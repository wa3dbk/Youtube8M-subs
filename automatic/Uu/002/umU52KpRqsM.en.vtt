you lose everything on top the upper
body<00:00:27.869> has<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.619> come<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> point<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.640> zero

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
body has to come to a point it's zero

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.530 
body has to come to a point it's zero
and<00:00:30.859> then<00:00:31.859> everything<00:00:32.369> has<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.390> a

you always think the release is a push
now<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> release<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.489> only<00:00:50.520> pulling<00:00:51.210> over<00:00:51.510> if

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
now the release is only pulling over if

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.810 
now the release is only pulling over if
I<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.559> correctly<00:00:52.949> look<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.460> fingers

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
and your something I use my finger to

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.630 
and your something I use my finger to
pushing<00:00:56.940> me<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.510> hole<00:00:58.340> see<00:00:59.340> because

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
pushing me into that hole see because

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.970 
pushing me into that hole see because
you<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.969> holes<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.930> move<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.559> there

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you have holes when I move you see there

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.619 
you have holes when I move you see there
a<00:01:02.010> hole<00:01:02.219> right<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.030> you've<00:01:03.180> more<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
a hole right so you've more a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.840 
a hole right so you've more a
theoretical<00:01:04.320> okay<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.220> did<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
theoretical okay so we did it like this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120 
theoretical okay so we did it like this
here<00:01:06.150> he<00:01:06.420> resists<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.350> use<00:01:07.560> my<00:01:07.770> front<00:01:08.010> foot

here he resists and I use my front foot
like<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.140> carry<00:01:10.500> over<00:01:10.920> some

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
like this and now if I carry over some

that we have one philosophy we have one
technique<00:05:28.870> many<00:05:29.620> many<00:05:29.980> representations<00:05:30.640> of

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
technique many many representations of

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.540 
technique many many representations of
it<00:05:31.360> yes<00:05:31.660> you<00:05:31.900> saw<00:05:32.140> that<00:05:32.350> with<00:05:32.650> my<00:05:32.680> point<00:05:33.160> you

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
it yes you saw that with my point you

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.030 
it yes you saw that with my point you
see<00:05:33.820> we<00:05:34.000> went<00:05:34.150> back<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:34.600> forth<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:35.320> there<00:05:35.919> is

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
see we went back and forth and there is

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.110 
see we went back and forth and there is
no<00:05:36.220> real<00:05:36.460> screw<00:05:36.850> there<00:05:37.530> ok<00:05:38.530> now<00:05:38.919> once<00:05:39.340> I<00:05:39.610> lock<00:05:40.060> a

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
no real screw there ok now once I lock a

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.850 
no real screw there ok now once I lock a
center<00:05:40.660> you<00:05:40.810> feel<00:05:41.050> down<00:05:41.260> here<00:05:41.530> there<00:05:41.740> is<00:05:41.830> a

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
center you feel down here there is a

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.180 
center you feel down here there is a
center<00:05:42.280> that<00:05:42.310> does<00:05:42.580> not<00:05:42.760> move<00:05:43.050> ok<00:05:44.050> now<00:05:44.590> I<00:05:44.620> can

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
center that does not move ok now I can

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.909 
center that does not move ok now I can
say<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.430> all<00:05:45.850> this<00:05:46.270> move<00:05:46.570> I<00:05:46.780> see<00:05:47.290> that<00:05:47.530> he

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
say that all this move I see that he

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.550 
say that all this move I see that he
does<00:05:48.130> not<00:05:48.280> really<00:05:48.520> move<00:05:48.850> here<00:05:49.300> so<00:05:49.870> I<00:05:49.900> can<00:05:50.350> use

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
does not really move here so I can use

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.340 
does not really move here so I can use
that<00:05:50.800> as<00:05:51.010> a<00:05:51.040> center<00:05:51.520> -<00:05:51.940> you<00:05:52.060> look<00:05:52.180> like<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.140> it

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
that as a center - you look like and it

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.040 
that as a center - you look like and it
caused<00:05:53.530> that<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.979> happen<00:05:54.010> or<00:05:54.430> as<00:05:55.120> I<00:05:55.150> do<00:05:55.419> this<00:05:55.690> he

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
caused that to happen or as I do this he

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.780 
caused that to happen or as I do this he
realized<00:05:56.620> that<00:05:56.680> if<00:05:56.979> he's<00:05:57.160> going<00:05:57.310> to<00:05:57.400> move

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
realized that if he's going to move

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.880 
realized that if he's going to move
oh<00:05:57.820> ok<00:05:58.419> he's<00:05:58.570> going<00:05:58.720> to<00:05:58.840> move<00:05:59.020> now<00:05:59.500> he<00:05:59.560> moved

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
oh ok he's going to move now he moved

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.770 
oh ok he's going to move now he moved
here<00:06:00.250> but<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.700> front<00:06:00.970> does<00:06:01.210> not<00:06:01.390> move<00:06:01.540> anymore

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
here but the front does not move anymore

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.780 
here but the front does not move anymore
my<00:06:02.110> front<00:06:02.380> some<00:06:02.530> silica<00:06:02.860> I<00:06:03.040> move<00:06:03.430> everything

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
my front some silica I move everything

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.760 
my front some silica I move everything
else<00:06:04.120> he<00:06:04.210> can<00:06:04.419> you<00:06:04.570> see<00:06:04.720> how<00:06:04.900> much<00:06:05.050> on<00:06:05.620> the

right sign and watch that I'm not

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.750 
right sign and watch that I'm not
deviating<00:06:50.260> one<00:06:50.470> leaf<00:06:50.680> a<00:06:50.770> bit<00:06:50.950> say<00:06:51.520> watch

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
deviating one leaf a bit say watch

00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:03.870 
deviating one leaf a bit say watch
starting<00:06:52.360> starting

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:16.390 

so<00:07:04.880> this<00:07:05.060> is<00:07:05.210> the<00:07:05.330> move<00:07:05.480> where<00:07:05.870> you<00:07:05.979> watch<00:07:15.400> see
