00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.379
 oregon usa here in the middle of nothing more accurate 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.360
 in the path of mister greenwood could the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.009
 Automobile future are indeed admitted 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.960
 Actually, the future sees something 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.279
 rusty and not very spectacular 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.199
 That was the first vehicle we did 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.939
 have built the idea to test the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.500
 to insert whole body and per 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.779
 to shift weight 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.360
 that was about the former in 1971 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.520
 Rocket researcher Charles Greenwood wanted 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.170
 a vehicle that with purely human 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.480
 to move force is to create 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.649
 the idea of ​​the young cadre of the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.450
 human car was born 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.129
 it was in the late sixties as I am now 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.379
 engineer worked in silicon valley 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.719
 I stood in a traffic jam and saw how the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.789
 people inhaled from the gases I thought 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.890
 I need something better 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.629
 So I worked on the idea 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.129
 Whole body to use around the car 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.820
 drive and the engine easy 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.820
 omit 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.390
 Greenwood is funding its vision of the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.369
 human cars about the sale of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.049
 technology for the construction of luxury 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 tree houses is needed to 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.770
 development of the human car is about the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.170
 decades ever more advanced 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 the first designs still seem like 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.650
 a bicycle now reminds that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.799
 Human car is more like a crossroads 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:31.950
 from rowboat and soapbox and how 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.840
 it all works like light and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.659
 elegant man human power in energy 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.950
 you know about cycling 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.259
 on the other hand , you put the entire body 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.720
 one obtains logically essential 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.189
 more energy even so much that simple 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:56.640
 bicycle components that no longer 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:58.950
 could withstand speeds 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.049
 be up to 100 km / h 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.570
 according to manufacturer possible at one 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.860
 maximum manpower of 2 places would be 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.990
 but for four people 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.819
 Excess energy is created by means of a 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.900
 stored at generator and can 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.640
 need to be retrieved 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.099
 the people applaud and cheer ours 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.870
 construction to partially hold others 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.549
 cars even when they look at us 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.849
 People love our human car 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.849
 easy 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.670
 and soon it is to the youth came to also 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.530
 give buy 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.569
 well over 200 million people live in america 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.040
 people on flat flat land with 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.620
 many speed limit of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.639
 sometimes only 40 km h where yes the people 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.370
 are more than ready 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:44.189
 whoever is ready could then turn around for and 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.209
 at 12.000 euro a human car 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.299
 to call his own 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.340
 a nice contrast to the future were 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.620
 of the autonomous driving where already one 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.569
 single assistant system cost so much 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.569
 could be like a whole human k
