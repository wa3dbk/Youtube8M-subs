game um and now I have 63 that's how
fast<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.750> grow<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.930> feel<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.260> three<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.590> four

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
fast they grow I feel like three or four

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.779 
fast they grow I feel like three or four
days<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.879> um<00:00:57.739> relevation<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.370> point<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
days but um relevation one point is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
days but um relevation one point is
sixty<00:01:00.120> cents<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.020> 63<00:01:01.469> points<00:01:01.770> it's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
sixty cents so if I have 63 points it's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.850 
sixty cents so if I have 63 points it's
about<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.520> thirty<00:01:03.390> four<00:01:03.780> dollars<00:01:04.140> right

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
about like thirty four dollars right

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.450 
about like thirty four dollars right
there<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:06.320> one<00:01:07.320> point<00:01:07.619> equals<00:01:07.770> 60<00:01:08.220> cents

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
there because one point equals 60 cents

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
there because one point equals 60 cents
up<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.780> gonna<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
up I'm gonna have to do it on a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.399 
up I'm gonna have to do it on a
calculator<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.760> an<00:01:11.970> actual<00:01:12.409> number
