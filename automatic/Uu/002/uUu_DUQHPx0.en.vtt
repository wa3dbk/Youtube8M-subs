00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.860 

and<00:01:46.780> then<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:47.020> film<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.530> tail<00:01:47.770> end

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
and then I film the tail end

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.010 
and then I film the tail end
and<00:01:49.960> then<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.710> start<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.160> very<00:01:51.970> softly<00:01:52.480> fill<00:01:52.870> in

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
and then I start to very softly fill in

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.040 
and then I start to very softly fill in
between<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:56.890> get<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.870> head<00:01:58.870> of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
between and when I get to the head of

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.310 
between and when I get to the head of
the<00:01:59.170> brow<00:01:59.350> I<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:01.030> even<00:02:01.330> softer<00:02:01.840> brush<00:02:02.050> strokes

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
the brow I use even softer brush strokes

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.120 
the brow I use even softer brush strokes
instead<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.830> just<00:02:03.010> having<00:02:03.160> like<00:02:03.460> one<00:02:03.490> monotone

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
instead of just having like one monotone

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.070 
instead of just having like one monotone
unnatural<00:02:06.130> looking<00:02:06.370> brow<00:02:06.640> it's<00:02:07.420> going<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.900> get

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
unnatural looking brow it's going to get

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.140 
unnatural looking brow it's going to get
softer<00:02:08.830> at<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:10.000> head<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.600> brow<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.970> I'm

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
softer at the head of the brow so I'm

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.540 
softer at the head of the brow so I'm
just<00:02:13.420> barely<00:02:14.200> touching<00:02:14.800> my<00:02:14.950> brow<00:02:17.310> there<00:02:18.310> is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
just barely touching my brow there is

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.710 
just barely touching my brow there is
soft<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.250> can<00:02:21.490> either<00:02:21.670> leave<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.180> brow<00:02:22.390> as

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
soft so you can either leave the brow as

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.290 
soft so you can either leave the brow as
is<00:02:23.530> which<00:02:23.890> looks<00:02:24.190> pretty<00:02:24.280> nice<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:25.030> know<00:02:25.120> it's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440

opposite direction I brush those brows
out<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.920> that's<00:02:42.700> basically<00:02:43.180> going<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.540> soften

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
out and that's basically going to soften

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.540 
out and that's basically going to soften
up<00:02:44.260> any<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.530> those<00:02:44.650> harsh<00:02:44.950> lines<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.460> you're

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
up any of those harsh lines and you're

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.310 
up any of those harsh lines and you're
going<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.700> get<00:02:45.910> like<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.240> faded<00:02:46.750> look<00:02:49.320> I'm

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
going to get like that faded look I'm

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.690 
going to get like that faded look I'm
going<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.710> opposite<00:02:51.100> direction<00:02:51.250> almost

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
going in the opposite direction almost

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.570 
going in the opposite direction almost
kind<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.060> pulling<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.600> color<00:02:52.870> out<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.580> then

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
kind of pulling the color out and then

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.400 
kind of pulling the color out and then
I'm<00:02:54.730> going<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.000> brush<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.660> rest<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.170> brow

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
I'm going to brush the rest of the brow

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.570 
I'm going to brush the rest of the brow
and<00:02:57.370> brush<00:02:57.640> out<00:02:57.850> any<00:02:58.000> harsh<00:02:58.360> lines

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.910 

and<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.660> all<00:03:03.870> very<00:03:04.080> done<00:03:04.680> very

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and the this is all very done very

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.160 
and the this is all very done very
softly<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.510> don't<00:03:06.750> want<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:06.990> too

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
softly so you don't want to be too

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.170 
softly so you don't want to be too
heavy-handed<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:08.490> lot<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.880> people<00:03:09.060> have

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
heavy-handed a lot of people have

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.880 
heavy-handed a lot of people have
trouble<00:03:09.660> with<00:03:09.840> insulin<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:10.590> that's<00:03:10.740> probably

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
trouble with insulin but that's probably

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.630 
trouble with insulin but that's probably
because<00:03:11.280> we're<00:03:11.490> just<00:03:11.670> applying<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.300> too<00:03:12.480> heavy

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
because we're just applying it too heavy

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.750 
because we're just applying it too heavy
