even<00:02:30.120> where<00:02:30.870> they're<00:02:31.019> supposed<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.380> be<00:02:31.470> French

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
even where they're supposed to be French

even where they're supposed to be French
stitching<00:02:42.980> what's<00:02:43.980> interesting<00:02:44.280> about<00:02:44.579> this

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
stitching what's interesting about this

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.360 
stitching what's interesting about this
being<00:02:45.150> illuminated<00:02:45.570> addition<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:46.859> offer

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
being illuminated addition so that offer

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.759 
being illuminated addition so that offer
any<00:02:47.820> 4runner<00:02:48.299> he's<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.109> my<00:02:49.230> opinion<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.709> is

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
any 4runner he's in my opinion this is

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.280 
any 4runner he's in my opinion this is
the<00:02:49.920> one<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.489> should<00:02:50.549> build<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.299> is<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
the one you should build it is the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.949 
the one you should build it is the
reason<00:02:52.709> why<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:52.980> want<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.670> body<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.090> frame<00:02:54.299> SUV

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
reason why you want a body on frame SUV

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.780 
reason why you want a body on frame SUV
and<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.290> they<00:02:55.440> can<00:02:55.590> hang<00:02:55.769> real<00:02:55.980> axles<00:02:56.459> off<00:02:56.640> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
and so they can hang real axles off of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.440 
and so they can hang real axles off of
it<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.440> they<00:02:58.440> really<00:02:58.799> keep<00:02:59.130> all<00:02:59.489> off-road

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840

once<00:04:02.840> you're<00:04:02.990> in<00:04:03.140> four<00:04:03.410> low<00:04:03.590> then<00:04:03.830> you<00:04:03.950> get<00:04:04.160> a

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
once you're in four low then you get a

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.730 
once you're in four low then you get a

with the suspension tuning the more

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.810 
with the suspension tuning the more

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
interesting part about all that is the

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.150 
interesting part about all that is the
fact<00:04:17.060> that<00:04:17.180> if<00:04:17.390> you<00:04:17.660> shift<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.560> old<00:04:18.770> school

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
fact that if you shift the old school

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.330 
fact that if you shift the old school
manual<00:04:19.580> pull<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.690> stick<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.080> move<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.500> system

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
manual pull the stick and move it system

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.500 
manual pull the stick and move it system
we're<00:04:22.490> now<00:04:22.610> in<00:04:22.790> for<00:04:23.060> low<00:04:23.300> which<00:04:23.450> means

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
we're now in for low which means

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.180 
we're now in for low which means
traction<00:04:24.140> controls<00:04:24.470> off<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:25.040> rear

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.080 
differential is locked and you can turn
on<00:04:27.790> crawl<00:04:28.790> control<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:31.460> if<00:04:31.580> we<00:04:31.700> move<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:32.030> a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
on crawl control so if we move it a

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.490 
on crawl control so if we move it a
short<00:04:32.330> distance<00:04:32.540> will<00:04:32.990> get<00:04:33.110> all<00:04:33.169> the<00:04:33.260> way<00:04:33.350> into

these circumstances if you turn this

thing all the way down to low it really

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.830 
thing all the way down to low it really
does<00:04:57.590> just<00:04:57.890> sort<00:04:58.640> of<00:04:58.760> crawl<00:04:59.000> along<00:04:59.150> and<00:04:59.720> if

situations it's a handy feature very in
sort<00:05:06.230> of<00:05:06.260> fast<00:05:07.000> single<00:05:08.000> track<00:05:08.270> like<00:05:08.510> we<00:05:08.660> are

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
sort of fast single track like we are

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.839 
sort of fast single track like we are
it's<00:05:09.230> pointless<00:05:10.160> in<00:05:10.460> all<00:05:10.580> honesty

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
it's pointless in all honesty

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.600 
it's pointless in all honesty
there<00:05:11.969> we<00:05:12.089> go<00:05:12.209> now<00:05:12.419> we're<00:05:12.599> in<00:05:12.919> super<00:05:13.919> super<00:05:14.189> low

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
there we go now we're in super super low

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.769 
there we go now we're in super super low
you<00:05:14.849> can<00:05:14.999> get<00:05:15.119> an<00:05:15.209> idea<00:05:15.270> of<00:05:15.889> how<00:05:17.209> slowly<00:05:18.209> this

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
you can get an idea of how slowly this

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.269 
you can get an idea of how slowly this
thing<00:05:19.110> goes<00:05:19.379> when<00:05:19.679> you've<00:05:19.830> got<00:05:20.009> it<00:05:20.129> before

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
thing goes when you've got it before

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:22.760 
thing goes when you've got it before
wheel<00:05:20.580> drive<00:05:20.819> low<00:05:21.119> and<00:05:21.599> the<00:05:22.139> lowest<00:05:22.559> setting

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
wheel drive low and the lowest setting

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.859 
wheel drive low and the lowest setting
of<00:05:23.099> crawl<00:05:23.339> control<00:05:23.490> if<00:05:24.330> you<00:05:24.449> turn<00:05:24.659> a<00:05:24.689> little

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:24.869 
of crawl control if you turn a little

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:27.829 
of crawl control if you turn a little
way<00:05:24.959> up<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.169> high<00:05:26.119> you're<00:05:27.119> still<00:05:27.419> moving<00:05:27.569> along

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:27.839 
way up to high you're still moving along

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.249 
way up to high you're still moving along
at<00:05:28.139> about<00:05:28.669> mm<00:05:29.669> two<00:05:30.179> miles<00:05:30.449> an<00:05:30.659> hour<00:05:30.809> three

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
at about mm two miles an hour three

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:52.219 
at about mm two miles an hour three
miles<00:05:31.469> now<00:05:31.770> our<00:05:31.979> tops

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.779 

so<00:05:53.229> the<00:05:53.319> forerunner<00:05:53.710> comes<00:05:54.039> in<00:05:54.190> three<00:05:54.430> models

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
so the forerunner comes in three models

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.309 
so the forerunner comes in three models
the<00:05:55.120> base<00:05:56.400> version<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.819> trail<00:05:58.419> version<00:05:58.720> and

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 
the base version the trail version and

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.150 
the base version the trail version and
the<00:05:59.650> limited<00:06:00.069> version<00:06:00.520> a<00:06:00.819> new<00:06:01.330> Fortis<00:06:02.110> 14<00:06:02.710> is

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
the limited version a new Fortis 14 is

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.850 
the limited version a new Fortis 14 is
all<00:06:03.699> of<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.449> sort<00:06:04.690> of<00:06:04.750> designs<00:06:05.199> of<00:06:05.590> the

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
all of the sort of designs of the

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.529 
all of the sort of designs of the
outside<00:06:06.310> they've<00:06:06.639> done<00:06:06.849> a<00:06:06.880> few<00:06:07.030> interesting

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
outside they've done a few interesting

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.860 
outside they've done a few interesting
things<00:06:07.599> with<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:09.400> bumpers<00:06:09.849> to<00:06:10.210> differentiate

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
things with the bumpers to differentiate

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.279 
things with the bumpers to differentiate
them<00:06:11.110> they've<00:06:11.470> put<00:06:11.710> more<00:06:11.949> clear<00:06:12.340> delineation

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
them they've put more clear delineation

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.409 
them they've put more clear delineation
across<00:06:14.289> them<00:06:14.560> one<00:06:14.949> thing<00:06:15.130> I<00:06:15.250> will<00:06:15.400> note<00:06:15.639> is<00:06:15.940> in

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
across them one thing I will note is in

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.480 
across them one thing I will note is in
past<00:06:16.750> versions<00:06:17.289> of<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.530> forerunner<00:06:17.949> of<00:06:18.039> o<00:06:18.310> is

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
past versions of the forerunner of o is

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.939 
past versions of the forerunner of o is
sort<00:06:18.759> of<00:06:18.849> had<00:06:19.000> an<00:06:19.090> issue<00:06:19.270> with<00:06:19.539> how<00:06:19.720> short<00:06:20.139> the

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
sort of had an issue with how short the

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.700 
sort of had an issue with how short the
front<00:06:21.190> seats<00:06:21.430> are<00:06:21.639> and<00:06:22.300> in<00:06:22.900> this<00:06:23.169> one<00:06:23.380> it<00:06:23.530> does

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
front seats are and in this one it does

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.870 
front seats are and in this one it does
seem<00:06:23.979> like<00:06:24.009> that<00:06:24.250> is<00:06:24.759> a<00:06:25.150> improved<00:06:26.880> situation

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
seem like that is a improved situation

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.999 
seem like that is a improved situation
there<00:06:28.300> seems<00:06:28.630> to<00:06:28.659> be<00:06:28.780> a<00:06:28.810> bit<00:06:29.050> more<00:06:29.199> v<00:06:29.530> support

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
there seems to be a bit more v support

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:31.920 
there seems to be a bit more v support
maybe<00:06:30.370> a<00:06:30.400> little<00:06:30.580> more<00:06:30.789> length<00:06:31.090> in<00:06:31.330> the<00:06:31.449> inseam

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
maybe a little more length in the inseam

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.379 
maybe a little more length in the inseam
of<00:06:32.259> the<00:06:32.860> seat<00:06:33.130> and<00:06:33.340> as<00:06:33.550> a<00:06:33.580> result<00:06:33.970> it's<00:06:34.300> a

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
of the seat and as a result it's a

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:35.909 
of the seat and as a result it's a
little<00:06:34.630> bit<00:06:34.720> more<00:06:34.900> comfortable<00:06:35.319> than<00:06:35.620> it<00:06:35.740> had

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
little bit more comfortable than it had

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.120 
little bit more comfortable than it had
been<00:06:36.039> in<00:06:36.099> the<00:06:36.280> past<00:06:37.530> the<00:06:38.530> one<00:06:38.680> thing<00:06:38.889> they<00:06:39.069> do

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
been in the past the one thing they do

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.020 
been in the past the one thing they do
do<00:06:39.460> nice<00:06:39.960> is<00:06:40.960> give<00:06:41.800> you<00:06:41.949> the<00:06:42.130> buttons<00:06:42.460> to<00:06:42.699> still

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
do nice is give you the buttons to still

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.700 
do nice is give you the buttons to still
turn<00:06:43.240> off<00:06:43.419> stability<00:06:44.050> control<00:06:44.409> traction

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
turn off stability control traction

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.490 
turn off stability control traction
control<00:06:45.490> and<00:06:46.120> you<00:06:46.479> get<00:06:46.630> a<00:06:46.659> separate<00:06:46.990> button<00:06:47.349> in

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
control and you get a separate button in

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.110 
control and you get a separate button in
the<00:06:47.680> off-road<00:06:47.919> version<00:06:48.220> for<00:06:48.580> a<00:06:48.610> locking<00:06:48.970> rear

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
the off-road version for a locking rear

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.270 
the off-road version for a locking rear
differential<00:06:49.509> so<00:06:50.259> you<00:06:50.740> really<00:06:51.009> do<00:06:51.130> get

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
differential so you really do get

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.209 
differential so you really do get
something<00:06:51.669> that<00:06:51.820> a<00:06:52.800> policeman<00:06:53.800> itself

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
something that a policeman itself

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:57.180 
something that a policeman itself
encircles<00:06:55.110> should<00:06:56.110> you

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
encircles should you

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.920 
encircles should you
have<00:06:57.760> the<00:06:58.060> inclination<00:06:58.570> to<00:06:59.080> do<00:06:59.230> so<00:07:00.450> and<00:07:01.450> now

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
have the inclination to do so and now

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.110 
have the inclination to do so and now
I'm<00:07:02.140> completely<00:07:02.380> covered<00:07:03.280> in<00:07:03.340> dust<00:07:03.550> as<00:07:03.850> long
