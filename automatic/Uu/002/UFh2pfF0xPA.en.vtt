00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:55.229

 such moments when you need to do 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.430

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.000
 shabby 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.990

 dries under the ground soft spot where 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.210
 the ground should dry on the way worth 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.600
