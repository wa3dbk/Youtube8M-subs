00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:16.470
 to science and technology the report does not 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.410
 the night at the center time point of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.199
 the Mexican Republic science and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.210
 technology tonight osiris forward of 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.679
 good night, good evening, 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.839
 that's how every Sunday here we walk 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.980
 with all the best notes on 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.659
 science and technology the best that has 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.460
 happened in the week and what do you think is 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.590
 a phone that is going to be ecological 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.000
 because I do not know if you're also that 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.890
 we always walk with that the battery of 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 phone does not last anything but then 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.950
 Well, we're going to like this because 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.690
 researchers from the University of 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.280
 arlington in texas it occurred to them that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 the giant propellers that produce 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.820
 wind energy could be dealt with in a 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.110
 phone then imagine you stay 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.480
 three percent of battery in your phone 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.060
 you put this casing that will have the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.160
 propellers at least a few minutes in the 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.590
 air you already have battery again then 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.480
 these propellers will measure about 1.8 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.160
 millimeters so let's have several 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.510
 in this ether house the most logical thing is 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.309
 ask yourself if you are not going to break into the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 first fall or if it collides with something not 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 you will have to have it in him 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.040
 outdoors so that it will start at 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.500
 function 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.690
 with the movement 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.520
 but how are they made with a 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.050
 nickel alloy as not be so 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.400
 easy to break are very 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.720
 excited with this that they have even 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.790
 thought about putting it for example in the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.500
 roofs of the houses to be able 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.390
 feed a surveillance system or 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.280
 external lights because it does not give 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.840
 operate a washing machine or something 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.060
 this position is always important 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 learn to say goodbye and at the level of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.510
 unemployment in Mexico is very ugly without 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.790
 But there are still people who can give 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.440
 the luxury of leaving your job lebron that 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.300
 many times is that they do not know how to say 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.650
 to their bosses because they are leaving 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.479
 new application in the app store of 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.160
 apple that will help us do this is 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.530
 a little more fun when we give up 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.090
 it's called job question and we input 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.399
 You will ask why we let them 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.860
 in the options says that maybe already 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.210
 You have another job or because you gave yourself 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560
 mind that the corporate world is not 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.940
 what's yours 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.100
 then he's going to ask us what we want 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.050
 do after giving up good comes 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.070
 from running for the senate to dance 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.380
 for money 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.959
 stein even comes so join a 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.030
 circus then it's like a lot of fun 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.709
 finishing this process the application 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.780
 We will choose whom to send 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.540
 the message 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.130
 by SMS and ready, there's never going to be 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.319
 say things head on but what 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.120
 better will help people have a 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.890
 idea of how to give up then they are another 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.390
 subject a little bit of health there is 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.400
 assume it we live in a country of much 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.900
 obesity and that implies that we have a 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.069
 lots of diabetics, well, not too 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.020
 you have to be very aware of your 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.430
 care so this application is 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.900
 lower your hand a little bit well 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.730
 gluco is a company that is dedicated to 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.900
 create solutions for people with 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.000
 this disease can carry the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.280
 records already have their application for 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.590
 android for them and has a version 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.120
 web and just presented a new cable 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.519
 to finish completing the application 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.890
 for android you connect it is called meter 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.780
 zinc to your cell phone and to one of 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.580
 the 22 glucose meters that are 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.019
 compatible and having this connected 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.610
 we are going to take the measurement of the 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.769

 through a web page and this 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.720
 application then it will let us also put 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.330
 our exercise habits 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.709
 food and others and purpose 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.780
 this and to finish with all the 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.970
 presentations that were made during 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.370
 the custom electronic show in the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.709
 vegas then garmin ad live fit a 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.410
 physical activity bracelet that won the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.510

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.830
 new year in realities live fit 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.430
 shows the current activity level in 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.500
 the users 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.420
 then he will give us a daily goal 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.190
 achievable will be personal 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.780
 also it serves for example for people 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.880
 like me that suddenly the wave goes away and 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.040
 will warn us when it's time to 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.840
 put on the movement shows us the 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.550
 steps the calories the distance 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.890
 good stopwatch until the time 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.930
 imagine it is water resistant 50 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.580
 meters then then for example me that 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.140
 I bring the purpose of entering the gym 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.360
 aggression by a means to throw me the 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.130
 hand that says to me hey no longer for you and 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.290
 Move a little bit, not after the 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.760
 purpose since last year we are already 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.470
 in the middle of January and still do not 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.180
 It is not no, it is not that I started it on 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.030
 last year I think the great idea of 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.430
 get in December 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.510
 and if it's been these days I do not know 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.860
 They extended a little more my 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.600
 jim holiday but there is take her 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.610
 this and already to finish it turns out that 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.829
 we are idlers because according to revealed 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.660
 the people of facebook the Mexicans 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.940
 we spend four hours a day on this network 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.950
 on average that is that we have nothing 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.270
 to do a lot of free time, I do not think 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.160
 that unless they are activists of 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.630
 desk then there is good 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.100
 justified that they spend the day in front of the 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.500
 computer because those images of 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.060
 mockery politicians and claims for increase 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.770
 to the price of the metro of reforms and other 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.440
 They will not be shared alone 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.910
 mexico there are 47 million users and it's 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.280
 which is a meeting point between 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.140
 fellow friends family stalkers and 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.030
 others besides that conversations 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.880
 of those who tell you hey, I tell you 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.430
 Inbox is the busiest on average 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.919
 There are 14 sessions of 17 minutes each 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.810
 between what is it that you check your own 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.360
 profile you send messages and well 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.130
 those who walk watching who are linked 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.229
 so then if it turns out that we lose 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.450
 too much time in this social network and 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.889
 would still be missing half how much 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.380
 we lose time on twitter because the 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.240
 we are alternating we can not be 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.860
 four hours and three others 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.139
 things and you see if your enric 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.199
 most who have facebook have 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.530
 twitter and vice versa no then then 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:24.099
 you are a little while in a social network and another 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.990
 ratito on instagram facebook and the 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.490
 different than there is no if I 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.830
 I insist those images of claims are not 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.509
 they share alone on instagram the photos 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.190
 of food are not going to go up alone either 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.370
 so if it is necessary to be in these 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.560
 mobile apps in a if they make us 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.849
 losing horrible time and talking about 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.410
 waste time on social networks les 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.690
 I leave my twitter 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.610
 with z of the go and you can write me 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.889
 can you read can I interact 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.780
 little bit too and also the next 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.159
 Sunday here we can listen to what 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.020
