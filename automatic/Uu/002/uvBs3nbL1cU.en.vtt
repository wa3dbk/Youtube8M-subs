timezone<00:01:47.050> is<00:01:47.200> good<00:01:47.410> what<00:01:48.010> I'm<00:01:48.100> noticing<00:01:48.280> is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
timezone is good what I'm noticing is

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.370 
timezone is good what I'm noticing is
that<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.790> screen<00:01:49.120> sensitivity<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.870> really

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
that the screen sensitivity is really

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.100 
that the screen sensitivity is really
good<00:01:50.590> I'd<00:01:50.740> say<00:01:51.030> almost<00:01:52.030> better<00:01:52.300> than<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.960> HTC

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
good I'd say almost better than the HTC

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.590 
good I'd say almost better than the HTC
touch<00:01:53.620> Pro<00:01:53.920> or<00:01:54.100> touch<00:01:54.280> diamond<00:01:54.820> but<00:01:55.180> not<00:01:55.360> as

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
touch Pro or touch diamond but not as

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.840 
touch Pro or touch diamond but not as
good<00:01:55.990> as<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.200> touch<00:01:56.410> pro2<00:01:56.710> on<00:01:57.160> a<00:01:57.220> diamond<00:01:57.670> -

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
good as the touch pro2 on a diamond -

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.080 
good as the touch pro2 on a diamond -
that's<00:01:58.360> because<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:59.050> screen<00:01:59.890> is<00:01:59.920> recessed<00:02:00.700> so

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
that's because the screen is recessed so

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.120 
that's because the screen is recessed so
there's<00:02:01.270> not<00:02:01.450> much<00:02:01.810> room<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.830> screen

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
there's not much room that the screen

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.100 
there's not much room that the screen
has<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.520> travel<00:02:03.820> in<00:02:04.120> order<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.570> register<00:02:04.840> a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
here basically it's a quick way to

unread messages your tasks and so on and
so<00:02:18.910> forth<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.660> hard<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.930> tell<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.230> video

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
so forth it's hard to tell in the video

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.640 
so forth it's hard to tell in the video
but<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.710> screen<00:02:20.980> looks<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:21.520> crap<00:02:22.500> look<00:02:23.500> at

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
but the screen looks like crap look at

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.500 
but the screen looks like crap look at
this<00:02:23.860> look<00:02:24.250> at<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.490> backlight<00:02:25.000> or<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.210> side

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
this look at the backlight or the side

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.210 
this look at the backlight or the side
light<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.960> really<00:02:26.260> intense<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.740> can't<00:02:27.070> look

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
light it's really intense you can't look

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.100 
light it's really intense you can't look
at<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.490> display<00:02:27.760> from<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.240> side<00:02:28.450> all<00:02:29.050> you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
at this display from the side all you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.680 
at this display from the side all you
get<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.860> white<00:02:30.190> sheet<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:31.209> doesn't

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
get is this white sheet that doesn't

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.660 
get is this white sheet that doesn't
look<00:02:31.810> too<00:02:31.870> good<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.800> let's<00:02:33.010> take<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> look<00:02:33.490> at

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
look too good so let's take a look at

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.890 
look too good so let's take a look at
what<00:02:33.820> we<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.209> here<00:02:34.510> we'll<00:02:35.050> go<00:02:36.270> into<00:02:37.270> settings

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
what we have here we'll go into settings

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.930 
what we have here we'll go into settings
and<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.800> funny<00:02:39.070> because<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.640> is<00:02:39.790> really

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
and it's funny because this is really

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.060 
and it's funny because this is really
what<00:02:40.180> Windows<00:02:40.450> Mobile<00:02:40.600> looks<00:02:40.959> like<00:02:41.170> today<00:02:41.590> 9

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
what Windows Mobile looks like today 9

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.860 
what Windows Mobile looks like today 9
years<00:02:42.459> later<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.180> we're<00:02:43.420> actually<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
years later and we're actually going to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.530 
years later and we're actually going to
do<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> side-by-side<00:02:44.260> comparison<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.180> next

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
do a side-by-side comparison in the next

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.140 
do a side-by-side comparison in the next
video<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.380> let's<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:47.739> over<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.100> system<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.970> see

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
video so let's go over to system and see

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.330 
video so let's go over to system and see
if<00:02:49.209> we<00:02:49.330> can<00:02:49.480> see<00:02:49.720> exactly<00:02:50.500> what<00:02:50.800> version<00:02:51.190> we're

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
if we can see exactly what version we're

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.090 
if we can see exactly what version we're
running<00:02:51.610> here<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:55.410> actually<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.620> think<00:02:56.709> this

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
running here and actually I think this

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.240 
running here and actually I think this
device<00:02:57.400> has<00:02:57.580> been<00:02:57.610> upgraded<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.300> Pocket<00:02:58.959> PC

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
device has been upgraded to Pocket PC

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.570 
device has been upgraded to Pocket PC
2003<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:01.030> looks<00:03:01.270> like<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.540> has<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.459> is

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
2003 it looks like it has so this is

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.340 
2003 it looks like it has so this is
actually<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.940> later<00:03:04.180> version<00:03:04.480> ok<00:03:04.989> button<00:03:05.260> is

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
actually a later version ok button is

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.870 
actually a later version ok button is
still<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.650> upper<00:03:05.770> right<00:03:06.040> corner<00:03:06.220> again

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
still in the upper right corner again

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.910 
still in the upper right corner again
the<00:03:07.030> screen<00:03:07.360> looks<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.080> bad<00:03:08.440> let's<00:03:08.709> turn<00:03:08.890> up

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
the screen looks so bad let's turn up

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.710 
the screen looks so bad let's turn up
the<00:03:09.040> brightness<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.970> see<00:03:10.120> if<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.330> helps<00:03:10.510> a

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
the brightness and see if that helps a

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.050 
the brightness and see if that helps a
little<00:03:10.810> bit<00:03:11.020> let's<00:03:11.980> turn<00:03:12.160> on<00:03:12.250> cleartype<00:03:12.820> and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
little bit let's turn on cleartype and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.810 
little bit let's turn on cleartype and
where's<00:03:14.020> brightness<00:03:14.560> would<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.800> be<00:03:14.920> here<00:03:15.340> here

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
where's brightness would it be here here

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.949 
where's brightness would it be here here
it<00:03:15.880> is<00:03:15.940> backlight<00:03:16.390> settings

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.810 

super-bright<00:03:19.959> really<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.340> super<00:03:21.640> bright

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
super-bright really this is super bright

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.330 
super-bright really this is super bright
it's<00:03:22.630> horrible

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
it's horrible

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.050 
it's horrible
these<00:03:24.340> are<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.550> old-style<00:03:24.970> TFT<00:03:25.959> displays

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
these are the old-style TFT displays

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.790 
these are the old-style TFT displays
that<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.390> look<00:03:28.930> completely<00:03:29.350> washed<00:03:29.590> out

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
that just look completely washed out

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.410 
that just look completely washed out
let's<00:03:30.010> see<00:03:30.100> how<00:03:30.340> we're<00:03:30.489> doing<00:03:30.520> in<00:03:30.760> memory<00:03:31.030> we

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
let's see how we're doing in memory we

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.180 
let's see how we're doing in memory we
only<00:03:31.570> have<00:03:31.720> about<00:03:31.810> 7<00:03:32.350> megabytes<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:33.130> free

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
only have about 7 megabytes of free

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.130 
only have about 7 megabytes of free
program<00:03:33.790> memory<00:03:33.970> available<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.630> don't<00:03:34.840> load

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
program memory available so don't load

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.229 
program memory available so don't load
on<00:03:35.290> SD<00:03:35.620> be<00:03:35.739> mobile<00:03:36.010> shell<00:03:36.190> let's<00:03:36.940> see<00:03:37.090> what

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
on SD be mobile shell let's see what

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.550 
on SD be mobile shell let's see what
programs<00:03:37.480> we<00:03:37.840> have

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
programs we have

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.900 
programs we have
one<00:03:38.680> thing<00:03:38.830> you<00:03:38.920> will<00:03:39.099> notice<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:39.459> that<00:03:39.520> it's

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
one thing you will notice is that it's

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.900 
one thing you will notice is that it's
fast<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.540> very<00:03:40.630> fast<00:03:41.459> I'm<00:03:42.459> bouncing<00:03:42.849> around

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
fast it's very fast I'm bouncing around

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.460 
fast it's very fast I'm bouncing around
from<00:03:43.150> screen<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.510> screen<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.080> we<00:03:44.290> don't

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
from screen to screen and we don't

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.780 
from screen to screen and we don't
really<00:03:44.620> get<00:03:44.800> that<00:03:44.860> many<00:03:45.130> programs<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.610> get<00:03:45.730> a

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
really get that many programs to get a
