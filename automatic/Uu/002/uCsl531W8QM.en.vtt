 what and attention because it's going to be talked about 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.339
 again and has questioned the future 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.240
 of the saga of sting the notes according to 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:35.720
 patel will badly bill bani 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.629
 and that is for good apart from that as you 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.789
 yesterday net report and can not only 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.370
 lose a couple of million dollars for 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.969
 the incentives of destine to not have 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.680
 reached the note that was stipulated 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.670
 in the contract with activision but 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.510
 also the opportunity to follow 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.179
 doing 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.910
 the saga of sting and is that the analyst 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.640
 commercial michael patcher believes that 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.769
 keep a new ip a new 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.470
 intellectual property with the notes 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.920
 reached around 70 and metacritic 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.420
 It can be very complicated bungee 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 will have to be justified before activision 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.700
 surely and according to michael patcher 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.310
 it is not enough 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.600
 according to him and textual words and has said 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.520
 the following this is not enough they are going to 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.230
 have to put the batteries next 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.510
 time 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.370
 and says that despite the scores 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.040
 I would say you know that it has been a success 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.610
 commercial invoicing 500 million 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.100
 dollars but it is believed that good 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.680
 notes have been fatal that the players 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.560
 when they have bought the game and have 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.040
 been playing him because they have felt 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.730
 disappointed and the truth is that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.030
 patches does not augur a future nothing good 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.760
 to distinguish neither this nor two nor as 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.890
 want to call them so I do not know about you 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.960
 what will you think I want to know about you 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.869
 opinion above all to those who have already 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.610
 played pretty to the title and nothing 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.170
