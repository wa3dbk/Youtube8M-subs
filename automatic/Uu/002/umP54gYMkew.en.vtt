00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.230
 reveal as much as possible what 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.970
 expect from the final room of the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.340
 old people's prison or sepulchers 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.440
 stalled as you well know I showed you 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.089
 the video on how to keep the key of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.980
 treasure through the opening of the boxes 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.539
 special that materialize later 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.760
 the killing of one of the mini bosses of the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.320
 Peta sizes well will not be the only one 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.359
 way to find those keys should 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.490
 be possible to drop the keys 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.779
 themselves as soon as you finish at least one 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.550
 Seniors' prison session 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.560
 we need to understand if we can 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.020
 keep only the first time at each 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.850
 prison or not this is not clear 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.590
 I can only show you what now 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.239
 you will find inside the sepulchres of 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.100
 crystal this image taken from a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.840
 video of planetesimi point com the link 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.670
 you will find it in the description there will be 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 essentially of the cases of which one 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.270
 larger openable only ed 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.280
 exclusively through a key of the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.020
 treasure inside according to what it is 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.629
 been told by dpj should be found 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.160
 an exotic guaranteed but always said that 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.480
 things could change 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.129
 always inside you should be able to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 have the chance to drop 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.199
 equipment of the wrath of Reggio 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.510
 strange light particle coins 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.710
 possibly armor web even if I remember 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.460
 they are used to buy weapons 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.470
 jail armor from several xvi 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.210
 seller dropped on the other atoll 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.189
 two boxes give the opportunity to try 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.950
 various material metal film particles 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.220
 of light strange coins and I don't know if it's for 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.280
 open those boxes you need to have 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.780
 another key to the treasure I don't think 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.329
 therefore the largest basket can be opened 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.520
 only with a key you can open all of them 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.100
 the baskets you want during the week 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.950
 they will not be held as long as you have 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.990
 clearly the keys though should 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.790
 just stop it clearly that you will have to 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.619
 redo the entire prison arrive 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.659
 back to the tombs to open one 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.670
 new case with a new key 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.710
 so what do you write weekly? 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.990
 then the end of prison rewards 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.020
 finish i don't know prison at level 32 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.270
 will give you an armored core for the first time 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.950
 reputation is precisely that arm is needed 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.899
 low back network only the first time 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.439
 you will end the prison to the same thing 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.780
 for those at 34 and 35 the prizes of 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.979
 level 28 instead you will always receive them 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.690

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.730
