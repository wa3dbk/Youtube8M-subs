00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 there are friends of youtube I am 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.889
 destroyers 5 in this video we are going to 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:17.130
 learn to make a balloon ball 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:19.000
 they will need water scissors balloons a lot 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.779
 patience 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.869
 male will need 60 or 70 balloons minimum 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.650
 30 or 40 are going to grab two of their 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.280
 favorites 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.879
 these are my two favorites 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.829
 and they will win the one they do not like me 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.620
 I really like pink but it was the first 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.000
 that they will fill it with water 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:50.300
 but without air and good are going to do 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.640
 knots and trim the leftovers as 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.690
 come here with the back ones going to start 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.140
 to cut there is this good wait here 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.780
 I have two samples 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.620
 they will start to cut more or less 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.620
 here 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.290
 this will be more or less 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.900
 and now another one in case you did not understand 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.950
 they can not grab like me like that for me 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.950
 easier 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:32.110
 and they are going to stretch all I already says them and 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.110
 Well, I have them trimmed 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.080
 A) Yes 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:45.060
 up on the sides and also all the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.130
 after those are you going to start 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.860
 grab the balloon like this 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.840
 and here there is always something hard that is 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.600
 like where you're going to bend and that's the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.320
 part where you have to put this thing 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.320
 that looks like this 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.840
 well done 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.720
 you will stay like this then you have to 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.710
 go through this example here 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.120
 or the other way around it from here to down so 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:26.110
 many times in for example I already did step 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.110
 now from here to here 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.060
 it looks like an egg like that 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:00.960
 the more you stretch it, the easier it is 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.900
 put it good and almost miss the most 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.610
 these threads that we had set aside ok 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.670
 well here are the ones we had 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.670
 paragraph from the beginning that these 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.830
 they were my favorite colors is like 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.300
 strong rosita 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.300
 and good 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.489
 if they lack the voice for example that 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:28.830
 it is very like an egg let's say so 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.769
 you have to put here and here to be 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.920
 grow more from there I thought it was from 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.330
 here because it was to be squeezed 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:44.819
 here and here and if it were done like that 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:49.230
 but I was wrong good good 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:55.459
