of toxic health right here to look into

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.600 
of toxic health right here to look into
cellphone<00:00:09.090> radiation<00:00:09.980> there's<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.070> recent

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
cellphone radiation there's a recent

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.440 
cellphone radiation there's a recent
study<00:00:11.880> done<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.750> cellphones<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.769> says<00:00:14.450> that

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
study done on cellphones that says that

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.359 
study done on cellphones that says that
if<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.630> live<00:00:15.780> within<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.109> mile<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.920> cellphone

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
if you live within a mile of a cellphone

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.090 
if you live within a mile of a cellphone
tower<00:00:17.810> that<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.170> probably<00:00:19.619> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> get

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
tower that you probably going to get

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.400 
tower that you probably going to get
sick<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.029> closer<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.480> get<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> cell

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
sick and the closer you get to the cell

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.000 
sick and the closer you get to the cell
phone<00:00:22.619> tower<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.640> second<00:00:24.060> you're<00:00:24.449> gonna<00:00:24.539> get

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
phone tower the second you're gonna get

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.720 
phone tower the second you're gonna get
so<00:00:26.010> I've<00:00:26.910> started<00:00:27.180> wondering<00:00:27.630> about<00:00:28.730> cell

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
so I've started wondering about cell

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.569 
so I've started wondering about cell
phone<00:00:30.000> screening<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.289> cell<00:00:31.830> phone<00:00:32.070> signal

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
phone screening and cell phone signal

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.020 
phone screening and cell phone signal
screening<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.420> how<00:00:33.630> effective<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.399> so

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
screening and how effective it can be so

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.819 
screening and how effective it can be so
we<00:00:36.480> got<00:00:36.630> some<00:00:36.950> different<00:00:37.950> materials<00:00:38.190> here<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
we got some different materials here and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.639 
we got some different materials here and
we're<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.670> how<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> affects<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
we're going to see how it affects the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.450 
we're going to see how it affects the
cell<00:00:43.890> phone<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> signal<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:46.219> first<00:00:47.219> thing<00:00:47.370> we're

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
cell phone a signal so first thing we're

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.600 
cell phone a signal so first thing we're
going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> start<00:00:47.700> off<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.500> pot<00:00:49.980> it's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
going to start off with is this pot it's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.590 
going to start off with is this pot it's
a<00:00:50.820> pot<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.780> stainless<00:00:52.530> steel<00:00:53.180> there's<00:00:54.180> quite<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
a pot of stainless steel there's quite a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
a pot of stainless steel there's quite a
thick<00:00:54.899> base<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.469> there<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.980> we're<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
thick base on there and we're going to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.510 
thick base on there and we're going to
put<00:00:56.910> our<00:00:57.059> cell<00:00:57.329> phone<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> cell

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
put our cell phone in that and the cell

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.360 
put our cell phone in that and the cell
phone<00:00:59.760> right<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.030> actually<00:01:01.020> has<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> signal<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
phone right now actually has a signal of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.179 
phone right now actually has a signal of
full<00:01:02.910> strength<00:01:03.149> which<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.629> five<00:01:03.870> bars<00:01:04.199> so

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
full strength which is five bars so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.859 
full strength which is five bars so
let's<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:05.580> happens<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.360> put<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.720> in

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
let's see what happens when we put it in

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.450 
let's see what happens when we put it in
the<00:01:06.960> pan<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:10.020> only<00:01:10.320> takes<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.740> few<00:01:10.770> seconds<00:01:11.340> for

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the pan and only takes a few seconds for

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.890 
the pan and only takes a few seconds for
the<00:01:11.670> signal<00:01:12.060> meter<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.960> react<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.780> once<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the signal meter to react and once it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.550 
the signal meter to react and once it
does<00:01:16.049> react

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
does react

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
does react
it<00:01:16.710> generally<00:01:16.979> chops<00:01:17.280> down<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.729> about<00:01:17.939> three

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it generally chops down to about three

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.469 
it generally chops down to about three
bars<00:01:18.570> two<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.320> three<00:01:19.500> bars<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.360> it's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
bars two to three bars so what it's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.710 
bars two to three bars so what it's
doing<00:01:21.540> right<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> right<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.390> seem<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
doing right now so right now we seem to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.460 
doing right now so right now we seem to
have<00:01:25.400> three<00:01:26.400> bars<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.080> actually<00:01:28.170> get

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
have three bars and we can actually get

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.800 
have three bars and we can actually get
that<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.710> drop<00:01:29.009> down<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.790> bar<00:01:30.030> by<00:01:30.390> putting

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
that to drop down to one bar by putting

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.480 
that to drop down to one bar by putting
a<00:01:31.020> lid<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.619> top<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.579> pan<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:35.220> seems<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
a lid on top of this pan so it seems to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.330 
a lid on top of this pan so it seems to
protect<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.720> certain<00:01:37.409> amount<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> cell

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
protect the certain amount of the cell

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.140 
protect the certain amount of the cell
phone<00:01:38.579> signals<00:01:39.150> coming<00:01:39.659> out<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:40.079> fun<00:01:40.820> but<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
phone signals coming out as fun but it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.770 
phone signals coming out as fun but it
doesn't<00:01:42.479> seem<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.890> best<00:01:44.130> protector<00:01:44.780> so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
doesn't seem to be the best protector so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
doesn't seem to be the best protector so
the<00:01:46.079> next<00:01:46.259> thing<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.530> look<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.220> this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the next thing we look at is this

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.960 
the next thing we look at is this
chicken<00:01:48.450> wire<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.250> we're<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> put<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
chicken wire and we're going to put the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
chicken wire and we're going to put the
phone<00:01:51.149> into<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.689> chicken<00:01:52.020> wire<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:53.159> what

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
phone into the chicken wire see what

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.850 
phone into the chicken wire see what
happens<00:01:54.829> now<00:01:55.829> I've<00:01:55.950> done<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.250> earlier<00:01:56.549> and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
happens now I've done this earlier and

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
happens now I've done this earlier and
chicken<00:01:58.860> wire<00:01:59.040> really<00:01:59.729> seem<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.509> much<00:02:00.540> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
chicken wire really seem to do much to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.940 
chicken wire really seem to do much to
be<00:02:01.170> honest<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:03.270> signal<00:02:03.799> seems<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
be honest with you the signal seems to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.999 
be honest with you the signal seems to
be<00:02:05.070> five<00:02:05.399> bars<00:02:05.759> whether<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:07.380> after<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
be five bars whether is in or after the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.279 
be five bars whether is in or after the
chicken<00:02:08.340> wire

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
chicken wire

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.839 
chicken wire
and<00:02:10.959> yeah<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:12.890> think<00:02:12.950> there's<00:02:13.250> too<00:02:13.400> many<00:02:13.489> holes

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
and yeah I think there's too many holes

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.460 
and yeah I think there's too many holes
in<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.420> chicken<00:02:14.750> wire<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.930> let<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> signal

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
in the chicken wire to let the signal

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:25.149 
in the chicken wire to let the signal
through<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.760> next<00:02:22.939> thing<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.720> foil<00:02:24.500> so

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
through so the next thing is foil so

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:31.149 
through so the next thing is foil so
we're<00:02:25.549> not<00:02:25.670> too<00:02:26.120> far<00:02:26.290> into<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.650> foil<00:02:30.159> unless

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
we're not too far into the foil unless

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.420 
we're not too far into the foil unless
it<00:02:31.459> happens<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:31.970> signal<00:02:32.329> strength<00:02:33.430> now

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
it happens for the signal strength now

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.520 
it happens for the signal strength now
much<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.760> my<00:02:34.879> surprise<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.019> was<00:02:36.170> doing<00:02:36.379> this

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
much to my surprise and I was doing this

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.979 
much to my surprise and I was doing this
earlier<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.060> signal<00:02:38.390> strength<00:02:38.689> drops

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
earlier is the signal strength drops

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.479 
earlier is the signal strength drops
right<00:02:39.379> down<00:02:39.519> actually<00:02:40.519> goes<00:02:40.670> down<00:02:40.939> to<00:02:41.299> one<00:02:41.750> bar

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
right down actually goes down to one bar

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.160 
right down actually goes down to one bar
it's<00:02:43.489> actually<00:02:43.819> dropped<00:02:44.390> right<00:02:44.569> down<00:02:44.629> right

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
it's actually dropped right down right

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.430 
it's actually dropped right down right
now<00:02:45.349> so<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:48.319> interesting<00:02:48.530> thing<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:49.099> is<00:02:50.000> that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
now so the interesting thing is is that

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.199 
now so the interesting thing is is that
this<00:02:51.440> foyer<00:02:51.799> was<00:02:51.980> not<00:02:52.129> actually<00:02:52.280> grounded<00:02:53.000> in

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
this foyer was not actually grounded in

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.899 
this foyer was not actually grounded in
any<00:02:53.359> way<00:02:53.599> it's<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:54.139> just<00:02:54.379> foil<00:02:54.909> wrapped

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
any way it's it's just foil wrapped

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.830 
any way it's it's just foil wrapped
around<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.209> phone<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:57.370> same<00:02:58.370> with<00:02:58.549> bees<00:02:58.879> the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
around a phone and same with bees the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.119 
around a phone and same with bees the
gramming<00:03:00.769> techniques<00:03:01.780> they<00:03:02.780> they<00:03:03.769> don't<00:03:03.950> need

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
gramming techniques they they don't need

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.849 
gramming techniques they they don't need
to<00:03:04.310> be<00:03:04.430> grounded<00:03:04.700> they<00:03:05.480> they<00:03:06.349> perform<00:03:06.739> the

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
to be grounded they they perform the

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.559 
to be grounded they they perform the
same<00:03:07.069> whether<00:03:07.400> they're<00:03:07.579> grounded<00:03:08.030> or<00:03:08.299> whether

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
same whether they're grounded or whether

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.879 
same whether they're grounded or whether
just<00:03:09.019> left<00:03:09.799> in<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.909> open<00:03:11.420> air<00:03:11.659> for<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:12.680> cell

just left in the open air for this cell

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.949 
just left in the open air for this cell

does<00:03:18.410> appear<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.769> be<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.910> foil<00:03:20.239> which<00:03:21.169> was<00:03:21.470> I

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
does appear to be the foil which was I

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.559 
does appear to be the foil which was I
found<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.519> be<00:03:22.579> quite<00:03:22.879> surprising<00:03:23.239> I<00:03:23.480> was

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
found to be quite surprising I was

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.330 
found to be quite surprising I was
expecting<00:03:24.049> me<00:03:24.230> chicken<00:03:24.680> white<00:03:24.829> has<00:03:25.129> some

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
expecting me chicken white has some

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.939 
expecting me chicken white has some
effect<00:03:25.669> and<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.930> surprised<00:03:27.530> me<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.739> it

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
effect and that surprised me that it

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:32.020 
effect and that surprised me that it
didn't<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:30.709> pan<00:03:30.949> is<00:03:30.980> pretty<00:03:31.280> good<00:03:31.579> but

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
didn't and the pan is pretty good but

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.009 
didn't and the pan is pretty good but
it's<00:03:32.299> just<00:03:33.400> too<00:03:34.400> big<00:03:34.639> and<00:03:34.819> bulky<00:03:34.970> really<00:03:35.449> the

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
it's just too big and bulky really the

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.589 
it's just too big and bulky really the
foil<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.530> definitely<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.160> best<00:03:37.310> thing<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:38.180> the

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
foil is definitely the best thing so the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.490 
foil is definitely the best thing so the
other<00:03:38.959> if<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:39.949> want<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.310> shield<00:03:41.260> cell<00:03:42.260> phone

other if you want to shield cell phone

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.729 
other if you want to shield cell phone
signals<00:03:43.599> simplest<00:03:44.599> thing<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.959> do<00:03:45.109> is<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:45.530> use

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
signals simplest thing to do is to use
