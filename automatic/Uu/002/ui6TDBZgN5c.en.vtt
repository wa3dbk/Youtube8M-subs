people actually lie about things I mean
they<00:03:06.950> would<00:03:07.100> pretend<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:07.580> this<00:03:07.790> was<00:03:08.000> about

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240

that<00:03:13.520> they<00:03:13.820> can<00:03:13.970> keep<00:03:14.150> hunting<00:03:14.540> them<00:03:14.660> it's

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
that they can keep hunting them it's

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900 
that they can keep hunting them it's
incredible<00:03:15.380> so<00:03:15.560> how<00:03:15.709> can<00:03:15.770> they<00:03:16.040> pretend<00:03:16.459> that

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
incredible so how can they pretend that

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.420 
incredible so how can they pretend that
this<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.209> about<00:03:17.510> control<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.470> pests<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.130> proof
