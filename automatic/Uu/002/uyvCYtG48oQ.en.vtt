00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.760
 among the incidents 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:22.010
 it happens that the son a little long is 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:25.939
 the cause of injury from the addition or in 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.220
 back of the teeth very often during 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.730
 of alignment 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:36.530
 the son who followed all the teeth 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:40.629
 just protrude back from the tube for 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:45.770
 do this you have the opportunity 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:50.059
 to add against the small tie a 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:55.129
 little ball of wax that you can 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:58.370
 find in the form of sticks to the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.690
 pharmacy or in the form of small 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:08.630
 box in which there is wax 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:12.619
 7.6 to come to protect the cheek and the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.189
 mucous membranes and so you avoid this 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.650
 injury 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:21.890
 waiting to come to the cabinet for 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:27.680
 to make the cut of this thread it is 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:31.130
 as possible as the little hooks 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.210
 which allows to hang the elastics of 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.210
 class iii or class 2 to force themselves 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.590
 look a little bit two solutions 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.320
 available to you either with your finger 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.079
 to press against the hook and to 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.659
 fold a little bit always 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:55.040
 the same with a little ball of wax 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:59.240
 to come protect the cheek with this 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.439
 dumpling does not make it too big and 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.560
 especially drying the tooth or the hook 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.939
 before depositing the wax so 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.939
 that they adhere more strongly
