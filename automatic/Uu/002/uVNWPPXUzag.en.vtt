00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.420 
NOT the best shooter and I just kept
knocking<00:01:34.079> him<00:01:34.439> down<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.070> actually

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
knocking him down but not actually

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.130 
knocking him down but not actually
killing<00:01:35.850> him<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.270> almost<00:01:36.420> died<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.049> the
