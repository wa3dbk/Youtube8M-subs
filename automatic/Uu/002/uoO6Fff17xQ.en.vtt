place now what BP was talking about was
the<00:01:06.990> fact<00:01:07.020> he<00:01:07.320> checked<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> earthquake

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the fact he checked the earthquake

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.570 
the fact he checked the earthquake
monitors<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:10.110> was<00:01:10.350> no<00:01:10.680> significant

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
monitors and there was no significant

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.840 
monitors and there was no significant
earthquake<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.240> cause<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:13.260> event<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.729> he

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
earthquake to cause this event but he

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.350 
earthquake to cause this event but he
did<00:01:15.119> say<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.200> 15<00:01:16.950> inches<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:18.000> rain

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
did say was there was 15 inches of rain

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.960 
did say was there was 15 inches of rain
that<00:01:19.049> had<00:01:19.290> fallen<00:01:19.650> there<00:01:20.100> over<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> period<00:01:20.610> of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that had fallen there over a period of

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
that had fallen there over a period of
of<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.540> few<00:01:21.780> days<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.520> rain<00:01:24.500> coupled

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
of just a few days and the rain coupled

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.920 
of just a few days and the rain coupled
with<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> fact<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.280> they've<00:01:26.549> been<00:01:29.930> cutting

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
with the fact that they've been cutting

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
with the fact that they've been cutting
a<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.530> timber<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> tops<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.329> these

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
a lot of timber out of the tops of these

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.510 
a lot of timber out of the tops of these
mountains<00:01:34.170> has<00:01:34.920> created<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.970> weakening<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
mountains has created a weakening of the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.789 
mountains has created a weakening of the
mountainside<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.140> they<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.320> give<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.619> can

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
mountainside and they can give you can

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.499 
mountainside and they can give you can
get<00:01:40.950> away<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.670> cutting<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
get away with that cutting of all that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.060 
get away with that cutting of all that
timber<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:43.049> long<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.710> don't<00:01:43.890> get<00:01:44.009> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
timber as long as you don't get a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.569 
timber as long as you don't get a
massive<00:01:44.790> amount<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.149> rain<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.810> major<00:01:46.710> or<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
massive amount of rain or a major or a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.080 
massive amount of rain or a major or a
strong<00:01:48.119> earthquake<00:01:48.390> shaking<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> what's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
strong earthquake shaking and so what's

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880 
strong earthquake shaking and so what's
happened<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.049> an<00:01:52.170> earthquake<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.799> was

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
happened is it was an earthquake it was

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.730 
happened is it was an earthquake it was
15<00:01:53.340> inches<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.759> rain<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.259> it's<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> rain
