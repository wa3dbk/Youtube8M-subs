00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 ana 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.670
 Say okay 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.720
 Tennis lesson project 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.260
 The tennis player should know more than 90% of penis troubles 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.530
 The solution if you learn how the body works and how to move it 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.780
 It is instructor An Jay Murakami 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.870
 Oh in that lesson project 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.380
 Player's form as in other lessons 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:36.480
 Heavy snow does not do 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.630
 In addition , it is neither ah nor the progress only to imitate nine players 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:47.129
 Needs deep money and effort like players 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:49.170
 A wound that is based on the use of reasonable body of anyone capable of realizing the technology rather than the introduction in difficult Tech 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.310
 I will introduce 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.400
 It may be the cause of a three-shot may not may be in too much moving of the body neck 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.550
 Swing speed increases with wrist snaps 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.000
 You may also do you think that there is momentum ball strike 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:12.050
 But the risk of making a mistake shot is higher than that . 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.050
 Please move the wrist like this and aim at the ball and shake the racket 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.530
 Oh 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.549
 Perhaps the racket is swung to a position where it was aimed by many people like this image 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.610
 Should be 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.400
 Move the wrist and swing the racket at the same time 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.670
 Racket it has moved significantly to the transverse direction 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.630
 If it deviates by 5 cm, it takes sweet spots 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:40.270
 It will be a frame shot if you shift 10 cm 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.840
 Swing the racquet using body rotation while keeping the whole arm together without moving the neck as much as possible 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.840
 Let's try 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:53.240
 Could you swing the racket as you aimed 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:55.390
 By swinging the racket using the entire body without moving the wrist , the lateral movement of the swing path is reduced 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.100
 Can do 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 This does not have to remove the sweet spot 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:10.580
 In order to eliminate the mistake shot so that you can swing the racket as you thought 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.580
 It is better to use the entire body instead of moving the wrist too much 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:21.000
 Tennis is not a difficult cleaning 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:25.560
 Because he exceeded the First body of the mechanism Kedomo is easy to Face 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.860
 Your booth will change if you know the use how people of tennis 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.330
 I would like to receive specific instructions on how to use the facts 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.340

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.349
 Hmm 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.349
