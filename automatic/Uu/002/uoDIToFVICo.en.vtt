00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.620
 Today there will be a football a little light 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.490
 particular 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:13.230
 will these three boys come from the mm 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.860
 neos that is a tyrant of punishments and not 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.080
 cocaine 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.210
 but he will be there for two and three hours 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.560
 he pulls right and that is left-handed but he is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.880
 pretty good so far limits 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.890
 of them will be a little penalized by 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.170
 this and I don't punish but 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.060
 I will care because the someone of you 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.340
 he predicted that I am a goalkeeper and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.960
 so I'll be in the door and the challenge will be who 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.500
 for one of them he will manage to make me two 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710
 goals 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 will win and change prof 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.149
 who has the slice of ham 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.340
 so hopefully good and there was a 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.940
 cauliflower and we can start with the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.520
 challenge 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.520
 leave a shit about ryder cup and mine 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.220
 and you can't win 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.970
 you gave me is called lisa whatsoever 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:33.800
 his career as a goalkeeper camp arena 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.980
 then guys that is the thing 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.930
 this given that it is very difficult 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.420
 practically shut up since 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.160
 30 it is very difficult to mark since 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.960
 they are small five-a-side doors, maybe me 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.100
 I'm in the door we decided to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.600
 change the challenge for a moment 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 practically I put myself out of the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.200
 takes a funny one meter 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.610
 next to the pole but outside the door e 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.810
 they will say on the second pole so that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.290
 there is a level of difficulty a little 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.290
 greater 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.280
 Yes No 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.379
 as it was later parade 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.830
 and okay I feel the goal is the great goal 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:39.580
 but in the perfect one 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:42.580
 I thought you were nice hand pulled ha 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.580
 named 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:59.030
 but someone but only the seas here 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.350
 you go slow 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.350
 Fabians 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:53.890
 this calculation we never have 44 minutes 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.950
 now miss b total of the fact two 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.290
 goal to him but he passes one really 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.230
 destroyed that is quite heartbreaking 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.300
 I hope you enjoyed it anyway 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.360
