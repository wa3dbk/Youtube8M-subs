00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:54.920
 install part of the history of that state 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:57.739
 Ask for patience by making this video and 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.629
 bororÃ³ 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.000

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.820
 in the link that I'll be leaving in the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.640
 description of the video for this page 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.970
 it's not written I 'm going to tell you how 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.070
 the parents where to open 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.240
 you will download some of these files 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:29.119
 but it's not all you guys will find 1001 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:36.840
 302 is ahead and runs is good 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:38.340
 and just ok let's go to the next step is to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.240
 vision that has to have a bit of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 attention 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.970
 they will enter node 1.1 that the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:51.960
 link is in the description and will download 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:58.170
 just this first rock 80 280 download 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:03.299
 this only in one point you just enough 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.469
 this for pain in the 12 you will lower 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.860
 this one 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:15.209
 dt 84 00 and not with the third 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.959
 three are going to download both and now let's go 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.750
 for the next step of the galera this 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.879
 The boring part is the part that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:30.060
 you will put the ped in between 560 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.730
 thing if you have a pendrive 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.530
 configured with the pc you will not 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.519
 need to do this step here then 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:43.050
 you can skip this step here in this 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:46.470
 space the pain is the following you go 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.970
 download artist explore expensive option 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:56.300
 either from him 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:59.780
 The description is you will open this 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:09.620
 program that is necessary you will 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:09.620
 form an eleven in 12 usb boxes you 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:20.340
 continue next wife that is needed 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:25.620
 for you who has no power to set the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.360
 xbox next will mark that of leaving the 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.790
 last unchecked 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.049
 and here you can get more and boot is 8 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.580
 or 7 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:42.120
 if you do not have eight gigs and 7 bikes it 's got 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.400
 that being a loses games not to stay 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.490
 giving a little problem that it gave when it was 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.710
 install 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.010
 for parts if you want a real 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.110
 and you will vote here for the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.370
 put two because we all depend not 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.290
 just to give an example 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.750
 but the toll you need is 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.640
 eight twins remembering just to give a 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.970
 example of how sets are gone 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.650
 put next next you click next 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.650
 here will begin to format there you 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.220
 hope it will take a while longer 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.239
 need to complete these nexus boots too 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.970
 ready you already have to lose if 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:25.660
 configured to be able to drive us 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.270
 to use the oil if you have used an organ 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.950
 and it works normal and does not need 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.080
 do this step 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.870
 now let's go to the next step after 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.120
 that you have is downloaded every 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.090
 files you take all those who 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.850
 You downloaded boot into a separate folder 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:51.580
 Creates the new folder by dropping it pet hit the 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:54.130
 1860 boot hd with so you do it 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.100
 This part is the one that takes the longest 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.910
 very slow to two hours one sister 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:05.290
 thing like that 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:07.380
 in the nine of the dodo you have no where 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:13.000
 on the website of 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:15.430
 registration is also up to you all 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.930
 the files you've downloaded mine 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.360
 files I unfortunately do not have anymore 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.600
 Unfortunately you go here on me and already 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.320
 committed a fault will indict it 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.990
 then installed it is going to give an example 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.580
 here with a core file that is the only one 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.440
 who have downloaded why others only 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.750
 to see the coren it is one of the agreements 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.500
 you will have to download all the 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.040
 files will be in that cpk format 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.670
 you 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:53.670
 after testing there go in jekyll file 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:58.170
 go to the folder that you 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:00.930
 here in the case mine was the hd piece and here 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:06.270
 inside the folder will have many files 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:09.320
 I think the files are in cpk all 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:14.910
 all files will be named 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:16.740
 Bad doc here you are male will have 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:29.120
 whenever the economy is in HD 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:34.380
 g2 is clean and everyone will open and only 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:39.030
 after that will appear the law that a 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:42.000
 bahia bahia here is going to load and the last one 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.600
 will do in the last step after 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.140
 only going to recharge will you put the 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.510
 pen drive on xbox storage goes 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:56.670
 open this pen drive in xbox and go 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:07:01.980
 install an application a save ps 2015 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:06.330
 will have a total of 5 gb and 500 gb 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:09.390
 you click on the top move to where you 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:12.780
 saved the data of your feet if you went in 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.600
 Memories Arena was in one thing on a HD 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.100
 external and internal 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.930
 so that's what you have understood 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.990
 and enjoyed it if you have one of the 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:25.170
 two as it is here this was one more 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:31.160
 video and even the next will only encourage 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:31.160
 A video there is not all the time.
