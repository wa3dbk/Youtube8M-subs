 there are very good everyone is welcome 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.540
 to this video super pro westway teach to 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.120
 how to make a screenshot or 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.030
 station on our samsung galaxy tablet 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.960
 tab 2 of 10.1 inches but with 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.490
 Android 4.2.2 update we do 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.180
 sounded in the android teacher 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.189
 and we proceed to the video well and a version 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.410
 holiness as we can observe we have 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.399
 changed the buttons has already put us in 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.210
 the center and it is no longer so the screen 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.210
 is as a soloist 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.510
 and they have changed us 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.110
 ok good and how to do the writing 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.620
 it's a little uncomfortable to how you samsung 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.230
 had used since then with the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.989
 first button would be easier but this 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.250
 time not good to do it first 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.390
 we have to press the button 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.390
 on or off 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.550
 extra robb and the volume down button 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.550
 only the volume down 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.970
 he does not want to go up we do not just want 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.430
 to lower what we are going to do is to oppress 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.680
 first the power button turned on and 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.260
 very very quickly that the low button 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.210
 the volume 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.210
 look what happens if the same time 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.330
 if it goes out he wrote but but it comes out 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.330
 How the volume is lowered 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.659
 it came out in exclusion but the icon came out 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.689
 that the volume is being lowered is a 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.670
 little uncomfortable and really to me 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.060
 I would enjoy that our other 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.640
 and ok now let's try the button on 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.159
 the on or off button and the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.740
 volume down button first what 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.140
 suppresses the power button and from there 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.039
 the volume down button has to be 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.039
 immediately 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.319
 there they are drank is something else 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.849
 let's try and capture 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.849
 and there it is 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.510
 without the uncomfortable 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.370
 then the icon that is going down 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.370
 volume here yes 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:45.000
 and since it 's good, it works just like 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.940
 the previous version you can take this 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.400
 sun in any application I do not have 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.020
 application we were to demonstrate already 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.200
 what 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.100
 of reset from factory and then not 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.140

 in any android store or in another 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.390
 type of platform what would be the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.770
 operating system can you tell me here 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.000
