Street wide which we're going to have a
look<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:36.059> whole<00:00:36.270> lot<00:00:36.450> more

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
look at it's got a whole lot more

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.910 
look at it's got a whole lot more
features<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.020> we're<00:00:37.170> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> cover<00:00:37.559> in

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
features that we're going to cover in

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.740 
features that we're going to cover in
just<00:00:38.160> two<00:00:38.309> minutes<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.820> today<00:00:39.390> we'll<00:00:39.600> just

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
just two minutes but today we'll just

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
just two minutes but today we'll just
point<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> more<00:00:41.040> obvious<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
point out some of the more obvious and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.510 
point out some of the more obvious and
beneficial<00:00:42.930> ones<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> biggest<00:00:44.219> change

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
beneficial ones so the biggest change

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.569 
beneficial ones so the biggest change
the<00:00:44.820> bike<00:00:45.000> probably<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:46.320> been<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.100> redesign

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the bike probably has been the redesign

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.229 
the bike probably has been the redesign
of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.680> batwing<00:00:49.680> fairing<00:00:49.969> which<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> our

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
of the batwing fairing which is our

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.799 
of the batwing fairing which is our
water<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.260> air<00:00:52.440> flows<00:00:52.710> through<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.280> might

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
water and air flows through you might

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.580 
water and air flows through you might
say<00:00:54.809> John<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.399> as<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.610> they're

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
say John and as you can see they're

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:12.340 
say John and as you can see they're
ducting<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.710> there<00:01:10.400> instrumentation<00:01:11.400> itself

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
ducting in there instrumentation itself

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.920 
ducting in there instrumentation itself
10%<00:01:13.350> water<00:01:13.500> viewing<00:01:14.040> area<00:01:14.369> they're<00:01:14.930> larger

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
10% water viewing area they're larger

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.920 
10% water viewing area they're larger
gauges<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.909> bike<00:01:18.119> will<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.420> show<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.689> what

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
gauges the bike will now show you what

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
gauges the bike will now show you what
gear<00:01:19.140> you're<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.320> rather<00:01:19.619> than<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.009> sixth

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
gear you're in rather than just sixth

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.310 
gear you're in rather than just sixth
gear<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> big<00:01:21.659> improvement<00:01:21.900> there

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
gear so that's a big improvement there

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.850 
gear so that's a big improvement there
as<00:01:22.439> well

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
as well
