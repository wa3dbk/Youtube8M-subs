looks<00:01:51.090> very<00:01:51.479> very<00:01:51.659> unique<00:01:52.110> nothing<00:01:52.890> I've<00:01:53.040> ever

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
looks very very unique nothing I've ever

cooler<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.130> although<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.700> prefer<00:01:57.000> more

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
cooler and although I prefer more

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
cooler and although I prefer more
minimalistic<00:01:57.840> designs<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
minimalistic designs I think this I

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.389 
minimalistic designs I think this I
catch<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.119> pump<00:02:00.360> design<00:02:00.540> looks<00:02:01.320> fantastic<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
catch a pump design looks fantastic and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.149 
catch a pump design looks fantastic and
spectacular<00:02:02.930> indeed<00:02:03.930> pretty<00:02:04.649> much<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.130> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
spectacular indeed pretty much like a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.399

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
reactor the pump shape is certainly kept

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.199 
reactor the pump shape is certainly kept
a<00:02:07.500> bit<00:02:07.619> more<00:02:07.799> angular<00:02:08.190> which<00:02:08.849> are<00:02:09.030> always

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
a bit more angular which are always

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.660 
a bit more angular which are always
liked<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.810> even<00:02:10.110> features<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> breathing<00:02:11.129> rat

once it's in operation

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.870 
once it's in operation

360<00:06:08.629> with<00:06:08.809> the<00:06:09.139> price<00:06:09.409> therefore<00:06:09.770> is<00:06:10.189> a<00:06:10.219> little
