00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.549
 greet you friends on the blog 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.930
 video channel wi-fi cows in this video i 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.450
 I will show you how 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.519
 use your laptop tablet or 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.599
 phone as a second monitor for 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.139
 your computer 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.139
 go 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.880
 so friends to implement 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.760
 we will need the scheme 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.540
 such a site called space disk 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.930
 . 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.390
 speech and so organization scheme is very 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.460
 just you install certain 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.140
 program on your computer main 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.629
 then go on wifi through 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.290
 local network and ip address of your 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.080
 computer and automatically your 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.660
 The device is recognized as a second monitor and 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.480
 you can already customize how 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.910
 a picture will be displayed on your 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.130
 main computer and on an additional 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.760
 monitor in the form of a tablet phone or 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.580
 laptop 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.820
 and it can be any absolutely 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.300
 device both on windows and on android 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.119
 or on ayos the only condition for 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.149
 implementation is customized at home 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.410
 local network through a router 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.330
 because we connect the computer 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.050
 we will be on the local network according to its 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.810
 ip address 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.740
 so what we need to do is necessary 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.460
 go from the main computer to the partition 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.940
 download and download here 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.700
 Here is a sentence called 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.040
 server with driver for windows disk 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.220
 primary writing that is the driver for 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.950
 first computer on windows here have 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.070
 we have an option for a 32-bit system and 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.070
 for 64 bit skip the right option 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.880
 we install after what the program of us 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.190
 will ask 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.260
 and reboot 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.170
 as a client we can as i have 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.660
 spoke to use any device but 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.700
 if you are using a computer or 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.940
 laptop running windows then also 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.570
 it will be convenient to download the client application 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.230
 I donâ€™t use browser and ip separately 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.810
 Addresses that I have already installed on 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.710
 let's give your computer this application 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.320
 pick up a mobile device and 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.860
 let's see how it works so friends 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.390
 well let's go on the tablet on this 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.900
 same site 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:42.040
 the computer has already rebooted me 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.040
 go to the site space disk. perech 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.860
 we tablet me connected to the same 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.270
 router your computer so here we 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.120
 Need a download section 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.950
 and there is such a reference which 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.830
 called start beview 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.870
 that's it we need to open in order 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.870
 to connect to our computer 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.480
 so it means here we need to enter 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.379
 ip address of our computer in order 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.620
 to find out we need to go to 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.019
 network and sharing management 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.629
 change adapter settings 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.890
 LAN connection and information 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.170
 so that's how it looks now 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.489
 ip address of our computer contains 26 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:43.109
 from 8,128 it is him we will beat in 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.109
 this window and so let's do it 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.750
 the court 168,128 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.969
 and press the connect button so all 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.340
 connected 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.489
 let's our computer now 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.689
 try to configure 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:11.480
 screens at the moment we have a screen 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:14.390
 the tablet is an extension 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.600
 computer screen again if i 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.519
 drag let's say some daddy in 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.849
 extreme right position then we have it 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:28.669
 automatically appears on your tablet and 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:32.470
 if you right-click on the worker 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:37.130
 table and here choose the screen resolution 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:40.789
 then we can choose how will 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.690
 we have a second monitor screen 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.490
 now we have an item to expand these 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.669
 taps 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.620
 You can also select duplication 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.599
 display the desktop only on the first 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.650
 device and only on the second let's 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.000
 try to make duplication that is 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.250
 so that we have the same on two screens 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.460
 there was information 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.460
 click apply 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.570
 so that's how us perry 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.110
 started that is on the computer 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:15.830
 the computer has adjusted to us permissions 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.480
 the tablet screen will save the changes and 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.630
 currently we can observe something 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.640
 the same thing we see on the screen 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:27.010
 the main computer we also see on 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:30.500
 tablet can open any 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:36.950
 application there need to open daddy here 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.670
 so the screen is duplicated she us 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.890
 on the computer 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.260
 now does not look good because 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.540
 The fact that the screen resolution is a bit 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.240
 different let's try 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:51.620
 use another option well 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.790
 for example, choose to display the desktop 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.790
 only on the first computers 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.790
 click apply and see that the screen on 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:12.070
 the main computer us went out and 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:12.730
 only displayed on the tablet as well 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.150
 can choose 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:18.360
 display the desktop only on the second 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.360
 try to apply 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.200
 and now the other way around the desktop is visible 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.260
 only on the main computer 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.730
 very handy program for those who 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.500
 wants to use your tablet in 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:36.540
 as a second monitor 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.030
 here are the photos here now threw 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.930
 on him that way we have 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:46.530
 but at the moment it looks after it 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:50.220
 how do you disconnect here this site on 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:53.600
 tablet badges we must back 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.600
 return to the main screen 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.130
 dowd there was a return of badges on 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.250
 elephant screen but here I have them a little 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.040
 beat after happened 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.760
 reconfiguration will need to be manually the same 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.220
 return these badges to their place 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.940
