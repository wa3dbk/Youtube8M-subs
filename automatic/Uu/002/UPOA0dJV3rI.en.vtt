half six and a half
points<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.640> probably<00:02:30.120> going<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> 14<00:02:31.050> so

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
points it's probably going the 14 so

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.710

we're<00:02:31.770> looking<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.160> touchdown<00:02:32.720> adjustment

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
we're looking at a touchdown adjustment

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.740 
we're looking at a touchdown adjustment
because<00:02:34.440> Kansas<00:02:34.739> City<00:02:35.160> lost<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.000> Tennessee

because Kansas City lost the Tennessee

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.080 
because Kansas City lost the Tennessee

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
so either the oddsmakers that we have

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.900 
so either the oddsmakers that we have
right<00:02:39.420> now<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.840> by<00:02:40.349> far<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.860> worst<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.640> all

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
right now or by far the worst of all

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.300 
right now or by far the worst of all
time<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.930> get<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.500> team<00:02:44.160> 7<00:02:45.000> points<00:02:45.420> off<00:02:45.599> in<00:02:46.310> one

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
down since we know that besides the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.140 
down since we know that besides the
quarterback<00:02:52.980> maybe<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.340> handful<00:02:53.849> of<00:02:53.880> players

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
quarterback maybe a handful of players

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.080 
quarterback maybe a handful of players
are<00:02:54.390> worth<00:02:54.540> even<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.049> point<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.920> get<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.670> Casey

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
are worth even a point so I get it Casey

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.619 
are worth even a point so I get it Casey
has<00:02:57.870> lost<00:02:58.440> two<00:02:58.709> defensive<00:02:59.519> starters<00:03:00.030> but

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
has lost two defensive starters but

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.720 
has lost two defensive starters but
unless<00:03:01.019> those<00:03:01.230> guys<00:03:01.530> are<00:03:01.799> worth<00:03:01.980> three<00:03:02.430> three

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
unless those guys are worth three three

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.750 
unless those guys are worth three three
and<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.880> half<00:03:03.060> points<00:03:03.510> each<00:03:03.690> which<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.260> doubt

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
and a half points each which I doubt

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.000 
and a half points each which I doubt
then<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.480> aligned<00:03:07.170> based<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.709> nothing

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
then this is aligned based on nothing

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.580 
then this is aligned based on nothing
