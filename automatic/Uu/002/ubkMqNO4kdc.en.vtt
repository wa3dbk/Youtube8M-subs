come eat very easy for you but if you're
a<00:00:31.289> beginner<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:32.520> over<00:00:32.550> something

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
a beginner I like to go over something

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.850 
a beginner I like to go over something
with<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.450> first<00:00:33.750> now<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:36.140> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.559> front

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
with you first now so this is the front

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.200 
with you first now so this is the front
face<00:00:38.129> which<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.670> side<00:00:38.910> that's<00:00:39.090> facing

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
face which is a side that's facing

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
face which is a side that's facing
obviously<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.290> bad<00:00:40.590> face<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.070> face<00:00:41.399> that's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
obviously a bad face to face that's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.450 
obviously a bad face to face that's
facing<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:43.079> face<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.950> face<00:00:43.980> that's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
facing way right face is the face that's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.119 
facing way right face is the face that's
the<00:00:45.000> right<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.629> left<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> left

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the right of you left is to the left

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.970 
the right of you left is to the left
obviously<00:00:47.850> up<00:00:48.090> he's<00:00:48.899> facing<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.590> deep

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
obviously up he's facing up and deep

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
obviously up he's facing up and deep
down<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.550> facing<00:00:50.910> down<00:00:51.120> we'll<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.140> using

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
down is facing down we'll be using

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.150 
down is facing down we'll be using
algorithms<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.370> lot<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:55.079> you'll<00:00:56.010> need

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
algorithms a lot in here so you'll need

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.920 
algorithms a lot in here so you'll need
to<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.449> told<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
to know what they are if I told you to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.220 
to know what they are if I told you to
move<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.920> write<00:00:59.309> inverted<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.809> moving

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
move to write inverted that be moving

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.709 
move to write inverted that be moving
the<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:02.219> face

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
the right and right face

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.509 
the right and right face
counterclockwise<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.860> order<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
counterclockwise so in order to do that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.460 
counterclockwise so in order to do that
you<00:01:05.700> should<00:01:05.820> pretend<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.840> you're<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> side

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you should pretend that you're the side

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.820 
you should pretend that you're the side
of<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> face<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:10.140> you'll<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.500> able<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of that face and then you'll be able to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340 
of that face and then you'll be able to
see<00:01:11.100> determine<00:01:11.790> which<00:01:12.000> side<00:01:12.270> which<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:12.990> kind

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
see determine which side which was kind

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.530 
see determine which side which was kind
of<00:01:13.380> clockwise<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.920> which<00:01:14.070> ways<00:01:14.250> clockwise<00:01:14.790> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
of clockwise in which ways clockwise so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.880 
of clockwise in which ways clockwise so
up<00:01:15.780> inverted<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.189> something<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.610> this

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
up inverted would be something like this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.780 
up inverted would be something like this
fighting<00:01:19.890> ready<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.460> something<00:01:20.670> like

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
fighting ready would be something like

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
fighting ready would be something like
that<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.650> forth<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> after<00:01:25.020> now

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
that and so on and so forth so after now

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.039 
that and so on and so forth so after now
that<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> know<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:25.979> those<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.780> able

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
that you know all those you are now able

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.980 
that you know all those you are now able
ready<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.950> scramble<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.549> make<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.329> solving

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.560 

okay<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> first<00:01:34.560> step<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.759> tutorial<00:01:36.450> is

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
okay so the first step in my tutorial is

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.069 
okay so the first step in my tutorial is
to<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.409> white<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.729> side<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
to get all white on one side so what you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.460 
to get all white on one side so what you
do<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.850> I'll<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.150> put<00:01:42.479> Y<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.960> side<00:01:43.170> for

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
do is I'll just put Y on this side for

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.749 
do is I'll just put Y on this side for
the<00:01:44.070> sake<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.520> demonstration<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:47.009> sense

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the sake of demonstration so we sense

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.179 
the sake of demonstration so we sense
there<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.450> red<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.560> agreeing<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:51.090> white

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
there a red and agreeing on this white

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.190 
there a red and agreeing on this white
corner<00:01:53.189> piece<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:54.060> search<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:54.270> either<00:01:54.780> red<00:01:55.170> or

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
corner piece we search for either red or

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.219 
corner piece we search for either red or
green<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.750> has<00:01:57.899> green<00:01:58.200> on

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
green so here is one and it has green on

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.420 
green so here is one and it has green on
it<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.159> since<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.090> need<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.420> align<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:02.100> Greens

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
it so since we need to align the Greens

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.880 
it so since we need to align the Greens
up<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.810> easily<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.649> since

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
up what you can easily do and since

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.459 
up what you can easily do and since
there's<00:02:05.250> no<00:02:05.520> corner<00:02:06.210> piece<00:02:06.390> over<00:02:06.630> here<00:02:06.659> you

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
there's no corner piece over here you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.450 
there's no corner piece over here you
can<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.619> move<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:07.950> down

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
can just move that down

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.920 
can just move that down
simple<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.930> then<00:02:10.860> here's<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> red<00:02:11.700> piece<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
simple and then here's a red piece you

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.810 
simple and then here's a red piece you
move<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.380> here<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:16.140> time<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:17.520> can't

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
move that here and this time you can't

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.400 
move that here and this time you can't
just<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.050> won't

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
just like do that because that won't

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.820 
just like do that because that won't
work<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.700> one<00:02:20.880> would<00:02:21.030> go<00:02:21.180> out<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:22.290> you

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
work then this one would go out so you

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.190 
work then this one would go out so you
need<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.190> move<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.090> out<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.510> way<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:24.720> then

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
need to move it out of the way so then

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.130 
need to move it out of the way so then
you<00:02:25.350> can<00:02:25.500> turn<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:26.100> up<00:02:26.390> move<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.600> back

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
you can turn this one up move it back

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.490 
you can turn this one up move it back
and<00:02:28.530> then<00:02:29.220> since<00:02:30.120> its<00:02:30.420> line<00:02:30.720> all<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.320> have<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
and then since its line all you have to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.130 
and then since its line all you have to
do<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.800> put<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.370> back<00:02:32.580> down<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:33.570> now<00:02:33.780> there's

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
do is put it back down and now there's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.480 
do is put it back down and now there's
only<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:34.500> more<00:02:34.650> slot<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.310> pretty

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
only one more slot so it's pretty

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.330 
only one more slot so it's pretty
obvious<00:02:35.970> where<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.240> one<00:02:36.480> should<00:02:36.840> go<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:38.130> like

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
obvious where this one should go so like

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.080 
obvious where this one should go so like
I<00:02:38.460> say<00:02:38.670> earlier<00:02:39.180> move<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.990> out<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.500> way

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
I say earlier move it out of the way

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.880 
I say earlier move it out of the way
push<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.240> up<00:02:42.920> align<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.340> put<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:44.940> back<00:02:45.120> down

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
push it up align it and put it back down

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.000 
push it up align it and put it back down
all<00:02:46.890> right<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.760> now<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.780> you've<00:02:48.960> solved<00:02:49.620> one

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
all right so now that you've solved one

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.670 
all right so now that you've solved one
side<00:02:50.370> correctly<00:02:51.830> this<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.240> this<00:02:54.240> part<00:02:54.720> okay<00:02:55.200> so

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
side correctly this is this part okay so

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.120 
side correctly this is this part okay so
anyhow<00:02:56.300> since<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:58.200> know<00:02:58.320> there<00:02:58.530> are<00:02:58.710> no<00:02:58.920> edges

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
anyhow since you know there are no edges

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.130 
anyhow since you know there are no edges
you<00:02:59.670> won't<00:03:00.060> have<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.390> worry<00:03:00.420> about<00:03:00.690> any<00:03:00.960> of

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
you won't have to worry about any of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.460 
you won't have to worry about any of
those<00:03:01.260> crosses<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.690> next<00:03:03.840> step<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
those crosses and so the next step is to

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.870 
those crosses and so the next step is to
get<00:03:04.620> all<00:03:04.830> yellow<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.850> top<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.440> case

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
get all yellow on top so this case

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.200 
get all yellow on top so this case
simply<00:03:08.880> resembles<00:03:09.570> this<00:03:09.930> case<00:03:10.290> see<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.610> these

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
simply resembles this case see the these

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.590 
simply resembles this case see the these
two<00:03:12.380> corners<00:03:13.380> are<00:03:13.590> solved<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.400> there<00:03:15.240> are<00:03:15.330> two

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
two corners are solved and there are two

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.730 
two corners are solved and there are two
off<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.230> side<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:18.150> off<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.660> side<00:03:18.900> so

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
off to the side to off to the side so

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.010 
off to the side to off to the side so
what<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.040> do<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.580> hold<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.270> cut<00:03:21.810> off

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
what you do is you hold it with cut off

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.250 
what you do is you hold it with cut off
their<00:03:22.200> side<00:03:22.440> facing<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.100> we<00:03:23.610> do<00:03:23.820> soon<00:03:24.260> which

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
their side facing you we do soon which

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.170 
their side facing you we do soon which
is<00:03:25.470> right<00:03:26.190> up<00:03:26.720> right<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.870> write<00:03:27.990> it<00:03:28.110> up<00:03:28.320> right

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
is right up right and write it up right

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.710 
is right up right and write it up right
youtube<00:03:30.180> then<00:03:30.720> right<00:03:31.470> invert<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.720> then

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
youtube then right invert it and then

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.830 
youtube then right invert it and then
that<00:03:34.140> sets<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.560> up<00:03:34.650> for<00:03:34.740> anti<00:03:35.220> soon<00:03:35.690> which<00:03:36.690> is

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
that sets you up for anti soon which is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.670 
that sets you up for anti soon which is
the<00:03:36.990> exact<00:03:37.320> opposite<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:38.010> soon<00:03:38.390> obviously<00:03:39.390> and

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
the exact opposite of soon obviously and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.970 
the exact opposite of soon obviously and
there<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:41.220> have<00:03:41.250> all<00:03:41.490> yellow<00:03:41.730> on<00:03:41.910> top<00:03:42.710> so<00:03:43.710> here

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
there you have all yellow on top so here
