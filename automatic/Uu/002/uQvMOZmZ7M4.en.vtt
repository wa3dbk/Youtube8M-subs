00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.299
 have you asked where the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.969
 books we find in bookstores 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.520
 in libraries or sometimes they reach us 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.279
 from other people or fallen from 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 sky some even already lived in 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.529
 our house since we were very limits 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.150
 the truth is that before all that a 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.540
 day when they saw the light of nothing 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.750
 we could say that actually born 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.780
 were manufactured by expert hands of 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.500
 people specialized in the art of 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.500
 make books 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.280
 you want to see how they make them discover 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.280
 with me in the book factory 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.580
 before being put on paper someone 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.980
 he had the work in his head and then 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.830
 write what will later be the 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.940
 content of the book a novel an essay 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.940
 a memory 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.210
 once the work is finished the author 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.700
 deliver the work to the editor on paper or in 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.060
 digital format is then when 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.120
 they study together the format the type of 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.800
 letter the size of the cover or the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.730
 possible connection to which you could 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.310
 belong 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.730
 currently the editor sends to the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.490
 print the archives of the work by the 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.280
 network from computer to computer what 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.900
 is a great time saving the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.870
 information is processed by means 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.080
 computers in what we call edition 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.020
 layout and already in the printing phase 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.110
 prepress colors typography 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.540
 designs everything contributes to the book 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.510
 be ready to print 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.149
 Now we must check if the document 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.670
 complies with the specifications 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.040
 necessary for everything to go well 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.860
 Currently the tests can be done at 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.120
 through the internet directly in the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.120
 customer's computer 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.010
 the filming of plates we can already 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.740
 move to the printing phase 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.590
 plates have a sensitive layer 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.650
 heat and have been recorded using a 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.380
 special laser imagine that you can 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.270
 record at high speed each letter and 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.270
 point that form the images 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.129
 when these plates are placed that the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.379
 ink printing machine will be able to 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.300
 look at the paper when turning the 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.510
 cylinders and the sheet of paper is left 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.250
 printed are very high machines 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.280
 precision this is what is called 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.700
 offset printing system the most 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.700
 popular 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.740
 However, if the circulation was very 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.580
 small we would have decided to print in 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.580
 digital machine 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.470
 we already have stacks of printed sheets 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.780
 Now you have to cut and fold the leaves 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.690
 have been printed in such a way that 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.879
 fold the pages that in ordered is 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.560
 correctly these phases is called 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.560
 guillotined and folded 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.260
 the rows of printed sheets are 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.950
 now converted into booklets or 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.950
 subjects 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.849
 usually 16 or 32 pages that 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.579
 joined together consecutively 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:54.639
 will form the finished book now we 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.909
 the first process is bound 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:00.519
 the elevation the booklets are placed 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.639
 in the feeders and the hard hike go 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.579
 grouping complete sets the system 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:09.129
 corrects possible errors and then 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.099
 the loin is prepared and the 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.530
 adhesive are placed the covers of the 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.229
 books go to a tape to dry 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.169
 at the end of it is guillotine for 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:23.169
 give them the exact size and then 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.430
 pitan are deceived and are loaded into 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.430
 delivery vehicles 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.450
 and we already have our same 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.450
 do not 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:56.309
 i 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.419
 good trip
