 utrecht because if she walks through that city one knows you pay attention or keep going 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.590
 citi 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.690
 chances are very high that the gnome against costa rica bouter is a creation 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.319
 from the illegal graffiti spraying a lot of weather 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.599
 tram doors from a little artistic initials 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.179
 and you can agree voters utrecht has his own kiev 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.909
 healing 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.449
 but who is the spiritual father 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.679
 the suspect is being brought 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.939
 9 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.990
 how 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.200

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.879
 non-statutory 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.690
 such a person has a sense of humor and the effects 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.690
 did plan this very much fun 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.339
 people are everywhere in every day think again new hope 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.989
 at the railroad tracks in residential areas throughout utrecht a cheerful or quite complete 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.649
 kosher gnome who always has the new message that used to be the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.009
 Trade union is a farce we have arjen five to six would by nothing too 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.620
 do in india 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.590
 mariana but to say the trend is I especially like gnome but I do 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 never wearing fur 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.050
 there is even a book about the gnome 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.540
 bicycle courier no brick neighborhood fought cabout all year and falls from 400 euros 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.350
 i've put a whole i in about fifteen hundred pictures 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.189
 utrecht falls 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.750
 for you of figurative images 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.000
 but me but this kind of thing there that I think it is beautiful and energy then 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.790
 not that he is that police officer 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.060
 yes that is shows even more often 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.770
 and instead of having a gnome, it actually has more to it 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.820
 the names as we as guns 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.230
 or whether or that here in a kind of robot can bouterse and that she finds things 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.810
 just very strong 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.970
 3 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.810
 and so nice outside in the garden 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.029
 9 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.699
 making the utrechtse theater leon giesen the gnomes even is one 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:12.689
 theater show 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.689
 contacted the maker through his bicycle repair shop 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.950
 beijing with the spring break the timepiece with the two crates of beer to the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.319
 bicycle repair 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.790
 and that can be the key and and a note that we are the beijer of the drawing of 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.089
 build living and 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:28.279
 the goals came from 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:32.939
 from the spring break involved the gnome and finally the cake goes 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.849
 I read that the shed done homework there were empty one 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.079
 bottle of beer 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.359
 we have been very sorry for years that they will not be there any further 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.669
 way too high 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.159
 green 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.159
 but we got to be flown so 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.579
 in 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.099
 if you are much more with the empire there is probably one 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.869
 behind sports hall 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.589
 I think it is also for the art form of the ad I enjoy it 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.880
 just tell me that i see this 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.940
 and again with letters and numbers 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.050
 not according to eric, because that is also not interesting to me for the brand name 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.999
 to put that told 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.999
 in my view nothing to do with art 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.749
 who depressions 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.709
 I am a very good friend with the ball outside 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.319
 at the eden award when best gnome is born 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.429
 a few years ago he was born in utrecht 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.779
 uncle 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.049
 to tell the street scene 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.199
 and then people's growth lay on the face, I think I called then 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.199
 some commotion closely and the extent of it 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.119
 the idea is that you just become aware of your environment you put 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.680
 just ijeereer has a relationship with the third place where you are a city where you 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.279
 lives and I think that's very good 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.729
 I am not alone you are watching a huge building, this is fantastic 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.949
 and do you think this might also ever belong in a museum, yes 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.149
 if you have one 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:16.089
 if you look at the commemoration in the dow were or with those who are with 

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.249
 both artists who are now seen as artists 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:20.739
 but before 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.539
 it is striking that those who were active and unknown and then those who despots 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.710
 that is positive that it is being looked at that way today 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.909
 but I would say the expulsion to Iraq openness of that 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:35.860
 operation 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.590
 that share nevertheless only go on paying for the women 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.449
 people who smoke come to a museum 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.570
 and it is go with the outer everyone there are also people who say away with 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.259
 that gnome who polluted 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.419
 our neighbors and properties 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.529
 Yes that 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.389
 beyond that he doesn't like that he is not accepted anywhere and 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:57.909
 is appreciated 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.199
 but they are very understandable and justified 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.030
 nowadays the gnome is also becoming a loot 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.090
 see you first especially fortis soon all the netherlands became gnome 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.440
 time was certainly fitting in the shoes and that certainly goes 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.900
 laugh 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.889
 get further follow-up 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.249
 they are certain to people 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.249
 this vessel will certainly continue to follow a tail 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:24.630
 and big too
