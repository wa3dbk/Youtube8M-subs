00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:16.835
 Karol Bielecki: - Professionally! 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.720
 Talant Dujszebajew: - It's enough for us to have six players plus one goalkeeper! 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.240
 four wingers and two best defenders! 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 this is success! 

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:36.138
 Denis BuntiÄ‡: good evening to everyone 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.750
 Ivan, please tell me what was today? 

00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:43.815
 What happened on the pitch? 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.809
 First of all congratulations for the whole team! 

00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:50.813
 For all eight players! 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.880
 We needed some motivation 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.420
 After the first very bad half, we played as we can 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.760
 At the end a happy but well-deserved result 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.740
 In the first half, was it our tactic? 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.660
 Did we just play poorly and then good? 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.319
 In the first half we needed more motivation 

00:01:27.702 --> 00:01:29.702
 We already had it after the first half 

00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:32.816
 We've made ourselves motivated. 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.220
 We wanted to show that everything is possible in 30 minutes. 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.900
 We showed that four wingers and two quarterbacks and the goalkeeper can win. 

00:01:45.978 --> 00:01:49.558
 What do you think about Julien? When he saw that we were losing, he did not want to play. 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.620
 We play in six players and one goalkeeper and we win. 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.940
 This is great!
