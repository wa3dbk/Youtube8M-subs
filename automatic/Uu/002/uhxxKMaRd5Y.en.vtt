00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
mastery mastery hey same difference

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.260 
mastery mastery hey same difference
honestly<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.040> st.<00:01:14.310> i<00:01:14.430> got<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> same<00:01:14.939> exact

honestly the st. i got the same exact

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.940 
honestly the st. i got the same exact
numbers<00:01:15.600> when<00:01:15.720> i<00:01:15.750> put<00:01:16.020> them<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.740> stab

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
numbers when i put them in as the stab

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.890 
numbers when i put them in as the stab
priorities<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.939> haste<00:01:18.390> mastery<00:01:18.570> are

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
priorities so haste mastery are

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.499 
priorities so haste mastery are

except<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> only<00:01:35.220> thing<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.460> changed<00:01:35.820> was

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
except the only thing I changed was

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.880 
except the only thing I changed was
three<00:01:36.299> forges<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> interesting

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
three forges so that's the interesting

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.740 
three forges so that's the interesting
part<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.240> back<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
part because if I go back and do the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.020 
part because if I go back and do the
gems<00:01:40.020> i<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.350> an<00:01:40.439> inkling<00:01:40.680> suspicion<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
gems i have an inkling suspicion that it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.580 
gems i have an inkling suspicion that it
will<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:42.750> bit<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.200> bigger

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
will be a little bit of a bigger

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.580 
will be a little bit of a bigger
difference<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:46.079> video<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.470> can

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
difference but in this video you can

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.429 
difference but in this video you can

haste<00:01:51.509> mastery<00:01:52.159> what<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.310> doing<00:01:53.579> more<00:01:53.790> damage

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
haste mastery what is doing more damage

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.389 
haste mastery what is doing more damage
and<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.840> white<00:01:55.110> damage<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:56.070> you

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
could have probably guessed white damage

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.459 
could have probably guessed white damage
is<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> little<00:01:59.219> bit<00:01:59.430> better<00:01:59.700> with<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.450> UM<00:02:00.659> the

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
different i doesn't matter honestly the

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.870 
different i doesn't matter honestly the
numbers<00:04:04.260> are<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:04.620> similar<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.400> doesn't<00:04:05.819> even

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
numbers are so similar it doesn't even

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.650

so<00:05:43.690> often<00:05:43.930> as<00:05:44.290> opposed<00:05:45.010> to<00:05:45.160> haste<00:05:45.370> mastery

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
so often as opposed to haste mastery

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.400 
so often as opposed to haste mastery
where<00:05:45.910> you're<00:05:46.030> just<00:05:46.060> pulling<00:05:46.390> flat<00:05:46.930> numbers

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
where you're just pulling flat numbers

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.120 
where you're just pulling flat numbers
so<00:05:48.220> i<00:05:48.430> highly<00:05:49.120> recommend<00:05:49.810> going<00:05:49.930> crit<00:05:50.350> in<00:05:50.530> my

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
so i highly recommend going crit in my

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.590 
so i highly recommend going crit in my
opinion<00:05:51.520> because<00:05:51.760> i<00:05:51.940> like<00:05:52.300> the

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
opinion because i like the

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.680 
opinion because i like the
unpredictability<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.850> surprise<00:05:55.210> of
