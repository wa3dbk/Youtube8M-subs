00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 I'm new to you but is 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.540
 my box must be off the engine is just that 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.280
 to catch 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.200
 16 in the woods of portia I ca n't do anything 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.670
 do are probably few 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.420
 wood is when it could have been better 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.670
 already in this porsche 911 speedster and found 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.050
 you immediately think then you are casper 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.650
 already with an even skewer on the way 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.820
 been 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.119
 Yes that's right 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.619
 but that was a porsche 964 space too 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.619
 now have it in the original 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.800
 in the late 80's then america was in one 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.090
 economic recession and porsche america 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.470
 he went to the head office 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.120
 germany are guys we need something 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.040
 aparts have the seller to 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.720
 because they simply do not sell any 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.740
 sports cars more clean very difficult on 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.300
 this moment 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.880
 and in germany day when yes that is 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.760
 all nice are you 964 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.290
 as good as fully developed and now again 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.940
 do something special but because 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.500
 municipalities back 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.810
 holding an old sketch lying down 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.460
 911 portion and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.259
 yes actually that was very easy 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.369
 to realize consent of taste that car 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.189
 based on 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.689
 just 911 cabrio only these affected what 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.850
 major adjustments 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.369
 so it was lowered ahead and for it 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.880
 removable soaps and you also had the side 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.820
 want 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.770
 lower the roof is really only true 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.950
 for emergencies and is under a hood 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.659
 here behind that also ensures that 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.100
 there are no rear seats 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.510
 there are unfortunately for the people with 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.390
 children or friends they take with them 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.130
 but yes as old as you might just have 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.670
 we do n't want any children on clean 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.670
 We therefore again 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.200
 which body actually speech Zolas 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.600
 meant as a kind of jamin a hardcore 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.370
 version of the 911 and there was also 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.900
 then comes standard with less luxury 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.070
 that also the idea to actually it 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.869
 cheaper in the market but 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.310
 when they finally had 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.300
 fully developed and ready to take in the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.650
 showroom puts the market is one 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.390
 math and it turned out that 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.509
 car actually became more expensive than the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.820
 ordinary 911 convertible so became a thing for 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.869
 the enthusiasts and so decided portia 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.600
 just hear it in a limited edition 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.080
 print the work 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.209
 finally sold in 2004 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.310
 of which we went 800 went to 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.310
 America and RSS over the rest of the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.110
 world wide 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.790
 there were some funny things about that 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.349
 skewers so was in for example in 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.930
 principle meant as a car with the 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.989
 normal body but you could 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.680
 if you chose the m503 variant of the 911 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.989
 stuff 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.819
 you can also choose internal hummingbirds 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.310
 so opt for the turbo look with the 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.290
 wider back somewhat cooler body 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.540
 yes and how everyone turns out to be you 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.220
 order responses of yes 100 euros pest 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.830
 it becomes very special thing so therefore 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.900
 were also just logical so 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.300
 almost everyone coaches for the wide body 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.560
 for the turbo look what makes it 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.330
 one took care of that in terms of 171 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.390
 of a nobody's built is of a 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.490
 so be narrow if you and 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.010
 let cars together again then that is 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.349
 the one to really look for 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.239
 of course anyway are els peter sales 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.650
 money would be because 21 100 pieces and then 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.739
 are already another from collectors 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.739
 yes you know its very easy to dip 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.200
 the three point two six-cylinder boxer and 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.050
 I'm having a good time 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:40.930
 yes the triple 2 sixes in the boxer who 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.819
 has 245 hp and 68 with the torque 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.670
 steal top speed or 45 kilometers 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.639
 per hour and jumps and 100 if you have the 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.079
 know how to operate manual five-speed container 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.410
 you should have about six schools 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.930
 cost 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.610
 with that performance that portia that is too 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.970
 nice that i'm a bit into the then 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.190
 shemale can either have your down considerably 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.310
 so the design helmet had a bid that 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.110
 also taken into account and the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.850
 a lot of noise that time is just one 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.080
 whole of car where that can free up 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.150
 it's a few screws 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.680
 you just have to know where they are but 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.340
 you can so one can advance 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.960
 this one 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.120
 I would personally do a helmet on it 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.230
 putting bins because flies are happening 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.230
 not necessarily very nice 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.889
 this copy is really yes i got it 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.990
 never and I am not exaggerating I still have 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.120
 never seen a car this age 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.740
 stops at 989 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.479
 like an all mega speech by the way 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.590
 they are all in the first half of 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.819
 built this year 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.069
 I've never seen a car like that 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.560
 age that looks like this 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.090
 he is really the first as new 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.319
 owner who has less than 14,000 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.629
 driven with it for a kilometer but also has it 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.500
 really cared for like our own 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:55.020
 baby was according to me 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.480
 like this panel here so that that that 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.830
 stitching the leather as no closure 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.090
 come to the factory 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.340
 if anyone has my say i would 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.530
 believe if you believe it is real or adjustable 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.700
 super nice car from the first owner 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.020
 has that to classics and know how to 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.340
 and I 'll joke 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.020
 momentarily 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.760
 said there is I put the player in 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.050
 however, this car is blaupunkt 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.940
 you peri it correctly as they then 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.940

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.940

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.139
 and 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.220
 not only is the window melody and 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.460
 orchestras 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.300
 antonie ventura 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.610
 i hope i'm all right 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.960
 pronounce what a case ok fantastic 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.050
 you get it all from the first 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.050
 owner 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.340
 super gift 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.780
 you get 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.100
 if I could 9 and features to 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.100
 pay then I would know 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.280
 No
