Minecraft because there are something

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.359 
Minecraft because there are something
I've<00:00:27.390> kind<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> jiggled<00:00:28.680> around<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.099> head

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.700 
I've kind of jiggled around in my head
over<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.849> years<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.539> they're<00:00:31.019> more<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.470> for

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
over the years and they're more so for

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.200 
over the years and they're more so for
console<00:00:32.160> than<00:00:32.279> anything<00:00:32.489> because<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> don't

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
console than anything because I don't

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.639 
console than anything because I don't
think<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.480> console<00:00:33.840> version<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.170> Minecraft

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
think the console version of Minecraft

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.229 
think the console version of Minecraft
