wireless<00:00:52.079> wouldn't<00:00:52.500> reach<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:52.949> had<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
wireless wouldn't reach it so we had to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.420 
wireless wouldn't reach it so we had to
buy<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> little<00:00:53.820> adapters<00:00:54.649> um<00:00:55.649> because

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
buy like the little adapters um because

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
buy like the little adapters um because
the<00:00:56.850> xbox<00:00:57.239> wireless<00:00:57.480> wasn't<00:00:57.930> strong<00:00:58.079> enough

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the xbox wireless wasn't strong enough

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560 
the xbox wireless wasn't strong enough
to<00:00:58.440> reach<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.949> wireless<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> house<00:00:59.879> but

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
to reach the wireless in the house but

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.910 
to reach the wireless in the house but
the<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.809> adapters<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.500> they're<00:01:01.739> much

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the little adapters are they're much

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
the little adapters are they're much
stronger<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.449> got<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.809> actually

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
stronger so we just got that actually

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.840 
stronger so we just got that actually
for<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.680> birthday<00:01:05.010> which<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.250> 26<00:01:05.670> that's
