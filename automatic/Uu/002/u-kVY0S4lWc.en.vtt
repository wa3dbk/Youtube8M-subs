00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hey guys this is Samuel tech geek I know

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.970 
hey guys this is Samuel tech geek I know
a<00:00:03.179> lot<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.510> people<00:00:03.659> have<00:00:04.080> problems<00:00:04.589> with<00:00:04.830> the

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
a lot of people have problems with the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.280 
a lot of people have problems with the
wii<00:00:05.100> controller<00:00:05.549> on<00:00:05.879> on<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:07.170> know

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
wii controller on on you know

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.950 
wii controller on on you know
sensitivity<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.250> such<00:00:08.490> now<00:00:09.450> as<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.750> can<00:00:09.900> see

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
sensitivity and such now as you can see

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.440 
sensitivity and such now as you can see
you<00:00:10.650> did<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.920> little<00:00:11.130> too<00:00:11.309> lights<00:00:11.580> that's<00:00:12.300> how

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
you did a little too lights that's how

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.829 
you did a little too lights that's how
fast<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.080> detect<00:00:13.380> my<00:00:13.650> motion<00:00:14.639> sensing<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.750> if

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
fast and detect my motion sensing so if

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.870 
fast and detect my motion sensing so if
you<00:00:15.960> ever<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.320> problems<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:17.070> control<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
you ever have problems we control is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.510 
you ever have problems we control is
it's<00:00:18.180> not<00:00:18.359> detecting<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.320> or<00:00:19.500> something<00:00:19.859> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
it's not detecting it or something you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.490 
it's not detecting it or something you
go<00:00:20.699> into<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.090> mode<00:00:21.359> as<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:22.020> see<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> little

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
go into this mode as you see the little

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.730 
go into this mode as you see the little
light<00:00:23.070> turn<00:00:23.369> sensor<00:00:23.760> bar<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.210> my<00:00:24.869> camera<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
light turn sensor bar and my camera and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.769 
light turn sensor bar and my camera and
my<00:00:25.800> wiimote<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.580> seen<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> lights<00:00:27.150> from<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
my wiimote is seen the lights from the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.529 
my wiimote is seen the lights from the
center<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.310> again<00:00:29.310> crease<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.820> how<00:00:30.000> fast<00:00:30.240> it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
center are again crease on how fast it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.200 
center are again crease on how fast it
sees<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.030> can

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
sees them as you can see it's just I can

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
sees them as you can see it's just I can
when<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.020> use<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> moat<00:00:34.530> does<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> lot<00:00:35.370> faster

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
when I use the moat does it a lot faster

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.670 
when I use the moat does it a lot faster
but<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.380> decrease<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:39.020> it<00:00:40.020> doesn't<00:00:40.410> see<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
but if I decrease it it doesn't see the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.090 
but if I decrease it it doesn't see the
lights<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:41.040> fast<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:43.290> could<00:00:43.559> lead<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.800> like

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
lights as fast and it could lead to like

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.729 
lights as fast and it could lead to like
weird<00:00:44.489> stuff<00:00:44.550> happening<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.260> now<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
weird stuff happening like right now I

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.569 
weird stuff happening like right now I
am<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.930> moving<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.260> weho<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:50.160> almost<00:00:50.370> as

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
am really moving the weho like almost as

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
am really moving the weho like almost as
fast<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:52.500> sensitive<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
fast as I can is that sensitive that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.760 
fast as I can is that sensitive that
fast<00:00:53.399> oh<00:00:53.930> my<00:00:54.930> play<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:56.059> this<00:00:57.059> log<00:00:57.300> better<00:00:57.770> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
fast oh my play here this log better in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.520 
fast oh my play here this log better in
here<00:00:59.359> this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> how<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.690> test<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.350> your

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
here this is how you test to see if your

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.090 
here this is how you test to see if your
wiimote<00:01:02.480> will<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.660> good<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.019> game<00:01:04.229> around<00:01:04.470> so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
wiimote will do good in game around so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
wiimote will do good in game around so
if<00:01:05.189> you're<00:01:05.309> having<00:01:05.489> any<00:01:05.729> problems<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.750> how<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
if you're having any problems on how it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.000 
if you're having any problems on how it
senses<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.670> edit<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.470> lot

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
senses as you can edit it here so a lot

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280 
senses as you can edit it here so a lot
of<00:01:11.040> people<00:01:11.130> say<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.490> wii<00:01:11.790> controls<00:01:12.210> suck<00:01:12.479> but

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
of people say that wii controls suck but

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.859 
of people say that wii controls suck but
it<00:01:13.619> might<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.939> way<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.360> lighting<00:01:15.750> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
it might be this the way the lighting is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.170 
it might be this the way the lighting is
in<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.200> room<00:01:16.439> might<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.490> how<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.759> censor

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
in your room might be how the censor

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.149 
in your room might be how the censor
bars<00:01:18.420> place<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.710> might<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
bars place or it might be the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.630 
bars place or it might be the
sensitivity<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.479> go<00:01:21.720> check<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.680> lot

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
sensitivity so go check this out a lot

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
sensitivity so go check this out a lot
of<00:01:23.759> people<00:01:23.909> out<00:01:24.090> problems<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
of people out problems with this and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380 
of people out problems with this and
I've<00:01:26.070> showed<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.909> people<00:01:27.000> and
