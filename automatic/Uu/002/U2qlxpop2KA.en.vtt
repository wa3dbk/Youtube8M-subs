year and I haven't done another video so
I<00:00:15.820> thought<00:00:16.059> I'd<00:00:16.209> sort<00:00:16.510> that<00:00:16.630> out<00:00:16.750> and<00:00:16.960> do<00:00:17.349> one

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
I thought I'd sort that out and do one

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.640 
I thought I'd sort that out and do one
now<00:00:17.800> um<00:00:18.660> but<00:00:19.660> before<00:00:19.779> I<00:00:19.990> do<00:00:20.079> that<00:00:20.169> in<00:00:20.470> case

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
started which I'll put a link in the

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.450 
started which I'll put a link in the
description<00:00:25.630> on<00:00:26.169> this<00:00:26.259> video<00:00:26.439> so<00:00:27.309> if<00:00:27.430> you

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
description on this video so if you

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.490 
description on this video so if you
could<00:00:27.730> check<00:00:27.969> that<00:00:28.119> out<00:00:28.329> that<00:00:29.050> would<00:00:29.200> be<00:00:29.320> good

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
could check that out that would be good

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.740 
could check that out that would be good
I<00:00:29.770> tend<00:00:30.040> to<00:00:30.130> update<00:00:30.489> that<00:00:30.669> more<00:00:31.059> than<00:00:31.509> I<00:00:31.570> do

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
I tend to update that more than I do

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.750 
I tend to update that more than I do
videos<00:00:32.169> simply<00:00:32.710> because<00:00:32.860> it's<00:00:33.070> easier<00:00:33.520> to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
videos simply because it's easier to

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.910 
videos simply because it's easier to
write<00:00:34.329> than<00:00:34.629> it<00:00:34.750> is<00:00:34.870> to<00:00:35.079> do<00:00:35.230> this<00:00:35.410> this<00:00:35.649> takes

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
write than it is to do this this takes

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.040 
write than it is to do this this takes
time<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:36.520> they're<00:00:36.640> fun<00:00:36.879> but<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.629> still<00:00:37.809> enjoy

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
time and they're fun but I still enjoy

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.930 
time and they're fun but I still enjoy
making<00:00:38.320> videos<00:00:38.739> so<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:38.980> was<00:00:39.129> lucky<00:00:39.309> in<00:00:39.610> making

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
making videos so I was lucky in making

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.510 
making videos so I was lucky in making
videos<00:00:40.590> anyways<00:00:41.590> get<00:00:41.860> on<00:00:43.800> now<00:00:44.800> I<00:00:45.040> have<00:00:45.250> to<00:00:45.370> say

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
videos anyways get on now I have to say

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.010 
videos anyways get on now I have to say
the<00:00:45.640> main<00:00:45.850> reason<00:00:46.300> I<00:00:46.360> didn't<00:00:46.600> make<00:00:46.750> many

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
the main reason I didn't make many

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.830 
the main reason I didn't make many
videos<00:00:47.079> in<00:00:47.850> 2013<00:00:48.850> simply<00:00:49.239> because<00:00:49.510> I<00:00:49.570> didn't

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
videos in 2013 simply because I didn't

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.390 
videos in 2013 simply because I didn't
really<00:00:50.020> have<00:00:50.140> anything<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:50.980> make<00:00:51.130> videos

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
really have anything to make videos

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.130 
really have anything to make videos
about<00:00:51.550> I<00:00:51.940> wasn't<00:00:52.150> really<00:00:52.420> doing<00:00:52.690> much<00:00:52.810> to<00:00:53.020> the

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
about I wasn't really doing much to the

about I wasn't really doing much to the
many<00:00:53.170> other<00:00:53.710> things<00:00:53.829> took<00:00:54.489> over<00:00:55.110> college<00:00:56.110> work

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
many other things took over college work

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.430 
many other things took over college work
kind<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.640> stuff<00:00:57.880> but<00:00:58.720> hopefully<00:00:59.079> this<00:00:59.200> year

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
last year back in the summer which is

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.500 
last year back in the summer which is
fine<00:01:21.220> in<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.610> summer<00:01:21.820> but<00:01:22.030> when<00:01:22.180> it's<00:01:22.330> in<00:01:22.390> the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
fine in the summer but when it's in the

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.940 
fine in the summer but when it's in the
winter<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:22.960> it's<00:01:23.140> raining<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.500> can't<00:01:23.770> do

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
winter and it's raining you can't do

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
winter and it's raining you can't do
that<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:25.920> let's<00:01:26.920> have<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.070> look<00:01:27.159> at<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.369> then

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that so let's have a look at it then

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.380 
that so let's have a look at it then
I'll<00:01:28.720> just<00:01:28.930> pop<00:01:29.350> open<00:01:29.619> these<00:01:31.170> look<00:01:32.170> at<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.440> end

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.550 

so<00:01:37.390> as<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.540> can<00:01:37.659> see<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.840> hinges<00:01:38.200> on<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.409> back

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
so as you can see it hinges on the back

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.420 
so as you can see it hinges on the back
there<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.250> quite<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.490> bit<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.970> rubber

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
there and I quite a bit of a rubber

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.039 
there and I quite a bit of a rubber
strip<00:01:42.430> just<00:01:42.790> to<00:01:42.939> seal<00:01:43.150> it<00:01:43.270> on<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.540> end<00:01:43.689> and

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
strip just to seal it on the end and

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.010 
strip just to seal it on the end and
then<00:01:44.170> saucy<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.590> couches<00:01:44.979> hold<00:01:45.159> it<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:45.340> place

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
then saucy the couches hold it in place

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.780 
then saucy the couches hold it in place
and<00:01:47.020> inside<00:01:47.670> you've<00:01:48.670> got<00:01:48.880> these<00:01:49.260> gloves<00:01:50.790> which

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.630 
the sand to fall through to be collected
now<00:02:10.720> there<00:02:11.019> you<00:02:11.110> can<00:02:11.230> see<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:11.379> light<00:02:11.680> which<00:02:12.280> is

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
now there you can see a light which is

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.399 
now there you can see a light which is
the<00:02:12.670> light<00:02:12.909> that<00:02:13.269> I<00:02:13.360> use<00:02:13.689> when<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:13.989> was<00:02:14.140> doing

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
the light that I use when I was doing

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.890 
the light that I use when I was doing
the<00:02:14.560> mini<00:02:14.950> shell<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.700> other<00:02:16.360> things<00:02:16.599> it<00:02:16.720> seems

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the mini shell and other things it seems

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.500 
the mini shell and other things it seems
to<00:02:16.989> survive<00:02:17.290> quite<00:02:17.500> well<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.769> he<00:02:18.010> doesn't<00:02:18.159> like

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
to survive quite well as he doesn't like

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.570 
to survive quite well as he doesn't like
shocks<00:02:19.510> or<00:02:19.900> things<00:02:20.110> like<00:02:20.200> that

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
shocks or things like that

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.070 
shocks or things like that
lamps<00:02:21.580> seem<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:22.000> blow<00:02:22.209> when<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.510> do<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.840> but

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
lamps seem to blow when you do that but

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.210 
lamps seem to blow when you do that but
it's<00:02:23.530> alright

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
it's alright

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.070 
it's alright
it<00:02:24.850> seems<00:02:25.120> what<00:02:25.330> their<00:02:25.450> hope<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:25.960> get

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
it seems what their hope is you can get

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.890 
it seems what their hope is you can get
a<00:02:26.110> shock<00:02:26.680> or<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.130> sudden<00:02:27.880> impact<00:02:28.300> there<00:02:28.630> that's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
a shock or a sudden impact there that's

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.440 
a shock or a sudden impact there that's
fine<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:30.160> over<00:02:30.400> there<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.640> was<00:02:31.030> your<00:02:31.210> dust

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
fine and over there I was your dust

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.180 
fine and over there I was your dust
extraction<00:02:31.900> which<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.800> actually<00:02:33.040> blowing

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
extraction which is actually blowing

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.070 
extraction which is actually blowing
inwards<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> depressurizes<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
inwards so it's a depressurizes the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.260 
inwards so it's a depressurizes the
thing<00:02:35.290> forces<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.310> out<00:02:36.460> of<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.760> hole<00:02:37.030> up

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
thing forces it out of that hole up

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.900 
thing forces it out of that hole up
there<00:02:37.510> which<00:02:37.750> then<00:02:38.010> goes<00:02:39.010> out<00:02:39.220> through

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
there which then goes out through

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.700 
there which then goes out through
outside<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.500> then<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.010> window<00:02:42.370> bit<00:02:42.580> here<00:02:42.970> is

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
outside and then the window bit here is

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.430 
outside and then the window bit here is
just<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.800> hole<00:02:45.400> cut<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.880> plywood<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.200> then

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
just a hole cut in the plywood and then

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.790 
just a hole cut in the plywood and then
on<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.620> outside<00:02:47.800> off<00:02:48.700> it's<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.000> piece<00:02:49.480> of

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
on the outside off it's a piece of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.730 
on the outside off it's a piece of
laminated<00:02:50.800> glass<00:02:51.210> from<00:02:52.210> a<00:02:52.300> door<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.630> think<00:02:52.930> a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
laminated glass from a door I think a

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.000 
laminated glass from a door I think a
little<00:02:54.580> bit<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.790> draught<00:02:55.570> excluder<00:02:56.290> stuff

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
little bit of draught excluder stuff

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.770 
little bit of draught excluder stuff
here<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.340> seal<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:57.910> then<00:02:58.830> there's<00:02:59.830> some

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
here to seal it and then there's some

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.420 
here to seal it and then there's some
architrave<00:03:01.780> or<00:03:01.960> something<00:03:02.230> quite<00:03:03.190> long

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
architrave or something quite long

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.650 
architrave or something quite long
enough<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.760> bit<00:03:03.940> there<00:03:04.090> but<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:04.390> got<00:03:04.510> that

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
enough that bit there but you got that

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.830 
enough that bit there but you got that
base<00:03:04.780> one<00:03:04.990> yeah<00:03:05.740> and<00:03:06.220> then<00:03:07.090> I've<00:03:07.240> got<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
base one yeah and then I've got the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.050 
base one yeah and then I've got the
pressure<00:03:08.350> gauge<00:03:08.680> there<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.640> say<00:03:09.820> how<00:03:09.910> much

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
pressure gauge there to say how much

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.330 
pressure gauge there to say how much
pressure<00:03:10.720> there<00:03:10.990> is<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.920> incoming

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
pressure there is and the incoming

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.960 
pressure there is and the incoming
supply<00:03:13.000> from<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.450> compressor<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:15.190> tap<00:03:15.640> turn

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
supply from the compressor and tap turn

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.480 
supply from the compressor and tap turn
off<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:17.290> then<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.070> actual

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
off and then that is the actual

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.290 
off and then that is the actual
compressor<00:03:18.880> itself<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.070> put<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:21.580> sand<00:03:21.880> in

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
compressor itself so you put the sand in

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.050 
compressor itself so you put the sand in
there<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:24.250> get<00:03:24.400> pressure<00:03:24.610> from<00:03:24.790> the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
there and you get pressure from the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.970 
there and you get pressure from the
compressor<00:03:25.690> often<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.530> would<00:03:26.740> you've<00:03:26.890> gone

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
compressor often that would you've gone

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.310 
compressor often that would you've gone
from<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.280> compressor<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.810> they<00:03:28.989> got<00:03:29.110> water

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
from the compressor and they got water

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.949 
from the compressor and they got water
trap<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.010> then<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:31.000> gauge<00:03:31.209> did<00:03:31.510> work<00:03:31.720> but<00:03:31.900> it

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
trap and then that gauge did work but it

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.490 
trap and then that gauge did work but it
doesn't<00:03:32.080> anymore<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.239> pressure<00:03:34.630> goes

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
doesn't anymore and the pressure goes

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.550 
doesn't anymore and the pressure goes
into<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.910> tank<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.600> fill<00:03:37.780> up<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.989> tank<00:03:38.170> itself

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
into the tank to fill up the tank itself

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.890 
into the tank to fill up the tank itself
to<00:03:38.739> pressurize<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.370> sand<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.239> also<00:03:40.630> comes

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
to pressurize the sand and also comes

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.860 
to pressurize the sand and also comes
down<00:03:41.140> this<00:03:41.500> pipe<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.730> bottom<00:03:43.180> there<00:03:43.540> and

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
down this pipe to the bottom there and

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.720 
down this pipe to the bottom there and
then<00:03:44.020> that<00:03:44.440> tap<00:03:44.709> controls<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.459> amount<00:03:45.670> of

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
then that tap controls the amount of

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.330 
then that tap controls the amount of
sand<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.239> comes<00:03:46.570> out<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.290> you've<00:03:47.890> got<00:03:48.070> air

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
sand that comes out so you've got air

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.100 
sand that comes out so you've got air
coming<00:03:48.550> there<00:03:48.850> blowing<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.390> sand<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.900> way

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
coming there blowing the sand that way

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.590 
coming there blowing the sand that way
then<00:03:50.350> through<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:50.920> nozzle<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:52.239> quite

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
then through this nozzle it's quite

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.670 
then through this nozzle it's quite
rather<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.290> then<00:03:54.100> out<00:03:54.430> through<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:56.230> nozzle

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
rather and then out through that nozzle

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.830 
rather and then out through that nozzle
there<00:03:57.040> which<00:03:57.760> is<00:03:57.910> got<00:03:58.060> tap<00:03:58.300> on<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.630> end<00:03:58.750> as

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
there which is got tap on the end as

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.110 
there which is got tap on the end as
well<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.080> you<00:03:59.140> can<00:03:59.200> turn<00:03:59.350> it<00:03:59.470> off<00:03:59.850> I'll<00:04:00.850> just

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
well so you can turn it off I'll just

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.660 
well so you can turn it off I'll just
turn<00:04:01.360> off<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.780> main<00:04:02.260> line<00:04:02.290> above<00:04:02.800> me<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.310> then

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
turn off the main line above me and then

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.130 
turn off the main line above me and then
turn<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.239> light<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.720> then<00:04:05.019> the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
turn on that light and then the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.570 
turn on that light and then the
extractor<00:04:05.709> fan<00:04:06.360> because<00:04:07.360> you're<00:04:07.480> better<00:04:07.600> here

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
extractor fan because you're better here

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.759 
extractor fan because you're better here
you<00:04:09.580> can<00:04:09.730> see<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.540> should<00:04:11.230> probably<00:04:11.470> up<00:04:11.620> some

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
you can see the should probably up some

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.229 
you can see the should probably up some
kind<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.070> mesh<00:04:12.280> guard<00:04:12.610> or<00:04:12.820> something<00:04:13.030> that

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
kind of mesh guard or something that

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.899 
kind of mesh guard or something that
seems<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.540> be<00:04:13.570> everything

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
seems to be everything

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.890 
seems to be everything
so<00:04:15.909> that<00:04:16.060> pressurizes<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:18.449> cabinet<00:04:19.449> and<00:04:19.630> then

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
so that pressurizes the cabinet and then

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.560 
so that pressurizes the cabinet and then
any<00:04:20.470> dust<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:21.160> think<00:04:21.340> will<00:04:21.459> then<00:04:21.609> go<00:04:21.820> up<00:04:21.940> in<00:04:22.210> that

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
any dust I think will then go up in that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.000 
any dust I think will then go up in that
hole<00:04:23.470> up<00:04:23.919> there<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.520> then<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:26.290> outside<00:04:26.740> which

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
hole up there and then to outside which

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.659 
hole up there and then to outside which
is<00:04:27.070> good<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.669> be<00:04:27.790> collected<00:04:28.270> safely<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.669> thought

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
is good to be collected safely I thought

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.460 
is good to be collected safely I thought
I'd<00:04:30.760> give<00:04:30.880> you<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:31.030> quick<00:04:31.240> demonstration<00:04:31.600> of

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
I'd give you a quick demonstration of

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.439 
I'd give you a quick demonstration of
the<00:04:32.889> sound<00:04:33.190> blast<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.580> action<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.120> I've<00:04:34.240> got

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
the sound blast in action so I've got

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.860 
the sound blast in action so I've got
the<00:04:34.660> one<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.530> back<00:04:35.710> plates<00:04:36.039> from<00:04:36.610> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
the one of the back plates from the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.230 
the one of the back plates from the
front<00:04:37.870> brakes<00:04:38.169> on<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.710> mini<00:04:38.949> so<00:04:39.820> I'm<00:04:39.940> going<00:04:40.150> to

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
front brakes on the mini so I'm going to

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.330 
front brakes on the mini so I'm going to
sound<00:04:40.449> blast<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.199> get<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.830> all<00:04:42.039> up<00:04:42.190> and

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
sound blast that and get that all up and

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.370 
sound blast that and get that all up and
painted<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:43.810> I'll<00:04:43.900> show<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.229> now

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
painted and so I'll show you that now

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.350 
painted and so I'll show you that now
cryo<00:04:44.979> things<00:04:45.250> up<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.490> pressure<00:04:45.699> so<00:04:46.060> I'll<00:04:46.210> just

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
cryo things up to pressure so I'll just

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.230 
cryo things up to pressure so I'll just
turn<00:04:46.570> on<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.810> fan<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:49.720> it<00:04:50.050> should<00:04:50.669> look<00:04:51.669> I'm

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
turn on the fan and it should look I'm

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.159 
turn on the fan and it should look I'm
not<00:04:52.389> even<00:04:54.300> there<00:04:55.300> we<00:04:55.479> go<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:57.479> can<00:04:58.479> sing<00:04:58.840> it<00:04:58.990> and

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
not even there we go I can sing it and

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:06.090 
not even there we go I can sing it and
there<00:04:59.620> we<00:04:59.740> go<00:04:59.860> let's<00:05:00.340> go<00:05:00.490> for<00:05:00.699> it<00:05:04.830> as<00:05:05.830> you<00:05:05.889> can

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
there we go let's go for it as you can

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.050 
there we go let's go for it as you can
see<00:05:06.250> it's<00:05:06.400> really<00:05:06.699> effective<00:05:08.580> I've<00:05:09.580> got<00:05:09.789> some

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
see it's really effective I've got some

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.939 
see it's really effective I've got some
new<00:05:10.810> grip<00:05:11.110> that<00:05:11.380> I've<00:05:11.470> got<00:05:11.650> was<00:05:11.800> actually

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
new grip that I've got was actually

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.180 
new grip that I've got was actually
popping<00:05:12.310> sand<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:14.050> can<00:05:14.110> use<00:05:14.320> ordinary<00:05:14.620> sand

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
popping sand you can use ordinary sand

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.050 
popping sand you can use ordinary sand
then<00:05:15.729> apparently<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.330> can<00:05:16.449> get<00:05:16.539> silicosis<00:05:17.020> I

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
then apparently you can get silicosis I

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.510 
then apparently you can get silicosis I
don't<00:05:19.060> want

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.159 

to<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.150> light<00:05:24.300> flicking<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:24.780> up<00:05:24.870> from<00:05:25.080> the

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
to the light flicking it up from the

00:05:25.169 --> 00:06:28.249 
to the light flicking it up from the
compressor<00:05:25.830> captain

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.230 

so<00:06:28.710> to<00:06:28.770> find<00:06:29.069> that<00:06:29.129> there<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.520> nuts<00:06:29.999> and

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
so to find that there the nuts and

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.879 
so to find that there the nuts and
crannies<00:06:30.449> that<00:06:30.659> you<00:06:30.840> couldn't<00:06:31.469> quite<00:06:31.560> get

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
crannies that you couldn't quite get

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.700 
crannies that you couldn't quite get
because<00:06:32.099> of<00:06:32.159> the<00:06:32.310> angle<00:06:32.669> the<00:06:32.699> first<00:06:32.969> time<00:06:33.710> they

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
because of the angle the first time they

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.540 
because of the angle the first time they
were<00:06:34.830> I'm<00:06:34.889> not<00:06:35.039> sure<00:06:35.159> if<00:06:35.279> I<00:06:35.370> can<00:06:35.460> get

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
were I'm not sure if I can get

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.640 
were I'm not sure if I can get
everything<00:06:37.009> does<00:06:38.009> I<00:06:38.069> want<00:06:38.249> it<00:06:38.310> to<00:06:38.430> rear<00:06:38.639> us<00:06:39.650> it

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
everything does I want it to rear us it

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.899 
everything does I want it to rear us it
originally<00:06:41.069> wouldn't<00:06:41.520> have<00:06:41.610> had<00:06:41.729> a<00:06:41.759> very

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
originally wouldn't have had a very

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.019 
originally wouldn't have had a very
thick<00:06:42.240> coat<00:06:42.479> of<00:06:42.509> pain<00:06:43.430> right<00:06:44.430> then<00:06:44.699> bit<00:06:44.879> like

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:45.029 
thick coat of pain right then bit like

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:53.580 
thick coat of pain right then bit like
this

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.950 

I<00:06:55.260> think<00:06:56.260> I'm<00:06:56.440> out<00:06:56.620> of<00:06:56.710> sand<00:06:57.300> so<00:06:58.300> I'll<00:06:58.510> stop<00:06:58.810> it

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
I think I'm out of sand so I'll stop it

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:09.750 
I think I'm out of sand so I'll stop it
there<00:07:03.990> back<00:07:04.990> home<00:07:05.260> and<00:07:05.970> light<00:07:06.970> off<00:07:08.520> open<00:07:09.520> it<00:07:09.639> up

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760 
there back home and light off open it up

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.260 
there back home and light off open it up
and<00:07:10.090> so<00:07:10.450> we<00:07:10.660> go

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.250 

and<00:07:16.270> you<00:07:16.330> probably<00:07:16.510> back<00:07:16.750> when<00:07:16.930> the<00:07:17.020> sand

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260 
and you probably back when the sand

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.030 
and you probably back when the sand
builds<00:07:17.590> up<00:07:17.680> it<00:07:17.800> in<00:07:17.919> sort<00:07:18.100> of<00:07:18.160> a<00:07:18.250> flow<00:07:18.430> that<00:07:20.040> in

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.040 
builds up it in sort of a flow that in

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.970 
builds up it in sort of a flow that in
here<00:07:21.250> the<00:07:21.810> extractor<00:07:22.810> family<00:07:23.169> I<00:07:23.230> know<00:07:23.530> so

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:23.980 
here the extractor family I know so

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.909 
here the extractor family I know so
obviously<00:07:24.760> that<00:07:24.820> size<00:07:25.120> not<00:07:25.360> but<00:07:26.050> as<00:07:26.650> you<00:07:26.800> can

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 
obviously that size not but as you can

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:30.000 
obviously that size not but as you can
see<00:07:26.979> that<00:07:27.669> is<00:07:27.850> now<00:07:28.260> pretty<00:07:29.260> good<00:07:29.380> it's<00:07:29.770> a<00:07:29.889> bit

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.010 
see that is now pretty good it's a bit

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.170 
see that is now pretty good it's a bit
of<00:07:30.100> the<00:07:30.190> rim<00:07:30.400> around<00:07:30.639> the<00:07:30.820> edge<00:07:30.910> that<00:07:30.940> I<00:07:31.150> need

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
of the rim around the edge that I need

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.900 
of the rim around the edge that I need
to<00:07:31.389> redo<00:07:31.660> and<00:07:31.930> pull<00:07:32.139> it<00:07:32.229> up<00:07:32.350> some<00:07:32.590> sand<00:07:32.950> but<00:07:33.700> for

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:33.910 
to redo and pull it up some sand but for

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.879 
to redo and pull it up some sand but for
now<00:07:34.120> for<00:07:34.630> the<00:07:34.720> purposes<00:07:35.080> of<00:07:35.200> this<00:07:35.320> video<00:07:35.470> I

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:35.889 
now for the purposes of this video I

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:38.070 
now for the purposes of this video I
think<00:07:36.220> that<00:07:36.310> will<00:07:36.430> do<00:07:36.610> so<00:07:37.540> thank<00:07:37.900> you<00:07:37.960> for

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080
