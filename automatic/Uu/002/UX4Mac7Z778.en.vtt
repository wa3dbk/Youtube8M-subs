00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
this card if I wanted I take it and I

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.730 
this card if I wanted I take it and I
would<00:02:03.909> replace<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.359> but<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.569> palma<00:02:05.319> has<00:02:05.499> two

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
would replace it but this palma has two

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.370 
would replace it but this palma has two
parts<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:06.609> so<00:02:07.329> when<00:02:07.689> my<00:02:07.810> part<00:02:08.110> would<00:02:08.259> look

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
parts of it so when my part would look

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.110 
parts of it so when my part would look
at<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.739> he'd<00:02:09.280> get<00:02:09.789> it<00:02:09.940> taken<00:02:10.090> both<00:02:10.330> cards
