performs great I've had some time to use
it<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:43.850> one<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.030> things<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.509> did

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it now one of the things that I did

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.850 
it now one of the things that I did
notice<00:01:45.990> though<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:49.619> see

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
notice though is that the you could see

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.499 
notice though is that the you could see
on<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.680> was<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.890> able<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.509> get

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
on this one here was not able to get

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.080 
on this one here was not able to get
that<00:01:54.659> screw<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:56.369> tried<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.060> tried

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that screw in and I tried and I tried

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.160 
that screw in and I tried and I tried
and<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.659> tried<00:01:58.100> cannot<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.869> think

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and I tried cannot get it in and I think

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.690 
and I tried cannot get it in and I think
because<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.560> might<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:01.979> been<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.100> slightly

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
because it might have been a slightly

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.050 
because it might have been a slightly
bit<00:02:03.119> off<00:02:03.329> when<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:03.840> drilled<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> hole<00:02:05.030> not<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
bit off when they drilled the hole not a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.999 
bit off when they drilled the hole not a
major<00:02:06.420> deal<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.170> course<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.560> would<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> lot

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
major deal of course it would be a lot

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.559 
major deal of course it would be a lot
better<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.340> could<00:02:08.369> put<00:02:08.640> all<00:02:08.759> four<00:02:08.970> screws<00:02:09.360> in

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
better if I could put all four screws in

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.940 
better if I could put all four screws in
but<00:02:10.500> ultimately<00:02:10.920> great<00:02:11.819> deck

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
but ultimately great deck

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.660 
but ultimately great deck
