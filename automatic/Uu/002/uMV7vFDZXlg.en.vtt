00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 we are not sure at all 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.140
 his sleeve 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.699
 you two are still not correctly 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.970
 so if you know how terrible they are 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.970
 the titans because they want to be soldiers 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.750
 humanist because week everything hammamet 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.579
 powered by fax and much cost of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.750
 igor cult with fed up of these you 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.690
 I understand that yes no 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.430
 Rainer and I are from a mountain village 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.430
 southeast of the demarÃ­a wall 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.140
 This is unlike the peoples of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.740
 the rivers were not notified in time of 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.510
 attack 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.580
 they devastated us first 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.070
 it was almost at dawn 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.440
 the cattle made a lot of noise and those 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.460
 strange tremors were becoming more and more 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.170
 big 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:27.900
 until I realized that they were steps 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.900
 then I hurried to open the window 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.539
 but 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.130
 now I do not remember much of what happened 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:47.640
 after that everyone was afraid 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.270
 then one to the stage I forgive what 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.319
 I really want to say is that you 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.319
 they are different from them 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.399
 people do not know how terrifying they are 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.399
 the titans today 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.200
 most of those here are what 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.360
 they do to keep up appearances 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.770
 they say that 2 year old children who 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.319
 they want to work in factories are 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.489
 cowards so they get carried away and they 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.740
 they make soldiers and I am not different from 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.750
 they 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.650
 I wanted to come to the troops so that 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.650
 send to the interior 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.860
 If I do not succeed, I'll give up everything 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.020
 I have no will of my own 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.590
 serves very late again in this 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.590
 remembered
