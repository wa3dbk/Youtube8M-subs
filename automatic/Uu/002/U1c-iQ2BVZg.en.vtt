 appears first in that item ie 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.679
 cross would have been perfectly 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.059

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.240
 it would have been perfectly fine 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.460
 we insist on the name of a player as

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.070
 made the difference and the scorer 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.070
 of the world championship 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840

 world with the albiceleste such I 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.190
 I would give the sky 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.870
