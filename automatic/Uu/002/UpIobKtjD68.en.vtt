00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello we continue with exercise 2 in 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:10.090
 its numeral 10 then we have fear the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.280
 let's see m what 6 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:19.070
 elevator to stress between replace 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:23.289
 for 3 over the bird is a means and 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.220
 that is elevated to the bird that is 4 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.689
 Well let's do the operations 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.870
 6 the wash the 3 is multiply 6,666 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:40.960
 for 6 and 36 36 for 6 gives us 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:45.540
 176 36 18 321 216 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.540
 then 6 to 13 216 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.520
 a medium raised to 4 because 4 affects 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.750
 both at 1,2 then one raised at 4 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:01.960
 gives us 1 and 2 raised to 4 2 by 2 by 2 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:06.130
 points 4 times 2.34 times 2 8 times 2 16 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.840
 then we put 216 that we fraction 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.180
 we put a 1 to convert the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.140
 fraction and now if you can apply it and of 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.270
 ear 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 then extreme products products 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.720
 internal then it would be 216 by 16 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.650
 let's do this multiplication 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:29.960
 6 x 6 36 we carry 36 for 16 interest that 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:34.910
 took 96 for all 21 for 6 61 for 11 1 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:41.650
 by pipeline we added 69 more and 615 took a 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:48.350
 one and 23 and 14 123 would give us 3 thousand 456 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:50.930
 then he gives us 3 thousand 456 on 1 for 11 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.840
 all number on 1 divided by 1 of the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.450
 same number or that gives us 3 thousand 456 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.909
 this is the numerical value of the polynomial 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.939
 dice 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.789
 11 then we have here 13 squared 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.399
 then it would be 3 that is one third 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:11.270
 then it would be 3 by a third to 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:14.720
 square all that about 4 more 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.530
 4 that multiplies in the square but in 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.530
 that one quarter 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.500
 squared over m which is 6 we go to 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.000
 wait 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.030
 first I will raise the squares 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.860
 so 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.320
 3 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.880
 by one third squared then the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.780
 square affects both the numerator with 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:40.380
 a denominator 1 squared is 1 and 3 at 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:43.020
 square is 9 all about 4 more 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.720
 and then we have 4 by then 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.880
 it happens the same 1 to the square 1 on 4 to 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.630
 square that is 16 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.180
 all that about 6 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.710
 let's do the part operation 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.650
 of the numerators then we're going to 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.380
 do this multiplication we place 193 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.690
 and 94 to convert them into fractions and 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.150
 to multiply easily three 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.620
 one is 3 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.530
 and one for 99 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.360
 about 4 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.620
 with what very well down to be able 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:22.690
 make them from the ear more 4 x 14 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.190
 about that 1 by 16 16 out of 6 out of 1 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.500
 to also make mind of ear 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.840
 First, I'm going to simplify this 3 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.819
 ninth 74 sixteenths to make it more 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.849
 simple we can take third up and 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.420
 down that would be third of 31 I have not 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.849
 lived between 3 to 3 over four over 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.500
 one more here we can also take out 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.470
 quarter of vido between four up and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.150
 down 4 and 24 gives me 1 16 divided into 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.599
 four mega 4 out of 6 out of 1 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.950
 now laws of the ear were applied 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.650
 extreme products internal products 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:03.329
 one by one is 1 out of 3 out of 4 2 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.060
 one by one 14 by 6 24 then I 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.060
 I'm 12 more than 24 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.659
 let's save to acquire a bit of 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.659
 expansion 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.769
 in 112 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.590
 + 124 let's make that last operation 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:27.950
 so 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:31.760
 we multiply 12 by 24 would be 288 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:36.080
 now even not for 24 24 plus 12 for 12 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.260
 would give us 36 out of 288 we're going to 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.260
 simplify 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:48.520
 we can divide between 36 up and down 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:53.350
 then 36 video 36 61 288 video 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:58.800
 between 36 36 in 388 every eight times 8 by 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:01.030
 6 48 48 but I have 48 for its 24 and 428 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.010
 28091 8th 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.139
 then the numerical value for the 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.569
 polynomial side is an eighth 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.699
 2 and then we have four per day 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:19.009
 square 4 because it is a medium 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:21.220
 squared about 2 16 per n 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.270
 It is a room 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.880
 and is squared on two 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.580
 minus one 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.090
 now let's do the operations 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.720
 then 4 by then a means to 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.150
 square 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.380
 the table affects 1 and capital all at 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.390
 time that you the numerator the 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:45.420
 denominator then 1 squared is 1 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:48.360
 and 2 squared is 4 all about 2 plus 16 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.810
 that multiplies a quarter square 1 to 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:56.400
 square is 1 and 4 squared 16 all 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.800
 about 2 - 1 then here 4 and you 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.970
 we put a 1 and the 16 11 so that we 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.190
 leave fractions 4 for 1 would give 4 and 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.900
 1 for 44 we would have four quarters 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.090
 but when we have a fraction with the 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.550
 same part of above that below that we 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.610
 equals 1 then this operation we 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:18.870
 gives 1 out of 2 like this one because 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:22.500
 we have to tell you by 116 and 1 by 16 16 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:26.010
 we would have 16 16 video that is 1 double 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.230
 2 - 1 then let's make this sum 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.600
 of fractions that is very simple because 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.950
 one half plus one half have the same 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.290
 denominator then I have the 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.050
 intact denominator which is 2 what do I do 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:40.310
 this operation one plus one this me 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.310
 it would be necessary to subtract it in one 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.270
 hat to leave some space and 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.250
 then it 's all about two this part of 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.130
 here I have the mind the numerator the 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:57.240
 equal denominator gives me 1 and I would miss 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:59.340
 subtract the 11 minus 1 would give us 0 0 is 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.970
 the numerical value of this polynomial that 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.970
 us standard
