00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.330
 the position of champions 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.790
 hello, I'm javier, how are you waiting? 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.670
 find very, very, very well and today 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.670
 I have two ideas that can be 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.890
 serve for Christmas without more 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.250
 preambles let's start for the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.870
 first we are going to need the rule 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.290
 I resist the liquid 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:31.380
 a pencil and a permanent down gun 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.390
 silicone with silicon piece of sheet 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.090
 green 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.400
 of yellow and black we will use very 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.880
 a little opaline paper 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.850
 decorative paper with no paper option 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.810
 China 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.670
 know how it is done 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.820
 when the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.190
 take our sheet vertically and let's 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.920
 to divide it into three I'm going to do it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.760
 calculating what but if you want you can 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.760
 do it with rule 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.489
 Now let's turn our sheet and let's go 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.489
 to divide it again in three parts 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 since you have your sheet divided into 9 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.659
 now you are going to cut the lines that you 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.250
 I'm checking right now you're going to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.250
 make a few cuts 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 now let's take our sheet 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.450
 vertically and we are going to put resistol 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.720
 in this part and we're going to paste the part 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.720
 above 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.590
 Now flip your box and do the same 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.930
 in this case we are simply going to put 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.740
 a little bit of this here and we're going to use this 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.840
 part later on this side we're going to do 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.960
 the same thing we are going to put resistol of this 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.710
 side 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.170
 and we are going to paste the box if you realize 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.390
 there is a smaller part inside 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.760
 then all this we are going to cut 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.760
 so that there is only one measure 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.470
 now that we have it that way comes the part 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.959
 funniest decoration with your paper 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.560
 Decorative your scissors your rule and your 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.020
 pencil we will mark depending on the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.920
 size of your house if you do it as I would 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.890
 I'm going to do 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.840
 you have to cut out a rectangle of 8 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.840
 centimeters by 6 centimeters 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.690
 and paste them 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.690
 and good to almost finish what 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.750
 let's do is with the piece of sheet 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.620
 green let's make a piquito 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.620
 cut it 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.540
 with your yellow sheet we are going to make a 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.540
 little Star 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.050
 and with your black sheet we are going to cut out a 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.370
 circle 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.370
 now glue it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.290
 now paste it in your little house 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:22.159
 with your scissors and folding paper 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.159
 let's make band-aids 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.120
 now with your hands for gypsies 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.360
 and put it in the box 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.700
 good for the second let's use 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.099
 a red shirt obviously has to be 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.739
 an old one or if you do not have you can use 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.250
 felt use a piece of cloth 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.250
 white 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.079
 scissors 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.650
 a down or something with what we can 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.129
 mark the needle and thread fabric of the color 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.830
 that you want preferably white or 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:12.110
 red let's see how it's done 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.130
 Well the first thing you have to do is 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:20.330
 fold red guardianship in half 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.580
 and then we're going to draw a boot for 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.710
 let it collide 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.710
 total we will be fixing 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:35.160
 Now that you have it well marked 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:39.660
 trim what you have two equal 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.400
 good since you have your two boots 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.900
 A) Yes 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:49.009
 cut a strip of 40 to 45 centimeters 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:53.169
 of white cloth 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.169
 fold the and trim the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.830
 now with 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.570
 fold a little white guard and put your 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.570
 boot over him 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:13.039
 and now it returns to bend 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.039
 and download it 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.520
 you are going to introduce your needle 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.520
 which you are going to know 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.880
 when you finish sewing this whole line 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:35.810
 from here cut and leave a little like a 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.290
 centimeter on each side now makes a 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.290
 cut 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.040
 around here pretty much 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:51.900
 rub careful not to get there and now 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.900
 let's put it in and let's get to know it 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.320
 now to this procedure in the other 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:23.150
 boot 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.920
 have the two boots ready we are going to 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.070
 flip 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.160
 so they are on the inside and 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.290
 let's join them 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.680
 remember that these have to be at 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:39.340
 backwards we are going to start sewing from the 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.340
 white 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.570
 simply insert the needle 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.840
 and before arriving 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.150
 pass it on 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.970
 when you finish, start turning your 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.970
 booty 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.919
 that would be all for today but before 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.229
 I go I want you to tell me which one 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:31.449
 liked the little box or the box more 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:34.270
 do not forget to subscribe to the part of 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:36.340
 above comment at the bottom and 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:40.169
 give little hand up 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.169
 see you in the next goddess 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.460
 I think that the air tire was struck 

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.920
 and
