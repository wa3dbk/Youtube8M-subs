should<00:02:13.170> look<00:02:13.409> something<00:02:13.739> like<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.610> okay<00:02:15.150> now

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
should look something like this okay now

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.690 
should look something like this okay now
what<00:02:16.409> you're<00:02:16.560> going<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.830> basically<00:02:17.129> do<00:02:17.430> it

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
what you're going to basically do it

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.050 
what you're going to basically do it
just<00:02:18.360> swivel<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.709> middle<00:02:20.220> packet<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.819> to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
see okay so I am swiveling and I still

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.870 
see okay so I am swiveling and I still
have<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.650> break<00:02:59.920> okay<00:03:00.460> now<00:03:01.270> this<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:03.490> packet

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
have the break okay now this this packet

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.850 
have the break okay now this this packet
in<00:03:03.970> my<00:03:04.090> right<00:03:04.270> hand<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.660> just<00:03:04.900> ripped<00:03:05.560> like

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
in my right hand it just ripped like

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.060 
in my right hand it just ripped like
that<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.760> transform<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.110> grip<00:03:08.380> in<00:03:08.590> my<00:03:08.860> left

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
that and I transform the grip in my left

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.760 
that and I transform the grip in my left
hand<00:03:09.370> into<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.730> straddle<00:03:10.150> grip<00:03:10.420> ready<00:03:10.990> for<00:03:11.530> a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
hand into a straddle grip ready for a

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.360 
hand into a straddle grip ready for a
one<00:03:12.040> handed<00:03:12.400> cut<00:03:13.470> now<00:03:14.470> as<00:03:14.770> you're<00:03:15.190> holding

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
one handed cut now as you're holding

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.390 
one handed cut now as you're holding
that<00:03:15.820> packet<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.750> like<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.190> you're<00:03:18.190> going

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
that packet just like that you're going

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.720 
that packet just like that you're going
to<00:03:18.460> go<00:03:18.700> ahead<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.180> flip<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.630> over<00:03:20.730> backwards

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
to go ahead and flip it over backwards

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.430 
to go ahead and flip it over backwards
while<00:03:22.690> doing<00:03:23.500> half<00:03:23.800> or<00:03:24.160> Bashara<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:25.000> cut<00:03:25.660> okay

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
while doing half or Bashara a cut okay

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.770 
while doing half or Bashara a cut okay
so<00:03:27.310> now<00:03:27.400> we<00:03:27.460> have<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.850> situation<00:03:28.030> just<00:03:28.600> like

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
so now we have the situation just like

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.540 
so now we have the situation just like
that<00:03:28.990> you're<00:03:29.500> going<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.710> go<00:03:29.950> ahead<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.280> drop

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
that you're going to go ahead and drop

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.550 
that you're going to go ahead and drop
this<00:03:31.150> packet<00:03:31.630> then<00:03:32.380> close<00:03:32.770> that<00:03:33.370> Charlet<00:03:34.120> cut

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
this packet then close that Charlet cut

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.910 
this packet then close that Charlet cut
so<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:38.200> reach<00:03:38.380> this<00:03:38.590> part<00:03:39.000> swivel<00:03:40.709> leave<00:03:41.709> that

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
so you reach this part swivel leave that

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.820 
so you reach this part swivel leave that
break<00:03:42.570> half<00:03:43.570> of<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.870> one<00:03:44.020> handed<00:03:44.350> cut<00:03:44.590> and

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
break half of the one handed cut and

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.699 
break half of the one handed cut and
while<00:03:45.190> turning<00:03:45.520> over<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.600> packet<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.470> then

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
while turning over that packet and then

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.280 
while turning over that packet and then
you<00:03:47.830> close<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:49.860> Charlie<00:03:50.860> exit<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:52.330> this<00:03:52.900> full

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
you close the Charlie exit so this full

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.380 
you close the Charlie exit so this full
Scott<00:03:53.560> guy's<00:03:53.770> is<00:03:54.070> completely<00:03:54.910> full<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.180> it

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
Scott guy's is completely full so it

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.480 
Scott guy's is completely full so it
maintains<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.870> order<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.500> whole<00:03:56.680> deck<00:03:56.890> so

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
maintains the order of the whole deck so

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.120 
maintains the order of the whole deck so
it's<00:03:57.760> pretty<00:03:58.209> cool<00:03:58.450> actually<00:03:58.810> an<00:03:59.410> application

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
it's pretty cool actually an application

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.920 
it's pretty cool actually an application
is<00:04:00.310> just<00:04:00.490> basically<00:04:00.820> doing<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.360> false<00:04:01.660> cut

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
is just basically doing that false cut

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.580 
is just basically doing that false cut
okay<00:04:02.910> Turing<00:04:05.489> then<00:04:06.780> after<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:08.050> just<00:04:08.230> simply

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
okay Turing then after you just simply

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.850 
okay Turing then after you just simply
close<00:04:08.860> this<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.790> can<00:04:09.970> go<00:04:10.180> ahead<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.570> do<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.440> top

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
close this you can go ahead and do a top

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.070 
close this you can go ahead and do a top
shot<00:04:12.100> okay<00:04:12.459> so<00:04:12.880> it's<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.120> pretty<00:04:13.300> cool<00:04:13.540> way<00:04:13.750> to

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
shot okay so it's a pretty cool way to

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.550 
shot okay so it's a pretty cool way to
produce<00:04:14.650> either<00:04:15.489> one<00:04:15.940> card<00:04:16.270> two<00:04:16.870> cards<00:04:17.320> do<00:04:17.530> a

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
produce either one card two cards do a

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.479 
produce either one card two cards do a
top<00:04:17.830> short<00:04:18.130> or<00:04:18.370> like<00:04:18.700> do<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:19.209> toss<00:04:20.250> production<00:04:21.250> I

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
top short or like do I toss production I

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.030 
top short or like do I toss production I
don't<00:04:22.090> know<00:04:22.180> but<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.570> can<00:04:22.630> just<00:04:23.110> get<00:04:23.320> creative

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
don't know but you can just get creative

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.870 
don't know but you can just get creative
with<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.730> special<00:04:26.130> full<00:04:27.130> script<00:04:27.340> okay

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
with this special full script okay
