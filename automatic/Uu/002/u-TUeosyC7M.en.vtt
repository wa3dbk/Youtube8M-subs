00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello from youtube here we have the samsung 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.359
 galaxy s3 mini of this violence how 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.150
 add contacts from venezuela to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.730
 whatsapp is to say if you are not in 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.160
 venezuela and has the cellular number of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 a friend of a contact from venezuela is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.400
 simply decide the procedure already 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.750
 that if you are in Venezuela then 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.670
 it only adds its freedom 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.930
 cell addresses and already but in 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.029
 our case that for example we 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 we think in colombia we should add the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.720
 country code the country code 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.449
 the country code for venezuela 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.090
 of 58 then of the procedure for 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.219
 be a contact from Venezuela thinking 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.020
 in other countries the next one we go to the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.930
 address book and we add the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.809
 contact let's go here and add the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.010
 name that telephone interview me not 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.079
 I know who she is 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.440
 she simply published her whatsapp 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.890
 on your facebook so I'm using it 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 as proof 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.310
 is called 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.489
 carola 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.460
 marÃ­n and is from venezuela then they want 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.120
 it is important to add the callsign and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.610
 for this we must add the most 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.260
 58 and here and there with hatches we're going to 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.160
 add the rest of numbers 4 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.160
 hairline 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.500
 146 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.229
 hairline locations these hairline are not 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.040
 necessary but so the procedure 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.340
 it works 522 easier to check 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.500
