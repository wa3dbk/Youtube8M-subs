00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.280 
in a hurry and they were always really
cool<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:55.579> know<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:56.750> hard<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.019> get<00:02:57.170> any

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
cool you know so it's hard to get any

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.550 
cool you know so it's hard to get any
really<00:02:57.590> good<00:02:57.769> service<00:02:58.010> out<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.430> them<00:02:58.610> but<00:02:58.819> I

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
really good service out of them but I

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:11.160 
really good service out of them but I
had<00:03:00.560> these<00:03:00.799> uh<00:03:01.150> steel<00:03:05.890> fillers<00:03:06.890> put<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.220> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.309 

there's<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.290> solid<00:03:15.069> valve<00:03:16.069> stems<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:17.139> you<00:03:18.139> can

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
there's a solid valve stems and you can

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.120 
there's a solid valve stems and you can
see<00:03:18.560> how<00:03:18.709> these<00:03:18.859> wheels<00:03:19.220> are<00:03:19.489> two-piece<00:03:19.970> and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
see how these wheels are two-piece and

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.379 
see how these wheels are two-piece and
looks<00:03:22.130> like<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:22.489> have<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:24.850> cut<00:03:25.850> away<00:03:25.940> some<00:03:26.359> of

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
looks like they have to cut away some of

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:34.930 
looks like they have to cut away some of
it<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:29.299> wheel<00:03:29.569> here<00:03:32.019> that's<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.319> bad<00:03:33.910> but<00:03:34.910> I

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
it this wheel here that's so bad but I

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.550 
it this wheel here that's so bad but I
don't<00:03:35.510> remember<00:03:35.750> which<00:03:36.019> one<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.380> wasn't

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
don't remember which one it wasn't

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.370 
don't remember which one it wasn't
leaked<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:37.280> I'm<00:03:37.400> imagining<00:03:38.170> possibly<00:03:39.170> this

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
leaked but I'm imagining possibly this

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.509 
leaked but I'm imagining possibly this
one<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.799> has<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.280> silicone<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:43.340> any

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
one that has the silicone on it in any

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.150 
one that has the silicone on it in any
way<00:03:43.760> I'm<00:03:44.030> thinking<00:03:44.900> about<00:03:45.319> going<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:45.739> tubes

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
way I'm thinking about going with tubes

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.309 
way I'm thinking about going with tubes
but<00:03:46.819> I<00:03:47.120> don't<00:03:47.599> know<00:03:47.750> if<00:03:47.840> there's<00:03:48.049> another

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
but I don't know if there's another

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.220 
but I don't know if there's another
safer<00:03:49.310> route<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:49.579> should<00:03:49.970> go<00:03:50.180> or<00:03:50.540> what<00:03:50.780> I've<00:03:50.989> got

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
safer route I should go or what I've got

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.569 
safer route I should go or what I've got
