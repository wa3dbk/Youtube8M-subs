00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.010 
notation art because you're dealing with
kids<00:02:03.890> you<00:02:04.340> know<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.729> this<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.450> only<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.720> step

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
from them going today shoka later so

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.060

turnover<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.670> everything<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:12.070> so

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
turnover and everything like that it so

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.090 
turnover and everything like that it so
happened<00:02:13.489> but<00:02:13.610> it's<00:02:13.760> not<00:02:13.940> really<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:15.170> problem

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
happened but it's not really a problem

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.830 
happened but it's not really a problem
as<00:02:16.520> far<00:02:16.550> as<00:02:16.850> rotation<00:02:17.360> there<00:02:17.510> instead<00:02:17.780> of

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
as far as rotation there instead of

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.900 
as far as rotation there instead of
rotation<00:02:18.350> actually<00:02:18.709> helps<00:02:19.130> though<00:02:19.760> with<00:02:19.880> the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
rotation actually helps though with the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.850 
rotation actually helps though with the
turnover<00:02:20.390> because<00:02:20.540> then<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.560> have<00:02:21.620> these

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
turnover because then you have these

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.320 
turnover because then you have these
people<00:02:22.160> come<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.489> you<00:02:22.610> have<00:02:22.730> student<00:02:23.090> second

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
train the new students and still be a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.000 
train the new students and still be a
rotation<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.330> they<00:02:26.780> can<00:02:26.959> still<00:02:27.200> learn<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.860> go

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
rotation and they can still learn and go

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.350 
rotation and they can still learn and go
and<00:02:28.250> you'll<00:02:28.370> learn<00:02:28.519> quicker<00:02:28.850> because<00:02:29.060> it's

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
and you'll learn quicker because it's

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.750 
and you'll learn quicker because it's
really<00:02:29.630> hands-on<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.519> don't<00:02:31.700> get

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
sent from the times for so that can

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.540 
sent from the times for so that can
improve<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.830> efficiency<00:03:02.200> what<00:03:03.200> could<00:03:03.410> not<00:03:03.590> at

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
improve the efficiency what could not at

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.440 
improve the efficiency what could not at
the<00:03:04.730> same<00:03:04.910> time<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.480> quality<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:07.450> probably

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
the same time the quality is probably

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.120 
the same time the quality is probably
not<00:03:08.750> as<00:03:09.050> good<00:03:09.380> because<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.740> have<00:03:09.920> people

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
not as good because you have people

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.260 
not as good because you have people
switching<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.910> lot<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:12.610> won't<00:03:13.610> or<00:03:13.970> could<00:03:14.240> be

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
switching a lot and won't or could be

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.540 
switching a lot and won't or could be
did<00:03:14.570> because<00:03:14.960> you<00:03:15.110> have<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.380> be

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
did because you have to be

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.040 
did because you have to be
double-checking<00:03:16.550> everything<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.390> yeah<00:03:17.570> yes

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
double-checking everything so yeah yes

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.740 
double-checking everything so yeah yes
and<00:03:18.260> no<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.890> same<00:03:19.130> comments<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:19.880> depends<00:03:20.300> and

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
and no the same comments it depends and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.680 
and no the same comments it depends and
it<00:03:20.900> was<00:03:21.110> employees<00:03:21.770> okay<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.910> what<00:03:23.480> changes

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
it was employees okay and what changes

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.900 
it was employees okay and what changes
of<00:03:24.020> any<00:03:24.200> would<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.680> like<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.460> apply<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.730> your

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
of any would you like to apply to your

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.570 
of any would you like to apply to your
job<00:03:26.120> location<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:26.810> would<00:03:27.770> say<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.400> should

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
job location I would say that it should

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.640 
job location I would say that it should
be<00:03:29.170> not<00:03:30.170> an<00:03:30.500> hour<00:03:30.800> but<00:03:31.580> if<00:03:32.140> necessarily<00:03:33.140> how<00:03:33.440> is

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
be not an hour but if necessarily how is

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.800 
be not an hour but if necessarily how is
so<00:03:33.800> more<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.580> say<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.450> would<00:03:35.570> be<00:03:35.660> better

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
so more of I say it would be better

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.710 
so more of I say it would be better
family<00:03:36.200> at<00:03:36.290> like<00:03:36.790> anywhere<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:38.120> two<00:03:38.270> weeks<00:03:38.480> to

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
family at like anywhere in two weeks to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.120 
family at like anywhere in two weeks to
a<00:03:38.750> month<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.320> Tom<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.860> separate

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
a month and a Tom and separate

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.890 
a month and a Tom and separate
departments<00:03:40.730> just<00:03:41.240> so<00:03:41.360> you<00:03:41.480> can<00:03:41.600> still<00:03:41.810> get

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
departments just so you can still get

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.410 
departments just so you can still get
the<00:03:42.020> same<00:03:42.050> rotation<00:03:42.770> going<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:44.240> that

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
the same rotation going and so that

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.820 
the same rotation going and so that
you're<00:03:44.570> not<00:03:44.600> stuck<00:03:45.050> in<00:03:45.200> one<00:03:45.290> department<00:03:45.410> for

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
you're not stuck in one department for

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.160 
you're not stuck in one department for
so<00:03:45.950> long<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.370> bore<00:03:46.610> with<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.390> then<00:03:47.900> you're

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
so long you bore with it and then you're

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.620 
so long you bore with it and then you're
not<00:03:48.320> in<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.130> problem<00:03:49.820> so<00:03:49.940> short<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.270> she<00:03:50.540> don't

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
not in a problem so short that she don't

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.030 
not in a problem so short that she don't
even<00:03:50.810> know<00:03:51.020> what's<00:03:51.200> going<00:03:51.260> on<00:03:51.560> when<00:03:51.770> you<00:03:51.890> come

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
even know what's going on when you come

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.940 
even know what's going on when you come
back<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.310> next<00:03:52.340> day<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.690> yeah<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:54.770> how<00:03:54.890> you

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
back the next day so yeah so how you

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.920 
back the next day so yeah so how you
