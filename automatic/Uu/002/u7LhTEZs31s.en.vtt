00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.566
- The people have spoken.

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.033
It's time to play
"What's in the Box?"

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:06.033
[cheers and applause]

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.566
All right, today's game
is Oscar-themed,

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.366
and we have some great prizes
to give away.

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.233
And what if I told you
that by the end of the game,

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.033
everyone in the audience
is gonna win a prize?

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:20.033
What if I--

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:23.233
[cheers and applause]

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:26.333
Who here has seen a movie
ever in their lifetime?

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.833
[cheers and applause]

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.133
What is your name?
- Russ.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.500
- Hi, Russ.
I'm Ellen.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.433
Nice to meet you.
- This is a privilege.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.533
- Oh, well--
- A privilege.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.200
- Where do you live?
both: Cerritos.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.766
- What do you do?
- Retired.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.433
Watch eight grandkids.
- Uh-huh.

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.200
Oh, wow.
So you need this.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.400
- Yeah, it's nice.
It's nice.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.300
- This is a nice break.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.633
You have
three choices there,

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:49.333
and we have--

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.200
- Number three, three.
- Oh, already.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.333
I don't even need
to say--

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.666
Wow.
Wait a minute.

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.833
- Oh, sorry.

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:57.300
- We're not talking
about the people.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.866
It's the box
that you're choosing.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.400
- Would you like
box number three?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.800
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.733
Well, he's already decided.
Let's see what box--

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.266
Oh, there's movies.

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.366
[cheers and applause]

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.300
All kinds of things.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.200
All the nominated movies.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.366
What else?

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.733
Is there anything else
back there

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:18.900
that goes with it?

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.000
- This Sony Blu-ray player.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.700
- It's a Blu-ray.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.166
Wonderful.
Anything else?

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:30.166
[cheers and applause]

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.966
- Thank you so much.
You're an inspiration.

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.366
- All right.
Thank you so much.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.566
What is your name?
- Lolita.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.666
- Lolita.
Where do you live?

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.733
[stammering]

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:43.733
[laughter]

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:44.733
- Vancouver, Canada.

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.000
- And what do you do there?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.166
- I sell Tupperware.
- Oh, good for you.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:51.166
[cheers and applause]

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.933
So we have Gomez

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:56.333
in front of--

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.833
No, let's call you Christian.
You're Christian.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.200
Christian is in front
of the curtain.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.300
Christian.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600
Yes, Christian.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.166
Anastasia is over there
in front of that curtain.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:12.166
Would you like what's behind
Christian or Anastasia?

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.533
- Christian.
- Yeah, Christian?

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.800
All right, let's see
what's there.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.533
[cheers and applause]

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:22.566
- Whoo!
Yes!

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:24.066
- That's not right.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:25.500
I don't--
I don't agree with that.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.266
Is there anything else
back there or just the bird?

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:29.533
What--

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:30.533
Oh!

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:34.366
[cheers and applause]

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:35.866
Lolita!

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:37.533
Hi, what's your name?
- I'm Janie!

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:39.133
- Janie, hi!
- Hi!

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:40.800
- How are you!
- I'm great!

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800
- Great!

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.600
[laughs and gasps]

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.500
- Oh.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.733
What do you do
for a living?

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.866
- I go to school.
- I see.

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:52.533
All right, Janie,
look, she didn't pick

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:54.066
what's behind
Anastasia there,

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:56.500
so I'm gonna give you
another chance.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.400
Somebody should pick
what's back there, right?

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.433
- Definitely.

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:00.900
- You don't really
have an option.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.066
It's just that, okay?

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:03.400
Let's see
what's back there.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.666
[harp glissando]

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:05.666
Oh!

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:08.766
[cheers and applause]

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:11.966
It's a Microsoft
Surface Pro 3 computer.

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:13.300
Congratulations.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.400
Hi.
- Hi, hi.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.233
- How's it going?
- I'm great.

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:17.833
How are you?
- You are with child.

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:19.833
- I am.
- And is this your first child?

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.000
- My second.
- Your second.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.966
How old is your other one?
both: 2 1/2.

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:24.466
- Wow, you're
gonna be busy.

00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:27.366
So let's just say
box number one--

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:29.366
Would you like
what's behind box number one

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:31.733
or box number two

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:33.200
or box number three?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.833
[harp glissando]

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:36.300
- I feel almost inclined
to choose one

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.366
'cause she's pregnant too.

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:38.366
- Yes.

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:39.700
[laughter]

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.333
- Oh, she's not pregnant.
- Oh.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.666
[laughter]

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:46.166
- She's pregnant.

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:47.566
All right.
- I'll take two.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:48.966
Two, two, two.
- Now, wait a minute.

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:50.066
She is pregnant.

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:51.400
[laughter]

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.333
Let's see what's behind
box number two.

00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:58.966
[cheers and applause]

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:01.233
- [speaking indistinctly]

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.900
- Thank you.
- That's all, right?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.333
There's nothing else
behind there.

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:07.766
It's just--
We move on, right?

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:09.433
Okay, just want
to make sure there's not--

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:10.433
Oh, $1,500--

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:13.433
[cheers and applause]

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.200
All right.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.233
So now I only have stuff
in my pants,

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:20.233
so would you like--

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:21.366
- Oh, my!

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:22.366
- So what would you like?

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:23.500
Would you
like what's

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.466
in my back left cheek
or my right cheek?

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:29.033
- Right might be my luckiest,
so I'll go with right.

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:31.800
- Right.
Okay, let me see.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.933
It's my library card.
- Yay!

00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:35.166
- Yay.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:37.133
You can go and get a book
or something like that,

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:38.933
but I felt something else
in there.

00:04:38.933 --> 00:04:40.866
Let me see
if it says something.

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:43.933
Hold on.
One second, please.

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:46.166
It says,
"Best Buy has expert service

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:47.300
"and unbeatable prices,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.900
"and all of these prizes
we've given away

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.266
"are available instore
and online and"--

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:53.466
Oh, I'm telling you this
because everybody's going home

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:55.300
with a $250 Best Buy
gift card.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.300
[cheers and applause]
