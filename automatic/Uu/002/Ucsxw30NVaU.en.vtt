00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.030
 hello if you have been ashamed for a long time 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.640
 we would probably already know that I hate 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.660
 cooked vegetables no but except by 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.710
 fire zucchini and here's a breakthrough 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.080
 yagyu cooked cauliflower still 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.540
 because I never bought then I 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.690
 did not eat the body something inedible and plus i 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.600
 thought it was broccoli what im 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.340
 cooked stumps profile and green 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.590
 if you are the same specialists and similar 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.510
 green I decided what was here 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.300
 go through a small program date axor and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 Now I'm in the middle and therefore the menu 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.800
 there was an arthur from broccoli which in 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 Basically it was not necessary to eat but I 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.340
 decided to find out and but such an experiment 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.920
 which by the way can read the plan 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.259
 the link will be under the video then I will not go until 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 the end, I made it puree and it turned out 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.440
 comfortable 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.600
 it actually wasn't just a discovery and 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.880
 delicious but the only thing I ate mashed 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.310
 from broccoli and cauliflower because 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.289
 I thought that this lesson was general 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.180
 today we cook two dishes at once 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.890
 now I'm not afraid of cauliflower she 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.289
 still raw very tasty too feared 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.569
 try by the way you can eat 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.200
 make you a dish of cauliflower puree 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:40.410
 and cauliflower roasted breaded and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.050
 so the most important thing is your broccoli a 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.369
 to cook you need to split oh not 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.259
 cauliflower jam 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.420
 I will call broking with the this 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.849
 carbon maniac about it in general the main thing 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.539
 it is to cook to cook we do not 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.940
 it's entirely 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.280
 need to be divided into inflorescences here 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.319
 that the water is heated now do not need 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.810
 divide it so immediately fail 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.810
 so you need to cut the head in half 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.370
 here and now just we start here on 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.870
 such inflorescences 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.880
 to share so that this cooked faster 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.830
 big thick stalks are immediately 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.780
 leave the water I boil a little of her 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.790
 salted and now we immerse our 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.080
 where cabbage 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.130
 half the cabbage we fry a 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.680
 half make mashed potatoes 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.200
 then after ten minutes 1 doormat need 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.990
 will get to the edge is not digested 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:44.350
 this is important the action has passed and now i'm 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:46.390
 extract exactly half of my cabbage 0 2 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.130
 same half we leave to cook yet 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.540
 5 10 minutes for mashed potatoes, we need as much as possible 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.490
 better and boil so that later it is easier 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.200
 bring down Yuri so here it will not be 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.230
 problems to digest a man so 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.870
 10 not enough until the cabbage cools me 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.420
 I will prepare breading for this to me 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.730
 will need 2 eggs you can use 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.090
 only squirrels if you are on a tough day 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.500
 merge the palace if the finish only squirrels 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:22.530
 naturally I need 4 laps and now I 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.530
 just fork a little folk nightmare 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.130
 it was dip cabbage now 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.040
 proper breading for breading 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.080
 wheat bran in principle can be any 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.710
 but I considered for breading using 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.710
 wheat 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.480
 spices I have here a set of spices mustard 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.950
 basil red pepper coriander 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.170
 what do you like mixing and 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.300
 dry herbs are very pasta add 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:59.840
 plan dry grass i have here 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:04:02.420
 bazing can be any prashechka hands counting 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.700
 on mix everything and now we will 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.300
 fry leg before fry 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:13.820
 and get the second half and leave 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:16.660
 cool then we will cook and so 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.150
 Now we are starting the actual plover 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.739
 best to fry share even if 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.750
 you don't divide earlier into smaller ones 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.630
 inflorescences to avoid large ones 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:32.570
 wolves are simple but not very easy 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:36.460
 divided now we raise this egg from 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.630
 I put the breading on the construction site 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.930
 frying pan before this i'm good 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.930
 warmed up not on a cold rolling pin 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.740
 as soon as we see that there is a crust 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.740
 double the whole then everything can be turned 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.040
 That is, in principle, no, they threw it 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.919
 You can always have an ipad periodically 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.160
 stir until you laugh when 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:25.070
 roasted the other side can all 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:27.020
 shoot yourself not everyone is already very happy here it is 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.500
 our intermediate result and continue 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.560
 step and so half of the head we cooked 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.770
 breaded your yuri is preparing even easier 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.139
 just take the other half of it all 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.510
 put in a blender and well 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:46.970
 thoroughly whisk to the state that 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:49.370
 so that in general there are no pieces left 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.970
 got one ok consistency by 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.139
 bloom 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:57.100
 the consistency I will not say that it 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:02.570
 It seems many say that there is no skin 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:05.389
 but it's filial even in your account I'm 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:09.160
 I will show you how to decorate it a little 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.160
 Tyrneta that we sat down for attention 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.600
 she after you love skating rinks 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.350

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:29.030

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:32.090

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.139
 minimum calories therefore must 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.530
 get cook buy heads 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.780
