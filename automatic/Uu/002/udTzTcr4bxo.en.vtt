00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 if for some reason you are not 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.370
 arrange droids have other technologies 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.620
 which allow not fully 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.840
 automate but seriously simplify 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.730
 cleaning the house set in his apartment 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.769
 central vacuum fun so 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.740
 let's say not cheap but 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.270
 no more filter changes no 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.000
 more bulky designs that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.760
 need to stick in the socket and most importantly no 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.859
 dust technology for many years and it is up 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.189
 ugliness just somewhere on the balcony 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.019
 there is such a bug on the wall 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 Here such a pipe goes plastic 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.480
 so that's going to zapravskaya from his knees 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.120
 variety of each room you put 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.320
 here is a pneumatic outlet where actually 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.930
 and stuck the hose of the vacuum cleaner 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 but there are 9 meters of plastic hose 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.699
 9 meters plus we have a bit too much 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.570
 take and stick we will not say 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.579
 trade here 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.539
 these vacuum cleaners but something i watch 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.930
 around yourself 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:07.229
 dirty I vacuum love attention 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.450
 turn on noise in me I really need 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.790
 vacuum cleaner hoses in the sockets are located 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.530
 contacts called for her which is a vacuum cleaner 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.299
 turns on if there is a hose 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.360
 switch can use it 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.710
 dust enters the power outlet comes to the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.369
 become 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.500
 small together from the air goes to the street 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.180
 that is, the concentration of dust in the air after 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.740
 cleaning will not increase 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.780
 and he also has a silencer here he is 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.950
 the vacuum cleaner doesn't sound louder than usual about 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.720
 60 decibels 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.549
 such a system can even be built into 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.170
 one-room apartment and not from the noise not 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.509
 neighbors will not suffer from vibrations 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.009
 Now the focus will show look good reason 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.070
 outlet is called pneumatic 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:52.659
 do not turn off the vacuum cleaner company 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.850
 separate element of the pneumatic scoop system 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.830
 if the garbage is on a little and locally 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.930
 just sweep all the broom closer to 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.930
 this gap and do not forget to turn off 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.729
 I turned off was not but the point is this 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.670
 imagine that there is such a vacuum cleaner 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.650
 standing in your basement in the garage or on 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.610
 the balcony from this apartment and it's quiet 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.860
 running collects dust and debris this one 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.450
 bug people who use these pluses 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.500
 they say that this is enough for a year and 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.180
 no filters are needed just 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.180
 comfortable not environmentally friendly
