Force is pushing the concept of the tank

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.490 
Force is pushing the concept of the tank
as<00:00:18.180> far<00:00:18.600> as<00:00:18.720> they<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:23.779> they<00:00:24.779> wanted<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> beef

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
up its armor and mobility so the answer

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.849 
up its armor and mobility so the answer
is<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.619> get<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.160> latest<00:00:29.490> technology<00:00:30.240> an

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
is to get the latest technology an

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.709 
is to get the latest technology an
