00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.059
 hello together and welcome 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.690
 in the aquarium 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:18.869
 I wanted you again today 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.630
 show my critic compress 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.480
 I'm not so sure about that, but me 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.180
 believe the meet easy preparations 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.689
 The female disappears very often 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:36.390
 There in the hidden coconut and 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:38.390
 the male here in front guards the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.640
 closer environment 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.430
 it is relatively inconspicuous though 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.770
 if, after all, an animal too 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:56.030
 close to this cave then weantraut 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:00.930
 it gets chased away in the cave 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:05.420
 Sometimes you can enter the entrance now 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.420
 but not exactly what they are 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:17.060
 head of the bitch see you get it 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.790
 also out now knows it so little 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.270
 Patrolled in the area gave to the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:30.190
 closer and attack occasionally 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:37.120
 get an international supposed 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.120
 enemy and that can see 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.890
 which follow the corner to the two 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:48.400
 it has already done a great deal of work 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.300
 Otherwise, maybe the reshuffle 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.530
 Young still floating inept young 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.100
 Maybe there is the female 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.510
 finally look again and get something 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.450
 outdated in the area and we are allowed 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.650
 There's probably a little bit of crappy too 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.060
 Do not go 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:17.550
 and that is the area of ​​the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:22.680
 aquarium something lax the female rat 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.680
 also happened once 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.349
 temporary female a very long in 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.090
 the cave 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.160
 somehow it looks like there are still 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.590
 always has a slight approach that is 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.540
 I do not think the animals are right now 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:46.140
 have already filed but usually not so 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.290
 just then the behavior closes then 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.450
 partly also again on a balance 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.150
 was just taking although then would 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.010
 probably not at some time 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.170
 More coming out of the cave is coming now 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.180
 she then always here again 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.540
 out that 's the smaller pair so 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.580
 not now couple what i'm right in 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.860
 area of ​​the basin has formed the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:16.830
 a little bigger but a bit later 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:20.069
 has found if that the couple with the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.200
 clear missing fins and 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.200
 locked drawings in the female 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.410
 look over it 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.410
 I sometimes is the other one 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:46.110
 are also quite peaceful together 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:51.210
 but so very general are more 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.610
 still undecided where they are then one 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.990
 want to set up dwelling 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.050
 sometimes here in the front area 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.420
 I made this cave Amazon and 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.170
 the pot with a stone plate something 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:13.410
 obscured for the opponents of the flower pot 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:18.830
 aquaristik and we behind but under 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:21.710
 this under this with which these masts 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.270
 I log in from the aquarium 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.520
 have previously laid properly watered 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.490
 They also decide often 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.030
 stop to stop 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.410
 in the middle area I would have one more 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.080
 Cocoon sunk there I had too 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.350
 Let it be laid on it so that's not the case 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.180
 sees echterdinger send next 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.180
 but that only happens so occasionally 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.150
 taken views 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.670
 meanwhile the coconut is spreading 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:56.730
 here is a run is also located 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:05:02.690
 looks a bit inconspicuous females when 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:05.160
 then it's right and then most of the time 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.870
 obliquely lies down on the 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.880
 page up now to also just 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:15.560
 Thank you very much for that and 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.180
 The little girl is just back 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.080
 on road 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.080
 yes so far first 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.900
 here from the aquarium and we will 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.350
 see how it goes on I hope that 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:37.139
 Then there are the offspring and me 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:40.600
 then maybe a couple of boys 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.590
 young fish do not suck off too many 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.970
 should also be a bit of breed care 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.990
 operate and be right back 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:50.560
 destroy camp and then I want 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:55.570
 also result from the pull large that I 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.419
 two couples have formed that one 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.820
 handy animals in the upper area 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.050
 the pool always swam around what he did 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.120
 was on it clicked that has 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.480
 I now put in another basin 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.020
 to fox fox that also has yesterday 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.570
 pretty much next to food and frost 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.430
 taken forage and moved a bit 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:22.590
 calmer now but so far only times 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.590
 all the best and goodbye
