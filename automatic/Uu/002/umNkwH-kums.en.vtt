your average jazz guitar where the neck

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.550 
your average jazz guitar where the neck
is<00:01:47.040> much<00:01:47.610> further<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:49.049> went<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
is much further you know they went that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.999 
is much further you know they went that
way<00:01:49.710> into<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> guitar<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.020> they

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
way into the guitar so so it's they

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.069 
way into the guitar so so it's they
probably<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:53.909> wanted<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> improve<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
probably really wanted to improve the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.590 
probably really wanted to improve the
idea<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.280> how<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.460> build<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.390> jazz

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
idea of you know how you build a jazz

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.260 
idea of you know how you build a jazz
guitar<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.920> never<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.399> caught<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
guitar but it never really caught on the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.719 
guitar but it never really caught on the
guitar<00:02:00.600> never<00:02:00.840> got<00:02:01.170> really<00:02:01.500> popular<00:02:01.729> because

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
guitar never got really popular because

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.420 
guitar never got really popular because
it's<00:02:02.960> well<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.409> differs<00:02:05.040> from<00:02:05.219> your

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
it's well it's it just differs from your

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.660 
it's well it's it just differs from your
average<00:02:05.790> look<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.750> jazz<00:02:07.110> guitar<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.770> think

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
average look of a jazz guitar I think

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.520 
average look of a jazz guitar I think
even<00:02:08.940> Barney<00:02:09.450> Kessel<00:02:09.599> didn't<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.410> too

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
even Barney Kessel didn't like it too

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.080 
even Barney Kessel didn't like it too
much<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
much but I like it

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.430 
much but I like it
because

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
because

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.860 
because
is<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.830> very<00:02:14.130> good<00:02:14.370> guitar<00:02:14.490> four<00:02:14.970> styles<00:02:15.690> in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
is a very good guitar four styles in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.170 
is a very good guitar four styles in
between<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.500> know<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.190> full<00:02:17.460> jazz<00:02:17.760> guitar

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
between you know it's a full jazz guitar

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.660 
between you know it's a full jazz guitar
it's<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.770> sit<00:02:20.040> comfortably<00:02:20.550> with

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
it's a you know you sit comfortably with

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
it's a you know you sit comfortably with
it<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.600> has<00:02:21.870> flat<00:02:22.320> wound<00:02:22.530> strings<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:25.680> you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
it it's has flat wound strings but you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.880 
it it's has flat wound strings but you
play<00:02:27.690> really<00:02:28.080> mellow<00:02:28.530> jazz<00:02:29.040> stuff<00:02:33.440> but<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.710> is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
play really mellow jazz stuff but it is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:49.040 
play really mellow jazz stuff but it is
also<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.550> good<00:02:35.790> funky<00:02:36.240> tar<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.900> even

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
also a good funky tar and you can even

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.370 
also a good funky tar and you can even
use<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.860> think<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.730> probably<00:02:51.380> behind

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
use it I think it's probably behind

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.790 
use it I think it's probably behind
certain<00:02:53.360> loudness<00:02:54.620> circumstances<00:02:55.620> it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
certain loudness circumstances it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.809 
certain loudness circumstances it
doesn't<00:02:56.010> work<00:02:56.130> anymore<00:02:56.340> but

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.970 

not<00:03:02.239> too<00:03:02.480> loud<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:03.319> a<00:03:03.409> pretty<00:03:03.590> good<00:03:03.769> rock

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
not too loud it's a pretty good rock

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.869 
not too loud it's a pretty good rock
guitar<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.930> think<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:07.099> deserves<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.819> be

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
guitar so I think it deserves to be

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.869 
guitar so I think it deserves to be
rediscovered<00:03:08.659> that's<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.069> 1967<00:03:10.069> Gibson

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
rediscovered that's the 1967 Gibson

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.699 
rediscovered that's the 1967 Gibson
