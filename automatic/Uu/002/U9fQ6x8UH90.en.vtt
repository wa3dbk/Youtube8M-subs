00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to all and welcome to our 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.240
 own point fr today i will you 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.389
 show how to solve your rubik's 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.750
 cube in four are in his 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.670
 lessons 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.840
 do not hesitate to press pause so 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.840
 to better take your time 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.769
 rugby was six faces we're going 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 name by letters for example here 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.830
 the face in front of you the green face 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.660
 is called the face f 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.290
 if i tell you f 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.120
 it will turn the face f 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.510
 a quarter turn in the direction of 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.379
 clockwise for example the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.910
 right phase here the red one will be the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.890
 phase of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.860
 if I tell you and it will be necessary 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.500
 turn the phase of a quarter turn into 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.239
 clockwise 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.650
 same for the left side which 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:02.030
 will be called the face I phase duo 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.030
 which will be called the h side 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.760
 the face of the bar which will be called the b side 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.880
 and the back side that will be called the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880
 in front of 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.460
 during lessons I will give you 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.159
 formulas that must be remembered parker 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.990
 which will allow you to solve the 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.789
 Rubik's Cube 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.020
 all movements are done in the 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.140
 clockwise 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.060
 unless the opposite is indicated by 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.920
 example if I tell you to reverse that 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.979
 will mean that it will take a quarter 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.490
 turn in the opposite direction of 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.490
 Clockwise 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:58.250
 then the rubik's cube has six faces 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.920
 so if it's important to know that 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.819
 centers determines the color of the face 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.509
 and he never moves then the 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:12.860
 rubik's cube also has a 12 stop 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:15.319
 and yes what the edges only has 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:26.269
 two faces of different colors 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:28.190
 while the corners we have 3 then 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.690
 once the rubik's cube and mix 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.880
 so the goal is going to be 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.430
 first of all to cross on 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.260
 one of the faces so I choose the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.910
 white face so with the white center 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.069
 so in the beginning you always have to try 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.120
 to fend for a little bit to 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:51.750
 find how 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.670
 replaced the sides to have a cross 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.450
 it's not very difficult just enough 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.780
 to look a little bit here 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.860
 so once we have our believe that we 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.610
 can see how it is here 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.190
 you do not have to deal with the corners so the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.069
 goal it's going to be align the stops so 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.180
 that is, in correspondence with the 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.380
 color centers here is for example 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.820
 here we have 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.820
 abel are all aligned obviously 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:40.379
 so for example here we can see 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:45.180
 of only two stops that are 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:48.299
 aligned so that means it means 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.249
 have to swap the other two for 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:56.879
 that it sets itself up with the centers of 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:04:00.389
 colors then in this case what we 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:03.450
 will do is we will put one of 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.340
 edges to us so one of the ridges that 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.780
 is not good and the other towards the 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.989
 right and then we make the formula 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.079
 right 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:19.910
 oo right reversed reversed right 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.599
 or reverse right inverted to reversed 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.099
 and here we can see that all the edges 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:29.789
 are well aligned with the centers 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:32.220
 red red towards orange orange and 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:38.099
 blue blue and we always see our 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:41.759
 cross who is who and well then the 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.880
 second mistake so it can be by 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.880
 example 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.860
 that the two edges that are not 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:56.089
 good is not the opposite 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.770
 here is for example here we have two stops 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:00.800
 who are good who are the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.909
 the una to the opposite of the other so this 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.360
 what we have to do now is 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:10.009
 to swap is also to make 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.800
 that what we are going to do is we will take 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.889
 the bad towards us and the other towards 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.039
 the outside made the first formula 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:24.860
 right to the right inverted or invert 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:29.419
 right to the right inverted then to 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:35.300
 reversed and there we will just try to 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:37.399
 turn up until you find the 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.499
 correspondence between two between two 

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:41.629
 centers for example here I have a small 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:44.659
 little turned and I found red red 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:48.379
 green green then we start again as in 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:50.479
 beginning we have to exchange his 2,6 and we 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.599
 redo the first formula right 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.439
 oo right reversed reversed right 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.889
 or reverse right inverted or inverted 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:03.030
 and so we see 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:06.710
 that our cross is perfect and that the 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.710
 edges are aligned with the centers
