Hi, guys! Finally, its here. The FINA World championships are taking off, the athletes are training at all the venues, and today, 1 day before the championships kick off, me and Marat Zakirov will give you a tour around FINA amusement park.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.940
The stand is constructed from production waste, it accumulates energy during the day, so you can charge your phone there.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:13.320
Planet Fitness, one of major Kazan 2015 partners, is going to encourage the public to join them for some group workouts and workshops in several popular types of fitness activities.
