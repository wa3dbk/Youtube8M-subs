00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.910 
up or go down I actually think they're
around<00:02:53.160> six<00:02:53.460> eighty<00:02:53.670> right<00:02:54.000> now<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:55.050> as<00:02:55.380> you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
around six eighty right now but as you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.040 
around six eighty right now but as you
can<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:56.370> not<00:02:56.550> too<00:02:57.030> great<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:57.630> it's

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
can see it's not too great but it's

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.440 
can see it's not too great but it's
decent<00:02:58.770> if<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.220> don't<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.730> any<00:02:59.940> money<00:03:00.150> and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
decent if you don't have any money and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.520 
decent if you don't have any money and
you<00:03:00.510> pretty<00:03:00.750> much<00:03:00.840> have<00:03:01.050> new<00:03:01.200> skills

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
you pretty much have new skills

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.950 
you pretty much have new skills
whatsoever<00:03:02.270> alright<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:03.450> if<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.660> don't<00:03:03.810> have

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
whatsoever alright so if you don't have

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.170 
whatsoever alright so if you don't have
70<00:03:04.380> agility<00:03:04.680> but<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.220> 16<00:03:05.640> dungeoneering

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
70 agility but you have 16 dungeoneering

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.790 
70 agility but you have 16 dungeoneering
you<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.600> use<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.870> resource<00:03:07.230> dungeon<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.710> the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
you can use the resource dungeon in the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.650 
you can use the resource dungeon in the
Blue<00:03:07.950> Dragon<00:03:08.370> section<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.850> terribly<00:03:09.240> dungeon

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
Blue Dragon section of terribly dungeon

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.140 
Blue Dragon section of terribly dungeon
although<00:03:10.380> without<00:03:10.860> 70<00:03:11.280> agility<00:03:11.580> you're<00:03:11.850> going

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
although without 70 agility you're going

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.850 
although without 70 agility you're going
to<00:03:12.240> be<00:03:12.390> wasting<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.020> lot<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.200> time<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.560> around

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
to be wasting a lot of time going around

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.410 
to be wasting a lot of time going around
the<00:03:13.980> dungeon<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.730> can<00:03:14.850> still<00:03:15.030> pick<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.270> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
the dungeon you can still pick up the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.090 
the dungeon you can still pick up the
scales<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.930> decent<00:03:16.290> amount<00:03:16.350> faster<00:03:16.950> because

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
scales a decent amount faster because

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.860 
scales a decent amount faster because
they're<00:03:17.400> around<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.850> circle<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.420> there<00:03:18.810> are

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
they're around in a circle and there are

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.380 
they're around in a circle and there are
a<00:03:18.900> lot<00:03:19.020> easier<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.530> pick<00:03:19.710> up<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.760> trip<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.150> did

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
a lot easier to pick up the trip I did

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.690 
a lot easier to pick up the trip I did
without<00:03:21.690> using<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.140> shortcut<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.800> got<00:03:23.340> four

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
without using the shortcut I got four

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.150 
without using the shortcut I got four
minutes<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.060> 45<00:03:24.420> seconds<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.230> like<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.410> said<00:03:25.470> 15

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
minutes and 45 seconds so like I said 15

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.680 
minutes and 45 seconds so like I said 15
seconds<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:26.610> don't<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.910> each<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.270> them<00:03:27.390> in<00:03:27.540> case

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
seconds I don't to each of them in case

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.510 
seconds I don't to each of them in case
you're<00:03:27.840> faster<00:03:28.170> or<00:03:28.290> slower<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:29.100> averages<00:03:29.490> out

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
you're faster or slower it averages out

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.690 
you're faster or slower it averages out
to<00:03:29.670> about<00:03:29.850> 3<00:03:30.240> 15<00:03:30.390> 2<00:03:30.750> 325<00:03:31.380> k<00:03:31.740> an<00:03:31.860> hour<00:03:31.980> which<00:03:32.520> is<00:03:32.670> a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
to about 3 15 2 325 k an hour which is a

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.000 
to about 3 15 2 325 k an hour which is a
lot<00:03:32.940> better<00:03:33.120> than<00:03:33.420> what<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.660> was<00:03:33.690> without<00:03:34.200> set

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
lot better than what it was without set

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.710 
lot better than what it was without set
or<00:03:35.190> without<00:03:35.400> 60<00:03:35.730> Dungeoneering<00:03:36.209> but<00:03:36.600> it's

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
or without 60 Dungeoneering but it's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.870 
or without 60 Dungeoneering but it's
still<00:03:36.870> not<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.140> best<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.770> get<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.550> if<00:03:38.730> you

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
still not the best you can get so if you

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.730 
still not the best you can get so if you
have<00:03:39.090> 70<00:03:39.480> agility<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.020> don't<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.350> 60

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
have 70 agility but you don't have 60

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.710 
have 70 agility but you don't have 60
Dungeoneering<00:03:41.340> it's<00:03:41.730> actually<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.240> pretty

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
Dungeoneering it's actually a pretty

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.840 
Dungeoneering it's actually a pretty
good<00:03:42.810> bit<00:03:43.110> faster<00:03:43.650> if<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:43.890> don't<00:03:44.100> have<00:03:44.310> 70

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
good bit faster if you don't have 70

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.490 
good bit faster if you don't have 70
agility<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.450> have<00:03:45.600> six<00:03:45.840> ood<00:03:45.959> engineering

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
agility but you have six ood engineering

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.710 
agility but you have six ood engineering
you<00:03:47.370> can<00:03:47.490> use<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.760> shortcut<00:03:47.790> which<00:03:48.360> takes<00:03:48.630> you

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
you can use the shortcut which takes you

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.570 
you can use the shortcut which takes you
right<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.440> dungeon<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.280> don't<00:03:50.459> waste

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
right to the dungeon so you don't waste

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.490 
right to the dungeon so you don't waste
any<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.150> time<00:03:51.420> going<00:03:51.690> around<00:03:51.900> heavily

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
any of that time going around heavily

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.010 
any of that time going around heavily
dungeon<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:53.670> actually<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.450> makes<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.870> big

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
dungeon so it's actually it makes a big

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.680 
dungeon so it's actually it makes a big
difference<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.680> figured<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.790> out<00:03:56.910> my<00:03:57.450> trip<00:03:57.660> was

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
difference I figured it out my trip was

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.140 
difference I figured it out my trip was
four<00:03:58.050> minutes<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.440> five<00:03:58.620> seconds<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.730> about

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
four minutes and five seconds so about

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150 
four minutes and five seconds so about
four<00:04:00.480> minutes<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.959> or<00:04:01.200> four<00:04:01.560> minutes<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.860> 15

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
four minutes and or four minutes and 15

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.880 
four minutes and or four minutes and 15
seconds<00:04:02.610> per<00:04:03.000> trip<00:04:03.270> and<00:04:03.989> averages<00:04:04.709> out<00:04:04.830> to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
seconds per trip and averages out to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.060 
seconds per trip and averages out to
about<00:04:05.070> 390<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.060> 405<00:04:06.660> k<00:04:06.900> an<00:04:07.050> hour<00:04:07.170> which<00:04:07.830> is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
about 390 to 405 k an hour which is

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.460 
about 390 to 405 k an hour which is
definitely<00:04:08.459> better<00:04:09.060> than<00:04:09.209> what<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:09.959> has<00:04:10.080> been

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
definitely better than what it has been

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.530 
definitely better than what it has been
but<00:04:10.980> it's<00:04:11.070> still<00:04:11.340> not<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.730> best<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.239> can<00:04:12.360> get

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
but it's still not the best you can get

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.910 
but it's still not the best you can get
all<00:04:12.989> right<00:04:13.110> now<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.500> where<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.709> get<00:04:13.800> the

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
all right now this is where you get the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.130 
all right now this is where you get the
most<00:04:14.070> out<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.340> Blue<00:04:14.580> Dragon<00:04:14.940> skills<00:04:15.180> with<00:04:15.690> 70

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
most out of Blue Dragon skills with 70

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.140 
most out of Blue Dragon skills with 70
agility<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.770> 60<00:04:17.220> Dungeoneering<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.940> time

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
agility and 60 Dungeoneering the time

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.699 
agility and 60 Dungeoneering the time
there's<00:04:18.359> so<00:04:18.570> much<00:04:18.720> quicker<00:04:18.989> because<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.560> can

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
there's so much quicker because you can

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.720 
there's so much quicker because you can
just<00:04:19.739> go<00:04:19.980> right<00:04:20.160> through<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.489> agility

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
just go right through the agility

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.490 
just go right through the agility
shortcut<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.540> then<00:04:21.930> right<00:04:22.140> into<00:04:22.290> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
shortcut and then right into the
