 the signal sos from the board did not yield to those 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.790
 less part of the sailors managed to wear

 the edges of this version of the collision from the ice 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.170
 now one of the main investigators

 ship wreck became drifting ice floe 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.200
 the question is what was it 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.180

 fully functional now check it 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.420
 Investigators from shipowners removed all

 trawler sank from a hole means it 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.710
 states in fact was far from 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.110
 ideally the investigators will 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.540
 work out another version of the error 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.730
