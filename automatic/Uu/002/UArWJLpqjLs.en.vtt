that<00:03:44.159> you<00:03:44.310> want<00:03:44.519> because<00:03:45.290> well<00:03:46.290> let's<00:03:46.319> face<00:03:46.590> it

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
that you want because well let's face it

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.250 
that you want because well let's face it
when<00:03:47.340> you're<00:03:47.519> rolling<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.120> evade<00:03:48.720> dice<00:03:48.930> on<00:03:49.200> a

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
when you're rolling the evade dice on a

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.589 
when you're rolling the evade dice on a
cloaked<00:03:49.680> ship<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:50.190> likelihood<00:03:50.909> that<00:03:51.150> what

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
cloaked ship the likelihood that what

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.030 
cloaked ship the likelihood that what
actually<00:03:52.019> ends<00:03:52.200> up<00:03:52.319> hitting<00:03:52.470> your<00:03:52.680> ship<00:03:52.830> is<00:03:53.010> a

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
actually ends up hitting your ship is a

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.509 
actually ends up hitting your ship is a
critical<00:03:53.879> attack<00:03:54.360> like<00:03:54.659> attack<00:03:55.140> is<00:03:55.519> pretty

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
critical attack like attack is pretty

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.259 
critical attack like attack is pretty
high<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:57.090> so<00:03:57.540> having<00:03:58.099> this<00:03:59.099> particular<00:03:59.970> card

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
high and so having this particular card

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.479 
high and so having this particular card
to<00:04:00.599> nullify<00:04:01.230> those<00:04:01.650> effects<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.340> actually

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
to nullify those effects and to actually

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.940 
to nullify those effects and to actually
repair<00:04:02.849> a<00:04:02.909> hole<00:04:03.150> that's<00:04:03.840> super<00:04:04.439> awesome<00:04:04.470> I'm<00:04:04.890> a

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
repair a hole that's super awesome I'm a

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.520 
repair a hole that's super awesome I'm a
really<00:04:05.430> huge<00:04:05.549> fan<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.239> if<00:04:06.569> I<00:04:06.840> was<00:04:07.349> like

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
really huge fan of it and if I was like

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.170 
really huge fan of it and if I was like
a<00:04:07.560> Klingon<00:04:07.890> player<00:04:08.189> which<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.640> happened<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.030> be

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
a Klingon player which I happened to be

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.570 
a Klingon player which I happened to be
I<00:04:09.360> was<00:04:09.870> I'd<00:04:10.470> say<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.340> car<00:04:11.549> that

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
I was I'd say that this is the car that

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.979 
I was I'd say that this is the car that
you<00:04:11.849> would<00:04:11.939> want<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.239> entire<00:04:12.480> booster<00:04:12.840> for

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
you would want this entire booster for

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.080 
you would want this entire booster for
like<00:04:13.439> the<00:04:13.530> other<00:04:13.680> stuff<00:04:13.920> is<00:04:14.010> okay<00:04:14.159> but<00:04:14.730> this<00:04:14.879> is

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
like the other stuff is okay but this is

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.490 
like the other stuff is okay but this is
the<00:04:15.180> card<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.480> actually<00:04:16.019> adds<00:04:16.169> something

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
the card that actually adds something

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.640 
the card that actually adds something
very<00:04:17.220> very<00:04:17.549> important<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.570> Klingons<00:04:18.900> for

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
very very important to the Klingons for

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.280 
very very important to the Klingons for
this<00:04:19.919> current<00:04:20.400> Borg<00:04:21.150> heavy<00:04:21.449> meta<00:04:21.780> okay

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
this current Borg heavy meta okay

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.140 
this current Borg heavy meta okay
so<00:04:22.650> let's<00:04:23.010> actually<00:04:23.250> talk<00:04:23.730> about<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
so let's actually talk about the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.510 
so let's actually talk about the
30-point<00:04:24.600> build<00:04:24.870> out<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.260> this<00:04:25.500> box<00:04:25.890> because

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
30-point build out of this box because

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.640 
30-point build out of this box because
ultimately<00:04:27.420> you<00:04:27.750> do<00:04:27.870> have<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.200> build<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.500> ship

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
ultimately you do have to build a ship

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.600 
ultimately you do have to build a ship
out<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:28.950> box<00:04:29.100> if<00:04:29.280> you're<00:04:29.370> going<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.520> be

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
out of this box if you're going to be

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.040 
out of this box if you're going to be
playing<00:04:29.790> with<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.180> something<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.570> add<00:04:30.750> into

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
playing with it something to add into

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
playing with it something to add into
your<00:04:31.110> list<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:32.310> would<00:04:32.790> probably<00:04:33.090> take

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
your list and I would probably take

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.340 
your list and I would probably take
these<00:04:35.070> cards<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.850> build<00:04:36.180> my<00:04:36.330> 30<00:04:36.540> point<00:04:36.810> list<00:04:37.080> I

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
these cards to build my 30 point list I

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.070 
these cards to build my 30 point list I
would<00:04:37.770> take<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.280> named<00:04:38.640> captain<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.360> course<00:04:39.840> I

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
would take the named captain of course I

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.840 
would take the named captain of course I
would<00:04:40.410> take<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.590> tech<00:04:41.070> upgrade<00:04:41.580> which<00:04:41.730> is

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
would take that tech upgrade which is

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.970 
would take that tech upgrade which is
super<00:04:42.150> freaking<00:04:42.930> awesome<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.740> would<00:04:43.860> take

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
super freaking awesome and I would take

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.890 
super freaking awesome and I would take
the<00:04:44.130> unnamed<00:04:44.400> ship<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.790> I<00:04:44.970> usually<00:04:45.690> take

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
the unnamed ship and I usually take

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.170 
the unnamed ship and I usually take
unnamed<00:04:46.410> ships<00:04:46.740> when<00:04:46.950> I<00:04:46.980> play<00:04:47.190> Klingons<00:04:47.610> to

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
unnamed ships when I play Klingons to

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.670 
unnamed ships when I play Klingons to
begin<00:04:48.480> with<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.260> kind<00:04:49.470> of<00:04:49.530> no

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
begin with and this is kind of no

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.890 
begin with and this is kind of no
exception<00:04:50.100> because<00:04:50.250> when<00:04:50.940> I've<00:04:51.060> got<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.390> two

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
exception because when I've got the two

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.540 
exception because when I've got the two
points<00:04:51.930> if<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.500> have<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:52.800> literally<00:04:53.190> look<00:04:53.430> at

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
points if I have to literally look at

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.490 
points if I have to literally look at
two<00:04:53.700> points<00:04:53.940> I'm<00:04:54.780> not<00:04:55.020> going<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.230> use<00:04:55.350> the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
two points I'm not going to use the

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.790 
two points I'm not going to use the
extra<00:04:55.770> shield<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:56.750> there<00:04:57.750> aren't<00:04:58.140> that<00:04:58.740> many

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
extra shield and there aren't that many

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.220 
extra shield and there aren't that many
red<00:04:59.490> maneuvers<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.390> I<00:05:00.420> would<00:05:00.660> really<00:05:01.050> need

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
red maneuvers that I would really need

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.040 
red maneuvers that I would really need
to<00:05:01.470> use<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:02.910> get<00:05:03.030> out<00:05:03.120> of<00:05:03.150> type<00:05:03.420> of<00:05:03.570> spot<00:05:03.810> I

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
to use to get out of type of spot I

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.620 
to use to get out of type of spot I
would<00:05:04.290> much<00:05:04.320> rather<00:05:05.030> be<00:05:06.030> in<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.210> position<00:05:06.360> to

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
would much rather be in a position to

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.950 
would much rather be in a position to
sensor<00:05:07.320> echo<00:05:07.620> with<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.860> Klingon<00:05:08.220> ship<00:05:08.570> then<00:05:09.570> to

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
sensor echo with a Klingon ship then to

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.290 
sensor echo with a Klingon ship then to
take<00:05:10.770> another<00:05:10.980> red<00:05:11.220> maneuver<00:05:11.640> again<00:05:11.850> so<00:05:12.120> let

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
take another red maneuver again so let

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.730 
take another red maneuver again so let
me<00:05:12.390> know<00:05:12.510> in<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.630> comments<00:05:13.050> below<00:05:13.170> what<00:05:13.290> you

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
me know in the comments below what you

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.260 
me know in the comments below what you
think<00:05:13.950> of<00:05:14.070> this<00:05:14.190> box<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:14.760> what<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.060> think<00:05:15.150> of

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
think of this box and what you think of

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.670 
think of this box and what you think of
my<00:05:15.390> faith<00:05:15.660> my<00:05:15.750> build<00:05:16.080> would<00:05:16.320> you<00:05:16.380> build<00:05:16.560> it

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
my faith my build would you build it

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.220 
my faith my build would you build it
differently<00:05:17.040> I<00:05:17.280> i<00:05:17.760> feel<00:05:18.450> like<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.840> try<00:05:19.170> to

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
differently I i feel like the try to

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.340 
differently I i feel like the try to
intermix<00:05:20.220> is<00:05:20.460> like<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:21.330> right<00:05:21.540> way<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:21.750> go<00:05:21.840> but

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
intermix is like the right way to go but

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.620 
intermix is like the right way to go but
maybe<00:05:22.980> you<00:05:23.190> disagree<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.330> should<00:05:24.510> be

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
maybe you disagree and I should be
