00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.390
 made our first n79 also 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.410
 naturally derived from the model 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.129
 n78 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.460

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.280

 98cento to be precise 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.379
 let's see the features of the phone starting from the display that ages 2, 4 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.379
 inch qvga in fact will have a resolution of 2 40 for 3 20 the classic

 good sound but not excellent 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.770
 the writing nocchia is no longer under the screen but now on the right 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.379
 even the cover as you can see just a little leap as if I were 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.110
 in tap 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.910
 the same that we find also on this part where there is the key to go 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 within the multimedia menu 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.630

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.030
 a little 'little ones but surely they are easily crushed you do not run into 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.920
 the problem of crushing the two lower keys 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.380
 the keyboard is completely flat 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.049
 large numbers and well written 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.350
 unfortunately, however, the central lines give some problems in fact in the phase of 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.549

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.440
 comfortable the door, however, this has brought 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.550
 having to change slightly 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.739
 the body 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.739
 and this part is in fact a bit in relief 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.279
 on the left side of the phone we find 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.219
 a door that protects 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.099
 the micro sd card slot in the package should be present one 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.299
 from 4 giga bytes 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.299

00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:01.749
 power-off button once the cooler phone has been released 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.189
 which has a peculiarity we find the 6f bl battery 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.090
 the same present on the noki n95 8 giga 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.629

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.559
 to arrive comfortably at the end of the day 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:20.029
 the back covers are interchangeable we don't have two on the white one a red one 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.740
 example by entering 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.629
 red lace you say a theme 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:30.629
 that was the one related to the previous cover so you blue 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.259
 now inserting the red cover 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.410
 thank you purchases xp 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.499

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:41.309
 let's see if I can show myself 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:44.309

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.830
 as you can see it automatically turns red 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.479
 so even with the white cover 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:03.059
 nocchia then returns to the interchangeable covers 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.370
 this model 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.990
 It is a GSM quad-band with gprs gel connectivity 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.189
 mantovani tsh hsdpa 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.429

 also the dual fare on board 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.769
 the ugly 2. 0 so no problem with stereo wireless headphones 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.990
 GPS for GPS assisted navigation 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.440
 if used as a satellite navigator we suggest this phone 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.430
 to buy a car charger because 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.449

 we also find the fm radio 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.379
 the fm transmitter there is the possibility of using this 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.469
 phone as a fm source 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:57.370
 audio 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.589
 so romantic and we are in the car is possible 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.580

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.139
 mp3 that we have on the phone through this system directly on the radio 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.139
 car 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.240
