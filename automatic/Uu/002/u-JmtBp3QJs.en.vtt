00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.360
 Hey, you there. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.140
 In this episode, I'll tell you 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.820
 how prepositions FROM and TO are used. 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.120
 Or... 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.080
 FROM means you come from something - 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.800
 and TO stands for three ... 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.540
 I mean, TO means you go to something. 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.640
 Do you understand that? 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 Superhanns, welcome. 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.740
 Thank you, it's fun to be here. 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.920
 Where do you come from? 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.380
 Well, right now I'm coming from the shower 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.540
 because I had to fight the lemu man, 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.220
 whose spirit smelled to evil. 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.700
 Approximately I come from the LOL-2 planet. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.740
 It is somewhere in the universe. 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.400
 Wait a minute. 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.040
 Hello. 

00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:04.522
 Hey, leave me alone, thank you. 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.160
 Sorry about that. It was my crazy neighbor. 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.980
 What's your neighbor? 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.080
 Well, he's a crazy woman from southern China ... 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.280
 what I understand makes her a Japanese ... 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.520
 Well, in any case he always fights - 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.940
 with a mad German teacher coming from Jokela. 

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:30.031
 He's a full lane head. 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.080
 Unlike, of course, of course ... 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.100
 Kerropas, Superhanns, 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.940
 where are you going next? 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.340
 Well, I have to go to three places next. 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.680
 Number one. 

00:03:15.957 --> 00:03:17.777
 I have to go to Africa - 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.560
 Fight with endless lions. 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.640
 Why? 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.769
 I'm not sure. 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.400
 Number two. 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.540
 Mun must go to the supermarket - 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.340
 because milk is out. 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.540
 And number three? 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.260
 Number three? 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.400
 Black feels like I have to get to the bathroom.
