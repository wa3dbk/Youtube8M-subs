00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello today we will do together 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.969
 a vegetable juice recipe 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.309
 more precisely what is called a seen 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.780
 green why a judge towards what there is 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.420
 a lot of food so to 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.480
 today we are going to use spinach 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.640
 that you have here so there spinach I 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.289
 make them a little wet it's not bad 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.660
 all the while the idea of ​​soaking the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.010
 foods if they are a little old you 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.179
 soak them in water for 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.489
 ten minutes 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.160
 it will rehydrate them 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.520
 part of revitalizing so the extraction 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.410
 will be even better then we will 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.590
 also serve as celery branch 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.820
 I would take I think two branches 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.860
 a few spinach leaves we go 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.690
 also take the carrots one to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 two carrots or the quantities it's not 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.719
 Very important 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.340
 a little bit of apples we will take 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.050
 also turmeric here fresh and then 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.899
 a little ginger 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.270
 so that's a little bit the how 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.240
 tell the superfoods the foods with 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.299
 a lot of qualities for you in 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.340
 term of anti oxidants and so they 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.350
 will come fragrant to decorate your juice 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.880
 you can also put a heap 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 other things like herbs 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.000
 fresh parsley why not to you 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.090
 to actually see according to your 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.150
 needs and especially your tastes so we 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.890
 will see also the cutting of these 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.619
 foods that is important for 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.670
 really make a juice of the best 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.670
 quality that is so I take two 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.560
 celery stalks that will be fine 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.720
 so my celery stalks would have 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.470
 tendency to put them like this then 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.290
 that in fact it's better compared to 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.810
 the mechanics of your device whose 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.990
 life turns like these make one of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.570
 coarse groups of his branches of 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.939
 celery make some stumps that you 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.450
 reduce like this it's pretty much 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.790
 we will say 4 5 cm and where put by 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.990
 handles so in the machine 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.390
 I take my handle like this is so 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.000
 it's much more ideal to cut them out 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.920
 than to put the branch in between them 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.080
 it's much more adapted you will see 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.290
 the yield will be better the quality of the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.060
 juice will be better so after having 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.070
 inserted into the device a food 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.930
 extremely fibrous like celery 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.150
 branch you see the long fiber like 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.730
 this the idea is to alternate with 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.050
 something like a carrot or a 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.980
 apple that is so harder with a 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.980
 different consistency 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.730
 one food after the other anyway 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:54.630
 because here we have roots 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.400
 it's pretty hard we'll take the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.690
 spinach 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.569
 so spinach I take a nice 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.819
 handle a nice handle that's good 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.370
 after soaking what I advise you 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.769
 to do here is to give a small 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.780
 stab in spinach all 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:14.340
 just once again the idea being 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.830
 to break the length of fibers and 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.110
 I introduce my handful of spinach to 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.530
 inside so here as you see it 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:27.090
 I use my hands but obviously you 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.519
 have your pusher available here 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.310
 precisely for foods like 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.560
 pinard who are very light accompanied 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.660
 the descent like this which is 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.970
 absolutely not necessary when 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.319
 the food is a bit heavier for 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.760
 accompany the spinach I'm going 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.040
 just add some carrots 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.819
 so to speak precisely of cutting 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.280
 carrot 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.290
 here the carrot is quite thick as 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.940
 you see it about 2 cm we're going 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.209
 cut so in length to 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.760
 refine and avoid putting on too much 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.110
 important the root is in extremely 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.780
 hard as you know 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.220
 the carrot here is going to entail so the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.900
 spinach it's very interesting in 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:14.020
 technical terms of alternating between 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.670
 leaves and more things more 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.680
 consistent like the carrot you see 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.000
 the carrot will lead 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.510
 spinach we will continue with always 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.740
 a little bit of celery branch as I 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.720
 you show it is at doll time 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.490
 incoming are a nice handle and we 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:37.150
 follow like these the apple is 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.630
 ideal to mix with each of your juices 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.550
 vegetables 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.430
 if you want to put something 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.200
 a little too sweet of course 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.419
 so the apple is cut in general to 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.950
 half or even four times 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.690
 you can even pass your apples in 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.050
 whole why not that will depend on 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.810
 their size of course so I put 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.310
 my apple taste 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.280
 so see how easy I 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.320
 realize my idea juice here what me 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.090
 actually allows this facility to 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.120
 realization of judges this is the broad 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.510
 mouthpiece 9 cm in diameter that's it 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.940
 exceptional at q vince and so that's 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.800
 unpublished elsewhere and indeed the 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.770
 engine power is going to be extremely 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.710
 important to support the width of 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.320
 sludge that is inserted into the device 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.390
 so let's add a little bit with the 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.950
 turmeric I like a lot of turmeric 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.540
 so really does it according to your 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.729
 taste me I put a little bit 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.970
 like those ginger 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.070
 I like them a lot but not either 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.410
 more than that since the tip is very 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.300
 very strong that's already a lot 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.880
 after you to judge again 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.260
 it's a matter of taste 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.970
 so I let you appreciate it anyway 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.920
 the amount of juice that we could do in 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.110
 a few minutes very quickly we have 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.000
 here more than 500 minutes of juice you 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.480
 see here 400 milliliters we are well 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.960
 beyond 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:00.460
 and that's the two three minutes we have 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.770
 a huge amount of juice here if you 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.870
 want to make more juice just 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.580
 leave the cap open so that the 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.980
 juice it's cool you can do as much 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.630
 quantity you want it 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.030
 close the cap to avoid 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.510
 the flow of drops on the plane of 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.230
 job 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:20.260
 turn off the machine and enjoy yourself 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.850
 have the fiber on this side as you 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.640
 see the fiber is dry 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.770
 we clearly see the fiber of 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.470
 food here there is no longer any judge 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.930
 this fiber is devoid of interest 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.630
 nutritional the purpose of the machine 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.300
 actually it is to dissociate 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.310
 minerals vitamins and serves for 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.950
 fibers so here you only have the 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.290
 fiber and this side you so 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.290
 all the minerals the vitamins the 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.470
 all nutrients preserved by 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.980
 the cold extraction quality 60 rounds 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.290
 minute 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.150
 so we do not hesitate to use his 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.180
 device every day to get re 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.980
