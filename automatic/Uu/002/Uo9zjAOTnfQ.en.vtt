00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
hours of ending and then I come back and

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.819 
hours of ending and then I come back and
I<00:04:09.130> try<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.610> win<00:04:10.150> at<00:04:10.390> least<00:04:10.510> 15<00:04:11.049> of<00:04:11.410> them<00:04:11.620> and
