I think Dick Grayson wants to take a
person<00:01:16.280> like<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:16.970> basically<00:01:17.210> they're<00:01:17.450> trying

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
to say that in Batman eternal I think is

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.940 
to say that in Batman eternal I think is
that<00:01:19.760> comic<00:01:20.120> a<00:01:20.300> new<00:01:20.780> character<00:01:21.200> is<00:01:21.620> going<00:01:21.830> to

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
that comic a new character is going to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.700 
that comic a new character is going to
be<00:01:22.130> coming<00:01:22.820> back<00:01:22.940> in<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.510> Batman<00:01:24.200> family<00:01:24.590> this

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
be coming back in the Batman family this

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.590 
be coming back in the Batman family this
isn't<00:01:25.070> Stephanie<00:01:25.400> Brown<00:01:25.520> another<00:01:26.060> character

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
isn't Stephanie Brown another character

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.630 
isn't Stephanie Brown another character
and<00:01:27.110> what<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.380> think<00:01:27.470> is<00:01:27.680> going<00:01:27.860> on<00:01:28.040> is<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:28.310> is

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
and what I think is going on is this is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.250 
and what I think is going on is this is
going<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:28.910> be<00:01:29.000> Dick<00:01:29.270> Grayson<00:01:29.720> taking<00:01:30.050> up<00:01:30.170> a

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
going to be Dick Grayson taking up a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.290 
going to be Dick Grayson taking up a
different<00:01:30.710> manner<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:31.460> think<00:01:31.910> he's<00:01:32.030> going<00:01:32.180> to

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
different manner I think he's going to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.390 
different manner I think he's going to
have<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.570> new<00:01:32.870> disguise<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.650> isn't<00:01:34.040> Nightwing

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
have a new disguise that isn't Nightwing

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.940 
have a new disguise that isn't Nightwing
I<00:01:34.640> think<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.270> Grayson<00:01:35.720> is<00:01:36.260> still<00:01:36.560> gonna<00:01:36.710> stay

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
I think the Grayson is still gonna stay

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.180 
I think the Grayson is still gonna stay
alive<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.930> bit<00:01:38.930> Nightwing's<00:01:39.320> dead<00:01:39.590> but<00:01:39.980> Dick

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
alive and bit Nightwing's dead but Dick

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.680 
alive and bit Nightwing's dead but Dick
Grayson<00:01:40.580> will<00:01:40.700> take<00:01:40.850> up<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.060> different<00:01:41.360> mantle

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
Grayson will take up a different mantle

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.140 
Grayson will take up a different mantle
as<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.870> different<00:01:42.410> hero<00:01:42.590> name<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.730> different

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
as a different hero name a different

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.610 
as a different hero name a different
person<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.510> don't<00:01:44.750> know<00:01:44.870> who<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:45.260> could<00:01:45.320> be

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620

yet<00:01:45.860> but<00:01:46.550> I<00:01:46.760> thought<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.030> was<00:01:47.270> pretty

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
that's pretty stupid them to kill off

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.429 
that's pretty stupid them to kill off
the<00:02:54.439> Grayson<00:02:55.069> but<00:02:55.849> it's<00:02:56.299> not<00:02:56.480> stupid<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:57.109> kill

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
the Grayson but it's not stupid to kill

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.649 
the Grayson but it's not stupid to kill
off<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.889> Nightwing<00:02:58.340> mantle<00:02:58.909> and<00:02:59.120> have<00:02:59.359> a<00:02:59.389> new
