examination of the tissues of the rats

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.670 
examination of the tissues of the rats
there<00:02:13.879> was<00:02:14.000> nothing<00:02:14.629> that<00:02:14.989> showed<00:02:15.230> any<00:02:15.440> type

of pathological manifestation the only
change<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.880> behavior<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.390> was<00:02:20.630> noted<00:02:20.990> was

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
change in behavior that was noted was

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.580 
change in behavior that was noted was
that<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.380> rats<00:02:21.590> were<00:02:21.830> running<00:02:22.160> out

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
that the rats were running out

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.309 
that the rats were running out
sharing<00:02:22.769> their<00:02:22.920> mangosteen<00:02:23.550> with<00:02:24.319> which

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
sharing their mangosteen with which

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.930 
sharing their mangosteen with which
brings<00:02:25.590> me<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.950> next<00:02:25.980> question<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.670> think

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
brings me to the next question I think

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.490 
brings me to the next question I think
everybody's<00:02:27.300> thinking<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.660> stockpiling<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
everybody's thinking of stockpiling the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.890 
everybody's thinking of stockpiling the
mangosteen<00:02:28.980> right<00:02:29.250> now<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.670> there<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> limit<00:02:30.720> to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
mangosteen right now is there a limit to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.869 
mangosteen right now is there a limit to
how<00:02:31.019> much<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.349> should<00:02:31.530> be<00:02:31.620> taking<00:02:31.769> well<00:02:32.519> you

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
how much we should be taking well you

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.150 
how much we should be taking well you
know<00:02:33.000> there<00:02:33.660> with<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.260> rat<00:02:34.410> studies<00:02:34.890> there

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
know there with the rat studies there

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.119 
know there with the rat studies there
were<00:02:35.280> no<00:02:35.459> toxic<00:02:35.970> limits<00:02:36.360> when<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.739> studies

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
were no toxic limits when you do studies

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.070 
were no toxic limits when you do studies
like<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.819> try<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.239> establish<00:02:39.360> some

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
like this you try and establish some

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.350 
like this you try and establish some
dose<00:02:40.379> at<00:02:40.650> which<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.190> animal<00:02:41.610> or<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.940> person

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
dose at which the animal or the person

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.940 
dose at which the animal or the person
that<00:02:42.569> you're<00:02:42.959> using<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.769> have

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
that you're using that is going to have

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.339 
that you're using that is going to have
adverse<00:02:44.370> effects<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:45.209> didn't<00:02:45.510> ever<00:02:45.720> find<00:02:46.140> that

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
adverse effects we didn't ever find that

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.460 
adverse effects we didn't ever find that
toxic<00:02:47.069> level<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.120> there<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.330> no<00:02:48.660> toxic<00:02:49.140> level

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
toxic level so there is no toxic level

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.550 
toxic level so there is no toxic level
however<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:50.280> minimum<00:02:51.269> dosages<00:02:51.930> when<00:02:52.170> someone
