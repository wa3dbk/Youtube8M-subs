Christianity basically became the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.010 
Christianity basically became the
official<00:00:40.310> religion<00:00:40.670> of<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.300> Roman<00:00:41.690> Empire

official religion of the Roman Empire

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.270 
official religion of the Roman Empire
and<00:00:42.350> it's<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.880> it's<00:00:43.910> an<00:00:44.870> amazing<00:00:45.470> time<00:00:45.950> of

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280

and it's and it's an amazing time of
history<00:00:46.790> I<00:00:46.970> think<00:00:47.240> it's<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.510> time<00:00:47.780> when<00:00:48.080> the

church became the chinuch really it was
a<00:00:51.290> time<00:00:51.620> when<00:00:51.890> Christians<00:00:52.810> decided<00:00:53.810> what

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
a time when Christians decided what

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.350 
a time when Christians decided what

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
an incredible change in circumstances

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.000 
an incredible change in circumstances
come<00:02:51.350> about<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.920> really<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.880> think<00:02:53.090> it's<00:02:54.010> in

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
come about and really I think it's in

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.090 
come about and really I think it's in
some<00:02:55.760> ways<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.510> story<00:02:57.020> is<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.260> story<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.800> how

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
some ways that story is a story of how

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.280 
some ways that story is a story of how
what<00:02:58.670> would<00:02:58.790> become<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.120> modern<00:02:59.390> world<00:02:59.750> came

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
what would become the modern world came

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.700 
what would become the modern world came
about<00:03:00.590> it's<00:03:01.250> it's<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.820> time<00:03:02.120> when<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
about it's it's the time when the

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.090 
about it's it's the time when the
Christianity<00:03:03.710> as<00:03:03.890> we<00:03:03.920> know<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.460> formed<00:03:05.150> when

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
Christianity as we know it formed when

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.250 
Christianity as we know it formed when
ideas<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.400> where<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.390> states<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.050> role<00:03:09.230> of

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
ideas of where the states the role of

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.250 
ideas of where the states the role of
the<00:03:09.470> state<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:09.950> church<00:03:09.980> came<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.760> be<00:03:10.940> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
the state of the church came to be and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.390 
the state of the church came to be and
so<00:03:12.260> these<00:03:12.410> are<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.860> think<00:03:13.190> they're<00:03:13.370> very

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
so these are I think they're very

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.160 
so these are I think they're very
interesting<00:03:14.150> questions<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.990> very

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
interesting questions the very

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.600 
interesting questions the very
interesting<00:03:15.470> issues<00:03:15.830> whether<00:03:16.370> you're<00:03:16.580> a

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
interesting issues whether you're a

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.490 
interesting issues whether you're a
Christian<00:03:17.060> or<00:03:17.240> not<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:17.690> well<00:03:17.870> worth<00:03:18.050> knowing

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
Christian or not it's well worth knowing

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
Christian or not it's well worth knowing
so<00:03:19.250> that's<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.360> book
