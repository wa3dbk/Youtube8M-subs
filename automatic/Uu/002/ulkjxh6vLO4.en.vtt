00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the water and it will become easier and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.119 
the water and it will become easier and
easier<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.390> drink<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.840> amount<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.229> water<00:01:04.469> but

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:07.709 
remember it takes a lot of alkalinity to

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:10.370 
remember it takes a lot of alkalinity to
neutralize<00:01:08.280> acidity<00:01:09.149> in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.389> body<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.289> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
neutralize acidity in the body so you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.020
