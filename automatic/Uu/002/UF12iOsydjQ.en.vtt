00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:54.690 

then<00:02:44.770> we'll<00:02:45.520> refine<00:02:45.910> some<00:02:46.209> solid<00:02:46.569> scrap

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700

and<00:02:54.840> finally<00:02:55.840> we'll<00:02:56.560> do<00:02:56.739> some<00:02:56.950> sweeps<00:02:57.250> from<00:02:57.819> a
