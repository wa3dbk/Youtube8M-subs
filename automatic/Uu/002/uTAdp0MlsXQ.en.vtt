Monster Hunter Diary: Felyne Village on the Edge G

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:30.736
Quest 12: Miss Meow and the Instructor's Room 2!

00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:37.820
This is Monster Hunter Diary: Felyne Village on the Edge G.

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:42.235
This is a special show. The theme is...

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:44.827
"Welcome, Monster!"

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:49.332
It's a rare chance to ask a monster whatever you want!

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:52.064
I've been working with monsters for seven years.

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:54.267
Leave it to me!

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.048
If you say so.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.672
Let's introduce today's guest...

00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:02.456
Zinogre!

00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:06.135
Thanks for having me.

00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:08.800
W-w-w-welcome...

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:12.872
Hey there, Zinny. What's up? It's me, the Instructor.

00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:15.959
He's ignoring you...

00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:17.499
Um... okay.

00:01:17.503 --> 00:01:24.012
The residents of Felyne Village had some questions for you.

00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:26.148
Let's take a look.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.028
I'm Knyght, from Felyne Village!

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:33.510
I heard that Shock Traps don't work on you.

00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:36.397
Is that really true?

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:39.503
What a look of innocence...

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:41.677
How about it, Zinogre?

00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:44.782
They're no problem at all. They kinda feel good, actually.

00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:46.767
Go ahead and send them all my way.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:51.689
You can break Shock Traps when you're supercharged, right?

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:54.978
You fall right into pitfalls, though!

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:56.081
What?

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:58.116
Tone it down, Instructor.

00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:00.664
No, I'm not angry.

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:04.745
Don't worry, it's fine. Zinny agreed to come today.

00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:07.268
Besides, I'm the Instructor!

00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:10.244
Okay, then. Let's go to the next question!

00:02:10.382 --> 00:02:12.852
Out of all the various monsters...

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:16.745
You're one of the main, featured ones. Is that a lot of pressure?

00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:20.454
Well, I really respect the monsters who came before me...

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:23.358
So I'm really honored that they decided to feature me.

00:02:23.404 --> 00:02:26.694
It's a lot of pressure, but I'll do my best.

00:02:26.773 --> 00:02:30.631
Come on, Zinny, you've got the skills and the popularity!

00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:32.558
No one else can even come...

00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:36.457
Oh, but I guess Jho's doing pretty well too.

00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:41.290
What? Grr... Deviljho...

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.262
N-next! Next question!

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:47.113
Zinogre, do you have a girlfriend?

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.885
Not right now, but...

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:57.664
I think Rathalos and Rathian have a great relationship.

00:02:58.114 --> 00:03:00.512
So, maybe, someday...

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:03.215
Good answer! He's doing great!

00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:04.835
Don't worry, Zinny! You'll be fine!

00:03:04.897 --> 00:03:07.174
Listen, I can set you up with some nice monsters.

00:03:07.274 --> 00:03:08.319
What?

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.417
Instructor, you're really overdoing this...

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.166
Don't worry, me and Zinny go way back!

00:03:14.303 --> 00:03:17.519
Oh, that's right. I've been meaning to ask...

00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.317
Where do you keep the Jasper?

00:03:21.463 --> 00:03:24.899
Unforgivable! And who are you, anyway?

00:03:25.887 --> 00:03:27.901
You know the Zinogre's Jasper?

00:03:28.028 --> 00:03:30.981
It's really rare, right? Where on the body is it?

00:03:31.063 --> 00:03:32.725
What? You don't know?

00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:35.285
I can't say it too loud, though.

00:03:37.312 --> 00:03:40.281
Whoa! Seriously!?

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.574
No wonder it's so rare...

00:03:44.573 --> 00:03:47.158
There's always more to learn!

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.710
Monsters are so interesting!

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.678
See you next time!

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.223
Enjoy the hunting life!

00:03:54.284 --> 00:03:56.033
G!
