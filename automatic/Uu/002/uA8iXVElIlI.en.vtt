 sacred time for the recipe 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.969
 is true they are there so it takes 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.369
 that they do not cooperate with what 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.980
 early potatoes onion tullaye you 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.109
 salt of pepper 1 9 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.310
 so is it also needs parsley then 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.840
 it's always better paid is safe if we 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.789
 take fresh parsley from paepe garden 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.289
 no but I did not have parsley 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.599
 fresh so I took parsley like that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.540
 it works also bought foot show the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.520
 proof and for cooking it will take a 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.989
 stove with oil and paper 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.340
 absorbing or is you sweeping balout 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.530
 the paper towel reminded you 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.700
 then you have to peel the apples from 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 earth with a thrifty 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.440
 cut the onion with a knife and then 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.730
 also cut when it's done 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.020
 Clean the potatoes with 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.640
 water because otherwise it becomes spinning 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 luck welcomed because of the weather at 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.510
 works well cleaned and especially well 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.149
 to dry I use robots machines 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.109
 modern to make their apaches a 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.109

 egg salt pepper and parsley 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.960
 that's what 's really in the middle with 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.790
 hands otherwise we take a spatula 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.979
