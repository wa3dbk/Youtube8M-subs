 hi guys today i 'm here in 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.170
 a support workshop to explain to you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.900
 how to get lights on 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.150
 low beam and high beam ones 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 which make the light xenon style therefore 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.140
 those bluish light bulb plus le 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.680
 positions with white led pieces from 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.939
 mount 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.840
 are the following 4 bulbs houses 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.930
 the blue xenon ones of the pilot the 2 cat 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.110
 boxx that serve to eliminate the error 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.010
 of the failure light on the panel and the two 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.010
 led bulb 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.820
 to do this job you have to have the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.539
 following materials a paste welder 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.710
 tin solder with atak or with 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.309
 specifies an indicator light for plastic 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.739
 to prove continuity or something 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.640
 of positive 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.290
 a tape scissor a bit of a bit 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 a tester clamps in case you are wrong 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.619
 a screwdriver with two torches a prof da 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:23.430
 25 a 30 torch let's proceed with it 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.770
 disassembly of the first lighthouse where it includes 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.770
 to remove previews from talk shows 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.510
 once removed the screws remove 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.510
 whole lighthouse from its headquarters 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:54.220
 lighthouse we proceed to remove the cover 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.619
 interested in position light one 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.009
 once the bulb of the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.170
 position and identified as the most e 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.579
 such as at least lampara 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:16.000
 let's start let's hope the loved ones 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:20.019
 for the insertion of the created box one 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.660
 once the twisted cable is unveiled 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.660
 box cable is soldered 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.970
 let's go to our own cable for one 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.970
 greater security 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.230
 once also put a led light bulb 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:42.730
 let's go and put the light bulb in the seat 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.269
 we go to the lighthouse once 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.290
 also change the two lamps to houses 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:52.450
 just go around the lamp holder e 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.019
 it can be automatically extracted 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.019
 light bulb 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.079
 take the blue one and insert it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.079
 in the same direction as before 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.130
 let this also fixes the in its 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:15.989
 We fit lampholders on the references 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.989
 a small turn and fixed lamps 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.910
 let's go to the same procedure 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.350
 also for the bulb for the year 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.900
 dazzling 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.049
 even there we take a little snap out 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.980
 We want a light bulb 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.980
 series and put the blue one 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.920
 let's put it on the lamp holder here 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:55.720
 a small click bulbs attached to the 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:58.210
 work is like this after reassembling the two 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:11.520
 protective caps we insert the headlight 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:11.520
 in the seat with the relative screws 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:05:04.860
 final will be the yellow positions of 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:12.520
 series the white anti- glare position 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:14.200
 yellow and the white bather if the video 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.770
 did you like it 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.770
 put a like one
