00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
very it reminds me slightly of Prince

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
very it reminds me slightly of Prince
but<00:00:37.950> Prince<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.340> very<00:00:38.550> subtle<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
but Prince is very subtle and this is

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.080 
but Prince is very subtle and this is
much<00:00:39.930> more<00:00:40.350> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.739> in-your-face<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.670> when

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
much more kind of in-your-face and when

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.340 
much more kind of in-your-face and when
you've<00:00:42.270> got<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.719> your<00:00:42.870> hair<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.140> can

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you've got this in your hair you can

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.910 
you've got this in your hair you can
smell<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:43.860> day<00:00:44.010> long<00:00:44.480> now<00:00:45.710> it's<00:00:46.710> actually

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
smell it all day long now it's actually

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.850 
smell it all day long now it's actually
a<00:00:47.129> hair<00:00:47.340> moisturizer<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:49.079> designed<00:00:49.590> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
a hair moisturizer and it's designed to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.740 
a hair moisturizer and it's designed to
go<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:51.920> chemically<00:00:52.920> treated<00:00:53.610> hair<00:00:53.640> which<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
go on to chemically treated hair which I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.410 
go on to chemically treated hair which I
assume<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.530> means<00:00:55.739> people<00:00:56.699> who've<00:00:56.879> dyed<00:00:57.149> their

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
assume it means people who've dyed their

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880 
assume it means people who've dyed their
hair<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:57.930> hair<00:00:58.109> dye

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
hair because hair dye

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.150 
hair because hair dye
tends<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.640> really<00:01:00.090> dry<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.390> out<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.379> yeah<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.980> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
tends to really dry it out so yeah it is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
tends to really dry it out so yeah it is
more<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:03.210> using<00:01:03.899> when<00:01:04.080> you've<00:01:04.199> dyed<00:01:04.439> your

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
more for using when you've dyed your

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.820 
more for using when you've dyed your
hair<00:01:05.689> but<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> don't<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.200> haven't<00:01:07.439> dyed<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:07.799> hair

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
hair but I don't I haven't dyed my hair

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.560 
hair but I don't I haven't dyed my hair
and<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.369> use<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:08.939> little<00:01:09.180> girls<00:01:09.360> as

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and I use this on my little girls as

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.380 
and I use this on my little girls as
well<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.930> find<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.590> helps<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.760> knots

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
well I do find that it helps with knots

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.929 
well I do find that it helps with knots
so<00:01:13.320> when<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> put<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.830> through<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.460> makes<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
so when I put this through it makes it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.649 
so when I put this through it makes it
much<00:01:15.270> easier<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.900> brush<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.530> afterwards<00:01:17.659> but

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
much easier to brush out afterwards but

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.280 
much easier to brush out afterwards but
I<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.369> clean<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.700> sooner<00:01:21.509> with<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
I have to clean it sooner with this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560 
I have to clean it sooner with this
stuff<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> use<00:01:23.610> tiny<00:01:23.970> tiny<00:01:24.420> tiny

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
stuff on so you use tiny tiny tiny

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.260 
stuff on so you use tiny tiny tiny
amounts<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.130> still<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.030> hair

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
amounts but it still it's a hair

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.600 
amounts but it still it's a hair
moisturizer<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.439> gonna<00:01:28.680> make<00:01:28.950> your<00:01:29.430> hair

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
moisturizer so it's gonna make your hair

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
moisturizer so it's gonna make your hair
more<00:01:31.340> moisturized<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.820> therefore<00:01:33.450> greasy

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
more moisturized and therefore greasy

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.130 
more moisturized and therefore greasy
what<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.700> guess<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.509> chemically

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
what it can do I guess with chemically

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.380 
what it can do I guess with chemically
treated<00:01:37.619> hair<00:01:37.829> than<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> actually<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.030> really

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
treated hair than it actually it really

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.590 
treated hair than it actually it really
really<00:01:39.840> helps<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.740> super<00:01:41.250> super

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
really helps because it is super super

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.210 
really helps because it is super super
moisturizing<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:43.229> stuff<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:44.009> good

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
moisturizing this stuff is really good

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.370 
moisturizing this stuff is really good
