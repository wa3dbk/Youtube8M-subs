00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
day we already felt it was going to be

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.509 
day we already felt it was going to be
difficult<00:01:02.479> and<00:01:02.629> awkward<00:01:03.049> for<00:01:03.680> this<00:01:04.189> is<00:01:04.309> such

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
difficult and awkward for this is such

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.340 
difficult and awkward for this is such
an<00:01:04.670> ironic<00:01:05.059> way<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.269> I<00:01:05.600> know<00:01:05.780> it's<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.170> very

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
an ironic way to I know it's a very

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.500 
an ironic way to I know it's a very
strange<00:01:06.799> like<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:07.460> know<00:01:07.640> in<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.180> morning

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
strange like I know in the morning

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.750 
strange like I know in the morning
itself<00:01:08.780> was<00:01:09.020> quite<00:01:09.170> tense<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:10.280> just<00:01:10.549> felt

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
itself was quite tense and I just felt

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.429 
itself was quite tense and I just felt
the<00:01:11.119> best<00:01:11.299> way<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.540> deal<00:01:11.840> with<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:12.020> was<00:01:12.229> get

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
the best way to deal with it was get

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.350 
the best way to deal with it was get
through<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:12.770> as<00:01:12.860> quickly<00:01:13.100> as<00:01:13.280> possible<00:01:13.360> and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
through it as quickly as possible and

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.929 
through it as quickly as possible and
not<00:01:14.630> labor<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:15.530> not<00:01:15.560> doing<00:01:15.860> loads<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:16.490> Tanks

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
not labor and not doing loads of Tanks

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.120 
not labor and not doing loads of Tanks
and<00:01:17.119> just<00:01:17.840> get<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.590> moment<00:01:18.770> where<00:01:19.100> we

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
and just get to the moment where we

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.570 
and just get to the moment where we
could<00:01:19.340> say<00:01:19.460> that's<00:01:19.610> about

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.980 

I<00:01:26.760> feel<00:01:27.760> like<00:01:27.850> I've<00:01:27.970> blocked<00:01:28.240> out<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.540> memory

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
I feel like I've blocked out the memory

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.510 
I feel like I've blocked out the memory
because<00:01:29.260> it's<00:01:29.410> almost<00:01:29.650> it<00:01:30.010> was<00:01:30.040> almost<00:01:30.220> like

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
because it's almost it was almost like

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.150 
because it's almost it was almost like
