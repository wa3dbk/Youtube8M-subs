 many elderly people live 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.460
 I am grateful for being tolerated 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.460
 just for safety on the film set 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.870
 of course must happen 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.980
 that is true, but you have also become over the years 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.980
 now you are now all current years ago in his life 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.900

 now has a problem with Ronald Koeman 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.210

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.330
 9 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.820
 He accepted to be broken 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.660
 it concerns the German Christians Thiele 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.130
 he is attacking your uv 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 it's watching out 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.499
 that is a natural process 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.499
 it said suspicion 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:17.319
 this is one of the four hours 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 we keep paying attention 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:22.469
 I am pushed aside 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.439
 Mr van Gaal, much more than today 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.409
 for this mission 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.929
 he is ronald koeman last year 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:33.309
 just bet something on it 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.309
 the woman had discovered 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.629
 I am very curious what he does FC Porto 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.489
 especially his success at home 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.549
 The growth is mainly due to this being very curious as to what he thought of it 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.149
 finds 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:51.879
 van gaal turned out to be unexpected 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.900
 to make peace they see if that also means money for koeman 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.219
 Mr. Kuman when talked about 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.219
 This is said to say that in the media last week what do you think about it 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.339
 yes what should think of it 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.519
 besides good question yes i don't know 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.869
 cabinet threes 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:11.079
 therefore you still get responding gaps hourly news 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.079
 but I can agree 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:18.099
 he must have talked about that has it in the front 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.389
 furthermore the syrian army 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.419
 the canvas 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.149
 but the address to see why is the vision 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:26.129
 works well according to barometer 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.329
 it's for reading 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.329
 paper would come by in brussels for savers tomorrow 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.689
 the public can close 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.029
 transics extra set but very neat 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.179
 years 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.689
 the sky may be a bit the same now but I don't think I am the prince of the church 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:40.659
 also not through 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:41.769
 it's fine this way 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:42.969
 Yes 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.149
 I will never be well again 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:46.779
 I don't think so 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.329
 that is to the book has the vision of van gaal 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.190
 well about it 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.499
 safety and justice 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.179
 physically true trainer 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:54.000
 absolutely 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.129
 but that 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.299
 that has never been a point of discussion 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.879
 rotterdam de roma 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.959
 you are already looking at wall street 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.180
 I don't look far enough 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.499
 just learn something to think here 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.879
 yes i can learn something from it 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.259
 success a very nice exercises on a rise in inflation 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.499
 the trainer has already started and common that reluctantly has the curtain 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.569
 accepted you think the air has cleared up a bit between the two
