however occasionally I mix it up by
staying<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.120> side<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> map<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.640> just

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
staying on this side of the map and just

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.920 
staying on this side of the map and just
keeping<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:38.969> eye<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.390> my<00:00:39.510> team<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.809> doing

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.350 
keeping an eye on what my team is doing
in<00:00:40.260> order<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.559> Cathy<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.100> feel<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.210> it's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
in order to Cathy I feel that it's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.729 
in order to Cathy I feel that it's
better<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.809> defend<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.590> distance

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
better to defend it from a distance

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.220 
better to defend it from a distance
rather<00:00:44.219> than<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.579> close<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.629> lot<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
rather than up close because a lot of

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
rather than up close because a lot of
people<00:00:46.320> also<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.920> throwing<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.700> sort<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
people also like throwing some sort of

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.010 
people also like throwing some sort of
explosive<00:00:48.300> down<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.539> team<00:00:54.840> I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
explosive down there so on my team I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.490 
explosive down there so on my team I
think<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.649> almost<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.219> subscribers<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
think it was almost all subscribers and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.229 
think it was almost all subscribers and
I<00:00:58.500> actually<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:59.010> off<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.340> quite<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> poor<00:00:59.910> start

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
I actually get off to quite a poor start

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.380 
I actually get off to quite a poor start
I<00:01:00.719> think<00:01:01.109> many<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.350> us<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:01.649> from<00:01:02.390> many

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
I think many of us will from many

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.820 
I think many of us will from many
different<00:01:03.539> countries<00:01:03.719> around<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> world<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
whoever had host at the time was one

I'm actually thinking of having a
private<00:02:55.129> match<00:02:56.110> where<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.879> will<00:02:58.879> go<00:02:59.030> into<00:02:59.150> a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.170 
free spectating mode and the outcome
will<00:03:02.209> be<00:03:02.769> me<00:03:03.769> swapping<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.730> dipper<00:03:04.879> players

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
will be me swapping to dipper players

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.740 
will be me swapping to dipper players
throughout<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.870> match<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:07.330> then<00:03:08.330> trying<00:03:08.660> to

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
throughout the match and then trying to

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.170 
throughout the match and then trying to

know if that would be something valuable

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.479 
know if that would be something valuable
I<00:03:23.510> know<00:03:24.380> certain<00:03:24.769> people<00:03:24.799> don't<00:03:25.130> like<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.370> be

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
I know certain people don't like to be

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.170 
I know certain people don't like to be
critiqued<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.120> whatnot<00:03:27.310> however<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.970> see

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
critiqued and whatnot however you see

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.729 
critiqued and whatnot however you see
you<00:03:29.450> guys<00:03:29.630> seem<00:03:29.840> like<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.989> good<00:03:30.200> bunch<00:03:30.440> and

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
you guys seem like a good bunch and

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.370 
you guys seem like a good bunch and
always<00:03:31.700> pretty<00:03:32.540> eager<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.870> get<00:03:33.079> some<00:03:33.349> new

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
always pretty eager to get some new

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.229 
always pretty eager to get some new
tactical<00:03:34.069> strategy<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.640> monkey<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.000> upper

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
tactical strategy that monkey the upper

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.240 
tactical strategy that monkey the upper
hand<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:35.599> maybe<00:03:35.930> there<00:03:36.709> might<00:03:36.739> be<00:03:36.860> some<00:03:37.099> value

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
hand so maybe there might be some value

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.520 
hand so maybe there might be some value
in<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:40.360> that's<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.420> good<00:03:41.540> hit<00:03:41.660> by<00:03:41.870> kill<00:03:42.140> i<00:03:42.349> just

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
in that that's a good hit by kill i just

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.990 
in that that's a good hit by kill i just
didn't<00:03:42.769> see<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:42.920> third<00:03:43.190> person<00:03:43.370> coming<00:03:43.819> until

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
didn't see the third person coming until

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.830 
didn't see the third person coming until
it<00:03:44.120> was<00:03:44.209> too<00:03:44.329> late

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.059 

so<00:03:49.379> as<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:49.620> see<00:03:49.739> i'm<00:03:49.830> running<00:03:50.010> the

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
so as you can see i'm running the

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.729 
so as you can see i'm running the
predator<00:03:50.459> harrier<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.330> i<00:03:51.480> believe<00:03:51.930> i<00:03:52.319> have

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
predator harrier and i believe i have

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.630 
predator harrier and i believe i have
the<00:03:53.629> emergency<00:03:54.629> air<00:03:54.989> drop<00:03:55.230> off

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.760 

we're<00:03:59.300> absolutely<00:03:59.450> creaming<00:04:00.440> them<00:04:00.590> at<00:04:00.680> the

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
we're absolutely creaming them at the

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.640 
we're absolutely creaming them at the
moment<00:04:01.100> only<00:04:01.190> have<00:04:01.400> 27<00:04:01.910> points<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:03.319> I<00:04:03.350> believe

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
moment only have 27 points so I believe

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.210 
moment only have 27 points so I believe
we're<00:04:04.069> playing<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.459> team<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:05.540> was<00:04:06.220> more

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
we're playing a team that was more

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.190 
we're playing a team that was more
geared<00:04:07.610> towards<00:04:08.120> trying<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.630> kill<00:04:08.780> people<00:04:09.050> and

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
geared towards trying to kill people and

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.580 
geared towards trying to kill people and
that's<00:04:09.470> fine<00:04:09.680> if<00:04:09.920> they<00:04:10.220> want<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.430> do<00:04:10.550> that<00:04:10.670> but

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
that's fine if they want to do that but

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.360 
that's fine if they want to do that but
they're<00:04:12.590> not<00:04:12.650> going<00:04:12.800> to<00:04:12.890> really<00:04:13.010> get<00:04:13.190> high

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
they're not going to really get high

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.750 
they're not going to really get high
kills<00:04:14.120> if<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:15.320> domination<00:04:15.740> games<00:04:16.130> over

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
kills if the domination games over

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.840 
kills if the domination games over
quickly<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.419> mean<00:04:17.780> this<00:04:18.739> games<00:04:19.010> over<00:04:19.220> in<00:04:19.549> seven

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
quickly I mean this games over in seven

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.310 
quickly I mean this games over in seven
minutes<00:04:20.000> so<00:04:20.239> they<00:04:20.359> miss<00:04:20.780> full<00:04:21.079> three<00:04:21.290> minutes

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
minutes so they miss full three minutes

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.680 
minutes so they miss full three minutes
of<00:04:21.650> kills<00:04:21.890> as<00:04:22.130> well<00:04:22.310> which<00:04:23.180> can<00:04:23.360> be<00:04:23.480> quite

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
of kills as well which can be quite

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.750 
of kills as well which can be quite
significant<00:04:24.260> especially<00:04:24.500> if<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:25.010> get<00:04:25.610> into

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
significant especially if you get into

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.100 
significant especially if you get into
the<00:04:25.850> groove<00:04:26.030> of<00:04:26.300> how<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.510> other<00:04:26.780> team<00:04:26.990> is

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
the groove of how the other team is

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.860 
the groove of how the other team is
playing<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:27.680> actually<00:04:27.800> start<00:04:28.870> releasing

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
playing and you actually start releasing

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.630 
playing and you actually start releasing
higher<00:04:30.260> killstreaks<00:04:33.220> I'm<00:04:34.220> here<00:04:34.370> I'm<00:04:34.460> just

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
higher killstreaks I'm here I'm just

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.909 
higher killstreaks I'm here I'm just
having<00:04:34.820> fun<00:04:34.910> holding<00:04:35.330> back<00:04:35.450> see<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.830> was

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
having fun holding back see and that was

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.670 
having fun holding back see and that was
unfortunate<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:38.080> he<00:04:39.080> got<00:04:39.169> me<00:04:39.320> because<00:04:39.620> I

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
unfortunate that he got me because I

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.920 
unfortunate that he got me because I
believe<00:04:39.919> my<00:04:40.130> form<00:04:40.669> Isis<00:04:40.970> three<00:04:41.180> bursts<00:04:41.390> rounds

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
believe my form Isis three bursts rounds

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.750 
believe my form Isis three bursts rounds
actually<00:04:42.320> hit<00:04:42.440> him<00:04:42.560> that<00:04:43.370> might<00:04:43.520> have<00:04:43.550> been<00:04:43.669> a

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
actually hit him that might have been a

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.150 
actually hit him that might have been a
lag<00:04:43.970> issue<00:04:44.240> as<00:04:44.419> well<00:04:44.450> he's<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.410> great<00:04:45.740> semtex

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
lag issue as well he's a great semtex

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.840 
lag issue as well he's a great semtex
spot<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.790> I<00:04:46.850> have<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.150> arm<00:04:47.300> of<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.480> baseball

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
spot and I have the arm of the baseball

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.240 
spot and I have the arm of the baseball
so<00:04:49.850> learn<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.240> one<00:04:50.890> it's<00:04:51.890> probably<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.160> only

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
so learn that one it's probably the only

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.530 
so learn that one it's probably the only
tactic<00:04:52.669> you're<00:04:52.820> going<00:04:52.940> to<00:04:53.000> get<00:04:53.090> in<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:53.240> video

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
tactic you're going to get in this video

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.380 
tactic you're going to get in this video
actually<00:04:54.550> but<00:04:55.550> yeah<00:04:55.669> that's<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.940> great<00:04:56.060> spot

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
actually but yeah that's a great spot

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.080 
actually but yeah that's a great spot
for<00:04:56.419> holding<00:04:57.020> both<00:04:57.230> B<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:57.470> C<00:04:58.040> obviously<00:04:58.940> you

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
for holding both B and C obviously you

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.880 
for holding both B and C obviously you
only<00:04:59.180> have<00:04:59.390> one<00:04:59.630> shot<00:04:59.660> at<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:00.410> see<00:05:00.740> was

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
only have one shot at it and see was

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.320 
only have one shot at it and see was
taken<00:05:01.220> a<00:05:03.640> lot<00:05:04.640> of<00:05:04.700> people<00:05:04.940> don't<00:05:05.090> shoot

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
taken a lot of people don't shoot

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.670 
taken a lot of people don't shoot

ballgame but if I see someone is behind
near<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:24.919> cradle<00:05:25.130> why<00:05:25.460> not<00:05:25.639> I'll<00:05:25.970> use<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.570> UAV

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
near the cradle why not I'll use the UAV

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.260 
near the cradle why not I'll use the UAV
completely<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:27.620> my<00:05:27.740> advantage<00:05:27.980> and<00:05:28.370> spam<00:05:29.090> the

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
completely to my advantage and spam the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.939 
completely to my advantage and spam the
wall<00:05:29.419> and<00:05:29.600> I<00:05:29.660> usually<00:05:29.930> pick<00:05:30.050> up<00:05:30.199> wipe<00:05:30.830> your

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
wall and I usually pick up wipe your

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.930 
wall and I usually pick up wipe your
kills<00:05:31.280> and<00:05:32.800> now<00:05:33.800> while<00:05:33.979> I<00:05:34.010> come<00:05:34.340> on<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.520> UAV

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
kills and now while I come on the UAV

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.490 
kills and now while I come on the UAV
that's<00:05:35.210> fine<00:05:35.449> because<00:05:35.660> I<00:05:35.870> take<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.169> shot<00:05:36.380> and

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
that's fine because I take the shot and

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.010 
that's fine because I take the shot and
that<00:05:36.560> I<00:05:36.650> moved<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.460> it's<00:05:38.389> not<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:38.720> much<00:05:38.780> of<00:05:38.930> a

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
that I moved and it's not so much of a

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:47.020 
that I moved and it's not so much of a
problem<00:05:44.590> now<00:05:45.590> my<00:05:45.740> area<00:05:46.010> actually<00:05:46.460> goes<00:05:47.000> to

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
problem now my area actually goes to

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.110 
problem now my area actually goes to

specifically<00:05:50.630> know<00:05:50.840> how<00:05:51.020> many<00:05:51.199> kills<00:05:51.410> it<00:05:51.560> is

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710

which<00:06:05.330> kind<00:06:05.960> of<00:06:06.080> sucked<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.620> think<00:06:07.190> there<00:06:07.280> was

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
which kind of sucked I think there was

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.399 
which kind of sucked I think there was
only<00:06:07.460> a<00:06:07.580> predator<00:06:08.030> and

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409 
only a predator and

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:13.809 
only a predator and
in<00:06:09.649> the<00:06:09.800> end<00:06:09.939> but<00:06:12.219> they're<00:06:13.219> usually<00:06:13.249> if<00:06:13.729> I

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819 
in the end but they're usually if I

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.369 
in the end but they're usually if I
throw<00:06:14.029> a<00:06:14.059> tear<00:06:14.300> drop<00:06:14.479> bar<00:06:14.749> and<00:06:14.869> you<00:06:14.929> really

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:15.379 
throw a tear drop bar and you really

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.399 
throw a tear drop bar and you really
want<00:06:15.589> the<00:06:16.449> high<00:06:17.449> killstreaks<00:06:17.749> the<00:06:18.139> reason<00:06:18.349> I

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
want the high killstreaks the reason I

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:19.659 
want the high killstreaks the reason I
did<00:06:18.589> want<00:06:18.769> to<00:06:18.830> get<00:06:18.949> this<00:06:19.039> country<00:06:19.339> done<00:06:19.489> then

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
did want to get this country done then
