00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
different like first one's gonna be like

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.100 
different like first one's gonna be like
16<00:03:56.870> MB<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.010> 2<00:03:58.069> 8<00:03:58.340> so<00:03:58.670> I'll<00:03:58.760> just<00:03:58.909> just<00:03:59.360> match<00:03:59.659> it

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
16 MB so 2 8 so I'll just just match it

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.770 
16 MB so 2 8 so I'll just just match it
alright<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.190> finish<00:04:01.519> matching<00:04:01.909> all<00:04:02.090> down<00:04:02.329> here

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
but I'm just describing it it's just

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.760 
but I'm just describing it it's just
going<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.340> be<00:05:10.550> like<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.360> video<00:05:11.780> I'm<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:12.440> can't

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
going to be like a video I'm I can't

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.750 
going to be like a video I'm I can't
skip<00:05:13.039> it<00:05:13.070> maybe<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.669> guys<00:05:13.820> can<00:05:14.949> so<00:05:15.949> I'm<00:05:16.610> gonna

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
have to sit there for every 10 minutes

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.779

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
every time you open up the game but I

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.980 
every time you open up the game but I
guess<00:05:19.970> it's<00:05:20.150> worth<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.510> pretty<00:05:21.440> cool<00:05:21.560> game

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
guess it's worth it pretty cool game

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.320 
guess it's worth it pretty cool game
alright<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.310> maybe<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.430> little<00:05:25.639> problem<00:05:26.000> with

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
alright and maybe a little problem with

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.990 
alright and maybe a little problem with
like<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:27.320> screen<00:05:27.650> frees<00:05:27.949> me<00:05:28.130> up<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.430> little<00:05:28.760> bit

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
like the screen frees me up a little bit

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000 
like the screen frees me up a little bit
but<00:05:29.300> it's<00:05:29.539> the<00:05:29.960> program<00:05:30.199> should<00:05:30.530> be<00:05:30.560> running

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
but it's the program should be running

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.719 
but it's the program should be running
so<00:05:31.159> just<00:05:31.370> kind<00:05:31.550> of<00:05:31.580> alt-tab<00:05:32.060> it<00:05:33.699> alright<00:05:34.699> just
