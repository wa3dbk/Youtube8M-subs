00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
is absolutely fantastic best one I've

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.379 
is absolutely fantastic best one I've
skated<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.320> far<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.920> it's<00:00:11.580> quite<00:00:11.849> cheap<00:00:12.120> too<00:00:12.360> i

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.499 
skated so far and it's quite cheap too i
think<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.870> can<00:00:12.929> get<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:13.380> 41<00:00:14.099> pounds

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
think you can get it for about 41 pounds

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.650 
think you can get it for about 41 pounds
so<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> cliche<00:00:16.770> team<00:00:17.220> logo<00:00:17.910> deck<00:00:18.330> or

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
so this was a cliche team logo deck or

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.939

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
something like that in 7.6 tales quite

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.310 
something like that in 7.6 tales quite
average<00:00:23.160> size<00:00:23.640> knows<00:00:24.300> little<00:00:24.990> bit<00:00:25.140> bigger

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
