year-round<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.690> yet<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.350> still<00:01:04.379> like

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
year-round but yet you can still like

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
year-round but yet you can still like
kind<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> switch<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.670> every<00:01:05.909> once<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
kind of switch to not every once in a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.179 
kind of switch to not every once in a
while<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.720> want<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.710> will<00:01:07.890> always

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
while if you want to it just will always

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.250

have<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.430> bright<00:01:08.939> color<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.810> recommend

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
have that bright color so I recommend

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.200 
have that bright color so I recommend
going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.890> somewhere<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.220> Joanne's<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.119> at

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
going to somewhere like Joanne's but at

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
going to somewhere like Joanne's but at
joann's<00:01:12.510> they're<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.110> expensive<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
joann's they're like really expensive I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
joann's they're like really expensive I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
flowers my second tip is to use the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.830 
flowers my second tip is to use the
stuff<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.909> already<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.659> decorate

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
your room and by that I mean using like

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.539 
your room and by that I mean using like
your<00:01:42.150> purses<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.869> shoes<00:01:43.200> your<00:01:43.680> jewelry

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
your purses your shoes your jewelry

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.639 
your purses your shoes your jewelry
everything<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:46.110> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.350> create

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
everything like that to kind of create

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.889 
everything like that to kind of create
little<00:01:46.950> displays<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:47.970> obviously<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.659> you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
color last year I actually went to like

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.560 
color last year I actually went to like
a<00:02:37.280> school<00:02:37.520> supply<00:02:37.670> store<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.210> I<00:02:38.270> just<00:02:38.420> got

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
a school supply store and I just got

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.240 
a school supply store and I just got
some<00:02:38.810> long<00:02:38.990> sheets<00:02:39.350> of<00:02:39.470> butcher<00:02:39.800> paper<00:02:39.830> and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
some long sheets of butcher paper and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.390 
some long sheets of butcher paper and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
seriously it was like less than five

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.280 
seriously it was like less than five
dollars<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:44.030> think<00:02:44.240> for<00:02:44.450> those<00:02:44.540> two<00:02:44.810> big<00:02:44.990> sheets

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
dollars I think for those two big sheets

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.190 
dollars I think for those two big sheets
and<00:02:45.530> then<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.040> basically<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.970> spent<00:02:47.360> all<00:02:47.630> this

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
are in my bed and I could totally switch

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.180 
are in my bed and I could totally switch
these<00:04:08.570> out<00:04:08.840> because<00:04:09.320> they're<00:04:09.860> just<00:04:10.070> like

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
these out because they're just like
