00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.369
 playing a bluray 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.189
 then its cap to make a package in 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.789
 this case an iphone 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:26.630
 here I am seeing something father 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.279
 and with a lot of love for my guest 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.019
 there is an iPod when it is close 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.600
 of posterity the truth neither classic 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.250
 they do not put it and then put it there according to their 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.520
 modem and already with that already with that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.530
 amplify in my mind 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.520
 signature image 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.520
 it is amplified 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.699
 we have exactly the new title of 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.070
 capcom of this re imagination of the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.540
 classic series remembering that I do not have 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.899
 web etc laxe of shoots of him this is the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.450
 classic or the normal edition with dante de 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.040
 white hair will imagine and in this case 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.049
 you already have a little protagonist 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.520
 younger 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.990
 the great action rhyme we gave ourselves is 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.280
 like a reboot if you want to see it like that in 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.930
 the explanation of everything that has happened 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.259
 in the series of typical hack'n'slash and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.030
 capcom which it wants to say or good 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.950
 the people of ninja ciu and people was like 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.179
 heavenly sword and other titles 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.280
 well the franchise was delivered 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.869
 they did a very good job the game is 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.300
 is a divided one campaign 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.220
 Player of approximately 6 to 10 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.630
 hours depends on the difficulty in which 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.729
 the young people and they lowered him a lot of 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.100
 cibeles to the difficulty in the sense of 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.289
 that the classic games were known 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.270
 for being extremely difficult until 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.010
 certain point and good in this case then 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.900
 good ya 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.760
 it's a little more accessible for everything 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.740
 public since with the change of image 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.830
 with this new makeover with 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.140
 other things this well then we have a 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.450
 new dante tells the story of dante 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.510
 that these, like you, do not use a bow 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.490
 composed not to use swords already ebony 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.080
 ivory that are your classics and boni yayi 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.330
 boni is not that you believe that bonnie of his 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.510
 but bonnie that vain 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.100
 evans ebony and ivory that are his 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.430
 pistols the white and the black and 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.230
 obviously he has his and I feel it like that 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.970
 it says clear and they also have weapons 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.370
 of his dad is brown and his mother is 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.260
 that you as we remember that he is a 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.350
 son of an angel and a demon and that's why 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.340
 have these powers 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.010
 special, well, well after the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.230
 campaign we have that is a hacker light 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.900
 that tells you how the universe in front 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.150
 we live in the real world but also 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.920
 find in another on another level that 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
 It would be the limbo that is where 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.940
 they find demons and demons 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.900
 Well, the human race has a 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.460
 little enslaved and is part ahead 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.170
 after all this self of 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.700
 rockstar 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.310
 after having this self to say 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.560
 Hey, you know I'm not interested in what 's 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.120
 happening with the world in this case then 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.610
 receives 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.920
 join your brother tell you the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.540
 history and then it's practically all the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.610
 single player campaign that we're leaving 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.019
 to gather at this time as is 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.670
 characteristic of a doctor is the most 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.680
 important are the stylized combos is 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.200
 say using all of your 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.760
 all your weapons in a more stylized way 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.760
 that is to say that you do many combos with 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.909
 rebellion your sword with you with your 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.069
 pistols and your voice and so on 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.799
 Earn style points once you go 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.480
 earning style points you'll have mclaren 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.620
 a classification for each nest for each 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.379
 level and starting with triple s wc s / d 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.940
 s / d etc. these will give you a little 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.170
 will have a final grade will give you 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.790
 names with which you can improve 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.459
 forward and your skills in each 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.739
 of their of their weapons and postures and what 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.480
 you want or that fits your 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.010
 gameplay as they are well commented 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.290
 the game is only one single campaign 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.640
 player and although it has a replay value 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.109
 in the sense that you can repeat the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.670
 missions to try to perfect your 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.959
 score ends the campaign 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.940
 you have practically nothing 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.489
 many people complained about the redesign of the 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.230
 character but in the particular I think 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.750
 that does not demerit the series the truth is a 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.760
 great great game great great slam 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.190
 go back to the golden age see up 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.160
 certain point of what was the micro but 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.840
 I think you could go I think this new 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.640
 current your new imagination will 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.870
 I could go quite well enough in 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.409
 a micro and is available for 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.379
 playstation 3 xbox 360 and pc 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:35.150
 and then go with your copy that is the 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:38.930
 better of the image of you not 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.990
 not the best 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.120
 I believe that the 2 or the 3 the 1 is medium 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.250
 boring but 12 not the 12 more 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.930
 bored of all but the school because 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:55.130
 the 3 the 4 5 nor bonus of qualification of the 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.960
 1 to 10 we will put an 8.2 because 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.310
 If the truth is good and you remember and 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.470
 there is also a generation that the truth 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.150
 the previous dante neither know him and know 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.040
 what they are talking about or have the least 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.980
 idea they have not seen the anime they are worth rubber 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.690
 the manga and the truth I think that for 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.220
 new for people who do not know a 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.670
 That is excellent excel a 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.670
 Title 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:22.080

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:48.420
