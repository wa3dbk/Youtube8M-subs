00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.519
 now that happens 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.049
 and there are fewer and fewer 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.049
 So do not believe me now that she says something she thinks 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.050
 No, what happens now? 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.890
 that means he will probably be so much 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.890
 my tin damage from playing the tablets 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.149
 my true 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.710
 and Chopin from Offenbach 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.180
 Parnassus, but that is already one 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.880
 and reveal to edit 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.670
 and the music and show 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.480
 for the purchase 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.640
 wakes up together 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.130
 1 sentence 2 90 have 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.440
 given to a veterinarian 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.500
 what comes next year 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 but bringing her is a single 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.100
 namely at the big price of 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.730
 at the nets 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.730
 who present themselves Offenbach also far beyond the borders 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.080
 growth rates 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 Haider distributed 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.930
 You also notice the fun of making music 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.630
 not only on carnival even though the colorful costumes are too timid to match 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.310
 but in the Frankfurter Straße because from there 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.160
 the big jubilee parade in Offenbach 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.690
 and big band 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.180
 on the marketplace 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.570
 no one seems to care what happens 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.690
 clear the way forward 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.630
 is not that 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.870
 Trim work best still want to dance a bit 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.070
 and actually come up with something 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.420
 He's doing just under 13 percent here 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.510
 right mood 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.510
 who waited at the inlet who in the marketplace 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:12.490
 now there are running 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.490
 the idea the Frankfurter Straße one i hope the know what they do 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.779
 it is called 1 1 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:37.449
 nothing to bake as a village club belong but the landscape this 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.019
 very colorful 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.120
 that's multicultural you can track how his person percents 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.299
 vacation 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.949
 We also do not have carnival Carnival Carnival that there is also something with JAL 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.769
 The main thing people want is their fun 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.769
 in the ten on the street and kill worldwide 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:57.299
 Finally, the more you bump into the serve compared to the one 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.779
 Report they also failed failed said Roth of before 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.779
 a few years, however, is 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:06.450
 everything is possible 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.450
 like both Füssenacht Bilfinger 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.319
 Food the teams do 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.319
 this can 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.609
 Kurt really plays along 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.139
 Potsdam 17 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.879
 how do you see the stitches? 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.879
 to place over the market 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:29.089
 Hertha was still relieved 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.409
 who put them on said Alsmann it is not a lot of the investigators 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:33.020
 stated 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.020
 many must see it will take a while 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.620
 and she tells you by example they are American high school 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.019
 yes, too 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.709
 close 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.689
 where the problems would now be in the Bundestag that at least he would call me 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.449
 you have to see that 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.790
 we did a great job 1088 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.790
 "If someone is at home 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:17.369
 until 19 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:23.699
 Police of course things 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.029
 the driver of the technical aid organization 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.029
 the Briton he asserted 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.079
 and in Offenbach it is still a number bigger because there is no 

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:37.560
 Anniversary move to Israel ", said Slomka
