gesturing<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.640> take<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> quick<00:00:36.270> look<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.570> them

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
gesturing I take a quick look at them

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.990 
gesturing I take a quick look at them
here<00:00:37.040> don't<00:00:38.040> got<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> bit<00:00:38.309> tricky<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.610> perform

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
here don't got a bit tricky to perform

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.190 
here don't got a bit tricky to perform
real<00:00:39.180> life<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.719> give<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
real life but can it give a go with the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.560 
real life but can it give a go with the
camera<00:00:40.500> unlocked<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.090> kind<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.329> uses

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
camera unlocked now so this kind of uses

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.119 
camera unlocked now so this kind of uses
the<00:00:42.660> accelerometer<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.710> launch<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the accelerometer to kind of launch you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.040 
the accelerometer to kind of launch you
immediately<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> camera<00:00:45.300> hopefully

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
immediately into the camera hopefully

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.240 
immediately into the camera hopefully
speeding<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.410> when<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> really<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.160> take
