00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.810
 mercedes okay this is a little broken 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.150
 over here but well let's see how it 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.150
 see also the pile because it has a 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.860
 somewhat good system that you have it 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.189
 how do you change it good guys as you see 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.650
 here we have the command and the first thing that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.650
 we want what to do is take the key 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.540

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.780

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.290

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 little eyelash that with the screwdriver 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.100
 flat 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.850

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.070
 screwed 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.490

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:31.470

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.660
 introduce them with the positive pole 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 looking up towards the side 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.710
 crossed 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.920
 and the flat side 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.350

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.530
