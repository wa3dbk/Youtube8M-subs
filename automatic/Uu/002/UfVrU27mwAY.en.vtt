00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
when it's done it has flat ground for

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.360 
when it's done it has flat ground for
now<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.079> decided<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:58.890> gonna<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.219> everything

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
now I decided I'm gonna do everything

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.029 
now I decided I'm gonna do everything
just<00:00:59.850> fled<00:01:00.239> before<00:01:00.390> he<00:01:00.719> treat<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> convex

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
just fled before he treat and convex

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.620 
just fled before he treat and convex
afterwards<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.270> easier<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.189> also

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
afterwards it's just easier and also

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.700 
afterwards it's just easier and also
afterwards<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.990> still<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> take

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
afterwards because I still have to take

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.980 
afterwards because I still have to take
off<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.130> whole<00:01:08.310> metal<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.450> easy<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
off the whole metal and it's easy on the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
off the whole metal and it's easy on the
flight<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.439> then<00:01:10.680> con<00:01:10.920> vexing<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
flight and then con vexing is the the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.550 
flight and then con vexing is the the
easier<00:01:12.630> part<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.689> like<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.960> these<00:01:16.290> are

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
easier part and I like this these are

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.469 
easier part and I like this these are
