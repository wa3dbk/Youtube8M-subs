00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.690 
today on draw stuff real easy we're
gonna<00:00:02.639> draw<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.470> keyring<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.890> make<00:00:05.069> it<00:00:05.250> even

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
gonna draw a keyring and to make it even

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.970 
gonna draw a keyring and to make it even
easier<00:00:05.879> we're<00:00:06.390> gonna<00:00:06.509> plan<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> little<00:00:07.440> bit<00:00:07.649> and

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
easier we're gonna plan a little bit and

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
pencil to run over all and draw a curve

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.339 
pencil to run over all and draw a curve
there<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.030> clip<00:00:12.300> there<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.230> to

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
there and a clip there this is just to

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.189 
there and a clip there this is just to
give<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.740> feel<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.820> keyring<00:00:15.330> which<00:00:16.080> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
give you a feel for the keyring which is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.050 
give you a feel for the keyring which is
a<00:00:16.230> very<00:00:16.619> complicated<00:00:17.039> thing<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.609> we're<00:00:17.910> gonna

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
a very complicated thing but we're gonna

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.340 
a very complicated thing but we're gonna
do<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.050> then<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:20.010> gonna<00:00:20.130> want<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.580> have

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
do it and then you're gonna want to have

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.210 
do it and then you're gonna want to have
tube<00:00:22.350> there<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.210> then<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.600> gonna<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:25.220> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
tube there and then this is gonna be the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
tube there and then this is gonna be the
key<00:00:26.519> fault<00:00:27.150> itself<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:29.840> draw<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> little<00:00:31.140> curve

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
key fault itself so draw a little curve

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.080 
key fault itself so draw a little curve
like<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.420> follow<00:00:33.420> me<00:00:33.540> down<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.820> that's

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
like that follow me down and then that's

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.310 
like that follow me down and then that's
the<00:00:36.329> top<00:00:36.899> part<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.530> Ring<00:00:39.050> okay<00:00:40.050> we're<00:00:40.290> just

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the top part of the Ring okay we're just

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.869 
the top part of the Ring okay we're just
gonna<00:00:40.590> come<00:00:42.500> bring<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.739> along<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
gonna come bring this along here and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.830 
gonna come bring this along here and
that<00:00:45.090> goes<00:00:45.360> up<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.140> little<00:00:46.500> bit<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that goes up a little bit so this is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.330 
that goes up a little bit so this is
really<00:00:49.170> tricky<00:00:49.820> then<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.090> comes<00:00:52.340> around

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
really tricky then that comes around

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.869 
really tricky then that comes around
there<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.430> gonna<00:00:56.610> come

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
there like that and that is gonna come

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.000 
there like that and that is gonna come
around<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> join<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
around and join up with that one and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 
around and join up with that one and
we're<00:00:59.250> gonna<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.579> another<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.180> coming<00:01:00.780> in

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we're gonna get another one coming in

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
we're gonna get another one coming in
around<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.229> go<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.010> there

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
around there and that will go in there

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.450 
around there and that will go in there
so<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.970> kind<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.270> double<00:01:07.250> layer<00:01:08.250> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
so you get this kind of double layer of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.230 
so you get this kind of double layer of
the<00:01:08.580> thickness<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:10.040> keyring<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.090> do

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the thickness of the keyring you can do

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.219 
the thickness of the keyring you can do
it<00:01:13.460> okay<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it okay and then this is gonna be the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.399 
it okay and then this is gonna be the
key<00:01:16.439> fob<00:01:17.299> which<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> comes<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.229> there

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
key fob which kind of comes in there

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.440 
key fob which kind of comes in there
like<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:22.460> maybe<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.610> dotted<00:01:24.000> line<00:01:24.030> across

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
like that and maybe a dotted line across

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.630 
like that and maybe a dotted line across
there<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.140> we're<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.070> see

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
there and then we're gonna have I see

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
there and then we're gonna have I see
let's<00:01:26.850> put<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.720> thickness<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
let's put a little bit of thickness to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.999 
let's put a little bit of thickness to
this<00:01:29.299> thing<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.110> you'll<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.799> look

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
this thing and then you'll have a look

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.149 
this thing and then you'll have a look
kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:33.140> emblem<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> top<00:01:34.619> much<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.040> we

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
kind of a emblem on the top much so we

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.480 
kind of a emblem on the top much so we
have<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> smiley<00:01:35.820> face

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.550 

something<00:01:43.490> like<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.750> then<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.380> might

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
something like that and then you might

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.060 
something like that and then you might
want<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:45.860> just<00:01:46.150> draw<00:01:47.170> something<00:01:48.170> very<00:01:48.620> very

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
want to just draw something very very

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.110 
want to just draw something very very
simple<00:01:49.700> just<00:01:50.660> straight<00:01:51.020> lines<00:01:51.320> across<00:01:52.120> like

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
simple just straight lines across like

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.320 
simple just straight lines across like
that<00:01:53.480> to<00:01:53.930> kind<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.290> fill<00:01:54.530> in<00:01:54.560> there<00:01:55.120> give<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.210> a

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
that to kind of fill in there give it a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.860 
that to kind of fill in there give it a
shade<00:01:57.340> like<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:59.240> would<00:01:59.450> be<00:01:59.600> much

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
shade like that this would be much

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.770 
shade like that this would be much
darker<00:02:00.170> physics<00:02:00.860> in<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.220> shade<00:02:01.550> and<00:02:02.510> then

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
darker physics in the shade and then

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.900 
darker physics in the shade and then
we're<00:02:03.170> gonna<00:02:03.320> want<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.590> give<00:02:03.800> it<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.130> little<00:02:04.640> bit

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
we're gonna want to give it a little bit

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.260 
we're gonna want to give it a little bit
of<00:02:06.910> shade<00:02:07.910> like<00:02:08.210> that<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:09.440> then<00:02:10.270> probably

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
of shade like that and then probably

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.950 
of shade like that and then probably
that<00:02:11.510> will<00:02:11.690> want<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.020> be<00:02:12.140> dark<00:02:12.440> as<00:02:13.400> well<00:02:13.960> when

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
that will want to be dark as well when

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.470 
that will want to be dark as well when
the<00:02:15.080> ink<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.380> dry<00:02:15.820> erase<00:02:16.820> all<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.270> pencil

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
the ink is dry erase all the pencil

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.700 
the ink is dry erase all the pencil
lives<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:20.090> then<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.390> can<00:02:20.540> maybe<00:02:20.780> add<00:02:21.350> some

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
lives and then you can maybe add some

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.270 
lives and then you can maybe add some
extra<00:02:22.480> shadow<00:02:23.480> like<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.080> put<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.040> on

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
extra shadow like that just to put it on

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.940 
extra shadow like that just to put it on
the<00:02:28.640> table<00:02:28.910> as<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.390> always<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:29.930> say<00:02:32.950> make

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
the table as I always like to say make

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.710 
the table as I always like to say make
sure<00:02:33.980> you're<00:02:34.430> subscribed<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.270> draw<00:02:35.510> stuff

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
sure you're subscribed to the draw stuff
