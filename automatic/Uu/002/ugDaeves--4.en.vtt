00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.740 
in there have some corrosion so you can
bust<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.099> free<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.610> lubricate<00:02:09.509> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.200 

so<00:02:13.750> yet<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.110> can<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.670> basically<00:02:15.670> whatever<00:02:15.910> you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
so yet you can do basically whatever you

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.590 
so yet you can do basically whatever you
need<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:17.860> I've<00:02:18.040> decided<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.580> do<00:02:18.820> is

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
need to it what I've decided to do is

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.680 
need to it what I've decided to do is
something<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.970> we<00:02:21.970> wanted<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.300> do<00:02:22.450> for<00:02:22.600> a

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
something that we wanted to do for a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.680 
something that we wanted to do for a
little<00:02:22.870> while<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.320> I<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:25.300> know<00:02:25.390> have<00:02:25.570> the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
little while and I you know have the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.940 
little while and I you know have the
spare<00:02:25.960> set<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.350> I'm<00:02:26.410> gonna<00:02:26.530> take<00:02:26.800> this

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
spare set so I'm gonna take this

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.560 
spare set so I'm gonna take this
opportunity<00:02:27.520> I'm<00:02:28.090> gonna<00:02:28.240> make<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.390> little

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
opportunity I'm gonna make a little

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.030 
opportunity I'm gonna make a little
clock<00:02:28.810> out<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:32.380> right<00:02:32.560> now<00:02:32.710> I'm<00:02:32.830> just

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
clock out of it so right now I'm just

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.290 
clock out of it so right now I'm just
taking<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.490> apart<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:35.490> got<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:36.580> get<00:02:36.700> most<00:02:36.940> of<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
taking it apart I got to get most of the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.240 
taking it apart I got to get most of the
working<00:02:38.190> internal<00:02:39.190> pieces<00:02:39.630> out<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
working internal pieces out of it to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.270 
working internal pieces out of it to
make<00:02:42.280> room<00:02:42.670> for<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:43.260> clock<00:02:44.260> mechanism<00:02:44.470> so

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
make room for the clock mechanism so

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.770 
make room for the clock mechanism so
really<00:02:46.240> just<00:02:46.270> any<00:02:46.570> screw<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:48.940> see<00:02:49.330> I'm

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
really just any screw that I see I'm

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.570 
really just any screw that I see I'm
taking<00:02:50.230> apart<00:02:50.350> I'm<00:02:50.800> going<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.010> take<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.280> dial

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
taking apart I'm going to take this dial

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:00.630 
taking apart I'm going to take this dial
off<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.880> holds<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.980> face<00:02:56.980> on<00:02:57.280> all<00:02:59.460> right<00:03:00.460> so

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
off just holds the face on all right so

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.610 
off just holds the face on all right so
I<00:03:00.700> just<00:03:00.730> pulled<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.150> guts<00:03:01.360> out<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:04.620> pulled

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
I just pulled the guts out and pulled

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.020 
I just pulled the guts out and pulled
the<00:03:05.770> little<00:03:05.890> needle<00:03:06.340> off<00:03:07.020> needles<00:03:08.020> right<00:03:08.200> here

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
the little needle off needles right here

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.600 
the little needle off needles right here
so<00:03:10.030> that's<00:03:10.210> all<00:03:10.360> John<00:03:10.980> right<00:03:11.980> now<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.160> have<00:03:12.460> the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
so that's all John right now I have the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.060 
so that's all John right now I have the
faceplate<00:03:13.210> which<00:03:13.570> what<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.290> can<00:03:14.560> really<00:03:14.740> do<00:03:14.920> is

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
faceplate which what I can really do is

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.760 
faceplate which what I can really do is
just<00:03:15.100> glue<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.640> right<00:03:16.090> here<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.410> part<00:03:17.680> of

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
just glue it right here on this part of

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.190 
just glue it right here on this part of
the<00:03:17.860> case<00:03:18.360> there's<00:03:19.360> plenty<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.660> room<00:03:19.810> in<00:03:19.959> there

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
the case there's plenty of room in there

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.670 
the case there's plenty of room in there
for<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.790> know<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.060> clock<00:03:22.330> parts<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.050> then

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
for you know the clock parts and then

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.570 
for you know the clock parts and then
this<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:24.340> gets<00:03:24.550> mounted<00:03:25.060> right<00:03:25.330> back<00:03:25.600> in<00:03:26.580> the

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
this just gets mounted right back in the

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.220 
this just gets mounted right back in the
glass<00:03:27.880> case<00:03:27.910> just<00:03:28.600> like<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:30.930> all<00:03:31.930> right<00:03:31.989> so

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
glass case just like that all right so

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.500 
glass case just like that all right so
it's<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.440> next<00:03:32.620> day<00:03:32.770> this<00:03:33.580> morning<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:34.180> went<00:03:34.330> to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
it's the next day this morning I went to

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.330 
it's the next day this morning I went to
my<00:03:34.600> local<00:03:34.840> Walmart<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.620> picked<00:03:35.890> up<00:03:36.070> this

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
my local Walmart and picked up this

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.010 
my local Walmart and picked up this
little<00:03:37.000> clock<00:03:37.239> mechanism<00:03:39.720> comes<00:03:40.720> with<00:03:40.900> the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
little clock mechanism comes with the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.979 
little clock mechanism comes with the
arms<00:03:41.350> here<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:45.330> what<00:03:46.330> I'm<00:03:46.420> gonna<00:03:46.540> do<00:03:46.780> now<00:03:46.959> is

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
arms here and what I'm gonna do now is

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.410 
arms here and what I'm gonna do now is
I'm<00:03:47.230> going<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.530> take<00:03:47.739> my<00:03:47.890> dremel<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.520> it<00:03:48.700> shave

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
I'm going to take my dremel to it shave

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.080 
I'm going to take my dremel to it shave
this<00:03:49.600> down<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.900> little<00:03:50.020> bit<00:03:50.350> and<00:03:50.910> shave<00:03:51.910> this

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
this down a little bit and shave this

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.449 
this down a little bit and shave this
down<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.360> little<00:03:52.450> bit<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.709> will<00:03:53.860> fit<00:03:54.130> right

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
down a little bit so it will fit right

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.580 
down a little bit so it will fit right
in<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.090> center<00:03:55.420> there<00:03:55.450> right<00:03:56.080> now<00:03:56.230> it's<00:03:56.410> just

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
in the center there right now it's just

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.050 
in the center there right now it's just
a<00:03:56.739> little<00:03:56.830> bit<00:03:57.070> too<00:03:57.250> big<00:03:57.489> so<00:03:57.520> I'm<00:03:57.820> just<00:03:57.970> gonna

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
a little bit too big so I'm just gonna

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.170 
a little bit too big so I'm just gonna
squeeze<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.770> that<00:03:59.800> it<00:03:59.920> fits<00:04:03.030> all<00:04:04.030> right

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
squeeze it in so that it fits all right

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.150 
squeeze it in so that it fits all right
so<00:04:04.330> I've<00:04:04.420> cut<00:04:04.630> into<00:04:04.780> this<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.050> bit<00:04:05.170> I<00:04:05.620> made<00:04:06.130> a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
so I've cut into this a bit I made a

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.930 
so I've cut into this a bit I made a
couple<00:04:06.430> little<00:04:06.580> notches<00:04:09.660> now<00:04:10.660> my<00:04:10.780> faceplate

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.380 

this<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:14.900> just<00:04:15.110> gonna<00:04:15.290> pop<00:04:15.680> right<00:04:16.549> into<00:04:17.000> there

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
this is just gonna pop right into there

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.080 
this is just gonna pop right into there
a<00:04:17.769> couple<00:04:18.769> of<00:04:18.860> well-placed<00:04:19.070> drops<00:04:19.880> of

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
a couple of well-placed drops of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.490 
a couple of well-placed drops of
superglue<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:21.019> should<00:04:21.230> be<00:04:21.320> fairly

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
superglue and it should be fairly

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.460 
superglue and it should be fairly
permanent<00:04:22.360> now<00:04:23.360> I'm<00:04:23.480> gonna<00:04:23.690> stick<00:04:24.350> the

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
permanent now I'm gonna stick the

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.350 
permanent now I'm gonna stick the
battery<00:04:24.830> in<00:04:25.010> I'm<00:04:25.220> gonna<00:04:25.400> put<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:25.790> hands<00:04:26.180> on

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
battery in I'm gonna put the hands on

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.060 
battery in I'm gonna put the hands on
and<00:04:26.690> then<00:04:27.290> I'm<00:04:27.380> going<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.560> cut<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:27.890> little

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
and then I'm going to cut a little

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.570 
and then I'm going to cut a little
access<00:04:28.790> hole<00:04:29.120> right<00:04:29.930> here<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:30.740> we<00:04:31.400> can

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
access hole right here so that we can

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.500 
access hole right here so that we can
change<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.180> battery<00:04:32.480> in<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.630> future<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:35.330> so

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
change the battery in the future and so
