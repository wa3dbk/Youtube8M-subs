00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.679
 bah 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 we 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.620
 well-being and respect in 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.780
 part of the values ​​we defend 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 within the establishment but also make 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.880
 part of the values ​​of the red cross 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.850
 our main objective is to guarantee 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.100
 the well-being of the child by ensuring 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.200
 quality welcome to favor 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.160
 the autonomy of the child and his 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.300
 socialization 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.910
 we are in a district 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.150
 rather favored and it is important 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.440
 for us as a structure in red 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.130
 to also welcome audiences in 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.740
 difficulty 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.000
 we try to respect as much as possible 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.680
 principle of multi home 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.850
 it requires a great deal of flexibility 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.310
 part of the teams a great tolerance 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.840
 also try to be very flexible very 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 framing very happy even with the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.820
 floors 1 and this one is embedded in 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.420
 a great adventure that is that of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.590
 First 1000 days of baby awakening 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.740
 blossoming through the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.290
 physical development of the baby through 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.900
 his play area is also very 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.830
 important the proposed partnership so 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.620
 by headquarters services with nestlé 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.140
 are for us an opportunity to 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.720
 redevelop and rehabilitate gardens 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.550
 inner courtyard of nurseries since we 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.380
 are on lyon and that suddenly we 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.840
 are in an urban setting and that 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.659
 outdoor spaces are an element 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.070
 important for children who live in 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.110
 middle of the city and we asked them 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.040
 a project a bit in the continuity all 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.420
 the rest of the structure 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.710
 and then it was necessary that the soil also 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.869
 are arranged so that babies 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.280
 can go out alone and get off 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.590
 all alone so they made us 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.830
 this little wooden advance this 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.989
 small tent the soft floor has been renovated 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.120
 outdoor games have been renovated 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.340
 also a path for children 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.200
 so that they can ride with the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.540
 trucks every renovation is 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.730
 particular and specific to the nursery 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.010
 who hosts it and it brings space 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.260
 green it brings a living space 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.850
 additional to these nurseries and that's 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.920
 important for us that the baby can 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.470
 flourish in a space first 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.820
 secure and then with little ones 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:47.230
 very different games from a cool to 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:49.090
 the other or nestle is alongside 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.070
 parents and being brought up from near 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.320
 150 years old and I know you're going 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.560
 also on your side and soon celebrate 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.590
 150 years of the red cross so this is a 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.480
 more reason if we needed one of 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.519
 associate with gout and know you 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.730
