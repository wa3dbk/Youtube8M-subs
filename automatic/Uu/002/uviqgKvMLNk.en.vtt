00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.820
 puppy the boxer is a cheerful dog 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.420
 playful curious confident and full of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.140
 energy although it's a work breed it 's 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.840
 a very playful dog even up 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.570
 when he is an adult this has turned him 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.250
 in a dog preferred by families 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.380
 that have young children look I want 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.770
 propose a series of exercises 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.860
 easy and basic to educate your boxer 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.059
 the first is that the puppy or the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.800
 future adult dog be allowed to touch without 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.469
 impediments any part of your 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.770
 body and for that you must accustom 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.010
 what to strange people must learn 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.460
 that you do not have to worry about the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.850
 strangers if you do not look for people 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.560
 different and allows you to caress it 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.710
 You can even let me get awards 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.650
 If you let yourself touch another exercise , it's 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.659
 that accepts the presence of other dogs 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.180
 and strange people without showing up 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:28.770
 aggressive and for that you must accustom 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.979
 what other dogs at the beginning look for 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.899
 dogs of their age and that are 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.110
 reliable and quiet and do not force it 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:44.670
 make fast you want to relate 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.369
 this is little by little another exercise is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.270
 what the dog should know that you are 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.569
 good with how it is good to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 dedicate a few minutes every day to 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:02.340
 game reserves your favorite toy for 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.890
 that moment they really like the strings 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.429
 the knots and similar objects but with 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.450
 speed the toy 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.180
 on the ground to get his attention and 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.359
 the dog is going to try to catch it as if 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.000
 it was a dam let it 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:24.900
 once in a while I'll take it another way 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.329
 is to teach you to come to your call 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.480
 practice at home before giving 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:35.290
 eat call him and tell him to come 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.069
 towards you that when approaching they offer you a 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.950
 piece of food after call it but 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.620
 Now with the food in your fist and reward 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.019
 what and in that way you will know that 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.780
 he will always want to be near you 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.959
 because you have something to give another 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.349
 exercise that helps a lot at the same time 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.780
 our dogs is to brush it and bathe it 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.719
 with a regular shape 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.480
 if you do not know what time you owe tomorrow 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.250
 to your puppy when a dog 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.370
 Ask your canine hairdresser what 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.239
 frequency would be the appropriate one 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.370
 these actions help the dog to 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.099
 let touch everywhere 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.260
 it does not matter if your dog is hair 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:25.330
 short anyway needs care 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.269
 likewise one that has long hair 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.780
 because because we're going to get used to it 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:36.129
 let yourself manipulate caress and amis 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.220

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.349
