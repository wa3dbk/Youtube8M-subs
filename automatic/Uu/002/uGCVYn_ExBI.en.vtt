00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 good these attached to a new video 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.220
 good and gasol update available 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 of gta 5 the 1.03 and good away from 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.219
 rockstar to clarify a bit for what 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.570
 serves this update because it is not yet 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.660
 have said nothing is already available for 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.690
 playstation3 so I guess that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.890
 also be available too 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.720
 first the comments 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.480
 lately we can get a little more 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 late the patches in the xbox and good we 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.439
 usually pull out already totally or not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.880
 have any problem that will end 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.850
 leave what they will have taken out if they have not 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.760
 taken out yet as I say far from 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.170
 rockstar solve a little natural of the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.750
 people have not yet put for what 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.000
 serves that patch I can not say anything 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.350
 official and I can not assure anything 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.149
 that is for the loss of the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.739
 characters since it seems good that 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.710
 still people are still disappearing 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.300
 to the characters and things like that 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 so well I can not confirm anything of 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 We will still see that caliber to see what it is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 what rockstar says is putting 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.840
 his is getting into his web page 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 vital to look at the forums a bit to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.500
 look what the people put the news 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.540
 and so and so are answering how we 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.300
 that a little later today 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.680
 that we will have news about what 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.550
 contains this patch 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.930
 let's hope it contains that we hope that 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.670
 contain that we are sure the characters 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.260
 this kind of thing because what is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.870
 saying most of the websites and 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.850
 is that it is serving to 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.470
 bonuses to patch a bit what 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.560
 would be the failures to get money 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.970
 extra bonuses of that kind of books that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.970
 really, well, they would make us a little 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.710
 enrich us inside the game 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.900
 and this would be a bit of a strategy 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.670
 filthy not since you know how good that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.960
 that's one of the things that can be 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.340
 buy from astoria the money 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.320
 within the game with which I 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.720
 it will seem a bit absurd that rockstar 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.730
 really I would like to correct that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.230
 before a problem that really is 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.490
 Fucking a lot more people like that 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.520
 How good we hope to see what it is that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.729
 happens for now we can not talk anything 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.929
 and nothing the patch 1.03 I do not know what 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.500
 contains still so good 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:04.890
 we'll wait for rockstar as 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.569
 point to your official blog and you're 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.369
 because like him a little one 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.349
 pretty slow poquillo again see you 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.040
 for example a call of duty patch 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.200
 always is there right away what 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.180
 contains is a pretty pretty list 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.890
 long so good we'll see let's hope 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.390
 that do not take long to encourage that 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.099
 yes they will take a long time and nothing in 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.080
 how much do they have it since they went up 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.489
 overcoming everything you do and see 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.489
 in the next video because he showed
