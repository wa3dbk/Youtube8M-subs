00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
we produced lots of different lettuces

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.859 
we produced lots of different lettuces
then<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:56.280> also<00:01:56.490> takes<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:57.090> water<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.630> brings

it over in here dumps it down in here

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.320 
it over in here dumps it down in here
recirculate<00:02:02.250> through<00:02:02.550> these<00:02:02.930> clay<00:02:03.930> balls

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
recirculate through these clay balls

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.580 
recirculate through these clay balls
here's<00:02:06.330> another<00:02:06.570> little<00:02:06.780> plant<00:02:07.110> growing<00:02:07.350> in

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
bit you have water right there so we can

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:26.990 
bit you have water right there so we can
grow<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.070> plants<00:02:26.400> right<00:02:26.580> here<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:26.880> this

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.420 
grow the plants right here in this
medium<00:02:27.560> or<00:02:28.560> we<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.860> grow<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.130> up<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
medium or we can grow it up in the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.330 
medium or we can grow it up in the
bucket<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:31.290> when<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.620> grow<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
bucket and when we grow it it up in the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.820 
bucket and when we grow it it up in the
bucket<00:02:32.519> all<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.540> excess<00:02:33.959> water<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.470> clean

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830

water drops down there and rating the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.390 
water drops down there and rating the
water<00:02:45.670> okay<00:02:47.380> let's<00:02:48.380> see<00:02:48.590> if<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.770> can<00:02:48.950> stand<00:02:49.160> up<00:02:49.340> a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
water okay let's see if I can stand up a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.240 
water okay let's see if I can stand up a
little<00:02:49.550> higher<00:02:51.460> you'll<00:02:52.460> see<00:02:52.730> I'd<00:02:53.600> have<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.960> get

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
little higher you'll see I'd have to get

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:04.330 
little higher you'll see I'd have to get
let<00:02:55.250> me<00:02:55.310> go<00:02:55.490> in<00:02:55.670> here<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.830> get<00:02:58.040> up<00:02:58.220> real<00:02:58.460> high

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.950 

they<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.550> get<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.730> view<00:03:06.560> call<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.770> plant

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.920 

okay<00:03:14.820> all<00:03:15.820> right<00:03:16.770> how<00:03:17.770> this<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:19.780> an

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
okay all right how this it's just an

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.470 
okay all right how this it's just an
experimental<00:03:20.800> project<00:03:21.070> I'm<00:03:22.000> not<00:03:22.270> really

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
experimental project I'm not really

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.500 
experimental project I'm not really
going<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.780> grow<00:03:23.020> them<00:03:23.200> like<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.710> I<00:03:24.210> just<00:03:25.210> want

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
going to grow them like that I just want

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
going to grow them like that I just want
to<00:03:25.750> see<00:03:26.910> what<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.030> nutrient<00:03:28.570> factors<00:03:29.080> will<00:03:29.320> do

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
to see what the nutrient factors will do

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.550 
to see what the nutrient factors will do
to<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.380> plant<00:03:33.720> because<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:35.050> have<00:03:35.380> this

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
to the to the plant because I have this

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.950 
to the to the plant because I have this
thing's<00:03:35.800> heavily<00:03:36.250> stock<00:03:36.750> they're<00:03:37.750> anywhere

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
thing's heavily stock they're anywhere

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.100 
thing's heavily stock they're anywhere
from<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.380> quarter<00:03:39.010> pound<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:40.110> three-quarters

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
from a quarter pound to three-quarters

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.910 
from a quarter pound to three-quarters
of<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.350> pound

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
of a pound

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.170 
of a pound
the<00:03:42.070> kalapa<00:03:42.459> fish<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:44.920> over<00:03:45.310> 400<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.030> them

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
the kalapa fish so this over 400 of them

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.390 
the kalapa fish so this over 400 of them
into<00:03:46.620> 1,200<00:03:47.620> gallon<00:03:48.130> tank<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:49.410> have<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> 450

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
into 1,200 gallon tank I have a 450

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.340 
into 1,200 gallon tank I have a 450
gallon<00:03:52.020> reservoir<00:03:53.020> to<00:03:53.680> collect<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.100> waste

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
gallon reservoir to collect the waste

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.830 
gallon reservoir to collect the waste
and<00:03:56.350> then<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.560> goes<00:03:56.709> back<00:03:56.950> up<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.400> plant<00:03:57.840> so

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
and then it goes back up to the plant so

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.750 
and then it goes back up to the plant so
you<00:03:59.739> hear<00:03:59.950> a<00:03:59.980> lot<00:04:00.130> of<00:04:00.190> people<00:04:00.370> growing

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
you hear a lot of people growing

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.080 
you hear a lot of people growing
hydroponically<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:02.370> actually<00:04:03.370> want<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.760> see
