00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello youtube people here who is talking 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.230
 Cleiton Adventure and I'll Present 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.290
 One more video lesson for you on this one. 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.250
 Today's video lesson will show you how 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.710
 solve a problem that sometimes 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 happens a windows firewall 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.449
 this problem is the following when you 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.510
 goes there in the configuration window of 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.340
 and you try to activate by clicking 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.490
 here in this option here use 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.980
 recommended settings it does not 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.080
 and this window appears and here 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.550
 with this message written the firewall of the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.130
 windows can not change some 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.690
 Diego code settings and see one 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.370
 number like this 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.190
 and then I had this problem I think the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.350
 and worked right here on your computer 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.700
 I can not guarantee that it will work 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.739
 all computers that try to 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.660
 apply this procedure but I believe 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.460
 that a good part of the computers that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.079
 Procedures have been applied. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.210
 Yes, because here I gave it right then. 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 I believe a lot of people will 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.530
 to be able to resolve this firewall error 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.210
 with this procedure that voting 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.480
 featuring now okay then is as follows 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.489
 will appear in this window here is not 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.150
