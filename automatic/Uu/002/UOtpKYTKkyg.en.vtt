in<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.810> video<00:00:01.170> we<00:00:01.860> will<00:00:02.010> show<00:00:02.220> you<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.520> to

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
in this video we will show you how to

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.329 
in this video we will show you how to
make<00:00:02.790> increases<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:03.659> Tunisian<00:00:04.140> crochet<00:00:04.339> that

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
make increases in Tunisian crochet that

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.610 
make increases in Tunisian crochet that
is<00:00:05.549> three<00:00:06.060> different<00:00:06.180> ways<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.600> increase<00:00:07.319> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
is three different ways to increase the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.070 
is three different ways to increase the
number<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.919> stitches<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.760> row<00:00:08.790> on<00:00:09.210> purpose

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
number of stitches in a row on purpose

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.770 
number of stitches in a row on purpose
for<00:00:10.320> shaping<00:00:11.059> decreases<00:00:12.059> add<00:00:12.240> shaping<00:00:12.660> as

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
for shaping decreases add shaping as

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.410 
for shaping decreases add shaping as
well<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.259> show<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.830> another<00:00:14.070> video

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
well and we show that in another video

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.790 
well and we show that in another video
in<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.509> three<00:00:15.809> ways<00:00:16.020> we're<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.560> show

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
in the three ways we're going to show

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.660 
in the three ways we're going to show
you<00:00:16.859> our<00:00:17.539> way<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.779> way<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> add<00:00:19.500> stitches<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
you our way a way to add stitches on the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.750 
you our way a way to add stitches on the
right<00:00:20.910> edge<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.539> cluster<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.230> add<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.310> cluster

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
right edge in a cluster to add a cluster

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.269 
right edge in a cluster to add a cluster
of<00:00:23.850> stitches<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> left<00:00:24.720> edge<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.289> also<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
of stitches on the left edge and also to

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.790 
of stitches on the left edge and also to
add<00:00:26.609> an<00:00:27.000> individual<00:00:27.689> stitch<00:00:27.990> somewhere<00:00:28.560> in

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
add an individual stitch somewhere in

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
add an individual stitch somewhere in
the<00:00:28.949> midst<00:00:29.160> over<00:00:29.670> well<00:00:31.340> here<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:33.149> de

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the midst over well here we have a de

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.080 
the midst over well here we have a de
nice<00:00:34.079> interchangeable<00:00:34.770> crochet<00:00:35.219> hook<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
nice interchangeable crochet hook and a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.060 
nice interchangeable crochet hook and a
small<00:00:36.390> piece<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.750> Tunisian<00:00:37.649> simple<00:00:37.890> stitch

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
small piece of Tunisian simple stitch

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.760 
small piece of Tunisian simple stitch
and<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:39.360> way<00:00:39.660> we're<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.590> add

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and the first way we're going to add

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.950 
and the first way we're going to add
stitches<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.460> by<00:00:41.700> adding<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> cluster<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:42.809> on

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
stitches is by adding a cluster here on

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.830 
stitches is by adding a cluster here on
the<00:00:43.079> right<00:00:43.290> edge<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.270> we're<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> chain

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the right edge and we're going to chain

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.610 
the right edge and we're going to chain
for<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.590> many<00:00:46.860> stitches<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> add

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
for as many stitches as we want to add

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.290 
for as many stitches as we want to add
let's<00:00:49.620> say<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:49.980> want<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> add<00:00:50.309> three<00:00:50.879> stitches

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
let's say we want to add three stitches

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.170 
let's say we want to add three stitches
so<00:00:51.449> we've<00:00:51.600> chained<00:00:51.960> three<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.579> treat<00:00:53.969> this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
so we've chained three now we treat this

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.260 
so we've chained three now we treat this
mini<00:00:54.750> chain<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.710> did<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.520> foundation<00:00:56.910> row

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
mini chain as we did the foundation row

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.750 
mini chain as we did the foundation row
which<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.629> show<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.989> another<00:00:58.260> video<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
which we show in another video that is

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.150 
which we show in another video that is
we<00:01:00.090> skip<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.780> chain<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.320> closest<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
we skip the chain that is closest to the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.969 
we skip the chain that is closest to the
hook<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:03.329> put<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> hook<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:03.989> from<00:01:04.680> front

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
hook and we put the hook in from front

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.090 
hook and we put the hook in from front
to<00:01:05.040> back<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:06.030> next<00:01:06.510> chain<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> draw<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:07.979> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
to back the next chain and draw up a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
to back the next chain and draw up a
loop<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.549> add<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.170> was

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
loop and add it to the one that was

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.679 
loop and add it to the one that was
already<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> hook<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:12.119> into<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> next

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
already on the hook go into the next

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.999 
already on the hook go into the next
chain<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> draw<00:01:14.070> up<00:01:14.390> another<00:01:15.390> loop<00:01:15.830> here<00:01:16.830> we

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
chain and draw up another loop here we

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.820 
chain and draw up another loop here we
have<00:01:17.220> three<00:01:17.939> new<00:01:18.119> stitches<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.200> right<00:01:19.560> of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
have three new stitches to the right of

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.090 
have three new stitches to the right of
what<00:01:20.070> used<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.880> edge<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.270> our<00:01:21.420> work<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
what used to be the edge of our work and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.289 
what used to be the edge of our work and
the<00:01:23.100> next<00:01:23.580> post<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:25.549> used<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.090> edge

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the next post we see used to be the edge

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.450 
the next post we see used to be the edge
of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> work<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.290> did<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.680> work<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.250> when

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
of the work and we did not work it when

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.340 
of the work and we did not work it when
it<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> selvage<00:01:30.270> stitch<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> no

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it was the selvage stitch but it is no

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.740 
it was the selvage stitch but it is no
longer<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> edge<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:32.750> incorporated

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
longer the edge it is now incorporated

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.390 
longer the edge it is now incorporated
into<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.170> row<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.909> work<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.450> normal

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
into the row and so we work it as normal

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.210 
into the row and so we work it as normal
in<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.549> case<00:01:38.850> Tunisian<00:01:39.450> simple<00:01:39.930> stitch

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
in this case Tunisian simple stitch

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.530 
in this case Tunisian simple stitch
let's<00:01:41.220> say<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.640> where<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> add

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
let's say this is where we want to add

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.889 
let's say this is where we want to add
another<00:01:43.340> stitch<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.640> somewhere<00:01:45.630> tucked

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
another stitch just somewhere tucked

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.060 
another stitch just somewhere tucked
into<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.380> row<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.930> before<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.140> work<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.829> next

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
into the row and before we work the next

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.749 
into the row and before we work the next
post<00:01:50.689> we<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.530> add<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.490> stitch

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
post we are going to add the stitch

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
post we are going to add the stitch
right<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.119> between<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.899> post<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.320> just

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
right here between the post we just

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280 
right here between the post we just
worked<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.310> next<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.119> I'm<00:01:58.020> drawing

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
worked and the next one and I'm drawing

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.780 
worked and the next one and I'm drawing
this<00:01:58.530> apart<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.159> make<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.610> clearer<00:02:01.490> we<00:02:02.490> work

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
this apart to make it a clearer we work

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.899 
this apart to make it a clearer we work
under<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:04.020> horizontal<00:02:04.890> bar<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.759> is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
under this horizontal bar that is

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.059 
under this horizontal bar that is
between<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.630> post<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.259> worked<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
between the post just worked and the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.479 
between the post just worked and the
next<00:02:08.399> post<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:09.390> put<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.020> hook<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.649> from<00:02:11.220> front

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
next post we put the hook in from front

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.390 
next post we put the hook in from front
to<00:02:11.550> back<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.480> draw<00:02:12.720> up<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:13.020> loop

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
to back and we draw up a loop

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.059 
to back and we draw up a loop
now<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.239> new<00:02:14.450> loop<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.930> coming<00:02:15.379> from<00:02:15.530> farther

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
now this new loop is coming from farther

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.580 
now this new loop is coming from farther
down<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.790> fabric<00:02:17.269> then<00:02:17.870> loops<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.530> are

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
down in the fabric then loops that are

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.910 
down in the fabric then loops that are
made<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.190> top<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:20.420> post<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.409> we<00:02:21.590> want<00:02:21.799> to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
made in the top of a post so we want to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.280 
made in the top of a post so we want to
be<00:02:22.040> sure<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.489> we<00:02:22.610> leave<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.390> little<00:02:24.140> bit

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
be sure that we leave that a little bit

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.770 
be sure that we leave that a little bit
looser<00:02:24.650> otherwise<00:02:25.400> we<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> tendency<00:02:26.599> to

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
looser otherwise we have a tendency to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.050 
looser otherwise we have a tendency to
create<00:02:26.959> an<00:02:27.290> eyelet<00:02:27.769> here<00:02:28.069> which<00:02:28.640> might<00:02:28.879> be

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
create an eyelet here which might be

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.449 
create an eyelet here which might be
just<00:02:29.330> what<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.629> want<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.799> if<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.010> isn't<00:02:31.310> leave

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
just what you want but if it isn't leave

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.089 
just what you want but if it isn't leave
that<00:02:31.670> loose<00:02:31.940> work<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.930> next<00:02:33.079> post<00:02:33.470> as<00:02:33.890> you

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
that loose work the next post as you

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.869 
that loose work the next post as you
normally<00:02:34.430> would

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
normally would

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.920 
normally would
and<00:02:35.090> here<00:02:35.989> we<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.940> three<00:02:37.940> loops<00:02:38.180> up<00:02:38.480> here

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
and here we have three loops up here

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.229 
and here we have three loops up here
where<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.159> previous<00:02:40.670> row

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
where in the previous row

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.319 
where in the previous row
there<00:02:41.540> were<00:02:41.659> only<00:02:41.840> two<00:02:42.319> posts<00:02:43.040> one<00:02:43.730> here<00:02:44.180> and

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
there were only two posts one here and

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.380 
there were only two posts one here and
one<00:02:44.720> here<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.310> new<00:02:46.489> stitch<00:02:47.180> in

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
one here and this is the new stitch in

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.970 
one here and this is the new stitch in
between<00:02:47.980> we'll<00:02:48.980> do<00:02:49.099> one<00:02:49.280> more<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.519> those<00:02:50.980> let's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
between we'll do one more of those let's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.199 
between we'll do one more of those let's
