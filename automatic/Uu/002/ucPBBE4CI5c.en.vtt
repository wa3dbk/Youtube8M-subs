don't forget to smooth the edges on the
top<00:03:35.700> as<00:03:35.939> well<00:03:35.969> I<00:03:39.139> recommend<00:03:40.139> going<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.409> a

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:40.469 
top as well I recommend going in a

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.470 
top as well I recommend going in a
curving<00:03:40.980> motion<00:03:41.310> don't<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:41.670> like<00:03:41.790> file<00:03:42.180> up

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
curving motion don't just like file up

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.289 
curving motion don't just like file up
like<00:03:42.689> like<00:03:43.019> this<00:03:43.319> like<00:03:44.310> actually<00:03:44.730> curve<00:03:45.090> it

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
like like this like actually curve it

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.849 
like like this like actually curve it
because<00:03:45.510> that's<00:03:45.659> the<00:03:45.959> shape<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.349> want<00:03:46.590> like

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
because that's the shape you want like

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.800 
because that's the shape you want like
follow<00:03:47.219> the<00:03:47.489> shapes<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.909> you<00:03:48.030> want<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.569> then

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
follow the shapes that you want and then

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.800 
follow the shapes that you want and then
you've<00:03:48.989> got<00:03:49.109> your<00:03:49.230> Fang<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:51.060> then<00:03:51.209> just<00:03:51.389> smooth

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
you've got your Fang so then just smooth

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.309 
you've got your Fang so then just smooth
that<00:03:52.049> on<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.260> little<00:03:52.590> bit<00:03:52.829> over<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.250> top<00:03:53.489> and

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
that on a little bit over the top and

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.379 
that on a little bit over the top and
put<00:03:55.319> it<00:03:55.439> on<00:03:55.560> your<00:03:55.709> tooth<00:03:55.980> above<00:03:56.790> where<00:03:57.239> your

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
put it on your tooth above where your

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.420 
put it on your tooth above where your
natural<00:03:57.480> tooth<00:03:57.840> ends<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.379> sort<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.189> gum<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
natural tooth ends on sort of the gum a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.800 
natural tooth ends on sort of the gum a
little<00:03:59.790> bit<00:03:59.909> so<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.150> get<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.329> little<00:04:00.629> bit<00:04:00.719> of

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
little bit so you get a little bit of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.000 
little bit so you get a little bit of
the<00:04:00.900> gums<00:04:01.049> on<00:04:01.230> there<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.500> has<00:04:01.620> something<00:04:01.769> to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
the gums on there and has something to

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.209 
the gums on there and has something to
adhere<00:04:02.159> to<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:03.209> like<00:04:03.359> I<00:04:03.480> said<00:04:03.949> make<00:04:04.949> sure<00:04:05.010> your

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:05.219 
adhere to but like I said make sure your

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:12.979 
adhere to but like I said make sure your
teeth<00:04:05.400> are<00:04:05.549> dry<00:04:09.919> smooth<00:04:10.919> under<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.810> then

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
teeth are dry smooth under and then

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.179 
teeth are dry smooth under and then
finally<00:04:13.379> when<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.560> want<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.739> take<00:04:13.919> them<00:04:14.069> off

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
finally when you want to take them off

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.189 
finally when you want to take them off
then<00:04:14.639> just<00:04:14.819> try<00:04:14.969> going<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.569> with<00:04:15.719> your<00:04:15.840> finger

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
and prying it out a little bit and then

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.260 
and prying it out a little bit and then
you<00:04:22.680> have<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:23.039> residue<00:04:23.430> left<00:04:23.610> over<00:04:23.849> and<00:04:24.210> you
