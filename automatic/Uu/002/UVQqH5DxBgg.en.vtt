all right this video is going to show

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.710 
all right this video is going to show
you<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.510> can<00:00:03.720> swap<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> thermostat<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.720> a

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
you how you can swap a thermostat on a

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.720 
you how you can swap a thermostat on a
4.2<00:00:07.589> liter<00:00:08.210> v8<00:00:09.210> out<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.750> engine<00:00:10.580> they<00:00:11.580> use

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
4.2 liter v8 out of the engine they use

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.789 
4.2 liter v8 out of the engine they use
these<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.360> bunch<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.840> Audi's<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
these in a bunch of the Audi's the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.849 
these in a bunch of the Audi's the
a-sixes<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> a8<00:00:15.740> starting<00:00:16.740> in

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
a-sixes in the and the a8 starting in

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.560 
a-sixes in the and the a8 starting in
2000<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:19.400> one<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> redesigns<00:00:21.180> this

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
2000 and one of the redesigns this

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.870 
2000 and one of the redesigns this
engines<00:00:21.960> got<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.439> nice<00:00:22.619> upgrades<00:00:22.890> over<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
engines got some nice upgrades over the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.820 
engines got some nice upgrades over the
32<00:00:24.390> valve<00:00:24.660> engine<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> things

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
32 valve engine but one of the things

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.560 
32 valve engine but one of the things
it's<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> definite<00:00:26.609> downside<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
it's a definite downside is the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.339 
it's a definite downside is the
thermostat<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.789> located<00:00:29.789> behind<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.990> timing

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
thermostat is located behind the timing

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
thermostat is located behind the timing
belt<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.369> by<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.550> book<00:00:32.669> you're<00:00:33.059> supposed<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
belt so by the book you're supposed to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.799 
belt so by the book you're supposed to
remove<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.050> timing<00:00:34.410> belt<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.690> basically<00:00:36.690> do

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
remove the timing belt and basically do

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.200 
remove the timing belt and basically do
the<00:00:36.899> timing<00:00:37.110> belt<00:00:37.320> job<00:00:37.860> from<00:00:38.579> scratch<00:00:38.940> in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the timing belt job from scratch in

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.810 
the timing belt job from scratch in
order<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.510> remove<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> thermostat<00:00:40.820> there's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
order to remove the thermostat there's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.220 
order to remove the thermostat there's
been<00:00:42.030> some<00:00:42.239> post<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.719> there<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.140> I've

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
been some post out there and I've

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.540 
been some post out there and I've
actually<00:00:43.350> done<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.710> once<00:00:44.010> before<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
actually done this once before but I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.299 
actually done this once before but I
didn't<00:00:44.820> shoot<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.210> video<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.890> how<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.160> do

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
didn't shoot any video on how you can do

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
didn't shoot any video on how you can do
this<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.760> leave<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.360> timing<00:00:48.719> belt<00:00:48.840> intact

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this and leave the timing belt intact

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.160 
this and leave the timing belt intact
and<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> that's<00:00:50.940> exactly<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.480> I'm<00:00:51.570> doing<00:00:51.600> so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
and so that's exactly what I'm doing so

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.400 
and so that's exactly what I'm doing so
the<00:00:52.440> first<00:00:52.739> thing<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.039> did<00:00:53.690> was<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.840> drain<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the first thing I did was I drain the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.900 
the first thing I did was I drain the
block<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:57.030> driver's<00:00:57.629> side<00:00:58.609> there's<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> 10

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
block on the driver's side there's a 10

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
block on the driver's side there's a 10
millimeter<00:01:00.239> hex<00:01:00.600> tube<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.670> remove

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
millimeter hex tube so if you remove

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.100 
millimeter hex tube so if you remove
that<00:01:02.969> you'll<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:05.119> about<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.420> much<00:01:06.630> coolant

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
that you'll get about that much coolant

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.410 
that you'll get about that much coolant
out<00:01:07.260> mine<00:01:08.010> was<00:01:08.250> clogged<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.030> there's<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> whole

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
out mine was clogged so there's a whole

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.590 
out mine was clogged so there's a whole
bunch<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.720> dirt<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.229> came<00:01:10.409> along<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.890> it

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
bunch of dirt that came along with it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.880 
bunch of dirt that came along with it
but<00:01:12.600> that's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.170> hat<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.530> don't<00:01:13.650> know<00:01:13.710> how<00:01:13.770> much

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
but that's a hat I don't know how much

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
but that's a hat I don't know how much
that<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.549> actually<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.479> know<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that that is actually there you know a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.039 
that that is actually there you know a
gallon<00:01:16.290> gallon<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.400> half<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:18.060> coolant<00:01:18.930> that

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
gallon gallon and a half of coolant that

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.149 
gallon gallon and a half of coolant that
came<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.970> that's<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.210> i<00:01:21.240> drained<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.619> stuck<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
came out that's all i drained I stuck a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
came out that's all i drained I stuck a
plastic<00:01:23.640> bag<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> remove<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
plastic bag here so when I remove the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.770 
plastic bag here so when I remove the
thermostat<00:01:26.210> not<00:01:27.210> sure<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.479> there's<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
thermostat not sure if there's going to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
thermostat not sure if there's going to
be<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> flood<00:01:28.140> or<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> whether<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.490> should

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
be a flood or not and whether I should

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.359 
be a flood or not and whether I should
have<00:01:29.970> drained<00:01:30.299> some<00:01:30.659> out<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> radiator

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
have drained some out of the radiator

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.300 
have drained some out of the radiator
but<00:01:32.369> I'll<00:01:32.759> find<00:01:32.970> out<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> few<00:01:33.420> minutes<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> did

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
but I'll find out a few minutes so I did

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.770 
but I'll find out a few minutes so I did
that<00:01:35.430> first<00:01:36.200> had<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> remove<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.299> fan<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.570> fan

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that first had to remove the fan and fan

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.319 
that first had to remove the fan and fan
clutch<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> free<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:41.939> some<00:01:42.119> room

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
clutch here just to free up some room

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.819 
clutch here just to free up some room
and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.380> loosen<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> drive<00:01:44.369> belt<00:01:45.590> here

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
and then I loosen the drive belt here

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.109 
and then I loosen the drive belt here
and<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.310> drop<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.000> way

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and just drop that out of the way

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609 
and just drop that out of the way
because<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.509> obstructs<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> bolts

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
because that obstructs one of the bolts

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.170 
because that obstructs one of the bolts
on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.159> thermostat<00:01:50.520> housing

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
on the thermostat housing

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
on the thermostat housing
I<00:01:51.890> hate<00:01:52.890> you'll<00:01:53.040> probably<00:01:53.250> notice<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.030> had<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
I hate you'll probably notice I had the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.330 
I hate you'll probably notice I had the
electric<00:01:54.570> fan<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.320> unrelated<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
electric fan out but that's unrelated to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.179 
electric fan out but that's unrelated to
this<00:01:56.520> job<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> bad<00:01:58.500> fan<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.100> I'm

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
this job I got I have a bad fan so I'm

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.590 
this job I got I have a bad fan so I'm
going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> swap<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.610> out<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.360> really

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
going to swap that out but you really

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.700 
going to swap that out but you really
don't<00:02:00.750> need<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.250> remove<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.710> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
don't need to remove it to do this and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.609 
don't need to remove it to do this and
then<00:02:05.009> I've<00:02:05.130> got<00:02:05.310> three<00:02:06.049> timing<00:02:07.049> belt<00:02:07.200> covers

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
then I've got three timing belt covers

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.429 
then I've got three timing belt covers
removed

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:09.439 
removed

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.399 
removed
so<00:02:10.009> we've<00:02:10.159> got<00:02:10.369> pretty<00:02:10.579> clear<00:02:10.789> access<00:02:11.409> so

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
so we've got pretty clear access so

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:13.330 
so we've got pretty clear access so
those<00:02:12.560> are<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.709> only<00:02:12.799> things<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.129> need<00:02:13.189> to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
those are the only things you need to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.449 
those are the only things you need to
remove<00:02:14.109> and<00:02:15.109> then<00:02:15.469> what<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.620> did<00:02:15.739> was<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:16.069> mark

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
remove and then what I did was a mark

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.099 
remove and then what I did was a mark
the<00:02:16.609> belt<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:17.060> can<00:02:17.180> see<00:02:17.390> those<00:02:17.569> two<00:02:17.750> marks

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
the belt you can see those two marks

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.190 
the belt you can see those two marks
there<00:02:18.409> and<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.819> put<00:02:19.969> a<00:02:20.030> zip<00:02:20.299> tie<00:02:20.480> on<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.689> top<00:02:20.989> and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
there and I put a zip tie on the top and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.309 
there and I put a zip tie on the top and
the<00:02:21.290> bottom<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.760> left<00:02:23.030> enough<00:02:23.299> slack<00:02:23.689> so

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
the bottom but I left enough slack so

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.429 
the bottom but I left enough slack so
that<00:02:24.469> I<00:02:24.500> could<00:02:24.650> pull<00:02:24.829> the<00:02:24.980> belt<00:02:25.220> forward<00:02:26.439> you

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
that I could pull the belt forward you

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.960 
that I could pull the belt forward you
can<00:02:27.590> see<00:02:27.739> it's<00:02:27.859> not<00:02:27.980> quite<00:02:28.310> halfway<00:02:28.549> on<00:02:28.879> the

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
can see it's not quite halfway on the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.099 
can see it's not quite halfway on the
camp<00:02:29.239> sprocket<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:32.390> know<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.659> zip<00:02:32.959> tie

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
camp sprocket and you know that zip tie

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.479 
camp sprocket and you know that zip tie
would<00:02:33.319> prevent<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.709> from<00:02:33.769> coming<00:02:34.159> off

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
would prevent it from coming off

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.330 
would prevent it from coming off
completely<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.680> then<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.769> just<00:02:37.010> pulled<00:02:37.250> it

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
completely and then I just pulled it

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.300 
completely and then I just pulled it
forward<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.879> then<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:39.230> twist<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.680> belt<00:02:39.829> to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
forward and then can twist the belt to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.580 
forward and then can twist the belt to
get<00:02:40.459> some<00:02:40.609> slack<00:02:40.909> now<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.900> other<00:02:42.109> thing<00:02:42.319> I<00:02:42.409> did

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
get some slack now the other thing I did

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.410 
get some slack now the other thing I did
which<00:02:42.799> I<00:02:42.920> didn't<00:02:43.129> mention<00:02:43.280> was<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.609> rotated<00:02:44.269> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
which I didn't mention was I rotated the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.899 
which I didn't mention was I rotated the
engine<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.829> get<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.220> point<00:02:46.459> where<00:02:46.730> the

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
engine to get to the point where the

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.869 
engine to get to the point where the
belt<00:02:47.180> has<00:02:47.480> got<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.079> most<00:02:48.260> slack<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.919> it

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
belt has got the most slack on it

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.250 
belt has got the most slack on it
these<00:02:50.239> engines<00:02:50.799> there's<00:02:51.799> a<00:02:51.859> certain<00:02:52.310> point

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
these engines there's a certain point

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.080 
these engines there's a certain point
where<00:02:54.260> if<00:02:54.530> you've<00:02:54.739> noticed<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.549> before

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
where if you've noticed this before

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.110 
where if you've noticed this before
the<00:02:56.599> belts<00:02:56.959> got<00:02:57.139> a<00:02:57.650> crazy<00:02:58.159> amount<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.579> slack<00:02:58.879> on

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
the belts got a crazy amount of slack on

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.629 
the belts got a crazy amount of slack on
it<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.139> I<00:03:00.169> got<00:03:00.409> to<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.739> point<00:03:01.010> or<00:03:01.340> close

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
it and so I got to that point or close

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.819 
it and so I got to that point or close
to<00:03:01.669> that<00:03:01.939> point<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.299> know<00:03:02.359> if<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.569> was<00:03:02.659> exact<00:03:03.079> so

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
to that point I know if it was exact so

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.460 
to that point I know if it was exact so
it's<00:03:04.159> a<00:03:04.250> little<00:03:04.430> floppy<00:03:04.669> here<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.409> then<00:03:06.409> the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
it's a little floppy here and then the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.429 
it's a little floppy here and then the
only<00:03:06.530> other<00:03:06.709> thing<00:03:06.919> i<00:03:07.099> did<00:03:07.280> was<00:03:07.459> i<00:03:07.549> remove<00:03:07.909> the

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
only other thing i did was i remove the

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.710 
only other thing i did was i remove the
timing<00:03:09.439> belt<00:03:09.530> roller<00:03:10.150> here<00:03:11.150> that's<00:03:11.480> just<00:03:11.659> a

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
timing belt roller here that's just a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.610 
timing belt roller here that's just a
single<00:03:12.049> i<00:03:12.639> think<00:03:13.639> it's<00:03:13.760> an<00:03:13.849> 8<00:03:13.970> millimeter<00:03:14.150> hex

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
single i think it's an 8 millimeter hex

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.050 
single i think it's an 8 millimeter hex
and<00:03:15.699> that's<00:03:16.699> it<00:03:16.909> so<00:03:17.440> with<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.680> then<00:03:19.310> i<00:03:19.340> remove

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
and that's it so with that then i remove

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.530 
and that's it so with that then i remove
the<00:03:20.359> actual<00:03:20.540> or<00:03:21.199> loosen<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.799> timing<00:03:22.220> belt

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
the actual or loosen the timing belt

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.759 
the actual or loosen the timing belt
keep<00:03:23.540> same<00:03:23.720> time<00:03:23.900> bill<00:03:24.079> thermostat<00:03:24.560> housing

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
keep same time bill thermostat housing

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.520 
keep same time bill thermostat housing
and<00:03:25.359> i<00:03:26.359> happen<00:03:26.629> to<00:03:26.659> have<00:03:26.780> an<00:03:26.870> extra<00:03:26.959> one<00:03:27.169> here

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
and i happen to have an extra one here

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.780 
and i happen to have an extra one here
so<00:03:27.709> i<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:27.919> show<00:03:28.069> you<00:03:28.099> where<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.340> bolts<00:03:28.639> are

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
so i can show you where the bolts are

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.020 
so i can show you where the bolts are
there's<00:03:28.970> only<00:03:29.090> three<00:03:29.680> there<00:03:30.680> are<00:03:30.829> t<00:03:31.040> 30<00:03:31.400> triple

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
there's only three there are t 30 triple

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.349 
there's only three there are t 30 triple
torques<00:03:32.359> and<00:03:32.919> so<00:03:33.919> here's<00:03:34.159> the<00:03:34.370> that's<00:03:35.120> kind<00:03:35.329> of

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
torques and so here's the that's kind of

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.909 
torques and so here's the that's kind of
your<00:03:35.569> your<00:03:35.959> mark<00:03:36.229> here<00:03:36.530> when<00:03:36.680> you're<00:03:36.769> on<00:03:36.859> the

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
your your mark here when you're on the

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:43.149 
your your mark here when you're on the
front<00:03:37.069> of<00:03:37.159> the<00:03:37.250> engine<00:03:38.079> this<00:03:39.079> is<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:42.159> so

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
front of the engine this is that and so

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.020 
front of the engine this is that and so
there's<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.489> bolt<00:03:43.699> here<00:03:44.180> just<00:03:45.139> below<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.470> and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
there's a bolt here just below it and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.039 
there's a bolt here just below it and
that<00:03:47.030> that's<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.510> reason<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.840> need<00:03:47.989> to

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
that that's the reason you need to

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.759 
that that's the reason you need to
remove<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.709> or<00:03:49.010> loosen<00:03:49.639> the<00:03:49.699> drive<00:03:49.970> belt

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
remove that or loosen the drive belt

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.099 
remove that or loosen the drive belt
because<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.430> extracts<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.329> bolt<00:03:53.870> and

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
because that it extracts that bolt and

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.879 
because that it extracts that bolt and
then<00:03:55.040> if<00:03:55.129> you<00:03:55.250> move<00:03:55.400> down<00:03:56.560> look<00:03:57.560> for<00:03:57.590> this

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
then if you move down look for this

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.210 
then if you move down look for this
