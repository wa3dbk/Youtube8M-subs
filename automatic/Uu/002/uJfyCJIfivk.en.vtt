once<00:00:27.330> again<00:00:27.449> I'm<00:00:27.720> back<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> time<00:00:28.260> warp<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.680> think

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
once again I'm back a time warp I think

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.830 
once again I'm back a time warp I think
the<00:00:29.160> last<00:00:29.340> time<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.670> was<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.029> time<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:30.599> was

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the last time I was a time what was

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.030 
the last time I was a time what was
probably<00:00:31.640> four<00:00:32.640> years<00:00:32.910> ago<00:00:36.620> hard<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> say<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
probably four years ago hard to say the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.580 
probably four years ago hard to say the
last<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.510> most<00:00:39.809> memorable<00:00:40.140> one

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
last one was the most memorable one

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
last one was the most memorable one
because<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.610> arm<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.030> energy<00:00:42.329> was<00:00:42.480> really

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
because the arm the energy was really

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.170 
because the arm the energy was really
strong<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.370> reason<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.700> people<00:00:44.820> just

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
strong for some reason that people just

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.270 
strong for some reason that people just
did<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.110> full<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.160> were

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
did was just full you know they were

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310

just<00:00:47.430> full<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.700> energy<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.170> had

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
just full of energy and actually I had

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.900 
just full of energy and actually I had
to<00:00:49.410> play<00:00:49.590> early<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.640> really

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to play early and that was really

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.369

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
these Germany still have been that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.390 
these Germany still have been that
energy<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:17.150> when<00:03:17.330> two<00:03:17.780> people<00:03:18.200> are<00:03:18.560> different

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400
