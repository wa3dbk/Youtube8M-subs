00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.579 

the<00:00:00.450> question<00:00:00.780> as<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.930> whether<00:00:01.170> or<00:00:01.260> not<00:00:01.380> we<00:00:01.560> are

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
the question as to whether or not we are

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.560 
the question as to whether or not we are
hard-wired<00:00:02.010> for<00:00:02.550> religion<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.330> spirituality

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hard-wired for religion and spirituality

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.789 
hard-wired for religion and spirituality
I<00:00:04.700> think<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> very<00:00:06.390> important<00:00:07.350> one<00:00:07.440> when

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
I think is is a very important one when

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.500 
I think is is a very important one when
we<00:00:07.890> look<00:00:08.099> at<00:00:08.189> how<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.460> brain<00:00:08.760> works

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
we look at how the brain works

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.100 
we look at how the brain works
it<00:00:10.110> looks<00:00:10.559> like<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.920> brain<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.340> able<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:12.150> very

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
it looks like the brain is able to very

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.499 
it looks like the brain is able to very
easily<00:00:13.410> engage<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.370> religious<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.030> spiritual

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
easily engage in religious and spiritual

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.010 
easily engage in religious and spiritual
practices<00:00:16.230> ideas<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.369> experiences<00:00:18.119> all<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
practices ideas and experiences all the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.990 
practices ideas and experiences all the
brain<00:00:19.230> scan<00:00:19.529> studies<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.039> we've<00:00:20.220> done<00:00:20.460> show

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
brain scan studies that we've done show

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.370 
brain scan studies that we've done show
that<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:21.359> are<00:00:21.449> multiple<00:00:21.660> parts<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that there are multiple parts of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.800 
that there are multiple parts of the
brain<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.859> seem<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.310> involved<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.150> it

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
brain that seem to get involved so it

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.960 
brain that seem to get involved so it
really<00:00:25.050> does<00:00:25.289> look<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.859> brain<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.369> so

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
really does look like the brain is so

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.460 
really does look like the brain is so
easily<00:00:27.240> capable<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.960> having<00:00:28.170> these

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
easily capable of having these

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.020 
easily capable of having these
experiences<00:00:29.369> now<00:00:29.910> exactly<00:00:30.330> how<00:00:30.920> that<00:00:32.030> ability

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
experiences now exactly how that ability

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
experiences now exactly how that ability
got<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> brain<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.739> course<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.040> much

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
got into the brain is of course a much

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.270 
got into the brain is of course a much
more<00:00:35.520> complex<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.750> both<00:00:37.440> philosophical<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
more complex and both philosophical and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280 
more complex and both philosophical and
scientific<00:00:38.430> question<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.570> scientists<00:00:40.140> would

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
scientific question the scientists would

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.410 
scientific question the scientists would
say<00:00:40.350> well<00:00:41.160> maybe<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.730> through<00:00:41.969> millions

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
say well maybe it was through millions

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.100 
say well maybe it was through millions
of<00:00:42.690> years<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.960> evolution<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.420> because<00:00:45.420> being

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
of years of evolution that because being

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020 
of years of evolution that because being
religious<00:00:46.559> or<00:00:46.680> spiritual<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.340> an<00:00:47.489> adaptive

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
religious or spiritual was an adaptive

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.389 
religious or spiritual was an adaptive
process<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.410> incorporated<00:00:49.680> into<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
process it got incorporated into the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.310 
process it got incorporated into the
biological<00:00:51.090> mechanisms<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> brain<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
biological mechanisms of the brain and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.569 
biological mechanisms of the brain and
there's<00:00:52.559> certainly<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> reasons<00:00:53.520> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
there's certainly a lot of reasons to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.310 
there's certainly a lot of reasons to
support<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.809> course<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.170> you're<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
support that and of course if you're a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
support that and of course if you're a
religious<00:00:55.739> individual<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.430> also<00:00:56.579> makes<00:00:56.910> sense

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
religious individual it also makes sense

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.209 
religious individual it also makes sense
that<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.989> there's<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.260> god<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.590> there<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.070> we're

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that if there's a god up there and we're

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.069 
that if there's a god up there and we're
down<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.430> that<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.390> would<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> brain

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
down here that we would have a brain

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
down here that we would have a brain
that's<00:01:01.230> capable<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.859> communicating<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.640> God

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that's capable of communicating to God

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.579 
that's capable of communicating to God
praying<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.480> God<00:01:03.629> doing<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> things<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.350> God

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
praying to God doing the things that God

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.350 
praying to God doing the things that God
needs<00:01:04.860> us<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.309> otherwise<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:06.240> would<00:01:06.330> be

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
needs us to do otherwise there would be

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.030 
needs us to do otherwise there would be
this<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.960> fundamentally<00:01:07.799> silly

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
this kind of fundamentally silly

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.590 
this kind of fundamentally silly
disconnect<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.850> wouldn't<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.360> wouldn't<00:01:09.420> be

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
disconnect we wouldn't we wouldn't be

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.640 
disconnect we wouldn't we wouldn't be
able<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.960> any<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> interaction

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
able to have any kind of interaction

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.000 
able to have any kind of interaction
with<00:01:11.189> God<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.510> does<00:01:12.750> look<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.770> brain

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
with God so it does look like the brain

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.340 
with God so it does look like the brain
no<00:01:14.340> matter<00:01:14.520> how<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.939> got<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:15.540> does<00:01:16.110> have

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
no matter how it got there does have

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
no matter how it got there does have
this<00:01:16.530> profound<00:01:17.070> ability<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.759> engage<00:01:17.939> in

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
this profound ability to engage in

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.999 
this profound ability to engage in
religious<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.869> spiritual<00:01:19.259> experiences<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
religious and spiritual experiences and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
religious and spiritual experiences and
and<00:01:20.130> that's<00:01:20.549> part<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.909> why<00:01:21.090> we've<00:01:21.509> seen

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and that's part of why we've seen

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.080 
and that's part of why we've seen
religion<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> spirituality<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> part<00:01:24.030> of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
religion and spirituality be a part of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.670 
religion and spirituality be a part of
human<00:01:24.390> history<00:01:24.750> since<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.170> very<00:01:25.350> dawn<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
human history since the very dawn of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560 
human history since the very dawn of
civilization<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> things<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.390> we

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
civilization one of the things that we

civilization one of the things that we
find<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.799> such<00:01:29.009> an<00:01:29.159> important<00:01:29.909> element<00:01:30.060> of

find to be such an important element of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660 
find to be such an important element of
many<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> rituals<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> practices<00:01:32.159> that

many of the rituals and practices that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.190 
many of the rituals and practices that
people<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.329> part<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.659> their<00:01:33.810> religious

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
people do as part of their religious

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.010 
people do as part of their religious
traditions<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.040> repetition<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.390> the

traditions is the repetition of it the
more<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.560> come<00:01:37.799> back<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.220> particular

more that you come back to a particular

more that you come back to a particular
idea<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.240> more<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.509> focus<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> more

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.160 
idea the more you focus on it the more
you<00:01:40.560> say<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> phrase<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> prayer<00:01:41.869> those<00:01:42.869> are

you say a phrase or a prayer those are
the<00:01:43.380> ideas<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> beliefs<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.640> become

the ideas and beliefs that become
written<00:01:45.509> into<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> neural<00:01:46.320> connections<00:01:46.470> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
written into the neural connections of

written into the neural connections of
the<00:01:47.100> brain<00:01:47.340> there's<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.729> cute<00:01:48.390> saying<00:01:48.689> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the brain there's a cute saying that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
the brain there's a cute saying that
neurons<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.470> fire<00:01:49.770> together<00:01:49.979> wire<00:01:50.250> together

neurons that fire together wire together

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.020 
neurons that fire together wire together
the<00:01:51.450> idea<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.200> when<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.100> are<00:01:53.130> doing<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the idea is is that when you are doing a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.300 
the idea is is that when you are doing a
particular<00:01:54.600> practice<00:01:55.170> whatever<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.189> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
religious or otherwise the more you do

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.249 
religious or otherwise the more you do
it<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.579> you<00:02:00.149> are<00:02:00.570> writing<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it the more you are writing that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.200 
it the more you are writing that
information<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> neural<00:02:02.729> connections

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that idea or support that practice fire

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.740 
that idea or support that practice fire
together<00:02:08.489> they<00:02:09.060> strengthen<00:02:09.599> their

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
together they strengthen their

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.540 
together they strengthen their
connections<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.800> makes<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.069> easier<00:02:11.489> for

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
connections and it makes it easier for

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.150 
connections and it makes it easier for
you<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.940> come<00:02:12.120> back<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.599> particular

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
you to come back to that particular

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.070 
you to come back to that particular
practice<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.970> also<00:02:14.180> strengthens<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
practice and it also strengthens the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.720 
practice and it also strengthens the
beliefs<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.710> are<00:02:15.890> around<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.580> particular

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
beliefs that are around that particular

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.690 
beliefs that are around that particular
practice<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:17.780> that's<00:02:17.960> also<00:02:18.170> why<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:18.950> think

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
practice now that's also why we think

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.580 
practice now that's also why we think
that<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:20.090> practice<00:02:20.630> like<00:02:20.780> meditation<00:02:21.260> even

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
that a practice like meditation even

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.740 
that a practice like meditation even
taken<00:02:22.490> into<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.730> more<00:02:22.970> secular<00:02:23.300> kind<00:02:23.630> of

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
taken into a more secular kind of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.530 
taken into a more secular kind of
context<00:02:24.320> can<00:02:24.950> be<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.160> very<00:02:25.460> powerful<00:02:25.760> tool<00:02:26.480> for

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
context can be a very powerful tool for

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.720 
context can be a very powerful tool for
helping<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.290> improve<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.950> way<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.100> person's

brain<00:02:28.970> works<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.930> analogy<00:02:30.320> here<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.560> think<00:02:30.890> is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
brain works the analogy here I think is

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.670 
brain works the analogy here I think is
if<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.970> were<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.210> wanting<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:33.110> become<00:02:33.530> a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
if you were to wanting to become a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.860 
if you were to wanting to become a
better<00:02:33.980> tennis<00:02:34.280> player<00:02:34.430> for<00:02:34.880> example<00:02:34.910> well

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
better tennis player for example well

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.410 
better tennis player for example well
you<00:02:36.320> could<00:02:36.470> do<00:02:36.650> one<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.340> two<00:02:37.520> things<00:02:37.550> one<00:02:38.240> is

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
you could do one of two things one is

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.970 
you could do one of two things one is
you<00:02:38.570> got<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.990> play<00:02:39.110> tennis<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.440> got<00:02:39.710> to<00:02:39.800> keep

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
you got to play tennis you got to keep

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.400 
you got to play tennis you got to keep
practicing<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.970> tennis<00:02:41.300> itself<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:42.230> other

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
practicing the tennis itself the other

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.290 
practicing the tennis itself the other
is<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.160> could<00:02:43.370> go<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.090> weight<00:02:44.270> room

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
is that you could go to the weight room

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.720 
is that you could go to the weight room
and<00:02:44.660> lift<00:02:44.870> weights<00:02:45.110> or<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.440> can<00:02:45.740> run<00:02:45.950> which<00:02:46.550> is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
and lift weights or you can run which is

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.760 
and lift weights or you can run which is
more<00:02:47.180> general<00:02:47.660> strengthening<00:02:48.350> and

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
more general strengthening and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.070 
more general strengthening and
conditioning<00:02:49.180> now<00:02:50.180> if<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.630> want<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.840> become<00:02:51.050> a

conditioning now if you want to become a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.870 
conditioning now if you want to become a
good<00:02:51.200> basketball<00:02:51.710> player<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:52.550> wouldn't<00:02:52.820> play

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
good basketball player you wouldn't play

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.900 
good basketball player you wouldn't play
tennis<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.510> shoot<00:02:54.020> baskets<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.700> weight

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
tennis you shoot baskets but the weight

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.700 
tennis you shoot baskets but the weight
training<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.750> aerobic<00:02:57.140> training<00:02:57.320> can<00:02:57.620> be

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
training and the aerobic training can be

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.980 
training and the aerobic training can be
good<00:02:57.890> for<00:02:58.070> both<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:58.940> meditation<00:02:59.600> may<00:02:59.750> fall

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
good for both so meditation may fall

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.950 
good for both so meditation may fall
into<00:03:00.350> that<00:03:00.610> area<00:03:01.610> where<00:03:01.910> maybe<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.720> want<00:03:02.900> to

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
into that area where maybe you want to

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.300 
into that area where maybe you want to
be<00:03:03.020> really<00:03:03.260> good<00:03:03.410> at<00:03:03.590> doing<00:03:03.830> crossword

good at crossword puzzles it doesn't

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.390 
good at crossword puzzles it doesn't

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
make you a good chess player but if you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.000 
make you a good chess player but if you
do<00:03:10.730> meditation<00:03:11.200> practices<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.410> might<00:03:12.830> make

maybe even being a better athlete so it

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.360 
maybe even being a better athlete so it
has<00:03:20.300> something<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.630> do<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.840> think<00:03:20.990> with<00:03:21.320> how<00:03:21.650> we

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
has something to do I think with how we

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.480 
has something to do I think with how we
can<00:03:22.610> more<00:03:23.540> generally<00:03:24.290> improve<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.100> function

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
can more generally improve the function
