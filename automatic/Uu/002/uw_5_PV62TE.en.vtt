00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
the connection is garbage so if I went

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.960 
the connection is garbage so if I went
in<00:03:31.629> a<00:03:31.750> video<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.319> show<00:03:32.530> up<00:03:32.620> at<00:03:32.799> 4<00:03:33.159> o'clock<00:03:33.190> my
