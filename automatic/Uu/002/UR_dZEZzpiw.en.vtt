00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.769
 main feature of samsung smartphone 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.049
 galaxy s7 is all-metal 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.900
 case according to its capabilities 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.849
 inferior to galaxy s5 and refers to 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.070
 middle class smartphones while 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.250
 the novelty differs unreasonably high 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.679
 The price of the galaxy s7 is completely 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.500
 made of aluminum back wall and 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.119
 sidewalls are one-piece construction 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.250
 but the surfaces are covered with plastic 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.379
 spraying due to this metallic 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.989
 body looks and feels like 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.210
 plastic due to matte finish 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.970
 thin body and low mass 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.710
 the device is comfortably held in hand on 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.080
 back side is the main 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.989
 camera and LED flash and grille 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.750
 ringing speaker camera module noticeable 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.610
 sticks out from the back of the front 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.530
 part of the smartphone is completely covered 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.600
 protective gorilla glass 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.360
 there are sensors above the screen 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.820
 approximation and frontal lighting 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.290
 camera and earpiece 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.390
 LED event indicator and here 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.280
 no below screen 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.079
 mechanical key and two touch 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.509
 system control buttons 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.270
 on the right side is the power button 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.359
 and locks and card connectors 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.070
 micro sd and nano sim cards on 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.829
 place memory card can be put 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.590
 the second nano-sim card is highly controversial 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.020
 the solution is on the left side 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.420
 volume button 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.759
 quite large stroke springy and 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.560
 responsive on the bottom is located 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.230
 wired connector 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.570
 headset and micro usb connector and 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.630
 they are located close to each other 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.690
 which is not very convenient smartphone does not have 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.370
 anti-dust and moisture screen diagonal 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.340
 made by technology super amoled 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.810
 equal to 5 and fiftieth press a resolution 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.000
 1 1920 by 1080 pixels to the merits 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.000
 screen need to carry a good oleophobic 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.160
 covering close to a rgb color gamut 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.500
 true black color is excellent 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.360
 white field uniformity is negligible 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.330
 drop in image brightness when looking 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.399
 at an angle the screen quality is very high 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.590
 smartphone plays enough 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.780
 loud sound full spectrum 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.930
 frequencies at maximum volume 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.940
 sound does not distort the front camera 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.140
 the smartphone has a resolution of 5 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.850
 megapixels main 13 megapixels 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.030
 rear camera is equipped with autofocus and 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 LED flash 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.950
 the camera settings menu is visual and 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.690
 intuitively clear from the main camera 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.750
 optical stabilization and mode 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.190

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.060
 no slowed down or alas country and 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.580
 video filming 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.459
 of the shooting modes only panoramic 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.959
 night portrait and selfies nonetheless 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.940
 The camera is well suited for 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.980
 documentary and artistic filming 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.880

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.610
 maximum resolution full hd 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.650
 galaxy s7 works 2g and 3g networks 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.019
 and also supports network fourth 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.890
 generations lte and k 4 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.590
 there is support nfc smartphone supports 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.450
 work with two sim cards can be any 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.760
 from sim cards assign the primary for 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.760
 organization transmission of voice calls 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.709

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.500
 work sim card in any slot but 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.989
 simultaneously in this mode can 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.810
 work just one of the smart phone cards 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.620
 running android 4 4 4 and 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.670

 settings and pop up shortcut under 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.130
 the menu is all very similar to what 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.260
 implemented in galaxy s5 and galaxy alpha 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.570
 except for some flagship 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.000
 features which in galaxy s7 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.730
 missing particular very limited 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.440
 supported gesture set 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.340

 qualcomm snapdragon 615 two 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.829
 gigabytes of ram and 16

 gigabytes of flash memory running 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.040
 galaxy s7 testing showed medium 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.739
 results 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.870
 far from modern flagships but 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.539
 smartphone performance is enough for 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.450
 performing everyday tasks non-removable 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.389
 battery capacity of 2600 milliampere hour 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.800
 provides up to 12

 3d games 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:39.479
 galaxy s7 like other smartphones ruler 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:40.919
 galaxy and overestimated its level 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.039
 technical equipment is not 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.990
 correspond to overpriced 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.779
 new is more expensive galaxy s5 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.729
 but only on many useful features 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:53.069
 from sensor alerts and sensor 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.020
 fingerprint protection from moisture and 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.909
 opportunities to use simultaneously 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.759
 two SIM cards and a memory card 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:02.430
 lightweight and high quality body 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.439
 bright screen decent sound and long lasting 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.610
 battery life is not justified 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.979
 smartphone flaws 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.279
 the main of which is unreasonably high 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.279
 the cost
