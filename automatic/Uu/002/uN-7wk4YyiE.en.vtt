00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
all the way to iOS 6 but either way

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
all the way to iOS 6 but either way
you're<00:01:36.810> entitled<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.380> your<00:01:37.409> opinion<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.100> this

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
is pretty much how the poll came out so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.639 
is pretty much how the poll came out so
that<00:01:42.030> means<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> pot<00:01:42.689> ug<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.170> probably<00:01:43.500> gonna

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that means the pot ug is probably gonna

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.429 
that means the pot ug is probably gonna
be<00:01:43.710> aiming<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.610> make<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> jailbreak<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:46.140> soon

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
be aiming to make the jailbreak as soon

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.130 
be aiming to make the jailbreak as soon
as<00:01:46.590> possible<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.180> today<00:01:48.479> he<00:01:48.750> tweeted

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
as possible so now just today he tweeted

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
as possible so now just today he tweeted
that<00:01:49.320> he<00:01:49.500> got<00:01:49.649> his<00:01:49.710> iphone<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.790> running<00:01:51.090> on

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that he got his iphone for running on

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.160 
that he got his iphone for running on
5.1<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.610> basically<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.450> means<00:01:54.780> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.100 
5.1 and now basically what this means is
he's<00:01:55.920> probably<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> slowly<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.869> or

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
he's probably going to slowly get it or

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.840 
he's probably going to slowly get it or
not<00:01:58.409> even<00:01:58.439> slowly<00:01:58.920> probably<00:01:59.520> pretty<00:01:59.670> quickly

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
not even slowly probably pretty quickly

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.539 
not even slowly probably pretty quickly
get<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> work<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.259> all<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.950> other<00:02:02.130> devices

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
get it to work on all the other devices

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.270 
get it to work on all the other devices
and<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:03.180> release<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.799> means<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and then release it and that means that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
and then release it and that means that
there's<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.700> jailbreak<00:02:06.180> hopefully

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
there's going to be jailbreak hopefully

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.440 
there's going to be jailbreak hopefully
relatively<00:02:07.920> soon<00:02:08.190> he<00:02:08.369> tweeted<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.970> few<00:02:09.300> weeks

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
relatively soon he tweeted a few weeks

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.320 
relatively soon he tweeted a few weeks
ago<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.039> could<00:02:11.220> be<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.940> month<00:02:12.120> or

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
ago that it could be like one month or

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.640 
ago that it could be like one month or
two<00:02:12.480> months<00:02:12.510> or<00:02:12.840> whatever<00:02:12.959> but<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.410> see

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
two months or whatever but I see

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.619 
two months or whatever but I see
seems<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:14.010> they're<00:02:14.549> on<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> good<00:02:14.970> track<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
seems that they're on a good track and

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.360 
seems that they're on a good track and
that<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.049> jailbreak<00:02:16.530> could<00:02:16.769> be<00:02:16.920> coming<00:02:17.250> out

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
that a jailbreak could be coming out

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.949 
that a jailbreak could be coming out
fairly<00:02:17.700> soon<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.329> I<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.540> wanted<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> give
