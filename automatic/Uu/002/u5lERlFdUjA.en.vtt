00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979 
where even the minor characters you

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.409 
where even the minor characters you
could<00:06:49.159> almost<00:06:49.370> see<00:06:49.639> a<00:06:49.669> movie<00:06:49.909> about<00:06:49.969> them<00:06:50.210> like

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:52.069 
I could I could totally watch a movie

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.550 
I could I could totally watch a movie
about<00:06:52.129> like<00:06:52.430> Jeremy<00:06:52.819> Renner's<00:06:53.090> wife<00:06:53.409> you<00:06:54.409> know

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:59.679 
what she's got going on earlier because
I<00:06:58.310> think<00:06:58.370> that<00:06:58.699> getting<00:06:58.969> that<00:06:59.210> level<00:06:59.479> of

00:06:59.679 --> 00:06:59.689 
I think that getting that level of

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.170 
I think that getting that level of
humanity<00:06:59.990> and<00:07:00.580> character<00:07:01.580> out<00:07:01.699> of<00:07:01.729> Renner<00:07:02.090> I

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
humanity and character out of Renner I

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.969
