00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
terrific but a bit unusual because of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
terrific but a bit unusual because of
the<00:01:28.259> long<00:01:28.560> five<00:01:28.950> minutes<00:01:29.280> keeping<00:01:29.640> time<00:01:29.850> we

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the long five minutes keeping time we

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.480 
the long five minutes keeping time we
get<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> very<00:01:30.450> intense<00:01:30.990> flavor<00:01:31.340> unusual<00:01:32.340> for

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
get a very intense flavor unusual for

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
get a very intense flavor unusual for
the<00:01:32.549> customer<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.299> very<00:01:33.540> important<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.170> us

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the customer but very important for us

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.069 
the customer but very important for us
this<00:01:35.040> way<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.880> withdraw<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.420> much<00:01:36.479> essence

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
this way we can withdraw as much essence

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.450 
this way we can withdraw as much essence
as<00:01:37.200> possible<00:01:37.680> from<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> tea<00:01:38.070> leaf<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
as possible from the tea leaf and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.639 
as possible from the tea leaf and
therefore<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> good<00:01:39.600> result<00:01:39.750> dr.<00:01:40.439> Zin<00:01:41.450> and

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
therefore get a good result dr. Zin and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.670 
therefore get a good result dr. Zin and
then<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.579> special<00:01:44.939> noise

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.490 

yeah<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:51.180> slurping<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.899> indeed<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> bit

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
yeah this slurping is indeed a bit

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.280 
yeah this slurping is indeed a bit
unusual<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.790> result<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.270> however<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
unusual the result is however that the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.380 
unusual the result is however that the
tea<00:01:55.470> extract<00:01:56.009> blends<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.580> oxygen<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
tea extract blends with the oxygen and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
tea extract blends with the oxygen and
therefore<00:01:57.810> reaches<00:01:58.590> every<00:01:58.920> sensitive<00:01:59.369> area

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
therefore reaches every sensitive area

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.630 
therefore reaches every sensitive area
in<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.119> around<00:02:00.330> mouth<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.869> gums<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.979> way<00:02:02.220> we

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
in and around mouth and gums this way we

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.820 
in and around mouth and gums this way we
are<00:02:02.759> able<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.149> really<00:02:03.600> recognize<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.409> profile

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
are able to really recognize the profile

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.479 
are able to really recognize the profile
of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> tea<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.939> teeth<00:02:06.210> bottom
