00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
so and then these just get clipped on to

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.980 
so and then these just get clipped on to
the<00:00:24.670> pre-attached<00:00:25.090> clips<00:00:25.390> that<00:00:25.660> are<00:00:25.720> on<00:00:25.840> the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
the pre-attached clips that are on the

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.060 
the pre-attached clips that are on the
lid<00:00:26.429> it's<00:00:27.429> really<00:00:27.609> simple<00:00:27.820> to<00:00:28.029> put<00:00:28.179> together

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
lid it's really simple to put together

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.730 
lid it's really simple to put together
so<00:00:30.070> that<00:00:30.220> says<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.689> stove<00:00:31.900> itself<00:00:32.170> is<00:00:32.410> made<00:00:32.590> up

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:32.740 
so that says the stove itself is made up

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.530 
so that says the stove itself is made up
of<00:00:32.920> steel<00:00:33.310> and<00:00:33.550> stainless<00:00:33.790> steel<00:00:34.149> so<00:00:34.329> really

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
of steel and stainless steel so really

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.119 
of steel and stainless steel so really
robust<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.140> you<00:00:35.200> would<00:00:35.290> expect<00:00:35.620> it<00:00:35.739> to<00:00:35.829> last<00:00:35.950> a

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
robust and you would expect it to last a

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.100 
robust and you would expect it to last a
good<00:00:36.250> long<00:00:36.340> time<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:37.300> stainless<00:00:37.660> steel<00:00:37.690> part

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
good long time the stainless steel part

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.709 
good long time the stainless steel part
is<00:00:38.290> yes<00:00:38.800> pot<00:00:39.129> stand<00:00:39.430> on<00:00:39.579> top<00:00:39.820> here<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.239> that's

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
is yes pot stand on top here so that's

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.119 
is yes pot stand on top here so that's
removable<00:00:41.050> so<00:00:41.379> you<00:00:41.410> can<00:00:41.590> clean<00:00:41.770> it<00:00:41.890> nice<00:00:42.100> and

easily and then also you can wait around
the<00:00:44.860> burners<00:00:45.190> themselves<00:00:45.670> now<00:00:46.510> these<00:00:46.660> burners

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
the burners themselves now these burners

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.580 
the burners themselves now these burners
produced<00:00:47.530> 1400<00:00:48.430> watts<00:00:48.579> of<00:00:48.850> heat<00:00:48.940> so<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:50.140> good

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
produced 1400 watts of heat so a good

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.080 
produced 1400 watts of heat so a good
amount<00:00:50.800> there<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:51.489> they're<00:00:51.940> easily
