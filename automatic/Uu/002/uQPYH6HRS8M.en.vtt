 guitar to the god of numbers and 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.180

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.270
 of a morning it is joyous like a 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.260

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.840

 english kim teaches the table of 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.630
 multiplication by six listening to the 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.880
 voice of patrice laffont 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.340
 she had a kind of two years that's 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.630

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.970
 numbers and letters in 2013 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.110
 it's 4:10 but be careful if like 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.090
 I was stuck on the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.440
 victories of simone menesguen in 79 who 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.670
 hold chalsa in 80 rooms and 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.460

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.990
 also but downright global I tell you 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.160
 you will see that this is not what 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.479
 it was numbers and letters to 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.220
 the time remember it was calm 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.630
 small budget elevator atmosphere had 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.920

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.130
 cleaning lady who were pulling them 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:50.130

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.729
 the time 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.229
 of course today it's a machine 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.000
 who distributes the numbers is also 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.350
 a machine that chooses the letters that 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.880
 find the words and who calculates the 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.950
