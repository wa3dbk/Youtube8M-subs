sonic boom so what we set out to do
today<00:00:40.000> was<00:00:40.330> concentrate<00:00:41.080> on<00:00:41.260> booms<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.740> we

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
today was concentrate on booms that we

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.280 
today was concentrate on booms that we

I<00:01:05.110> recorded<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.009> data<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:06.579> that<00:01:06.610> we<00:01:06.729> can

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
I recorded the data so that we can

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.210 
I recorded the data so that we can
correlate<00:01:07.210> that<00:01:07.450> with<00:01:07.900> other<00:01:08.590> tests<00:01:08.980> that<00:01:09.070> we

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
correlate that with other tests that we

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.130 
correlate that with other tests that we
have<00:01:09.310> done<00:01:09.340> with<00:01:09.640> outdoor<00:01:10.090> booms<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:10.870> booms

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
have done with outdoor booms and booms

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.899 
have done with outdoor booms and booms
and<00:01:11.409> smaller<00:01:11.740> structures<00:01:12.310> we<00:01:12.670> were<00:01:12.730> just

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
and smaller structures we were just

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.940 
and smaller structures we were just
interested<00:01:13.330> in<00:01:13.360> getting<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.110> perception

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
interested in getting the the perception

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.010 
interested in getting the the perception
of<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.310> folks<00:01:15.550> listening<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.480> the<00:01:16.570> booms<00:01:19.020> so

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
of the folks listening to the booms so

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.440 
of the folks listening to the booms so
we're<00:01:20.200> simulating<00:01:20.650> what<00:01:21.340> we<00:01:21.490> anticipate<00:01:22.270> will

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
we're simulating what we anticipate will

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.840 
we're simulating what we anticipate will
be<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.600> boom<00:01:22.750> level<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.710> new<00:01:23.950> aircraft<00:01:24.550> by

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
be the boom level of a new aircraft by

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.080 
be the boom level of a new aircraft by
using<00:01:25.180> an<00:01:25.479> existing<00:01:25.780> f-18<00:01:26.650> airplane<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.970> do

using an existing f-18 airplane to do

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.940 
using an existing f-18 airplane to do
that<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:28.360> have<00:01:28.510> to<00:01:28.659> dive<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.020> airplane<00:01:29.650> in<00:01:29.890> a

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
that we have to dive the airplane in a

that we have to dive the airplane in a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
unique manner and that creates both a

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.200 
unique manner and that creates both a
quiet<00:01:32.650> boom<00:01:32.950> at<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.280> location<00:01:33.760> where<00:01:33.909> we<00:01:33.940> want

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
the public can fly on but we don't want

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.190 
the public can fly on but we don't want
