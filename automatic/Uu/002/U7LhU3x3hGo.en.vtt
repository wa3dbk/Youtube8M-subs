00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.070
 is your everyday life 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.289
 it's an ordinary girl of 16 years 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.760
 when that exceptional talent 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.480
 for which sport 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.339
 she is the only one of the three nominees 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.339
 of the young talent dollar 2010 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.590
 different sports from an early age this newspaper especially for those people 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.800
 which the shipping company 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.050
 it is a rock in scene and also on winter triathlon 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.260
 or war 8 solid moves to france where she continues to swim 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.600
 to hold 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.829
 be a pity a pity 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 presenter and 8 years in france 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.720
 if you say so yourself 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.720
 implicitly smart 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.510
 van der vlies very well 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.690
 Yes 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.850
 and i would get it and sun 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.689
 and then I was asked and train to come and ask him and eventually it 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.810
 not so good against France with the world changing 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.160
 and 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.430
 he was seeing age end 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.460
 and weird isn't it, sir 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.640
 for those changing services to the trainer 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.840
 take a look once 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.550
 Monday he is one of the few people who are after it 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.880
 it is something very happy with it 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 after that went two weeks 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.539
 her attention therefore remains in question 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.639
 kern is going to live in a host family at the age of 13 to live in the Netherlands 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.829
 able to train 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.149
 so I soon think of one youth game after the other 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.339
 it has been strange enough for a few months with the national coach 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.910
 the first time i spoke to him was on one 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.439
 after the European Championship Short Course in Rijeka in Croatia 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.799
 that can sometimes be seen swimming at a competition 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.510
 but never experienced it so close and there could be whole 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.589
 special swimmer especially because she 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:41.009
 that has a huge 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.009
 a nice technique and that I really like 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:50.879
 Zevenhoven elbow that will actually be sure if your hand moves 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.109
 I also stand still and painfully all pop singers in the world 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.090
 last year it was taken over from competitor ford 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.429
 they all have 24 and work 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.429
 the formateur great 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:12.669
 what is the difference between france and ireland yes that would be second yellow 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.949
 Meerhout always had to postpone 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.249
 and always more and more technology 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.479
 one turning point later 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.479
 you have everything 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.959
 playing full power in strength training is just what the 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:29.819
 other 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.939
 but in the water that can be temporary 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:33.939
 to do everything 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.829
 enschede we may this is a decrease of three thousand euros of which even more 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.260
 then the other to the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.990
 it can when the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.559
 Unfortunately 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:46.839
 it's in the act 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.349
 this year ago 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.349
 that is the normal time of eerd 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.120
 a nice 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.469
 we have to go there again for long distances 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.569
 yes then i was actually 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.209
 after 100 meters 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.249
 and then I get going, but I can keep it up 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:09.639
 is also because you have trained and in France 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.639
 yes i think so 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.150
 the practical part conditions 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.860
 others denis culture what we know yes that will succeed that goes on top 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.410
 the quay really the name something they would never actually done in the Netherlands 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.969
 so have 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.979
 yes that makes its base a controversial in may 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.639
 the find 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.939
 i just want to play them because of them 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:39.729
 and then say 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:40.840
 and then it is taken 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.840
 per cent 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800
 when i see you see what we get from one of the boys hands 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:03.849
 much higher 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:04.569
 can't get it
