00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.440
 Hello friends today is the seventh day 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.619
 international but record this video 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.279
 already quite late I want to sleep 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.859
 tired 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.789
 no strength here today we had a very 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.760
 difficult day many experiences we 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.570
 tried playing we had two games with and 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:36.510
 9 and mvp but we are not very results 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.489
 Satisfied we played 11 but times although we 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.239
 pretty frau or both games 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.190
 threw in the first game against c9 we 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.320
 definitely should have won here but we are not 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.050
 coped 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.870
 slightly here where I let you down 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.170
 and therefore the refuge there could not 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.930
 focus very silly and gave away the game 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 which were supposed to collect it win 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.729
 so we replayed them on all three 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.270
 lines and not that in principle did not foreshadow 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.310
 woes but something happened here 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.170
 first group of lepi 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.909
 we also got it 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.009
 gave numbers or elevator given 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:24.250
 recruited no gave then two teamfight 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:26.320
 and we also lost the game over there too 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.729
 magnus can totally take the blame on 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.360
 but it was quite difficult to play 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.509
 because it's pretty pretty difficult 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.240
 I can play myself when there is practically no 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.460
 design team and the enemy is very mobile 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.090
 them spirit breaker running decanters with 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.950
 tracks 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.860
 s-works dager and if you're somewhere on the floor 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.679
 seconds or late or something before 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.390
 did or crooked did you need 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.350
 lose the fight with a high probability 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.860
 that is, we could not give 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.619
 advantage is no where with us 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.899
 or swing here but if the tips were 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.759
 hard to play then c9 game is very disappointing 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.880
 given away and so we are a little upset 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.580
 because every draw is one point 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.470
 just a win three points so in 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.630
 In principle, it is practically the same 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.160
 the most that the defeat here if even 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.250
 would score four points today we 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.910
 probably weren't so sad here but 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.019
 after the games we talked talked 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.880
 sat down watched other other games 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.420
 totally all our strength game today 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.819
 sucked out of me i was very tired 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.160
 it was hard to do something hard 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.950
 record some more videos here 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.389
 so now you have to go to bed 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.030
 rather late and not early in the morning 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:51.250
 us games thank you so much for being 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.920
 support us cheer for us this is us 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.910
 very helpful to read 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.040

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.010
 some kind of positive support comment 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.040
 We will try and hope that everything 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.400
 will continue to cool here so what see you soon
