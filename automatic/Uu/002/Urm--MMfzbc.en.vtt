firm what I'll do is just pick these out
one<00:02:58.160> at<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.340> time<00:02:58.630> making<00:02:59.630> sure<00:03:00.080> not<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.440> get<00:03:01.400> any

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550

little as possible I'll get these out on
the<00:03:08.630> plate<00:03:08.930> another<00:03:09.860> option<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.430> put<00:03:10.850> the
