the<00:00:15.870> ultimate<00:00:16.289> has<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> lot<00:00:16.710> more<00:00:16.740> nose<00:00:17.220> rocker

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
the ultimate has a lot more nose rocker

make<00:00:18.630> takeoffs<00:00:19.140> something<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.610> would

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
make takeoffs something that you would

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.150 
make takeoffs something that you would
probably<00:00:21.780> want<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.080> get<00:00:22.320> for<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> little<00:00:23.039> bit

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
probably want to get for the little bit

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.669 
probably want to get for the little bit
bigger<00:00:23.400> days<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.539> want<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> stick<00:00:25.410> little

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
bigger days if you want a stick little

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.919 
bigger days if you want a stick little
longboard<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.340> all<00:00:26.580> sir<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> lot<00:00:27.720> more

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
longboard or all sir it's a lot more

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.870 
longboard or all sir it's a lot more
maneuverable<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.259> narrower<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
maneuverable it is narrower and the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.140 
maneuverable it is narrower and the
ladle<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:34.230> because<00:00:34.740> it's<00:00:35.040> made<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> little

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
ladle just because it's made a little

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.970 
ladle just because it's made a little
bit<00:00:36.240> a<00:00:36.450> bit<00:00:36.750> bigger<00:00:36.930> wave<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.710> don't<00:00:37.860> mean

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
bit a bit bigger wave so you don't mean

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.979 
bit a bit bigger wave so you don't mean
it<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.310> so<00:00:38.520> stable<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> would<00:00:39.690> gives

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
it to be so stable but you would gives

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.549 
it to be so stable but you would gives
you<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.039> easier<00:00:41.370> turning<00:00:41.910> designs<00:00:42.780> made

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
you so it's easier turning designs made

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.750 
you so it's easier turning designs made
to<00:00:43.770> ride<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> smaller<00:00:45.379> center<00:00:46.379> fan<00:00:46.760> with

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
to ride with a smaller center fan with

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.510 
to ride with a smaller center fan with
the<00:00:47.940> side<00:00:48.180> pens<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.440> less<00:00:49.649> drag<00:00:49.980> having

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the side pens so it's less drag having

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.200 
the side pens so it's less drag having
that<00:00:50.640> bigger<00:00:51.020> say<00:00:52.020> 8<00:00:52.829> 9<00:00:53.190> inch<00:00:53.430> pin<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.000> those

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
some floaters and some you know some

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.270 
some floaters and some you know some
like<00:01:51.690> closeout<00:01:52.170> turns<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.250> a

like closeout turns if you want to get a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.550 
like closeout turns if you want to get a
last<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:53.700> turn<00:01:53.940> in<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:55.020> still<00:01:55.290> gives<00:01:55.440> you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
last little turn in it still gives you

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.290 
last little turn in it still gives you
the<00:01:55.680> opportunity<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.400> knows<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.119> really

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
the opportunity to knows right it really

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.359 
the opportunity to knows right it really
does<00:01:57.510> like<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> fast

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
does like if you if you have a fast

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.120 
does like if you if you have a fast
enough<00:01:59.550> wave<00:01:59.940> enough<00:02:00.540> face<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.410> can<00:02:01.920> walk

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
enough wave enough face you can walk

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.900 
enough wave enough face you can walk
still<00:02:02.460> totally<00:02:03.300> fine<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:04.800> ultimate<00:02:05.190> it's<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
still totally fine the ultimate it's a

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.910 
still totally fine the ultimate it's a
quicker<00:02:06.330> board<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.930> know<00:02:07.050> as<00:02:07.350> far<00:02:07.619> as<00:02:07.680> long

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
quicker board you know as far as long

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.460 
quicker board you know as far as long
board<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> go<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:09.780> doesn't<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.170> quite

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
board to go it's it doesn't have quite

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.699 
board to go it's it doesn't have quite
the<00:02:10.590> volume<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> traditional<00:02:12.240> log<00:02:12.709> so

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
the volume as like a traditional log so

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.699 
the volume as like a traditional log so
it<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> little<00:02:14.220> quicker<00:02:15.530> it'll<00:02:16.530> actually

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
it is a little quicker it'll actually

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.250 
it is a little quicker it'll actually
kind<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.220> surprise<00:02:17.610> you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
kind of surprise you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.199 
kind of surprise you
when<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.129> take<00:02:20.370> off<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.819> make<00:02:20.970> your

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
when you take off and you make your

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.270 
when you take off and you make your
first<00:02:21.360> bottom<00:02:21.750> turn<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.650> come<00:02:22.890> looks<00:02:23.099> like

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
first bottom turn it come looks like
