now the original Tucson first join our

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.930 
now the original Tucson first join our
lineup<00:01:58.200> about<00:01:58.619> five<00:01:58.830> years<00:01:59.009> ago<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.819> was<00:01:59.910> a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
lineup about five years ago and it was a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.059 
lineup about five years ago and it was a
2005<00:02:00.690> model<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.649> doesn't<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.039> the

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
2005 model so it doesn't have the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.219 
2005 model so it doesn't have the
longest<00:02:02.580> history<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.300> we<00:02:03.420> think<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:04.080> got<00:02:04.200> a
