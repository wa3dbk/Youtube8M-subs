00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
when you go in you know at such high

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.740 
when you go in you know at such high
speeds<00:00:57.940> you've<00:00:58.940> got<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.390> be<00:00:59.450> able<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.630> hold

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
speeds you've got to be able to hold

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.180 
speeds you've got to be able to hold
onto<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.050> bike<00:01:00.200> basically<00:01:00.410> if<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:00.980> can't

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
onto the bike basically if you can't

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.560

hold<00:01:01.340> onto<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.579> bike<00:01:01.760> or<00:01:01.940> support<00:01:02.270> yourself

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
hold onto the bike or support yourself

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.770
