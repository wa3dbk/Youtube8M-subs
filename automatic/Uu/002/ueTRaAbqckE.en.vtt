00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
I'm going to want it to rise up to be

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.640 
I'm going to want it to rise up to be
about<00:02:43.069> you<00:02:43.819> know<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.329> keep<00:02:44.510> up<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.139> it<00:02:45.470> would

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
about you know to keep up so it it would

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.059 
about you know to keep up so it it would
be<00:02:45.769> nice<00:02:45.889> if<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.130> was<00:02:46.280> huge<00:02:46.639> but<00:02:47.829> it's<00:02:48.829> not

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
be nice if it was huge but it's not

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.039 
be nice if it was huge but it's not
going<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.340> be<00:02:49.459> huge<00:02:52.299> now<00:02:53.299> another<00:02:53.690> thing<00:02:53.780> you

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
going to be huge now another thing you

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.860 
going to be huge now another thing you
can<00:02:54.200> do<00:02:54.380> instead<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.160> needing<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:56.690> can

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
can do instead of needing it you can

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.640 
can do instead of needing it you can
just<00:02:56.900> put<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.350> right<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.829> pan<00:02:58.069> like<00:02:58.370> that

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
just put it right in the pan like that

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.879 
just put it right in the pan like that
and<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.859> can<00:03:01.069> turn<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.400> over<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.620> would<00:03:03.739> be

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
and you can turn it over so it would be

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.620 
and you can turn it over so it would be
good<00:03:04.069> if<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.280> got<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.609> air<00:03:04.790> out<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:05.480> it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
good if you got the air out so that it

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.420 
good if you got the air out so that it
will<00:03:05.720> start<00:03:06.049> over<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:08.600> want<00:03:08.810> your<00:03:09.430> you

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
will start over you want your you

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.740 
will start over you want your you
usually<00:03:10.609> want<00:03:11.090> your<00:03:11.269> lines<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.930> be<00:03:12.109> underneath

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
usually want your lines to be underneath

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.800 
usually want your lines to be underneath
ok<00:03:14.829> let's<00:03:15.829> try

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
ok let's try

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:26.940 
ok let's try
oh<00:03:23.849> ok<00:03:24.849> but<00:03:25.060> generally<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.569> would<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:25.950> roll

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
oh ok but generally you would just roll

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.190 
oh ok but generally you would just roll
it<00:03:27.160> up<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.610> make<00:03:28.450> sure<00:03:28.480> when<00:03:28.840> you're<00:03:28.959> rolling

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
it up and make sure when you're rolling

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.509 
it up and make sure when you're rolling
it<00:03:29.470> up<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.360> attaches<00:03:31.840> together<00:03:32.440> if<00:03:33.310> it's

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
it up but it attaches together if it's

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.640 
it up but it attaches together if it's
too<00:03:33.760> oily<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.420> won't<00:03:34.599> attach<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.200> see<00:03:35.410> let's

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
too oily it won't attach you see let's

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.250 
too oily it won't attach you see let's
just<00:03:35.800> come<00:03:35.980> right<00:03:36.160> back<00:03:36.370> up<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.140> then<00:03:38.140> you're

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
just come right back up and then you're

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.330 
just come right back up and then you're
going<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.440> have<00:03:38.500> bread<00:03:38.860> that's<00:03:39.040> going<00:03:39.280> to

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
going to have bread that's going to

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.570 
going to have bread that's going to
completely<00:03:39.700> unroll<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.769> maybe<00:03:42.040> in<00:03:42.250> order<00:03:42.459> to

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
completely unroll so maybe in order to

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.070 
completely unroll so maybe in order to
keep<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.880> from<00:03:43.030> doing<00:03:43.209> that<00:03:43.450> I'll<00:03:43.660> have<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.930> add

keep it from doing that I'll have to add
a<00:03:44.530> little<00:03:45.459> more<00:03:45.849> flour<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.900> won't<00:03:50.260> be<00:03:50.470> oily

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.350 

okay<00:03:56.190> it's<00:03:57.190> okay<00:03:57.549> if<00:03:57.760> your<00:03:57.910> bread<00:03:58.090> doesn't

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
okay it's okay if your bread doesn't

okay it's okay if your bread doesn't
work<00:03:59.790> everything<00:04:00.790> turns<00:04:01.030> out<00:04:01.180> differently

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
work everything turns out differently

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
you see that time there are no lines see

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.729 
you see that time there are no lines see
this<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:13.000> bit<00:04:13.269> here<00:04:13.299> see<00:04:14.080> it's<00:04:14.349> stuck

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
this this bit here see it's stuck

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.430 
this this bit here see it's stuck
together<00:04:15.479> because<00:04:16.479> I<00:04:16.570> added<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:16.989> little<00:04:17.019> more

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440

together because I added a little more
flour<00:04:19.079> okay<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:20.229> then<00:04:20.350> we're<00:04:20.500> going<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.709> need

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
flour okay and then we're going to need

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.940 
flour okay and then we're going to need
one<00:04:21.100> more<00:04:21.310> for<00:04:21.549> this<00:04:24.840> if<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.050> sort<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.350> pull<00:04:26.740> it

one more for this if you sort of pull it
as<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.400> roll<00:04:27.700> it<00:04:27.940> it's<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:29.830> can<00:04:30.160> be<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.780> better

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
as you roll it it's it can be a better

ok that helped see because oil will keep

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.240 
ok that helped see because oil will keep
it<00:05:14.919> from<00:05:15.070> sticking<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.760> itself<00:05:16.830> ok<00:05:17.830> I<00:05:17.860> have<00:05:18.070> to

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
it from sticking to itself ok I have to

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.779 
it from sticking to itself ok I have to
go<00:05:18.400> find<00:05:18.700> another<00:05:18.820> loaf<00:05:19.270> pan<00:05:20.229> for<00:05:20.560> that<00:05:20.729> ok<00:05:21.729> so

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
go find another loaf pan for that ok so

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.250 
go find another loaf pan for that ok so
now<00:05:22.120> these<00:05:22.389> are<00:05:22.570> going<00:05:22.720> to<00:05:22.780> sit<00:05:22.990> here<00:05:23.020> and

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
now these are going to sit here and

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.899 
now these are going to sit here and
they're<00:05:23.530> going<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.770> rise<00:05:23.950> until<00:05:24.490> they're<00:05:24.669> just

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
they're going to rise until they're just

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.860 
they're going to rise until they're just
up<00:05:25.659> above<00:05:25.900> the<00:05:26.530> pan<00:05:27.190> slightly<00:05:27.789> the<00:05:28.479> mind<00:05:28.720> that

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
up above the pan slightly the mind that

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.420 
up above the pan slightly the mind that
rise<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:29.320> much<00:05:29.530> because<00:05:29.770> the

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
rise that much because the

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.950 
rise that much because the
probably<00:05:30.640> won't<00:05:30.820> rise<00:05:31.000> double<00:05:31.540> now<00:05:31.690> they'll

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
probably won't rise double now they'll

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.920 
probably won't rise double now they'll
probably<00:05:32.170> rise<00:05:33.120> half<00:05:34.120> again<00:05:34.480> or<00:05:34.660> a<00:05:34.690> third

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
probably rise half again or a third

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.390 
probably rise half again or a third
again<00:05:35.230> as<00:05:35.380> much<00:05:36.090> maybe<00:05:37.140> okay<00:05:38.140> this<00:05:39.100> is<00:05:39.250> all

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
again as much maybe okay this is all

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.700 
again as much maybe okay this is all
depending<00:05:39.850> on<00:05:39.970> how<00:05:40.180> much<00:05:40.870> yeast<00:05:41.140> you<00:05:41.350> put<00:05:41.560> in

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
depending on how much yeast you put in

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.620 
depending on how much yeast you put in
how<00:05:42.010> fast<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.610> will<00:05:42.700> rise<00:05:42.910> depends<00:05:43.450> on<00:05:43.540> how

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
how fast it will rise depends on how

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.080 
how fast it will rise depends on how
much<00:05:43.750> East<00:05:44.020> this<00:05:44.950> is<00:05:45.100> really<00:05:45.280> not<00:05:45.520> taking<00:05:45.940> very

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
much East this is really not taking very

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.750 
much East this is really not taking very
long<00:05:46.180> for<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:46.960> risings<00:05:47.410> in<00:05:47.560> between<00:05:47.890> okay

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
long for the risings in between okay

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.260 
long for the risings in between okay
