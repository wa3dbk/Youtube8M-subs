00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:16.610
 the filming crew 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.949
 the ferrari f60 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.680

 the repetition why but there is no difference between you and me 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.370
 but regarding the commemoration these elements to his fate of our history 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.620
 associate most of the time the death of someone is the deadly conflict 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.890
 barbaric made by a few days off 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.449
 I thought we could commemorate Thursday 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.449
 this evening in November more than 80 homes fell into oblivion 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.980
 we pronounce on our schedule 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.790
 by sitting down they will talk about it every month 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.020
 there are of course some people who always refuse to say that they 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.000
 have to face men have already occurred today in which 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.210
 evolve armed men will play soon 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.700
 to come and mark social sciences 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.370
 it's wonderful why 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.120
 because if gauthier people communicate with us against the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.800
 baton blows they know that words are much more formidable weapons 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.440
 it is beautiful gives us access to understanding and for those who are 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.680
 interested in establishing the truth he is he added as you 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.500

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770

 entire crisis and have been bought intolerance and oppression 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.150
 for sure you have the right to express yourself with complete freedom 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.580
 of speech and thought 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.910
 today the monitoring power of the binding newspaper for the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.600
 conformism it is a question of between other solution it is necessary to describe how in 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.770
 did we get there 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.080
 whose fault is there who has some who are more responsible 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.170
 but that will have to be accountable but to be honest 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.920
 if you pick the culprits 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.940
 do you look in a mirror 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.930

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.930
 back that your silence 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.210
 the other big change that if the perpetrators 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.020
 were not enough last night I tried to break this silence at night 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.790
 last I explode as soon as possible for this country to remember 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.279

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.579
 in this respect he added the date of November 5 in our memoirs 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.760

 portrait if you suffer becomes a holder of this government you 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.749

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:58.429
 any commemoration on November 5th but if against 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:02.589
