store<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:38.939> got<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.780> something

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
store and got these this is something

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.410 
store and got these this is something
that<00:01:40.710> may<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.460> these<00:01:41.970> were<00:01:42.180> not

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that may be good to know these were not

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.100 
that may be good to know these were not
5499<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> store<00:01:44.060> they<00:01:45.060> were<00:01:45.420> i<00:01:45.689> believe<00:01:45.960> i

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
5499 in the store they were i believe i

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.889 
5499 in the store they were i believe i
think<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> salesperson<00:01:47.189> said<00:01:47.430> 110<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
think the salesperson said 110 in the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.330 
think the salesperson said 110 in the
store<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.350> because<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> was<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.100> their

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
store but because it was on their

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.179 
store but because it was on their
website<00:01:50.759> he<00:01:51.659> matched<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.619> no<00:01:52.799> problem<00:01:53.130> at

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
website he matched it with no problem at

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.969 
website he matched it with no problem at
all<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.270> most<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.170> oakley<00:01:55.439> vault<00:01:55.470> stores

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
all so most of the oakley vault stores

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.679 
all so most of the oakley vault stores
will<00:01:56.189> probably<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.649> ask<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:59.100> to

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
will probably do that if you ask them to

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.030 
will probably do that if you ask them to
it's<00:02:00.689> got<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.020> stuff<00:02:01.500> written<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:01.920> the

inside<00:02:02.310> my<00:02:02.520> Lighting's<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.210> good<00:02:03.420> so

inside my Lighting's not that good so
it's<00:02:04.560> hard<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> made<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.549> USA<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
it's hard to see the made in the USA and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.949 
it's hard to see the made in the USA and
then<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.910> side<00:02:08.970> here<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.629> has<00:02:09.750> all<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
then on this side here it has all the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.080 
then on this side here it has all the
oakley<00:02:10.319> markings<00:02:10.770> in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.119 

it<00:02:13.269> says<00:02:13.450> current<00:02:13.720> case<00:02:13.989> but<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:14.590> don't<00:02:15.010> think

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
it says current case but I don't think

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.800 
it says current case but I don't think
that's<00:02:15.280> going<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.550> come<00:02:15.760> out<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.090> well<00:02:16.269> on<00:02:16.480> this

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
that's going to come out so well on this

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.370 
that's going to come out so well on this
video<00:02:17.110> just<00:02:17.319> due<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.500> my<00:02:17.650> lighting<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.190> Oh
