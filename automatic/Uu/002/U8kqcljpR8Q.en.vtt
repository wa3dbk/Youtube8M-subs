00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
so these actually have a lot of scuffing

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.370 
so these actually have a lot of scuffing
which<00:03:11.280> I'm<00:03:11.489> surprised<00:03:11.970> because<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.690> was<00:03:13.140> kind

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
which I'm surprised because I was kind

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.199 
which I'm surprised because I was kind
of<00:03:13.500> i'm<00:03:14.010> holding<00:03:14.459> off<00:03:14.579> on<00:03:14.640> getting<00:03:14.970> them

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
of i'm holding off on getting them

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.580 
of i'm holding off on getting them
because<00:03:15.510> they<00:03:15.660> are<00:03:15.690> really<00:03:15.930> kind<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> pricey

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
because they are really kind of pricey

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.140 
because they are really kind of pricey
so<00:03:16.920> i<00:03:16.950> was<00:03:17.190> thinking<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:17.670> they<00:03:17.819> would<00:03:17.880> be

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
so i was thinking that they would be

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.900 
so i was thinking that they would be
just<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.019> little<00:03:19.049> bit<00:03:19.350> nicer<00:03:19.639> but<00:03:20.639> they<00:03:20.730> have

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
just a little bit nicer but they have

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.110 
just a little bit nicer but they have
like<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> lot<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.630> scuffing<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.470> them<00:03:23.120> but

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
like a lot of scuffing on them but

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.520 
like a lot of scuffing on them but
they're<00:03:24.299> really<00:03:24.420> heavy<00:03:24.810> they're<00:03:25.260> much

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
they're really heavy they're much

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.440 
they're really heavy they're much
heavier<00:03:25.980> than<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.310> other<00:03:26.430> ones<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:27.329> i've

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
heavier than the other ones that i've

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.490 
heavier than the other ones that i've
gotten<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.989> were<00:03:28.139> by<00:03:28.440> hasbro<00:03:29.130> in<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:31.230> blind

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
gotten that were by hasbro in the blind

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.670 
gotten that were by hasbro in the blind

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
bags and things so very heavy definitely

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.479 
bags and things so very heavy definitely

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
could be used as a paperweight so those

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:47.460 
could be used as a paperweight so those
are<00:03:38.819> my<00:03:38.900> cute<00:03:39.920> ponies<00:03:41.600> they're<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:42.900> cute
