00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
still in the return period for this open

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200 
still in the return period for this open
box<00:01:06.840> best<00:01:07.740> buy<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.430> I'll<00:01:08.549> probably<00:01:08.729> return

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
box best buy one so I'll probably return

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.500 
box best buy one so I'll probably return
that<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.720> paid<00:01:10.610> 179<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that because I paid 179 for this this is

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.810 
that because I paid 179 for this this is
about<00:01:12.750> 250<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> text<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.490> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
about 250 with the text on it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.200 
about 250 with the text on it
so<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.450> more<00:01:15.630> obvious<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.619> send<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.979> back

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
so it's more obvious to send that back

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.210 
so it's more obvious to send that back
in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> box<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.960> these<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:22.220> QuickStart

this<00:01:48.479> kind<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> bothers<00:01:48.990> me<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> little<00:01:49.500> bit<00:01:49.799> why

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
this kind of bothers me a little bit why

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.240 
this kind of bothers me a little bit why
HP<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.500> moisture<00:01:52.500> connectors

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
HP do this because moisture connectors

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.560 
HP do this because moisture connectors
are<00:01:53.399> about<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.790> length<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:54.420> they've

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
are about this length and then they've

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.060 
are about this length and then they've
got<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.930> extension<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.829> here<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.240> whole

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
got this extension on here so the whole

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
got this extension on here so the whole
connector<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.090> goes<00:02:00.240> into<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> computer

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
connector that it goes into the computer

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.319 
connector that it goes into the computer
is<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.500> long<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.310> again<00:02:02.820> most<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.180> your

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
is this long and again most of your

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.870 
is this long and again most of your
average<00:02:03.540> connectors<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.880> only

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
average connectors are actually only

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.889 
average connectors are actually only
that<00:02:06.060> long<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.960> into<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> computer<00:02:07.610> so

charger go inside covering off here we

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.600 
charger go inside covering off here we
have<00:05:14.480> our<00:05:14.660> keyboard<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.440> for<00:05:16.250> what<00:05:16.370> I've<00:05:16.490> been

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
have our keyboard and for what I've been

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.660 
have our keyboard and for what I've been
finding<00:05:16.970> using<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.990> other<00:05:18.140> one<00:05:18.410> I<00:05:18.650> found<00:05:19.490> this

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
finding using the other one I found this

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.480 
finding using the other one I found this
keyboard<00:05:20.210> doesn't<00:05:20.570> have<00:05:20.720> very<00:05:20.990> good<00:05:21.200> feedback

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
keyboard doesn't have very good feedback

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.550 
keyboard doesn't have very good feedback
when<00:05:22.490> you're<00:05:22.640> typing<00:05:23.180> with<00:05:23.360> it<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:24.320> keyboard

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
when you're typing with it the keyboard

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.470 
when you're typing with it the keyboard
is<00:05:24.950> very<00:05:25.990> mushy<00:05:26.990> I<00:05:27.380> guess<00:05:27.830> I<00:05:27.950> could<00:05:28.130> say<00:05:28.480> the

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
is very mushy I guess I could say the

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.210 
is very mushy I guess I could say the
keys<00:05:29.780> don't<00:05:29.990> have<00:05:30.200> a<00:05:30.230> lot<00:05:30.470> of<00:05:30.590> spring<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.100> them

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
keys don't have a lot of spring to them

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.950 
keys don't have a lot of spring to them
so<00:05:31.430> again<00:05:31.730> it's<00:05:31.880> hard<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.270> get<00:05:32.450> really<00:05:32.720> good

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
so again it's hard to get really good

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.610 
so again it's hard to get really good
feedback<00:05:33.160> off<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.490> keyboard<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.810> HP<00:05:36.410> has

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
feedback off the keyboard and HP has

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.620 
feedback off the keyboard and HP has
their<00:05:36.830> textured<00:05:37.370> trackpad<00:05:37.940> here<00:05:38.180> so<00:05:38.330> it's<00:05:38.450> got

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
their textured trackpad here so it's got

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.800 
their textured trackpad here so it's got
a<00:05:38.870> whole<00:05:39.680> bunch<00:05:39.890> of<00:05:40.010> little<00:05:40.220> tiny<00:05:40.490> dimples<00:05:41.060> on

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
a whole bunch of little tiny dimples on

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.540 
a whole bunch of little tiny dimples on
it<00:05:41.990> it<00:05:42.110> gives<00:05:42.260> you<00:05:42.410> some<00:05:42.710> friction<00:05:43.160> on<00:05:43.310> it<00:05:43.340> but

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
it it gives you some friction on it but

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.040 
it it gives you some friction on it but
it<00:05:43.640> may<00:05:43.760> be<00:05:43.820> harder<00:05:44.210> to<00:05:44.240> move<00:05:44.510> your<00:05:44.690> finger

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
it may be harder to move your finger

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.680 
it may be harder to move your finger
around<00:05:45.190> on<00:05:46.190> it<00:05:46.340> they<00:05:46.970> also<00:05:47.180> put<00:05:47.650> two<00:05:48.650> distinct

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
around on it they also put two distinct

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.030 
around on it they also put two distinct
buttons<00:05:50.690> on<00:05:50.870> here<00:05:51.110> instead<00:05:51.350> of<00:05:51.470> just<00:05:51.650> one

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
buttons on here instead of just one

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.210 
buttons on here instead of just one
button<00:05:52.910> like<00:05:53.450> something<00:05:53.870> that<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.080> ACC<00:05:54.650> 700

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220
