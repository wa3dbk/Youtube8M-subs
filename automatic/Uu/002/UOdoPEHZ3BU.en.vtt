Ezra<00:04:37.430> went<00:04:37.610> down<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.240> kind<00:04:38.419> of<00:04:38.479> gave<00:04:38.599> me<00:04:38.750> a

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
Ezra went down so it kind of gave me a

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.330 
Ezra went down so it kind of gave me a
break<00:04:39.050> there<00:04:39.259> and<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.560> interval<00:04:39.949> I<00:04:40.130> guess<00:04:40.250> it

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.790 
break there and the interval I guess it
was<00:04:40.460> about<00:04:40.550> midway<00:04:40.970> so<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:41.930> knew<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.410> just<00:04:42.470> had<00:04:42.680> to
