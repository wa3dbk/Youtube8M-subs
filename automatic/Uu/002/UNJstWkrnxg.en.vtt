00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.540
 hello this is a very simple tutorial and 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.420
 quick to show how we painted two 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.740
 magnolia pistils especially for 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.169
 female students who are studying 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.259
 instructorado of flowers of rubber eva without 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.910
 remote molds because this is one of 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.690
 those of the pistils that have to 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.580
 paint for your flower at your hand the pink 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.650
 remember that the magnolias come or 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.050
 white or pink so generally not 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.329
 there are more colors than those so lend 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.120
 Attention to how to paint the pistil for 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.100
 our sleeve the pink one in this case 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.870
 study using magenta 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.390
 once the pistil has it dry 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.359
 what they will do the pistil in general 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.430
 has this part a little bit darker 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:51.210
 so what I give is a basis 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.730
 soft magenta in case they are 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.460
 making a white magnolia this part 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.870
 would go white but in this case as is the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.870
 pink magnolia the task 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.580
 we will paint the theory of the class 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:13.210
 of magenta will give you a base 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.210
 clarita to all the part below 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.750
 they do not have to be even or anything 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.800
 because it 's for 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.800
 put a color 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.080
 this is going to give everything to everything 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.420
 around once you are and with the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.370
 same magenta notice that when the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.900
 we assemble remember inside they were left 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.910
 like little pickets when we take out 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.330
 outside so all that will happen to you 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:46.590
 the brush so that all those 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.930
 little tips with a little color will happen to me 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.520
 15 the almost dry with little paint 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.520
 and notice that he is going to be 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.429
 tips of magenta color 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.090
 once we have this done 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.270
 what we are going to do is take the color 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.310
 very little black 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.620
 at the tip nothing more 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.319
 and I'm going to start giving it all this edge 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.780
 that we did to him where he 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.340
 we mark the edge 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.970
 they will go to mark the points gently 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 then they are going to take out the painting in the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.330
 napkin 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.980
 and they are going to smoke down all the black 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.080
 that have been left there 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.989
 is to give it as a kind of shadow 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.760
 and deepen all that that edge 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.760
 He cited that we were creating 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.910
 in this way so special will stay 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.250
 smoking everything down to hit more 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.980
 people and darker this part and the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.290
 tip a little magenta up like this 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.750
 they are going to paint all styles of 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.610
 magnolia for the pink magnolia for the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.350
 white machinery this part is going to 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.690
 leave white and the one that they have to 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.760
 paint it to give it a little color in the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.350
 top part, notice that the sleeves 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.220
 White has a color rather 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.870
 green or create a brown cited a greenish 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.950
 so this one is watching to learn the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.680
 fertile daughter 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.470
 who are trying to imitate the color 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.970
 of the style that takes up that would be 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.510
 everything and see you in the next 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.510
 tutorials
