00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.290
 a makeup 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.689
 I am a member when the lipstick and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.810
 They told me how they wanted tutorials 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.829
 about it 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.560
 so he decided to do this makeup 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.720
 it's like in pink tones I think that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.239
 at this moment it does not show on the camera 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.420
 but on my eyelids I have a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.480
 pink in intense but determined for 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.280
 make it seem more natural to try 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.950
 do as makeup as more dramatic 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.930
 so to speak because I am always from 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.510
 the person who gets like that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.430
 neutral colors in the eyes and the motive 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.590
 of neutral colors 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.690
 with this lipstick would be like super 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.310
 ok but I wanted to try the different 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 put a little color to my makeup 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.120
 to not always be the same videos and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.010
 well I think that for the generation I do not know 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.010
 note too but I hope that 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.050
 at this moment the box 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.740
 Miley Cyrus 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:27.840
 is equal to normal levels too 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.960
 in red and is also signed and very 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.160
 beautiful and the tone is beautiful the truth is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 that I buy it because this is a 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.070
 bug and if not just because the plane's 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.810
 corn andrews I think it's never a 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.970
 problem because they are simply not my 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.490
 style and I'm more matte more things but 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.590
 I liked the effect that the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:59.659
 colors in your amplified line because I 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:02.210
 liked how he told me then 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.890
 with this he said that I have my lips is 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.060
 more than enough for me obviously 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.060
 a whole thing of taste 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.840
 like everyone else and it's super good 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.549
 very good quality very good in 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.379
 general everything I have tried have 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.860
 been excellent and this is not the 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.510
 exception 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.430
 can that effect go away for a while 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.040
 like so blog on the lips while 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.470
 when the dye and then that's what 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.470
 good that at the end like of the day 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.890
 then I bought it twice because 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.569
 the regions that I bought it was lost to 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.489
 the ten minutes of having bought it from 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.000
 I still cry inside 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:57.440
 but good because I love with all my 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.870
 person miley small review of this 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.750
 lipstick and let's go with it 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.940
 I'm going to start with the eye area 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.500
 applying a base to shade that and 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.599
 I'm going to apply it to all the staff 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.080
 superior and I will also extend it a little 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.080
 to the bottom 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.080
 of the palette andré múz fashion I'm going to 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.240
 take the color newt and apply it over 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.710
 all the eyelid both mobile and fixed 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.140
 to create a basis for the others 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.450
 shadows of the same planet I'm going to take the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.560
 tone the vix that is a clear coffee if 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.330
 you want to give half a substance 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.160
 makeup you could use a coffee a 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.930
 little stronger this I will be 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.940
 applying in the eye socket and how 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.530
 can see I left it very subtle now 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.720
 those typical Chinese palettes of many 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.430
 colors I'm going to take this pink pink 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.050
 that in ba2 I call him because they have 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.460
 happened a better name for him I'll go 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.230
 to apply on the coffee tone of 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.180
 nantes and extended it a little towards the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.950
 innermost part of the basin and 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:54.160
 blurred so they do not look cut and you 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:56.080
 mix well the colors of it 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.700
 Chinese palette I will take that tone of the 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.920
 corner that is a pink super super 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.930
 strong and I'll apply it in the part 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.190
 internal of the basin and I'm going to blur 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.780
 to mix with the pink that 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.820
 had previously applied I'm going to take 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.070
 again the coffee tone mixed with 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.450
 the pink burnt to mark more my 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.920
 account because I had missed a 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.660
 little the color that is where they have I'm going 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.370
 to take the pink tone and I'll 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.370
 apply the intercom and tap 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.370
 now with the clearest tone of all 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.630
 I will illuminate the area of the lacrimal and 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.350
 I'm going to extend a little bit on the line 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.480
 lower eyelashes 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.190
 and with our pencil type and the pink one 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.570
 intense I'm going to mark the bottom line 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.120
 of the tabs but for the part 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.950
 external and average putting the connector not 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.660
 clarito de nantes and a step that I 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.920
 I had forgotten that they illuminate the arch of 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.420
 eyebrow and I'm using the same 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.430
 shade that in the lacrimal and now as 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.130
 black delineador de natura I'm going to mark 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.780
 the water line inside and above 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.790
 I go to all stability in l'oréal gel 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.410
 and a beveled brochette and I'm going to 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.180
 delineate my eyes by the top line 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.480
 of the eyelashes making a tail 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.480
 cat 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.760
 now in curls and eyelashes and masks 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.400
 I am using telescopic 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.080
 l'oreal if you wanted something more dramatic 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.430
 they could also apply lashes 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.169
 falsehoods passing a face of concealer 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.419
 I will be using the dye in 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.850
 brainerd by bobby braun in tone 7 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.650
 like the medium pitch and news 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.220
 Applicator directly because he wants 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.580
 try this brochette of soeva in the 142 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.580
 concealer bar 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:33.580
 as a base I will use a bobby 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.559
 braun to show my past video on my 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.300
 tone is the 4 natural I'm explaining 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:38.979
 with the skunk but this one is already all 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.719
 retired and old and the hairs come out 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.339
 I do not know if they know where I can buy a 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.020
 baratito that touches between villasana seen 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.169
 leave me comments and know where by 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.169
 finish 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.620
 for this they use these powders and they 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.360
 I said that I want to finish 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.889
 I also go with my face and for that 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.139
 I am using the terracotta powders of 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.729
 ory flame I will mark the area below or 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.919
 mules and also a little my forehead because 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.840
 it's huge 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.419
 and also a little blush on my 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.220
 cheeks to fix my eyebrows 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.320
 it costs a lot but I'm putting it 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.240
 all the effort to improve and used a 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.080
 video of the pencil and then blurred with a 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.879
 eyebrow brush 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.530
 But the reason for existence of 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:19.569
 this makeup that is the glam pib of 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.460
 miley cyrus and true that the camera does not 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.150
 manages to capture well its vibrant color but 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.150
 It is very cute 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.400
 besides environment 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.400
 It would be stable and you liked it 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.600
 the eyes but I like it 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:01.770
 today if you liked this video 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.770
 remember to give him credit 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.340
 giant
