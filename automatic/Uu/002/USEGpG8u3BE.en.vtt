00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
are three settings here which I will go

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.430 
are three settings here which I will go
over<00:02:17.989> right<00:02:18.530> now<00:02:19.239> okay<00:02:20.239> here's<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.630> quick<00:02:21.019> test

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
over right now okay here's a quick test

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.340 
over right now okay here's a quick test
of<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:22.220> cardio<00:02:22.790> option<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.750> microphone

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
of the cardio option of the microphone

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.520 
of the cardio option of the microphone
this<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.980> first<00:02:25.370> option<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:27.049> is<00:02:27.230> for

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
this is the first option and this is for

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.720 
this is the first option and this is for
voiceovers<00:02:28.570> anything<00:02:29.570> like<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.920> now<00:02:31.459> I'm

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
voiceovers anything like that so now I'm

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.600 
voiceovers anything like that so now I'm
at<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.299> reasonable<00:02:32.959> distance<00:02:32.989> away<00:02:33.860> from<00:02:34.100> the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
at a reasonable distance away from the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.630 
at a reasonable distance away from the
microphone<00:02:34.850> about<00:02:35.660> like<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.380> don't<00:02:37.340> know<00:02:37.430> maybe

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
microphone about like I don't know maybe

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.830 
microphone about like I don't know maybe
a<00:02:38.030> foot<00:02:38.600> or<00:02:38.870> two<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.250> now<00:02:40.280> we'll<00:02:40.730> go<00:02:40.880> closer<00:02:41.269> and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
a foot or two so now we'll go closer and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.560 
a foot or two so now we'll go closer and
you<00:02:42.290> can<00:02:42.470> hear<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.860> difference<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.640> hello<00:02:44.030> you

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
you can hear the difference so hello you

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.560 
you can hear the difference so hello you
can<00:02:44.660> probably<00:02:45.079> see<00:02:45.230> me<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.739> shot<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:47.150> hello

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
can probably see me in the shot so hello

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.520 
can probably see me in the shot so hello
hello<00:02:48.380> hello<00:02:49.069> here's<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.000> test<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.720> second

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
hello hello here's a test of the second

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.290 
hello hello here's a test of the second
setting<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.220> microphone

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
setting on the microphone

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.960 
setting on the microphone
and<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:54.410> has<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.400> 10<00:02:56.210> decibel<00:02:57.170> p<00:02:58.040> ad<00:02:58.610> which

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
and this has a 10 decibel p ad which

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.360 
and this has a 10 decibel p ad which
means<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.750> can<00:02:59.990> record<00:03:00.470> louder<00:03:00.860> things

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
means that you can record louder things

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.910 
means that you can record louder things
with<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.450> here<00:03:03.410> I'm<00:03:03.500> going<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.710> play<00:03:03.860> some

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
with it so here I'm going to play some

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.900 
with it so here I'm going to play some
music<00:03:04.780> into<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.400> I'm<00:03:07.400> going<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.640> make<00:03:07.790> it

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
music into it I'm going to make it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:04:12.930 
music into it I'm going to make it
pretty<00:03:08.120> loud

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.849 

okay<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.329> is<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.780> third<00:04:15.049> option<00:04:15.349> on<00:04:15.769> the

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
okay so this is the third option on the

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.090 
okay so this is the third option on the
microphone<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:17.660> omnidirectional<00:04:18.169> so

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
microphone it is omnidirectional so

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.450 
microphone it is omnidirectional so
sound<00:04:19.910> coming<00:04:20.299> from<00:04:20.449> everywhere<00:04:21.430> will<00:04:22.430> be

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
sound coming from everywhere will be

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.529 
sound coming from everywhere will be
heard<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.960> I'll<00:04:24.919> speak<00:04:25.460> into<00:04:25.669> it<00:04:25.850> while<00:04:26.270> music

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
is playing so you can see how it works

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.000

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
thing that I don't like about it is kind

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.640 
thing that I don't like about it is kind
of<00:05:18.009> this<00:05:18.250> part<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.639> the<00:05:18.759> stand<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.389> is<00:05:20.139> a<00:05:20.379> little

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
of this part of the stand it is a little

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.330 
of this part of the stand it is a little
bit<00:05:20.889> flimsy<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.789> can<00:05:22.000> see<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.379> but<00:05:23.379> when<00:05:24.159> you

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
bit flimsy you can see that but when you

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.939 
bit flimsy you can see that but when you
adjust<00:05:24.789> it<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.090> tighten<00:05:25.629> it<00:05:25.779> then<00:05:26.050> seems<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.919> be

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
adjust it to tighten it then seems to be

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.670 
adjust it to tighten it then seems to be
fine<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:28.000> only<00:05:28.150> other<00:05:28.300> thing<00:05:28.509> is<00:05:29.020> that<00:05:29.439> I

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
fine and the only other thing is that I

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.129 
fine and the only other thing is that I
feel<00:05:30.039> that<00:05:30.370> sometimes<00:05:30.939> with<00:05:31.360> this<00:05:31.569> microphone

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
feel that sometimes with this microphone

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.769 
feel that sometimes with this microphone
the<00:05:32.860> higher<00:05:33.460> pitched<00:05:33.759> sounds<00:05:34.330> are<00:05:34.479> a<00:05:34.509> little

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:34.779 
the higher pitched sounds are a little

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.679 
the higher pitched sounds are a little
