a<00:00:02.760> handy<00:00:03.760> little<00:00:03.880> practice<00:00:04.330> tool<00:00:04.510> that<00:00:04.690> I

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720 
a handy little practice tool that I

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.880 
a handy little practice tool that I
thought<00:00:04.900> you<00:00:04.960> might<00:00:05.020> find<00:00:05.380> useful<00:00:05.560> it's

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:05.890 
thought you might find useful it's

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.830 
thought you might find useful it's
called<00:00:06.100> a<00:00:06.160> metronome<00:00:06.550> and<00:00:06.880> it's<00:00:07.510> not<00:00:07.660> one<00:00:07.809> of

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:07.840 
called a metronome and it's not one of

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.049 
called a metronome and it's not one of
those<00:00:08.050> old-fashioned<00:00:08.830> tiki-taka<00:00:09.640> metronomes

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
those old-fashioned tiki-taka metronomes

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.759 
those old-fashioned tiki-taka metronomes
but<00:00:10.269> it's<00:00:10.389> a<00:00:10.480> digital<00:00:10.660> one<00:00:11.019> called<00:00:11.320> the<00:00:11.469> Korg

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
but it's a digital one called the Korg

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.030 
but it's a digital one called the Korg
and<00:00:12.040> a<00:00:12.790> 30<00:00:13.299> and<00:00:13.599> my<00:00:14.019> students<00:00:14.469> find<00:00:14.589> it<00:00:14.799> really

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
and a 30 and my students find it really

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.100 
and a 30 and my students find it really
helpful<00:00:15.280> because<00:00:15.820> it<00:00:16.059> lets<00:00:16.240> them<00:00:16.420> track<00:00:16.660> their

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
helpful because it lets them track their

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.200 
helpful because it lets them track their
progress<00:00:17.320> so<00:00:18.160> this<00:00:18.340> particular<00:00:18.760> model<00:00:18.910> goes

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
progress so this particular model goes

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.750 
progress so this particular model goes
from<00:00:19.420> 40<00:00:19.720> beats<00:00:19.900> per<00:00:20.080> minute<00:00:20.350> to<00:00:20.400> 208<00:00:21.400> bees<00:00:21.580> per

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
from 40 beats per minute to 208 bees per

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.280 
from 40 beats per minute to 208 bees per
minute<00:00:22.000> and<00:00:22.090> that's<00:00:22.150> more<00:00:22.510> than<00:00:22.720> enough<00:00:22.780> tempo

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
minute and that's more than enough tempo

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.410 
minute and that's more than enough tempo
variation<00:00:23.830> for<00:00:24.010> anymore<00:00:24.250> employer<00:00:24.760> but<00:00:25.270> some

variation for anymore employer but some

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.730 
variation for anymore employer but some
snare<00:00:25.630> drummers<00:00:25.990> that<00:00:26.140> are<00:00:26.230> really<00:00:26.470> wanting

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
snare drummers that are really wanting

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.680

to push their mom and dad exercises you

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.120 
to push their mom and dad exercises you
can<00:00:28.780> certainly<00:00:29.080> get<00:00:29.230> models<00:00:29.530> that<00:00:29.650> go<00:00:29.740> faster

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
can certainly get models that go faster

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.290 
can certainly get models that go faster
than<00:00:30.280> that<00:00:30.370> but<00:00:30.610> this<00:00:30.700> will<00:00:30.880> suit<00:00:31.120> most

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
than that but this will suit most

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.940 
than that but this will suit most

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
with the other arrow okay so I'm gonna

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.109 
with the other arrow okay so I'm gonna
bring<00:01:02.860> it<00:01:02.980> back<00:01:03.070> down<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.309> 16<00:01:03.910> we're<00:01:04.030> gonna

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
bring it back down to 16 we're gonna

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.819 
bring it back down to 16 we're gonna
keep<00:01:04.329> it<00:01:04.509> fairly<00:01:04.689> slow<00:01:05.049> for<00:01:05.259> this<00:01:05.379> exercise

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
keep it fairly slow for this exercise

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.709 
keep it fairly slow for this exercise
and<00:01:06.219> I'm<00:01:06.819> gonna<00:01:06.939> show<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.240> how<00:01:07.509> you<00:01:07.600> can

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
and I'm gonna show you how you can

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.840 
and I'm gonna show you how you can
subdivide<00:01:08.079> that<00:01:08.259> note<00:01:08.740> into<00:01:09.189> groups<00:01:09.429> of<00:01:09.579> three

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
subdivide that note into groups of three

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.300 
subdivide that note into groups of three
so<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.179> beat<00:01:10.539> that<00:01:10.810> single<00:01:11.499> beat<00:01:11.649> I'm<00:01:11.859> gonna

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
so that beat that single beat I'm gonna

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.859 
so that beat that single beat I'm gonna
break<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.670> down<00:01:12.789> into<00:01:12.999> groups<00:01:13.299> of<00:01:13.420> three<00:01:13.659> and

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
break it down into groups of three and

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.279 
break it down into groups of three and
so<00:01:14.020> if<00:01:14.109> you<00:01:14.200> press<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.679> top<00:01:14.950> gray<00:01:15.579> button<00:01:16.030> and

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
so if you press the top gray button and

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.139 
so if you press the top gray button and
then<00:01:17.289> you<00:01:17.560> use<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.920> bottom<00:01:18.219> arrows<00:01:18.850> earth

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
then you use the bottom arrows earth

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.179 
then you use the bottom arrows earth
buttons<00:01:19.539> again<00:01:19.659> this<00:01:20.289> number<00:01:20.679> zero<00:01:20.950> will

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
buttons again this number zero will

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.090 
buttons again this number zero will
change<00:01:21.490> from<00:01:21.789> zero<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.719> seven<00:01:22.929> once<00:01:23.709> you<00:01:23.859> get

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
change from zero to seven once you get

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.859 
change from zero to seven once you get
to<00:01:24.280> seven<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.819> will<00:01:24.969> then<00:01:25.149> change<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.509> notes

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
to seven it will then change to notes

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.870 
to seven it will then change to notes
I'm<00:01:26.079> going<00:01:26.109> to<00:01:26.289> go<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.799> second<00:01:27.609> grouping

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
I'm going to go to the second grouping

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.149 
I'm going to go to the second grouping
of<00:01:27.999> notes<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.509> I'm<00:01:28.749> gonna<00:01:28.869> press<00:01:29.109> the<00:01:29.950> top
