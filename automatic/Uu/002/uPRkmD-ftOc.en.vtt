00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.330 
cells are most mitotic and are actively
dividing<00:01:50.409> as<00:01:50.819> the<00:01:51.819> cells<00:01:52.060> divide<00:01:53.069> they<00:01:54.069> move

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
dividing as the cells divide they move

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.289 
dividing as the cells divide they move
up<00:01:54.659> through<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:55.840> different<00:01:56.170> layers<00:01:56.350> so<00:01:57.299> above
