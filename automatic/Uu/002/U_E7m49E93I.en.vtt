well invented I was inspired by Pride

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.760 
well invented I was inspired by Pride
and<00:01:13.790> Prejudice<00:01:13.880> I<00:01:14.510> would<00:01:14.930> care<00:01:15.200> not<00:01:15.410> living

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
and Prejudice I would care not living

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.810 
and Prejudice I would care not living
with<00:01:16.070> 2005<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.360> saw<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.600> show<00:01:18.460> where<00:01:19.460> she<00:01:20.230> has

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
with 2005 I saw a show where she has

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.330 
with 2005 I saw a show where she has
there<00:01:22.820> her<00:01:23.390> blush<00:01:24.260> or<00:01:24.500> bronze<00:01:24.770> on<00:01:25.040> very

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
there her blush or bronze on very

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.540 
there her blush or bronze on very
different<00:01:25.610> place<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:27.590> think<00:01:27.650> it<00:01:27.980> works<00:01:28.220> for

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
different place and I think it works for

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.910 
different place and I think it works for
my<00:01:28.750> face<00:01:29.750> shape<00:01:30.310> so<00:01:31.570> what<00:01:32.570> I'm<00:01:32.810> going<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.320> do<00:01:33.590> is

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
my face shape so what I'm going to do is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.840 
my face shape so what I'm going to do is
the<00:01:34.430> first<00:01:34.760> enemy<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.510> use<00:01:35.770> decide<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:37.370> show<00:01:37.610> it

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
the first enemy to use decide to show it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.310 
the first enemy to use decide to show it
how<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.930> is<00:01:39.110> if<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:39.680> apply<00:01:40.070> runs<00:01:40.730> underneath<00:01:44.320> as

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
how it is if I apply runs underneath as

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.240 
how it is if I apply runs underneath as
most<00:01:45.860> people<00:01:46.220> do

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.840 

very<00:01:51.250> cheap

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
very cheap

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.490 
very cheap
runs<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.870> think<00:01:53.140> some<00:01:54.040> pearls<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:56.350> bit

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
runs I think some pearls a little bit

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.039 
runs I think some pearls a little bit
too<00:01:56.920> dark<00:01:57.160> I<00:01:59.010> don't<00:02:00.010> care

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.319 

-<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.259> it<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.500> little<00:02:05.860> bit<00:02:06.009> too<00:02:06.280> much<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.149> can

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
- is it a little bit too much so you can

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.449 
- is it a little bit too much so you can
see<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.659> effect

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.809 

so<00:02:12.939> it<00:02:13.030> seems<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.659> little<00:02:13.780> bit

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.899 

and<00:02:17.299> then<00:02:18.250> go<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.519> temple<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.819> the

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
and then go to the temple this is the

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:33.680 
and then go to the temple this is the
drugstore<00:02:23.209> brush<00:02:23.780> it's<00:02:24.349> had<00:02:24.560> no<00:02:24.799> brand

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.090 

like

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
like

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.650 
like
a<00:02:36.220> little<00:02:36.880> bit<00:02:37.000> too<00:02:37.090> much

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.840 

but<00:02:41.230> yeah<00:02:42.010> I'm<00:02:42.820> going<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.450> apply<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:45.010> bronze

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850

but yeah I'm going to apply the bronze
on<00:02:46.210> a<00:02:46.240> other<00:02:48.510> place<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.230> other<00:02:50.320> cheek<00:02:50.890> hope

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
on a other place on the other cheek hope

on a other place on the other cheek hope
you<00:02:51.940> can<00:02:52.120> see<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.390> difference<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.490> know

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
you can see the difference as you know

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.620 
you can see the difference as you know
everywhere<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.410> put<00:02:56.440> shade<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:58.240> will<00:02:58.450> make

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
everywhere you put shade it will make

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.110 
everywhere you put shade it will make
your<00:02:58.840> face<00:02:59.110> look<00:02:59.470> more<00:02:59.950> narrow<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.430> what<00:03:00.910> we're

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
your face look more narrow so what we're

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.690 
your face look more narrow so what we're
going<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.420> do<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.810> take<00:03:02.650> some<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.220> bronze

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
going to do is take some of the bronze

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.420 
going to do is take some of the bronze
up<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.210> apply<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.210> middle

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
up and apply it just in the middle

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.690 
up and apply it just in the middle
still<00:03:09.430> on<00:03:09.580> any<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:09.970> cheekbones<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:12.640> you

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
still on any of the cheekbones now you

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.420 
still on any of the cheekbones now you
can<00:03:12.910> see<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.180> difference<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:17.250> there's<00:03:18.250> my

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
can see the difference and there's my

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.380 
can see the difference and there's my
little<00:03:18.490> trick<00:03:19.740> this<00:03:20.740> will<00:03:21.040> make<00:03:21.220> more<00:03:21.730> narrow

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
little trick this will make more narrow

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.060 
little trick this will make more narrow
and<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:24.390> side<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.420> my<00:03:25.810> face<00:03:26.080> it<00:03:26.650> will<00:03:26.860> make

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
and on this side of my face it will make

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.610 
and on this side of my face it will make
me<00:03:27.280> look<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:30.070> will<00:03:30.370> make<00:03:31.030> my<00:03:31.720> face<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.110> little

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
me look it will make my face a little

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.700 
me look it will make my face a little
more<00:03:32.770> squared<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.210> think<00:03:34.630> it's<00:03:35.110> just<00:03:35.470> what

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
more squared and I think it's just what

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.320 
more squared and I think it's just what
I<00:03:35.740> need

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
I need

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.180 
I need
you<00:03:37.330> can<00:03:37.480> do<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> same<00:03:38.140> thing<00:03:38.650> with<00:03:38.860> blush

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
you can do it the same thing with blush

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.850 
you can do it the same thing with blush
actually<00:03:39.820> but<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.570> use<00:03:40.720> bronzer<00:03:41.260> because<00:03:41.620> it's

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
actually but I use bronzer because it's

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.170 
actually but I use bronzer because it's
slightly<00:03:42.700> below<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:44.350> cheekbone

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
slightly below the cheekbone

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.110 
slightly below the cheekbone
but<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.390> only<00:03:46.570> apply<00:03:47.020> it<00:03:47.080> a<00:03:47.290> little<00:03:47.530> bit<00:03:47.710> in<00:03:47.860> a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
but you only apply it a little bit in a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.170 
but you only apply it a little bit in a
middle<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:50.830> work<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.280> out<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.430> little<00:03:51.760> bit<00:03:51.970> near

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
middle you work it out a little bit near

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.660 
middle you work it out a little bit near
the<00:03:52.420> end<00:03:52.600> actually<00:03:53.560> that's<00:03:54.100> it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
the end actually that's it

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.750 
the end actually that's it
so<00:03:55.030> not<00:03:55.450> on<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.840> up<00:03:55.960> of<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.350> cheek<00:03:56.590> not<00:03:57.130> here
