00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.420
 hello all good morning good afternoon 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.270
 Goodnight 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.790
 I am queen of chaos and we are going to touch the 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.700
 next topic that is about food 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.990
 transgenic since last week has been 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.900
 been talking about the subject in different 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.090
 activist social networks so this 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.310
 it's my little grain of sand there's more 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.530
 Similar and equally interesting topics 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.530
 on my channel if you like to see them 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.310
 well here we can see as leaves 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.530
 naturally dry they burn with 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.950
 ease and leave nothing but 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.950
 ashes 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.090
 now as you will see we have a bag of 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.420
 hedges here is the expiration clearly 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.600
 I decided to burn a whole bag this 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.570
 product already costs 5 pesos maximum in 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.590
 some places before then the truth 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.059
 every time I ate and bought guys but 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.040
 well here we see how it burns 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.570
 very interesting 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.130
 see how the flame intensifies 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.690
 they are burning 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.050
 very fast 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.260
 but no less intense fire that 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.410
 it's already something strange they seem candles or something 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.410
 A) Yes 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.909
 can see already can you think I appreciate 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.240
 grease 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.680
 what is a very strange orange liquid 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.500
 says my nephew that maybe that's the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.170
 cause is the fat here so that does not stop 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.020
 if the game is intense because it is fat 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.000
 it's very good observation for those 6 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.560
 years because it had not occurred to me 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 it has both and as such was 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.630
 the fire did not kill the fat 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.990
 means that our stomach either 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.070
 because you see you can appreciate the fat 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.910
 also on the rocks he was impregnated 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.920
 basically he was impregnated in the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.920
 very interesting rocks 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.630
 continue with the potatoes sabritas marinated 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.030
 unlike the guys these 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.040
 They took a long time to burn but they burned 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.920
 they did not leave any fat and they 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.350
 they disintegrated well I guess that means 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.400
 that although they cost 8 pesos, 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.400
 they poison so much 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.420
 when we comment on the chetos 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.940
 They said it could have been the cheese 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.190
 causing the strange liquid so 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.680
 let's see that to see what happened 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.050
 experiment was somewhat slow but after 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.170
 of burning a large part this did not let go 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.550
 almost no fat 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.550
 very interesting too 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.349
 finally because we liked to burn things 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.450
 junk we deal with a maruchan soup 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:09.050
 of chili piquin and shrimp cost quite a bit 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.780
 but what was burned disintegrated well 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.940
 then the problem would be the glass and the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.040
 fact that most do not expect more than 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.439
 three minutes to se cosa 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.420
 and they know that about sewing well with water 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.689
 wait good at least I expected 10 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.870
 minutes for months I did not like 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:32.590
 no blemish I did not like it too 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.629
 that soup in the end that's all 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.939
 planet I'm not going to eat che everything is neither 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.609
 This does not mean that they stop 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:42.069
 eat your favorite scrap yards but 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:46.030
 reduce their consumption at least in one 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:49.629
 50% let us be more aware of our 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.609
 health and the health of the planet what has 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.590
 that see the good planet health every 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.689
 time we consume these kinds of things 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.230
 Well, you see they are in plastic bags 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.620
 boxes and this I think it does not help the 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.920
 planet in addition if they are not 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.340
 if you can not recycle I think that 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.640
 it hurts much the health of the planet 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.280
 if the cds are bad cameramen but 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.810
 it was interesting and educational there if 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.780
 they want to do the experiment 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.150
 Do it but see them especially 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.780
 children that burn as profit for 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.830
 raise awareness of what we eat 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.139
 now if you wonder why I too 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.830
 me when they put this kind of stuff 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:36.860
 I told myself that I'm going to eat 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.890
 and commented that we are going to eat stones or 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.790
 be this this I know it hurts me 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.610
 but how can I fight it how can I 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.660
 stop eating what I'm eating 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.030
 well it's a way it would be 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.330
 a small garden would be a good 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.720
 option and they could find how to do it 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.750
 on the internet there are many pages to 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.580
 respect also create your own 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:11.140
 chickens or 5 to 7 chicks 2 4 to 3 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.590
 bunnies and do then there is solved 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.870
 what is the vegetables the fruits and the 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.529
 meat not there could be solved clear if 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.509
 they are encouraged to do this kind of thing 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:25.109
 to check more the products that 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:28.649
 we consume already know that they do not carry many 

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:33.629
 chemists already want the butchers in 

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:35.999
 the eggs are in the fruit good to see from 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:39.119
 where does it come from and those who do well 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:42.070
 things to support them and those that do not 

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:45.640
 buy that kind of stuff 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.820
 well we see you bye bye and not to the 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.820
 transgenic
