00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.690
 the hooks there is a manic pancho in the 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.690
 public 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:03.690
 spotted I like I like choirs 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.479
 I like that celestial corito I like 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.380
 those harmonies but a little voice and there 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:14.910
 a deep panchimalco voice and you have to 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.940
 to tune that little voice was the development 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.470
 there I am checking something very different 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.720

 good presentations and today has not been 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.870

 today I liked your presentation so much 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:45.760
 Thank you very much to Mr. Ricardo 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.980
 just so that the public can 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.930
 understand a little the difficulty of what 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.910
 that you do the three are not 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.700
 singing the same each one of them 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:58.060
 sing a different line and make a 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.700
 harmony is very complicated harmony 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.770
 that you make 33 are the seasons 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.660
 particles are very difficult and can 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.639
 do it and not hang on to what the 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.919
 another requires a training and a 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.780
 constant work that is not only 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.760
 then they are hours of hours of hours 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.860
 rehearsal have been very good today 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.990
 also gentlemen I just have to observe 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.309
 them 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.830
 I thought I was going to scream something because 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:24.499
 there are always details around here 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.389
 at the beginning there was a little bit of doubt 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:28.400
 I know if it was the phrasing bit the tuning 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.319
 very small but immediately 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.599
 they grabbed and they finished very well 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:34.279
 be careful with that really the lights 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.050
 are very difficult congratulations I had 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:40.770
 very difficult with very many citations 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:43.740
 thank you to take a seat gentlemen 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:47.389
