hi<00:00:01.020> guys<00:00:01.229> welcome<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.560> my<00:00:01.739> channel<00:00:01.769> weird

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hi guys welcome to my channel weird

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.820 
hi guys welcome to my channel weird
working<00:00:02.580> wonderful<00:00:02.969> now<00:00:03.689> stock<00:00:04.230> bikes<00:00:04.500> have

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
working wonderful now stock bikes have

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.760 
working wonderful now stock bikes have
really<00:00:05.339> big<00:00:05.490> rear<00:00:05.790> sprockets<00:00:06.390> now<00:00:07.080> some<00:00:07.740> of

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
really big rear sprockets now some of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.980 
really big rear sprockets now some of
you<00:00:08.010> may<00:00:08.190> know<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.550> reason<00:00:08.940> for<00:00:09.060> that<00:00:09.150> it's

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
you may know the reason for that it's

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.750 
you may know the reason for that it's
because<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.650> allows<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.160> engine<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.460> rev<00:00:11.730> up

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
because it allows the engine to rev up

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.450 
because it allows the engine to rev up
more<00:00:12.120> quickly<00:00:12.350> but<00:00:13.350> it<00:00:13.440> also<00:00:13.590> decreases<00:00:14.430> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
more quickly but it also decreases the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.359 
more quickly but it also decreases the
top-end<00:00:14.970> so<00:00:15.390> you<00:00:15.480> get<00:00:15.630> more<00:00:15.840> acceleration<00:00:16.710> but

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
top-end so you get more acceleration but

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.489 
top-end so you get more acceleration but
you<00:00:17.519> compromise<00:00:18.419> on<00:00:18.630> your<00:00:18.660> top-end<00:00:19.080> which<00:00:19.320> you

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:19.499 
you compromise on your top-end which you

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.029 
you compromise on your top-end which you
shouldn't<00:00:19.769> need<00:00:20.009> on<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.249> stomp<00:00:20.550> bag<00:00:21.410> now<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
shouldn't need on a stomp bag now the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.970 
shouldn't need on a stomp bag now the
reason<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.759> is<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.589> you<00:00:25.589> can<00:00:25.800> work

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
reason for that is because you can work

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.460 
reason for that is because you can work
it<00:00:26.189> out<00:00:26.310> from<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.669> gear<00:00:26.820> ratio<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.320> my

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
it out from the gear ratio so in my

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.319 
it out from the gear ratio so in my
other<00:00:28.619> video<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.009> may<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.460> seen<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.119> we

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
other video you may have seen that we

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.570 
other video you may have seen that we
calculated<00:00:30.839> the<00:00:31.019> gear<00:00:31.199> ratio<00:00:31.619> using<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
calculated the gear ratio using all the

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.240 
calculated the gear ratio using all the
things<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.720> had<00:00:33.810> the<00:00:33.930> crankshaft<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.920> into

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
things so we had the crankshaft go into

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.540 
things so we had the crankshaft go into
the<00:00:35.520> clutch<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.990> 1<00:00:37.230> gear<00:00:37.440> ratio<00:00:37.550> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the clutch which was 1 gear ratio the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
the clutch which was 1 gear ratio the
input<00:00:38.880> shaft<00:00:39.150> to<00:00:39.330> the<00:00:39.420> output<00:00:39.450> shaft<00:00:39.960> was<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
input shaft to the output shaft was the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.070 
input shaft to the output shaft was the
next<00:00:40.470> gear<00:00:40.680> ratio<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:42.000> front<00:00:42.450> sprocket<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
next gear ratio the front sprocket to

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.510 
next gear ratio the front sprocket to
the<00:00:43.170> rear<00:00:43.350> sprocket<00:00:43.860> was<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> next<00:00:44.310> gear

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the rear sprocket was the next gear

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.980 
the rear sprocket was the next gear
ratio<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.180> multiply<00:00:45.360> them<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:45.810> together

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
ratio and we multiply them all together

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.220 
ratio and we multiply them all together
to<00:00:46.470> get<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> overall<00:00:46.950> gear<00:00:47.250> ratio<00:00:47.990> now<00:00:48.990> if<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
to get the overall gear ratio now if the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.010 
to get the overall gear ratio now if the
crank<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.740> spinning<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> certain<00:00:50.610> rpm<00:00:51.020> let's

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
crank is spinning at a certain rpm let's

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
crank is spinning at a certain rpm let's
say<00:00:52.200> 5,000<00:00:52.890> rpm<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:54.330> rear<00:00:54.960> sprocket<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.860> going

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
say 5,000 rpm the rear sprocket is going

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.470 
say 5,000 rpm the rear sprocket is going
to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.030> spinning<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.660> lot<00:00:57.930> slower<00:00:58.700> if<00:00:59.700> it's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to be spinning a lot slower if it's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.170 
to be spinning a lot slower if it's
bigger<00:01:01.220> whereas<00:01:02.220> if<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.640> small<00:01:02.940> rear

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
bigger whereas if it's a small rear

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
bigger whereas if it's a small rear
sprocket<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:03.990> to<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.170> spinning<00:01:04.559> much

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
sprocket it's going to be spinning much

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.700 
sprocket it's going to be spinning much
closer<00:01:05.219> well<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.149> much<00:01:06.359> closer<00:01:06.719> but<00:01:07.049> closer

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
closer well not much closer but closer

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.639 
closer well not much closer but closer
to<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> RPM<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.969> the<00:01:09.030> crank<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.350> means

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
to the RPM of the crank so that means

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.029 
to the RPM of the crank so that means
that<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:12.119> much<00:01:12.420> easier<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.079> the<00:01:13.710> crankshaft

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
that it's much easier for the crankshaft

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.660 
that it's much easier for the crankshaft
to<00:01:14.249> turn<00:01:14.579> very<00:01:15.149> quickly<00:01:16.340> because<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> only

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to turn very quickly because it only

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.050 
to turn very quickly because it only
moves<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.630> rear<00:01:18.810> wheel<00:01:19.109> a<00:01:19.409> small<00:01:19.920> amount<00:01:20.219> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
moves the rear wheel a small amount so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.520 
moves the rear wheel a small amount so
that<00:01:21.210> means<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.569> the<00:01:21.659> engine<00:01:21.960> revs<00:01:22.109> up<00:01:22.350> more

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
that means that the engine revs up more

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.760 
that means that the engine revs up more
quickly<00:01:22.740> however<00:01:23.659> when<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.140> doing

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
quickly however when this is doing

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.760 
quickly however when this is doing
12,000<00:01:26.520> rpm<00:01:26.700> let's<00:01:27.630> say<00:01:27.780> that's<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.259> redline

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
12,000 rpm let's say that's the redline

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.129 
12,000 rpm let's say that's the redline
of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.100> vehicle<00:01:29.549> 12,000<00:01:30.299> rpm<00:01:31.729> if<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.899> rear

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:34.139 
of the vehicle 12,000 rpm if the rear

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:38.029 
of the vehicle 12,000 rpm if the rear
sprocket<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.859> small<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.600> speed<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
sprocket is small then that speed of the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.629 
sprocket is small then that speed of the
the<00:01:38.340> rpm<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.359> rear<00:01:39.509> wheel<00:01:39.719> will<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.069> lot

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:41.639 
the rpm of the rear wheel will be a lot

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.599 
the rpm of the rear wheel will be a lot
higher<00:01:42.679> whereas<00:01:43.679> if<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.069> big<00:01:44.340> wrist

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
higher whereas if you have a big wrist

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.499 
higher whereas if you have a big wrist
bracket<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.990> RPM<00:01:46.380> will<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:47.159> further<00:01:47.759> from

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
bracket on the RPM will be further from

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.870 
bracket on the RPM will be further from
the<00:01:48.899> sprockets<00:01:49.469> rpm<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.459> sprockets

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the sprockets rpm now the sprockets

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.819 
the sprockets rpm now the sprockets
going<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.270> very<00:01:51.539> fast<00:01:51.749> so<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.649> rear

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
going very very fast so the rear

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.349 
going very very fast so the rear
sprocket<00:01:53.219> will<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.429> going<00:01:53.549> very<00:01:53.639> very<00:01:54.060> slowly

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
sprocket will be going very very slowly

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.120 
sprocket will be going very very slowly
as<00:01:54.749> opposed<00:01:55.109> to<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.409> small<00:01:55.679> sprocket

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
as opposed to with a small sprocket

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.149 
as opposed to with a small sprocket
going<00:01:56.999> faster<00:01:57.569> so<00:01:58.109> the<00:01:58.289> top-end<00:01:58.529> will<00:01:58.979> be

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
going faster so the top-end will be

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459 
going faster so the top-end will be
smaller<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> reason<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.959> top-end<00:02:01.289> will

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
smaller but the reason the top-end will

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.830 
smaller but the reason the top-end will
be<00:02:01.560> smaller<00:02:01.859> is<00:02:02.159> because<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> RPM<00:02:03.270> limit<00:02:03.689> of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
be smaller is because the RPM limit of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.739 
be smaller is because the RPM limit of
the<00:02:04.289> crank<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:05.279> at<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.579> certain<00:02:05.789> point<00:02:06.209> so

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
the crank is at a certain point so

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:08.719 
the crank is at a certain point so
12,000<00:02:07.529> rpm<00:02:07.679> let's<00:02:08.129> say<00:02:08.280> that's<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
12,000 rpm let's say that's it in the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.500 
12,000 rpm let's say that's it in the
rev<00:02:08.970> limiter<00:02:09.799> that<00:02:10.799> can't<00:02:11.129> go<00:02:11.340> any<00:02:11.489> faster<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
rev limiter that can't go any faster the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.490 
rev limiter that can't go any faster the
reason<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.900> can't<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.170> any<00:02:13.319> further

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
reason it can't go any further

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
reason it can't go any further
because<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> Rev<00:02:14.310> runner<00:02:14.700> if<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.450> rev

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
because the Rev runner if your rev

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.650 
because the Rev runner if your rev
limiter<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.530> higher<00:02:17.210> even<00:02:18.210> though<00:02:18.510> you've<00:02:18.630> got

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
limiter is higher even though you've got

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.260 
limiter is higher even though you've got
a<00:02:18.810> rear<00:02:19.050> sprocket<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:19.740> massive<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.970> will

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
a rear sprocket that's massive you will

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.320 
a rear sprocket that's massive you will
have<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> higher<00:02:21.720> top<00:02:22.020> end<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.790> basically

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
have a higher top end so that basically

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.850 
have a higher top end so that basically
is<00:02:24.900> why<00:02:25.460> stum<00:02:26.460> bikes<00:02:26.700> accelerate<00:02:27.660> quicker<00:02:27.960> rev

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
is why stum bikes accelerate quicker rev

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.100 
is why stum bikes accelerate quicker rev
up<00:02:28.890> quicker<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> lower<00:02:30.300> top-end<00:02:30.780> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
up quicker but have a lower top-end and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.410 
up quicker but have a lower top-end and
if<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.410> want<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.770> increase<00:02:32.100> your<00:02:32.160> top-end<00:02:32.670> get

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
if you want to increase your top-end get

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.440 
if you want to increase your top-end get
a<00:02:33.450> smaller<00:02:33.780> race<00:02:34.050> bracket<00:02:34.530> or<00:02:35.070> as<00:02:35.550> we'll<00:02:36.240> know

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
a smaller race bracket or as we'll know

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.900 
a smaller race bracket or as we'll know
from<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> gear<00:02:37.080> ratio<00:02:37.470> video<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:38.550> can<00:02:38.760> also

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
from the gear ratio video you can also

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.330 
from the gear ratio video you can also
do<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> other<00:02:39.540> way<00:02:39.840> around<00:02:39.900> by<00:02:40.740> leaving

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
do it the other way around by leaving

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.000 
do it the other way around by leaving
the<00:02:41.430> rear<00:02:41.580> sprocket<00:02:41.970> as<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:43.010> changing

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
the rear sprocket as it is and changing

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.290 
the rear sprocket as it is and changing
the<00:02:44.100> size<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.490> front<00:02:44.640> sprocket<00:02:44.820> now

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
the size of the front sprocket now

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.880 
the size of the front sprocket now
obviously<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.320> being<00:02:46.500> driven<00:02:46.709> over

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
obviously but it being driven over

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.979 
obviously but it being driven over
driver<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.520> would<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> opposite<00:02:48.510> with

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
driver you would do the opposite with

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.140 
driver you would do the opposite with
the<00:02:49.110> front<00:02:49.350> sprocket<00:02:49.560> making<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.580> bigger<00:02:50.910> rear

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
the front sprocket making a bigger rear

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.990 
the front sprocket making a bigger rear
sprocket<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.690> bigger<00:02:51.989> front<00:02:52.290> sprocket<00:02:52.530> for

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
sprocket a bigger front sprocket for

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.199 
sprocket a bigger front sprocket for
top-end

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
top-end

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.479 
top-end
and<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.480> smaller<00:02:54.930> front<00:02:55.260> sprocket<00:02:55.530> for

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
and a smaller front sprocket for
