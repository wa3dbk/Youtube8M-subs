00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.660
 What color is this dress 揪 respect (盛竹如口(́◉◞౪◟◉‵) ) 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.460
 Black and blue 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.300
 Still platinum? 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.260
 Or maybe all colors are mixed together 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.960
 Not only scientists try to explain it scientifically 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.820
 Many people also try to sum up their own theory. 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.660
 What is the correct answer for BUT? 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.340
 This is really a mystery 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.500

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.640
 Hello everyone, welcome to watch the fun. 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.040
 Today we are going to uncover a recent hot puzzle: 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.200
 "What color is this dress?" 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.220
 before this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.820
 Let’s start with a simple warm-up for the head. 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.700
 We invited a volunteer. His name is Ryan. 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.380
 And he is going to participate in this episode 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.720
 ★★★ 欢乐痣多腥★★★ 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.600
 This is the first test 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.640
 Do you understand what I am talking about? Ryan? 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.720
 In fact, we have already introduced it a little earlier. 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.380
 This is the second time that the title of the show is played. 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.360
 Oh... I am ah. 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.040
 I mean... it happened, right? 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.220
 You introduce yourself again. 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.620
 Do you understand? Ryan is here. 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.040
 But in fact, his head is not ready to answer such a difficult question. 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.580
 for example: 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.740
 "What color is this dress?" 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.920
 So the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 Please join us in this world where the brain is activated: 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.440

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.160
 Look? 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.340
 If you just thought that the title of the show will appear again 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.840
 Then you are very wrong. 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.020

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.780
 Welcome to our first quiz

 ★ mathematics little prodigy ★ 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.460
 Please do it at home together. 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.600
 I will put my hand on the back than the number 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 But before we know what the number is 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260
 In front of the TV, please pick a number in your head. 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.100
 do you understand? 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.680
 Great! (๑•̀ω•́)ノ

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920
 Now add the original number to five 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.600
 No matter what your total number is now 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.900
 Buckle it off

 what's next, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.820
 Plus two 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.300
 Now subtract the number you thought of at the beginning 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.660
 And the number you think in your mind right now is the number I am comparing behind. 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.720
 Yes, there is nothing wrong with it. 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.380

 ★ can't help ★ (Note 2) 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.760
 Have Ryan come to solve the problem for us (Ryan腼腆 waved (๑ ́ᄇ`๑)) 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 I hope that you will also think together in front of the TV. 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.400
 Ok, Ryan. 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.160
 Assumption: two trains are on the same rail 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.500
 The two cars are driving in the opposite direction 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 Train A travels at 50 meters per hour. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.840
 Train B advances at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour. 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.120
 The train is traveling without resistance 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.660
 And the two trains depart at the same time 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.180
 Question: What happens to passengers on train A? 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.980
 The answer is (A): 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.920
 All of the above 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.660
 (B): 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.300
 Help! 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.800
 (C): 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.660
 Not ───(the tail is elongated) 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.460
 Or (D): 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.280
 Be careful!!! 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.480
 Um... I think... 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.380
 I guess it is 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.020
 (C)? 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.580
 Very close! 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.220
 The correct answer is: 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.160
 (B) (C) (D) 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.600
 If we are talking about train B, 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.960
 This answer may be correct. 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.200
 Because B is set to: "Advance at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour." 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200
 But the question to ask is train A: 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.580
 "Traveling at 50 meters per hour" 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.880
 Means that the majority of passengers in the car are Americans (Note 3) 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.940
 And what other non-American passengers say 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.700
 Are garbled (that is, I don't understand it) 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.780
 But even that 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.160
 The answer can't be seen is (A) All of the above! 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.500
 And other options have no reason to follow. 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 and so... 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.600
 You are wrong again! 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.440
 The answer is indeed: (A) all of the above 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.140
 You have to jump out of the frame to think 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.660
 What framework? 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.260
 The correct answer you look at is actually: 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.720
 (E) Who cares 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.480
 (F) This question is stupid 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.640
 (G) This question can no longer be asked because if it does not stop... 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.720
 Or (H) 2 TRAINZ!!!!! 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.640
 I just can't see the above options at all, it's not fair, right? 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.160
 You must also see the entire photo Ryan 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.440

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.260
 ★ "See" tricks ★ 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.720
 What we are going to do is just a simple test 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.980
 The only thing you need to do is tell me. 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.400
 "What did you see on the screen?" 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.140
 Ryan? 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.000
 Hmm... Letter A? 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.500
 Wrong answer! 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.900
 The correct answer is: 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.920
 red 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.220
 Oh, I thought you asked... 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.940
 Next question (directly interrupt www) 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.320
 What do you see on the screen now? 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.740
 Do you see blue? 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.240
 some! 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.200
 You made a mistake! 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.580
 The correct answer is: 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.420
 Letter A 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.720
 But you yourself ask me clearly... 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.540
 Next question! 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.040
 ( ́・_・`) 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.180
 What do you see on the screen now? 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.360
 Ok, what I see is the gray letter A. 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.800
 Does twilight mean this "gray" or this "glow"? 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.460
 Is this bad? 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.960
 Actually not bad (then you ask fart w) 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.720
 Ok... then I guess it should be "grey"! 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.220
 Big mistake! 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.480
 The answer we want... 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.560
 Ok, that is the "glow" color!!! 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.320
 Still wrong! 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.820
 Shrimp destroyed?! 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.360
 The answer we really want is: 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.520
 Bright black letter A 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.920
 The long-horned guinea pig knows that there is a bright black color. 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.320
 However, if we dim the gray (turn back to gray www) 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.500
 Turn it into black 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.140
 What do you see on the screen now? 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.560
 Ok, you said that the color is black! - That's right - 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.520
 Does the photo have any physical changes? 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.240
 Yes, there is nothing wrong! 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.720
 In this case, the answer must be: black letter A 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.320
 Ryan, 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.460
 Your answer is really the most in the country. 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.960
 Outrageous mistakes! 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.560
 Shrimp?!??! 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.060
 The correct answer is: an unfinished picture of the Pac-Man (Note 4) rotated by 90 degrees, and he is eating tic tac (Mint Sugar Brand) 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.560
 (completely helpless + angry) 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.020
 Let's go through the last question! 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.560
 Heavenly public! 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.560
 Which letter do you see on the screen now? 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.880
 The question is "letter"? -Yes - 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.600
 Is it completely colorless? - It is true - 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.480
 Isn't that stupid answer like "unfinished Pac-Man pictures"? 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.180
 The question is straightforward when it is asking the letters? -Yes - 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.440
 Ok, I can get it! 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.880
 The answer must be... 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.820
 Letter A 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.320
 Wrong home! 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.960
 Go to your grandmother's Wang Tsai little girl 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.160
 The correct answer to this question is: 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.020
 Extremely narrowed close-up letter B 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.020
 OK, but that B is really made up of A. 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.780
 So technically, my answer is correct this time? 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.620
 You made a mistake! 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.680
 This B is not made up of A 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.960
 Hey? What is it made up of? 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.280
 Unfinished Pac-Man pictures: D 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.900
 You killed this day... 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.340
 ★★★ 欢乐痣多腥★★★ 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.860
 Ok, now your head is already active. 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.340
 Let us look at the topic again: 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.060
 "What color is this dress?" 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.580
 Since your head is ready 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.180
 You can finally consider the comprehensive possibilities of the whole picture. 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.620
 Let us now extend from the original problem 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.380
 "Is this really a dress?" 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.860
 People presume that it is a dress 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.280
 But if you use the method I teach you in the show to see the whole picture 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.060
 You will see that this dress is actually... 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.820
 shirt! 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.500
 It is a shirt! 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.640
 I still can't understand why you have to do a bunch of bird tests that no one knows the answer. 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.800
 Everyone has been discussing the color of this dress since these days. 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.420
 When you see this whole photo 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.440
 The only correct answer to this problem is that it is a shirt. 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.260
 You provoke 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.020
 what? 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.000
 The correct answer is actually: (A) 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.280
 Are you serious? 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.040
 You let me and the audience experience it all. 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.800
 As a result, you still don't plan to give us a real answer? 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.740
 The answer I have is (A) 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.040
 This does not make sense! 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.740
 Does A have a relationship with the color of this dress? 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.820
 Not A but the answer (A) 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.620
 Do you want to see the whole photo at the same time? 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.320
 "You have to jump off the frame to think" 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.180
 "The correct answer is actually (A)" 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.140
 "In fact (A)" (Echo*3) 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.180

 "This question is stupid!" 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.120
 "This question can't be continued any more because if it doesn't stop..." 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.100
 "If it doesn't stop..." Then what? 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.260
