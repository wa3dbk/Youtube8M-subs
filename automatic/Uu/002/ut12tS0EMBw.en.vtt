00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
hey youtube my first video I showed you

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.759 
hey youtube my first video I showed you
how<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.540> disassemble<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:08.630> ninja<00:00:09.630> 500<00:00:10.349> petcock

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
how to disassemble a ninja 500 petcock

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.289 
how to disassemble a ninja 500 petcock
one<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> things<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.370> alluded<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> you

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
one of the things that I alluded to you

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.599 
one of the things that I alluded to you
in<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> video<00:00:15.719> information<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
in the video information was that the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.230 
in the video information was that the
500<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.260> ninja<00:00:22.260> 250<00:00:23.029> were<00:00:24.029> not

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
500 and the ninja 250 were not

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.689 
500 and the ninja 250 were not
interchangeable<00:00:25.849> this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> because<00:00:28.699> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
interchangeable this is because the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.510 
interchangeable this is because the
flange<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> side<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.869> tank<00:00:31.520> comes

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
flange on the side of the tank comes

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.400 
flange on the side of the tank comes
down<00:00:33.050> much<00:00:34.050> farther<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.579> ninja<00:00:35.880> 250

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.610 

whereas<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.160> ninja<00:00:41.460> 500<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.410> one

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
whereas with the ninja 500 you have one

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.340 
whereas with the ninja 500 you have one
of<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> frame<00:00:44.100> backbones<00:00:45.140> running<00:00:46.140> right

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
of the frame backbones running right

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.840 
of the frame backbones running right
underneath<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:48.510> switch<00:00:50.270> both<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.480> these

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
underneath this switch both of these

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
underneath this switch both of these
have<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> flat<00:00:54.239> area<00:00:55.520> with<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> rubber<00:00:56.910> seal<00:00:57.390> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
have a flat area with a rubber seal that

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 
have a flat area with a rubber seal that
bolts<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> bottom<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> tank<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
bolts up to the bottom of the tank and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.210 
bolts up to the bottom of the tank and
seals<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> bottom<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> tank<00:01:04.220> the

seals to the bottom of the tank the
ninja<00:01:05.549> 250<00:01:08.630> operates<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.900> same<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.590> but

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
ninja 250 operates in the same way but

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.850 
ninja 250 operates in the same way but
because<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:12.060> frame<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> single<00:01:13.290> backbone

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
because the frame has a single backbone

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.940 
because the frame has a single backbone
and<00:01:14.360> because<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.479> has<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> deeper<00:01:16.259> flange<00:01:16.619> on

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and because it has a deeper flange on

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.230 
and because it has a deeper flange on
the<00:01:17.100> side<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.610> tank<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:19.140> switch<00:01:20.240> sits

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the side of the tank the switch sits

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
the side of the tank the switch sits
down<00:01:21.540> farther<00:01:23.150> from<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.390> tank<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.189> can't

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
down farther from the tank so you can't

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.190 
down farther from the tank so you can't
interchange<00:01:27.450> these<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> 250<00:01:30.960> in

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
interchange these two and then to 250 in

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.749 
interchange these two and then to 250 in
a<00:01:31.740> 500<00:01:32.460> tank<00:01:33.500> hits<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.770> backbone<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
a 500 tank hits the backbone on the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.980 
a 500 tank hits the backbone on the
frame<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.900> ninja<00:01:40.259> 500<00:01:41.070> won't<00:01:41.970> even<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
frame the ninja 500 won't even up to the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.190 
frame the ninja 500 won't even up to the
tank<00:01:43.520> because<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> flange<00:01:45.000> comes<00:01:45.450> down<00:01:45.780> right

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
tank because the flange comes down right

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.610 
tank because the flange comes down right
