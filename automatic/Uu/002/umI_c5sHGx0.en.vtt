00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
like this I like to just go back and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.270 
like this I like to just go back and
forth<00:01:13.350> between<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.740> two<00:01:13.890> until<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
gradation is pretty pretty smooth so for

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
gradation is pretty pretty smooth so for
this<00:01:17.220> step<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.790> using<00:01:18.030> odd

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
this step I'm going to be using odd

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.149 
this step I'm going to be using odd
fellow<00:01:18.420> using<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> brush<00:01:19.500> kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.040> an

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
out where the line is going to go and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.810 
out where the line is going to go and
then<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> same<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.130> top<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> because

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
then do the same for the top and because

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.370 
then do the same for the top and because
I<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:30.180> want<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> green<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> main

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
stupid autocorrect actually is a very

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
stupid autocorrect actually is a very
complimenting<00:01:57.060> color<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.570> wouldn't

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
complimenting color and you wouldn't

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
complimenting color and you wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.369> really

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
necessarily think that like this really

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.090 
necessarily think that like this really
rosy<00:02:00.479> rusty<00:02:01.200> color<00:02:01.409> would<00:02:01.619> complement<00:02:02.040> a

rosy rusty color would complement a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100 
rosy rusty color would complement a
green<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.549> actually<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> looks

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
green but it actually I think it looks

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
the tattoo liner unlike the other look I

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.129

think<00:04:52.000> for<00:04:52.150> this<00:04:52.240> one<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.720> would<00:04:52.840> be<00:04:52.870> safe<00:04:53.110> to

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
think for this one it would be safe to

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.659 
think for this one it would be safe to
go<00:04:53.380> a<00:04:53.409> little<00:04:53.830> bit<00:04:54.039> more<00:04:54.190> dramatic<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.639> a

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
go a little bit more dramatic and a

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.439 
go a little bit more dramatic and a
little<00:04:54.880> more<00:04:55.270> thick<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:58.120> then<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.360> course

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
little more thick and then of course

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.370 
little more thick and then of course
you've<00:04:58.840> got<00:04:58.870> mascara<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.620> go

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.420 

personally<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.470> like<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.650> add<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.890> little<00:05:05.100> bit<00:05:05.310> of
