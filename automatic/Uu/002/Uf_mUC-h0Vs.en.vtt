so in the meantime now let's go to

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.710 
so in the meantime now let's go to
waypoints<00:07:02.950> looking<00:07:03.370> out<00:07:03.460> teleport<00:07:04.030> 2<00:07:04.240> and

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
waypoints looking out teleport 2 and

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.940 
waypoints looking out teleport 2 and
we're<00:07:04.930> going<00:07:05.050> to<00:07:05.080> build<00:07:05.229> up<00:07:05.410> some<00:07:05.560> training

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
points in the hyperbolic time chamber

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.260 
points in the hyperbolic time chamber
and<00:07:07.870> see<00:07:08.590> if<00:07:08.860> we<00:07:09.220> actually<00:07:09.400> can<00:07:09.820> still<00:07:10.180> do<00:07:10.360> that

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
and see if we actually can still do that

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:20.310 
and see if we actually can still do that
