00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.560
 grain and we are going to bring here from approx a 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.700
 mechanical to have brought him a little bit 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.639

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.110
 out there getting ready and well here what 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.950
 you are pretty handsome the truth 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.460

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.920
 in control 1 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.430
 castro

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.560
