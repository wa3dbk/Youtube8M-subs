into the little bunkers lair is what

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.260 
into the little bunkers lair is what
I'll<00:01:17.860> call<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.220> it's<00:01:18.400> just<00:01:18.550> called<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.820> bunker

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
I'll call it it's just called the bunker

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.580 
I'll call it it's just called the bunker
but<00:01:19.660> once<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:19.930> get<00:01:20.020> in<00:01:20.140> there<00:01:20.290> you<00:01:20.440> can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
but once you get in there you can

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.440 
but once you get in there you can
actually<00:01:20.620> save<00:01:21.280> an<00:01:21.430> exit<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:21.910> start<00:01:22.300> there

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
actually save an exit and start there

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.390 
actually save an exit and start there
each<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.780> every<00:01:22.930> time<00:01:23.140> therefore<00:01:23.770> not<00:01:24.130> having

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
each and every time therefore not having

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.620 
each and every time therefore not having
to<00:01:24.460> walk<00:01:24.670> all<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.000> way<00:01:25.090> through<00:01:25.330> here<00:01:25.480> through

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
to walk all the way through here through

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.750 
to walk all the way through here through
thousand<00:01:26.110> cuts<00:01:26.230> every<00:01:26.650> time<00:01:26.890> now<00:01:27.460> right<00:01:27.640> here

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
thousand cuts every time now right here

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.520 
thousand cuts every time now right here
I<00:01:27.820> did<00:01:28.090> speed<00:01:28.330> up<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.570> path<00:01:28.750> just<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.140> kind<00:01:29.350> of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
I did speed up the path just to kind of

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.620 
I did speed up the path just to kind of
clarify<00:01:30.460> for<00:01:30.520> those<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.030> might<00:01:31.120> be<00:01:31.240> confused

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
clarify for those that might be confused

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.180 
clarify for those that might be confused
on<00:01:31.750> how<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.870> get<00:01:32.050> there<00:01:32.290> but<00:01:32.710> there<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.040> can

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
on how to get there but there you can

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.620 
on how to get there but there you can
see<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.490> bunker<00:01:33.760> door<00:01:33.909> across<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.240> bridge

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
see the bunker door across the bridge

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.810 
see the bunker door across the bridge
once<00:01:35.290> you<00:01:35.409> do<00:01:35.680> go<00:01:35.860> through<00:01:36.070> this<00:01:36.190> door<00:01:36.430> like<00:01:36.670> I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
once you do go through this door like I

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.130 
once you do go through this door like I
was<00:01:36.970> saying<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.300> will<00:01:37.480> not<00:01:37.659> need<00:01:37.870> to<00:01:38.020> go

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
was saying you will not need to go

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.170 
was saying you will not need to go
through<00:01:38.380> thousand<00:01:38.950> cuts<00:01:39.070> again<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.940> only

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
through thousand cuts again the only

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.700 
through thousand cuts again the only
reason<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.510> have<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.690> do<00:01:40.870> this<00:01:41.050> now<00:01:41.380> is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
reason you have to do this now is

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.280 
reason you have to do this now is
because<00:01:42.159> it's<00:01:42.340> not<00:01:42.400> in<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.790> fast<00:01:43.030> travel<00:01:43.450> so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
because it's not in a fast travel so

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.660 
because it's not in a fast travel so
yeah<00:01:44.470> we're<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:44.800> here<00:01:44.979> now<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:45.130> don't<00:01:45.460> have<00:01:45.550> to

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
yeah we're in here now you don't have to

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.040 
yeah we're in here now you don't have to
do<00:01:45.790> it<00:01:45.909> you<00:01:46.030> can<00:01:46.180> see<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.510> did<00:01:46.630> change<00:01:46.870> to<00:01:47.020> a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
do it you can see it did change to a

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.690 
do it you can see it did change to a
co-op<00:01:47.409> game<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.100> want<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.370> explain<00:01:48.670> a

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
co-op game and I want to explain a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.890 
co-op game and I want to explain a
little<00:01:48.970> bit<00:01:49.150> about<00:01:49.360> what<00:01:49.600> we<00:01:49.720> were<00:01:49.870> doing

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
little bit about what we were doing

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.070 
little bit about what we were doing
instead<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.650> saving<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.310> exiting<00:01:51.880> if<00:01:52.870> you've

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
instead of saving and exiting if you've

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.930 
instead of saving and exiting if you've
formed<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:53.560> all<00:01:53.680> in<00:01:53.920> Borderlands<00:01:54.520> 2<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:54.700> you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
know if you try to do it for players

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.899 
know if you try to do it for players
especially<00:01:56.620> with<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.159> warrior<00:01:57.490> or<00:01:57.610> something

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
especially with the warrior or something

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.570 
especially with the warrior or something
like<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.450> becomes<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.260> pain<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.770> you<00:02:00.490> know

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
like that it becomes a pain to you know

save<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.090> exit<00:02:01.330> every<00:02:01.510> time<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:01.840> have

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
save and exit every time and have

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.930 
save and exit every time and have
everybody<00:02:02.350> join<00:02:02.590> off<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.460> can<00:02:03.670> notice

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
everybody join off of you you can notice

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.370 
everybody join off of you you can notice
the<00:02:04.090> guns<00:02:04.299> there<00:02:04.540> on<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.810> ground<00:02:05.049> what<00:02:05.290> we

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the guns there on the ground what we

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.810 
the guns there on the ground what we
were<00:02:05.530> doing<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:05.979> actually<00:02:06.370> killing<00:02:06.549> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
were doing is actually killing the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.330 
were doing is actually killing the
bunker<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.360> then<00:02:07.870> leaving<00:02:08.170> back<00:02:08.470> mm<00:02:09.039> cuts<00:02:09.190> and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
bunker and then leaving back mm cuts and

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.040 
bunker and then leaving back mm cuts and
coming<00:02:09.550> back<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.940> doing<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.600> would<00:02:10.810> allow

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
coming back in doing this would allow

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.930 
coming back in doing this would allow
the<00:02:11.110> bunker<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.650> respawn<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.370> there's<00:02:12.790> two

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
the bunker to respawn and there's two

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.710 
the bunker to respawn and there's two
reasons<00:02:12.970> why

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
reasons why

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.390 
reasons why
we<00:02:13.810> were<00:02:13.930> doing<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.500> first<00:02:14.770> was<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
we were doing this the first was the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.890 
we were doing this the first was the
obvious<00:02:15.580> we<00:02:16.120> were<00:02:16.150> doing<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.450> because<00:02:16.630> it's<00:02:16.840> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
obvious we were doing it because it's a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.510 
obvious we were doing it because it's a
pain<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.260> have<00:02:17.320> everybody<00:02:17.740> keep<00:02:17.920> joining<00:02:18.190> it's

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
pain to have everybody keep joining it's

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.850 
pain to have everybody keep joining it's
just<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.760> lot<00:02:18.910> easier<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.450> way<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:20.170> second<00:02:20.740> if

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
just a lot easier this way the second if

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.190 
just a lot easier this way the second if
you've<00:02:21.010> ever<00:02:21.160> killed<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.580> bunker<00:02:21.970> he<00:02:22.750> drops<00:02:23.050> a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
you've ever killed the bunker he drops a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.960 
you've ever killed the bunker he drops a
lot<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.530> money<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.070> sometimes<00:02:24.550> when<00:02:24.790> there's

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
lot of money and sometimes when there's

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.940 
lot of money and sometimes when there's
a<00:02:25.030> lot<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.300> money<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.690> kind<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.200> pass<00:02:26.530> up<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
a lot of money you kind of pass up the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.280 
a lot of money you kind of pass up the
legendaries<00:02:27.610> especially<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.750> know<00:02:28.840> we've<00:02:29.170> I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
legendaries especially you know we've I

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.480 
legendaries especially you know we've I
think<00:02:29.380> we've<00:02:29.740> all<00:02:29.920> been<00:02:30.130> there<00:02:30.250> done<00:02:30.460> it

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
think we've all been there done it

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.860 
think we've all been there done it
there'll<00:02:30.730> be<00:02:30.790> money<00:02:31.090> laying<00:02:31.300> next<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.660> health

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
there'll be money laying next to health

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.780 
there'll be money laying next to health
and<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.530> think<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.160> legendary<00:02:33.580> but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
and you think that it's a legendary but

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.160 
and you think that it's a legendary but
it's<00:02:33.910> really<00:02:34.060> not<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.480> especially<00:02:34.780> with<00:02:35.080> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it's really not and especially with the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.660 
it's really not and especially with the
bunker<00:02:35.500> there's<00:02:35.710> these<00:02:35.860> cracks<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.520> floor

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
bunker there's these cracks in the floor

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.790 
bunker there's these cracks in the floor
the<00:02:37.060> guns<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.750> kind<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:38.050> fold<00:02:38.260> down<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.620> there

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
the guns can kind of fold down in there

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.650 
the guns can kind of fold down in there

over<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.990> ground<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:41.830> kind<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.130> hard<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.550> see

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
over the ground it's kind of hard to see

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.570 
over the ground it's kind of hard to see
the<00:02:43.540> legendary<00:02:43.840> orange<00:02:44.500> beam<00:02:44.740> throughout<00:02:45.310> all

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
the legendary orange beam throughout all

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.430 
the legendary orange beam throughout all
the<00:02:45.790> yellow<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.660> we<00:02:46.810> were<00:02:46.900> actually<00:02:47.020> leaving

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the yellow so we were actually leaving

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.080 
the yellow so we were actually leaving
the<00:02:47.680> area<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.010> coming<00:02:48.250> back<00:02:48.400> in<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.940> would

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
the area and coming back in that would

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.820 
the area and coming back in that would
allow<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> bunker<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.750> respawn<00:02:50.140> everybody

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
allow a bunker to respawn everybody

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
wouldn't have to keep rejoining the game

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.090 
wouldn't have to keep rejoining the game
it<00:02:52.660> would<00:02:52.810> also<00:02:52.959> allow<00:02:53.230> all<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.709> money<00:02:53.890> to

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
it would also allow all that money to

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.040 
it would also allow all that money to
disappear<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.820> if<00:02:54.970> by<00:02:55.120> chance<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.570> did<00:02:55.780> drop<00:02:56.020> a

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
disappear so if by chance it did drop a

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.560 
disappear so if by chance it did drop a
legendary<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:57.370> would<00:02:57.520> see<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.330> ground

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
legendary you would see it on the ground

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.449 
legendary you would see it on the ground
a<00:02:58.810> lot<00:02:58.959> easier<00:02:59.380> than<00:02:59.560> having<00:02:59.890> all<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.190> little

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
a lot easier than having all the little

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.280 
a lot easier than having all the little
yellow<00:03:00.610> scattered<00:03:01.240> everywhere<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:02.080> that's

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
yellow scattered everywhere so that's

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.570 
yellow scattered everywhere so that's
just<00:03:02.410> why<00:03:02.590> we<00:03:02.740> were<00:03:02.860> doing<00:03:03.100> that<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.459> guys

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
every time I use it it seems like when

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.089 
every time I use it it seems like when
you<00:04:41.520> aim<00:04:41.729> down<00:04:41.940> sights<00:04:42.409> the<00:04:43.409> first<00:04:43.650> initial

you aim down sights the first initial
shots<00:04:44.370> are<00:04:44.699> really<00:04:44.990> scattered<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.169> does<00:04:46.590> get

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800

accurate<00:04:47.370> really<00:04:47.669> quickly<00:04:48.090> but<00:04:48.599> still<00:04:48.840> aiming

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
accurate really quickly but still aiming

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.409

down<00:04:49.440> sights<00:04:49.830> it's<00:04:50.190> still<00:04:50.550> not<00:04:50.819> as<00:04:51.000> accurate

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
down sights it's still not as accurate

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.939 
down sights it's still not as accurate
as<00:04:51.539> what<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:51.840> seems<00:04:52.080> when<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.379> hipfire<00:04:52.770> it

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
as what it seems when you hipfire it

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.290 
as what it seems when you hipfire it
seems<00:04:53.129> like<00:04:53.280> when<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:53.520> hipfire<00:04:53.849> this<00:04:54.060> beast

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
seems like when you hipfire this beast

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.570 
seems like when you hipfire this beast
it<00:04:54.840> becomes<00:04:55.289> like<00:04:55.710> just<00:04:56.009> super<00:04:56.400> super

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
it becomes like just super super

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210
