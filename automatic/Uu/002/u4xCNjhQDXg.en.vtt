played<00:00:09.120> MOBAs<00:00:09.540> at<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.750> very<00:00:09.990> very<00:00:10.200> high<00:00:10.349> level

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
played MOBAs at a very very high level

played MOBAs at a very very high level
they<00:00:11.280> were<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.900> team<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:13.349> worked<00:00:13.559> with<00:00:13.769> at

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980

e3<00:00:14.630> for<00:00:15.630> Gotham<00:00:15.929> heights<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.740> developed<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
e3 for Gotham heights we developed a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.950 
e3 for Gotham heights we developed a
really<00:00:17.520> good<00:00:17.670> rapport<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.090> them<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.869> we

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
really good rapport with them and we

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.599 
really good rapport with them and we
thought<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.619> would<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.890> really<00:00:20.160> great

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609

trying to figure out what champions feel
too<00:00:46.500> strong<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.950> which<00:00:47.070> Champions<00:00:47.340> might

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
too strong and which Champions might

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.450 
too strong and which Champions might
need<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.300> bit<00:00:48.480> help<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:49.710> didn't<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.129> a

need a little bit help we didn't have a
whole<00:00:50.760> lot<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.910> information<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.750> new

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379

champions<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.579> new<00:00:53.699> maps<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> when<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.170> got

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
champions or the new maps so when we got

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.160 
champions or the new maps so when we got
here<00:00:55.530> we've<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.160> plunged<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.820> know<00:00:57.170> neck

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
here we've just plunged you know neck

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.750 
here we've just plunged you know neck
deep<00:00:58.199> into<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> water<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.309> tried<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
deep into the water and we tried to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.849 
deep into the water and we tried to
learn<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:00.539> these<00:01:00.690> new<00:01:00.840> things<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.469> meanwhile

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
learn all these new things and meanwhile

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.470 
learn all these new things and meanwhile
the<00:01:02.250> developers<00:01:02.730> behind<00:01:02.940> us<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.359> they're

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the developers behind us and they're

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.329 
the developers behind us and they're
telling<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.019> neat<00:01:04.199> tips<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> tricks<00:01:05.129> with

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
telling it's neat tips and tricks with

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.219 
telling it's neat tips and tricks with
all<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> champions<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.780> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.049> have

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
all the champions so we can kind of have

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.550 
all the champions so we can kind of have
a<00:01:07.470> smoother<00:01:08.280> learning<00:01:08.580> curve<00:01:09.409> even<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
a smoother learning curve even in a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.170 
a smoother learning curve even in a
couple<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.950> hours<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.280> complexity<00:01:11.790> has<00:01:11.970> been

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
couple of hours that complexity has been

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.760 
couple of hours that complexity has been
here<00:01:12.420> we've<00:01:12.810> already<00:01:13.020> learned<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.590> about

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
here we've already learned a lot about

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460 
here we've already learned a lot about
how<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.549> game<00:01:14.700> feels<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> start<00:01:15.509> timing

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
how the game feels at the start timing

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.399 
how the game feels at the start timing

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
complexity came in because they've

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.240 
complexity came in because they've
actually<00:01:54.960> been<00:01:55.140> able<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.439> show<00:01:55.829> us<00:01:55.979> all

different things that we know

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.820 
different things that we know
our<00:01:58.210> code<00:01:58.450> about<00:01:58.600> our<00:01:58.690> game<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.080> push<00:01:59.650> those

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
our code about our game and push those

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.020 
our code about our game and push those
up<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.220> next<00:02:00.370> level<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.700> they've<00:02:00.880> also

shown us all the distance we really have
to<00:02:02.560> go<00:02:02.740> in<00:02:03.040> order<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.280> make<00:02:03.460> things<00:02:03.670> as<00:02:03.880> good<00:02:04.270> as
