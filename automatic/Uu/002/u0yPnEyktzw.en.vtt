00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.780
 hello today we are going to prepare a cold soup 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.570
 from tomato to the essence of basil is 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.010
 a very simple dinner or a first course 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.280
 so take note of all the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.280
 ingredients 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.180
 the ingredients are a kilo of tomatoes 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.980
 ripe cut into pieces pepper 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.460
 salt olive oil 2 garlic leaves and 30 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.460
 fresh basil 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.019
 this recipe could be done well with 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.059
 Thermomix blender or a step 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.710
 but as I in this case I do not have 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.640
 in a container we have put the tomato 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.109
 chopped both eyes we're going to add a 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.930
 little pepper to taste one as always 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.970
 good 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.010
 handful of salt 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.010
 and a stream of olive oil 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.549
 until here it would be more or less the basis of 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.350
 salmorejo now what we are going to do 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.799
 different that we are going to add the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.799
 basil 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.060
 but not all of us here have booked 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.530
 you see a little bit of basil for 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.530
 infuse it with a little oil 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.689
 with a hand blender we are going to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.689
 start to beat it 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.530
 here you see how the soup of 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.670
 tomato if you do not like to find anything 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.220
 although good as you see has been 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.780
 pretty soft you can strain it with a 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.270
 Chinese but we in this case what 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.130
 we are going to leave as is, so now 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.220
 the only thing we are going to do is in a 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.240
 Mortar chop the basil with fat salt 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.240
 and olive oil 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.909
 in two individual bowls we have put 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.489
 to the cold tomato soup the oil of 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.769
 basil as you see and before serving for 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.830
 give a different touch we will grate 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.890
 a little tomato sorry a little 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.310
 cheese in each body 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.240
 You can do it with Parmesan cheese or with 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.100
 any cheese that you have at home 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.480
 you do not need any that is going very 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.780
 all right 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.000
 and once we have it that way, we're going 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.760
 to put in the fridge two hours so that 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.280
 be cool and we would have ready 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.709

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.150
