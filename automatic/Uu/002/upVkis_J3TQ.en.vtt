just<00:01:35.780> um<00:01:36.040> Jonathan<00:01:37.040> from<00:01:37.760> part<00:01:38.000> one<00:01:38.180> cuz<00:01:38.960> it

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
just um Jonathan from part one cuz it

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.410 
just um Jonathan from part one cuz it
seems<00:01:39.260> so<00:01:39.560> cuz<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:40.040> mean<00:01:40.190> he's<00:01:40.370> already<00:01:40.610> it

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
seems so cuz I mean he's already it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.060 
seems so cuz I mean he's already it
looks<00:01:41.479> like<00:01:41.720> enough<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.080> do<00:01:42.170> ripple<00:01:42.500> power<00:01:42.710> and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
looks like enough to do ripple power and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.350 
looks like enough to do ripple power and
all<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.310> stuff<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.700> think<00:01:43.940> he<00:01:44.150> did<00:01:44.299> a

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
all that stuff and I think he did a

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.380 
all that stuff and I think he did a
 over<00:01:45.049> dry<00:01:45.260> through<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.799> coca-cola

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
 over dry through the coca-cola

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.570 
 over dry through the coca-cola
so<00:01:47.390> looks<00:01:47.930> like<00:01:48.020> i<00:01:48.350> mean<00:01:48.530> he's<00:01:48.590> younger<00:01:49.190> too<00:01:49.460> it

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
so looks like i mean he's younger too it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.340 
so looks like i mean he's younger too it
seems<00:01:49.760> so<00:01:50.030> it's<00:01:50.210> like<00:01:50.330> they<00:01:50.810> did<00:01:50.960> say<00:01:51.110> he's

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
seems so it's like they did say he's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.020 
seems so it's like they did say he's
been<00:01:51.500> doing<00:01:51.920> this<00:01:52.040> type<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.340> thing<00:01:52.490> since<00:01:52.909> he

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
been doing this type of thing since he

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.000 
been doing this type of thing since he
was<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.210> kid<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:53.690> I'm<00:01:54.110> guessing<00:01:54.380> he's<00:01:54.799> probably

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
was a kid so I'm guessing he's probably

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.420 
was a kid so I'm guessing he's probably
stronger<00:01:55.400> than<00:01:56.000> Jonathan<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.500> if<00:01:58.040> I'm<00:01:58.220> right

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
stronger than Jonathan so if I'm right

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.430 
stronger than Jonathan so if I'm right
about<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:59.030> does<00:01:59.180> mean<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.420> each<00:01:59.840> you

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
about this that does mean that each you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.170 
about this that does mean that each you
know<00:02:00.470> generation<00:02:01.190> gets<00:02:01.520> stronger<00:02:01.909> than<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
know generation gets stronger than the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.390 
know generation gets stronger than the
next<00:02:02.479> one<00:02:02.630> this<00:02:03.320> from<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.590> start<00:02:03.799> that's<00:02:04.280> what

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
next one this from the start that's what

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.770 
next one this from the start that's what
it<00:02:04.430> seems<00:02:04.700> like<00:02:04.760> let<00:02:05.270> me<00:02:05.330> know<00:02:05.420> if<00:02:05.540> I'm<00:02:05.630> right

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
it seems like let me know if I'm right

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.190 
it seems like let me know if I'm right
that<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:07.250> think<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.580> was<00:02:07.670> pretty<00:02:07.820> cool<00:02:08.200> no

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
that and I think I was pretty cool no

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.110 
that and I think I was pretty cool no
Joseph<00:02:09.470> seems<00:02:09.799> like<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.039> badass<00:02:10.250> especially

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
Joseph seems like a badass especially

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.780 
Joseph seems like a badass especially

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
I'm at last ending of the episode when

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.100 
I'm at last ending of the episode when
you<00:02:13.819> had<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.269> Tommy<00:02:14.840> gun<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.170> did<00:02:15.439> not

like that at all I was pretty piece as
well<00:02:18.270> we<00:02:18.960> actually<00:02:19.140> use<00:02:19.380> guns<00:02:19.830> i'm<00:02:20.100> not<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
well we actually use guns i'm not a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.520 
well we actually use guns i'm not a
loner<00:02:20.850> he's<00:02:21.030> gonna<00:02:21.180> use<00:02:21.270> his<00:02:21.450> fat<00:02:21.840> guns<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
loner he's gonna use his fat guns in the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.340 
loner he's gonna use his fat guns in the
fights<00:02:22.940> but<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.150> he<00:02:24.270> does<00:02:24.450> that's<00:02:24.720> cool<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.260> he

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
fights but if he does that's cool and he

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.200 
fights but if he does that's cool and he
also<00:02:25.500> oh<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.400> looks<00:02:26.520> like<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.820> has<00:02:26.910> some<00:02:26.940> type

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
also oh this looks like it has some type

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.690 
also oh this looks like it has some type
of<00:02:27.240> martial<00:02:27.540> arts<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.080> pen<00:02:28.740> style<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.610> like

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
of martial arts that pen style it's like

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.280 
of martial arts that pen style it's like
you<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:29.850> more<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.630> street<00:02:30.990> fighting

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
you just more of like a street fighting

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.520 
you just more of like a street fighting
using<00:02:32.250> guns<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.910> guess<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.600> there's<00:02:34.350> also

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
using guns I guess and there's also

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.710 
using guns I guess and there's also
something<00:02:35.100> i<00:02:35.340> wanted<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> question<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.330> what

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
something i wanted the question is what

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.440 
something i wanted the question is what
is<00:02:36.840> common<00:02:37.740> energy<00:02:37.980> they<00:02:38.700> mentioned<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.300> at

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
is common energy they mentioned this at

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.910 
is common energy they mentioned this at
least<00:02:39.630> two<00:02:39.930> or<00:02:40.080> three<00:02:40.110> times<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> with<00:02:40.800> an

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
least two or three times and with an

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.250 
least two or three times and with an
episode<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.300> ripple<00:02:42.690> power<00:02:42.900> a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
episode and we have ripple power a

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.890 
episode and we have ripple power a
ripple<00:02:43.650> energy<00:02:43.800> but<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.760> hamon<00:02:45.690> energy

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
ripple energy but what is hamon energy

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.699 
ripple energy but what is hamon energy
and<00:02:46.320> what<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.680> his<00:02:46.860> basic<00:02:47.400> um<00:02:47.640> no<00:02:48.570> concept<00:02:49.440> what

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
and what is his basic um no concept what

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.590 
and what is his basic um no concept what
is<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.920> actually<00:02:50.310> about<00:02:50.520> maybe<00:02:51.090> we'll<00:02:51.300> learn

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
is that actually about maybe we'll learn

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.240 
is that actually about maybe we'll learn
a<00:02:51.660> little<00:02:51.990> bit<00:02:52.110> more<00:02:52.350> about<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.770> him<00:02:53.070> and

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
a little bit more about this him and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.830 
a little bit more about this him and
energy<00:02:53.640> later<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.030> next<00:02:54.270> episode<00:02:54.600> most

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
energy later the next episode most

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.290 
energy later the next episode most
likely<00:02:55.230> I'll<00:02:55.739> be<00:02:55.770> mentioning<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.730> against<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
likely I'll be mentioning it against the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.120 
likely I'll be mentioning it against the
most<00:02:57.510> rates<00:02:57.840> mentioned<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.800> did<00:02:58.980> not

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
most rates mentioned and so did not

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.060 
most rates mentioned and so did not
spilling<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.989> we<00:03:01.110> actually<00:03:01.440> see<00:03:01.650> straits

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
spilling and we actually see straits

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.190 
spilling and we actually see straits
once<00:03:02.310> again<00:03:02.610> very<00:03:03.120> old<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.600> creepy<00:03:03.810> booking

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
once again very old and creepy booking

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.300 
once again very old and creepy booking
was<00:03:04.350> still<00:03:04.500> looking<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> beast<00:03:05.190> but

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
was still looking like a beast but

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.810 
was still looking like a beast but
apparently<00:03:06.000> he<00:03:06.630> actually<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:07.410> meijer<00:03:07.980> deal

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
apparently he actually a meijer deal

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.300 
apparently he actually a meijer deal
Brando's<00:03:09.330> nature<00:03:09.720> from<00:03:09.989> part<00:03:10.230> one<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:11.010> he

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
Brando's nature from part one so he

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.430 
Brando's nature from part one so he
takes<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.850> for<00:03:12.000> himself<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.570> use<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.900> mask<00:03:13.170> put
