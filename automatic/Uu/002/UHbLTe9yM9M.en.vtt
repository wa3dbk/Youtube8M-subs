this<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:01.979> lego<00:00:02.610> adding<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.389> subtracting

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
this is a lego adding and subtracting

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.430 
this is a lego adding and subtracting
machine<00:00:04.589> i<00:00:04.770> made<00:00:04.980> that<00:00:05.250> uses<00:00:06.060> gears<00:00:06.509> inside<00:00:06.990> of

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
machine i made that uses gears inside of

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.910 
machine i made that uses gears inside of
it<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:08.429> make<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.000> subtract<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.559> by

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
it to make it and subtract so this by

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.950 
it to make it and subtract so this by
can<00:00:11.340> be<00:00:11.460> pulled<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.000> out<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.389> disengage

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
can be pulled in and out to disengage

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.810 
can be pulled in and out to disengage
from<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> rest<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.830> train<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.400> that's

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
from the rest of the train and that's

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.500 
from the rest of the train and that's
the<00:00:15.080> operating<00:00:16.080> lever<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.760> I'm<00:00:17.880> disengaged

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the operating lever so I'm disengaged

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.910 
the operating lever so I'm disengaged
you<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.900> turn<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.109> without<00:00:19.470> turning<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
you can turn it without turning the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.500 
you can turn it without turning the
others<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> ones<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.210> tens

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
others and this is the ones and the tens

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.580 
others and this is the ones and the tens
and<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.830> way<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.609> works<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.960> ratio<00:00:28.289> of

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and the way it works is the ratio of

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.160 
and the way it works is the ratio of
this<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.599> has<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
this to this is one to one it just has a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.380 
this to this is one to one it just has a
few<00:00:31.500> gears<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.309> between<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:32.969> them<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
few gears in between to get them all to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.049 
few gears in between to get them all to
turn<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> right<00:00:33.930> way<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.399> wanted

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
turn the right way and then I wanted

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.240 
turn the right way and then I wanted
this<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.780> 10

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
this one to that one to be one to be 10

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.790 
this one to that one to be one to be 10
1<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.460> 10<00:00:41.700> or<00:00:41.879> 10<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.329> 1<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.320> when<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.530> turn

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
1 to 10 or 10 to 1 so that when we turn

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.700 
1 to 10 or 10 to 1 so that when we turn
this<00:00:43.980> once<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:45.420> goes<00:00:45.629> around<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> tenth<00:00:46.469> of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
this once that goes around the tenth of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.490 
this once that goes around the tenth of
the<00:00:46.829> time<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.420> turn<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.809> once<00:00:49.140> this

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the time or when you turn this once this

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.860 
the time or when you turn this once this
goes<00:00:49.800> around<00:00:50.010> 10<00:00:50.370> times<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.600> would<00:00:51.690> be

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
goes around 10 times so that it would be

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
goes around 10 times so that it would be
base<00:00:52.050> 10<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.070> can't<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.730> like

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
base 10 and you can't do that with like

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.319 
base 10 and you can't do that with like
Leah<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> had<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.949> 125<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.190> an<00:00:56.309> 82<00:00:56.670> 30<00:00:56.940> 40

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
Leah so I had a 125 with an 82 30 40

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.939 
Leah so I had a 125 with an 82 30 40
tooth<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.320> don't<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.590> how<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.800> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
tooth and then I don't know how I you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.660 
tooth and then I don't know how I you
can<00:00:59.160> see<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.550> but<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> 42,000<00:01:01.070> 822<00:01:02.070> or<00:01:02.190> 16

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
can see it but on the 42,000 822 or 16

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.899 
can see it but on the 42,000 822 or 16
so<00:01:03.000> 125<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.229> 122<00:01:04.799> making<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.119> 10<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
so 125 and then 122 making one to 10 so

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
so 125 and then 122 making one to 10 so
start<00:01:08.909> off<00:01:09.060> by<00:01:09.330> adding<00:01:10.290> some<00:01:10.500> numbers<00:01:10.860> we're

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
start off by adding some numbers we're

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.999 
start off by adding some numbers we're
going<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.460> add<00:01:12.200> set<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:17.180> 43<00:01:18.650> let's<00:01:19.650> say

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
going to add set this to 43 let's say

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.050 
going to add set this to 43 let's say
for<00:01:20.549> intends<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> nones<00:01:22.100> 43<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.340> we're

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
for intends to the nones 43 and we're

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:34.380 
for intends to the nones 43 and we're
going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.450> add<00:01:25.490> 8<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.939> that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.080 

and<00:01:34.960> we<00:01:35.229> see<00:01:35.560> we<00:01:36.400> got<00:01:36.580> an<00:01:36.729> answer<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:38.460> 51<00:01:39.460> which

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
and we see we got an answer of 51 which

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.600 
and we see we got an answer of 51 which
is<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.659> correct<00:01:41.229> answer<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:41.979> now<00:01:42.190> let's<00:01:42.400> say

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
is the correct answer and now let's say

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.790 
is the correct answer and now let's say
we<00:01:42.700> wanted<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.229> subtract<00:01:44.229> five<00:01:44.979> from<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
we wanted to subtract five from that

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.900 
we wanted to subtract five from that
plug<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:48.100> into<00:01:48.640> five<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.930> gauge<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.619> and

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
plug that into five and gauge it and

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:58.020 
plug that into five and gauge it and
then<00:01:53.400> three<00:01:54.400> four<00:01:55.140> five<00:01:56.140> we<00:01:56.979> see<00:01:57.310> when<00:01:57.880> it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
then three four five we see when it

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.660 
then three four five we see when it
turns<00:01:58.270> back<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.810> zero<00:01:59.229> we've<00:01:59.979> got<00:02:00.159> an<00:02:00.250> answer

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
turns back to zero we've got an answer

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.359 
turns back to zero we've got an answer
of<00:02:01.020> 46<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.200> we<00:02:02.320> can<00:02:02.500> reverse<00:02:02.830> that<00:02:03.240> 46<00:02:04.240> plus<00:02:04.509> 5

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
of 46 and we can reverse that 46 plus 5

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.330 
of 46 and we can reverse that 46 plus 5
51<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.840> actually<00:02:08.020> very<00:02:08.289> simple<00:02:08.860> how<00:02:09.190> it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
51 it's actually very simple how it

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.500 
51 it's actually very simple how it
works<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:09.970> gets<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.869> wave<00:02:11.050> took<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.350> number<00:02:11.560> like

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
works so gets a wave took a number like

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.750 
works so gets a wave took a number like
70<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:17.580> 78<00:02:18.580> how<00:02:19.180> about<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:21.310> wanted<00:02:21.700> to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
70 and 78 how about and we wanted to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.170 
70 and 78 how about and we wanted to
disengage<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:23.080> we<00:02:24.010> wanted<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> add<00:02:25.230> 32<00:02:26.230> it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
disengage this we wanted to add 32 it

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:37.110 
disengage this we wanted to add 32 it
set<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.209> 0<00:02:28.860> 1<00:02:29.860> 2<00:02:30.459> 3<00:02:33.840> 2<00:02:34.840> 3<00:02:35.070> c<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.310> can<00:02:36.459> reverse<00:02:36.850> all

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.740 
of your steps 9 and Cary to what one and
that's<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:44.079> it's<00:02:44.380> very<00:02:44.709> simple<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.549> it<00:02:45.970> can

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
that's it it's very simple and it can

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.490 
that's it it's very simple and it can
add<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:47.500> subtract<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.880> my<00:02:49.750> next<00:02:50.140> video

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
add and subtract so and my next video

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.310 
add and subtract so and my next video
will<00:02:50.650> probably<00:02:50.890> be<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.730> similar<00:02:52.510> idea<00:02:52.630> only

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
will probably be a similar idea only

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.210 
will probably be a similar idea only
it'll<00:02:53.950> be<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.510> phase<00:02:55.510> 2<00:02:55.870> or<00:02:56.140> binary<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.100> it

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
it'll be in phase 2 or binary and it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.780 
it'll be in phase 2 or binary and it
will<00:02:57.310> have<00:02:57.519> much<00:02:58.299> more<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:59.290> these<00:02:59.790> counter

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
will have much more of these counter

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.840 
will have much more of these counter
wheels<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:01.690> can<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:02.850> more

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
wheels so that you can have more

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.500 
wheels so that you can have more
position<00:03:04.420> they'll<00:03:04.570> be<00:03:04.750> like<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.200> 2<00:03:05.890> 1<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.549> 2<00:03:06.579> so<00:03:07.239> 4

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
position they'll be like a 2 1 a 2 so 4

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.600 
position they'll be like a 2 1 a 2 so 4
s<00:03:07.720> &amp;<00:03:07.900> eights<00:03:08.140> though<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.769> then<00:03:09.040> will<00:03:09.190> be<00:03:09.220> the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
s &amp; eights though and then will be the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.590 
s &amp; eights though and then will be the
same<00:03:10.000> idea<00:03:10.360> though<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:11.170> that's<00:03:11.350> it
