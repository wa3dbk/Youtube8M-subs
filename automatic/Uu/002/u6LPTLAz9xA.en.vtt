is<00:01:18.340> this<00:01:19.090> grip<00:01:19.479> will<00:01:19.780> give<00:01:20.050> you<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.349> fastest

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
is this grip will give you the fastest

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.870 
is this grip will give you the fastest
speed<00:01:21.340> possible<00:01:21.959> it's<00:01:22.959> somehow<00:01:23.920> because<00:01:24.729> it

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
speed possible it's somehow because it

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.059 
speed possible it's somehow because it
comes<00:01:25.119> from<00:01:25.209> the<00:01:25.420> snare<00:01:25.869> drum<00:01:26.200> so<00:01:26.649> you<00:01:26.709> have

comes from the snare drum so you have

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.479 
comes from the snare drum so you have
the<00:01:27.280> same<00:01:27.550> wrist<00:01:28.030> position<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.979> keep<00:01:29.979> in<00:01:30.190> just

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:30.489 
the same wrist position and keep in just

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:35.370 
the same wrist position and keep in just
this<00:01:30.729> wrist<00:01:31.060> position<00:01:33.539> so<00:01:34.539> is<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.750> very<00:01:35.080> natural

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
this wrist position so is a very natural

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.070 
this wrist position so is a very natural
movement<00:01:36.220> is<00:01:36.369> give<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:36.819> an<00:01:36.970> incredible<00:01:37.360> fast

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
movement is give you an incredible fast

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.410 
movement is give you an incredible fast
speed<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:44.200> even<00:01:44.860> for<00:01:45.099> passage<00:01:45.610> like<00:01:45.910> single

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
speed or even for passage like single

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.800 
speed or even for passage like single
pageant

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:02:01.649 

are<00:01:50.380> those<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.590> speed<00:01:59.590> as<00:01:59.860> fast<00:01:59.920> as<00:02:00.909> your

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
are those so speed as fast as your

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.160 
are those so speed as fast as your
wrists<00:02:02.200> can<00:02:02.470> handle<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:04.210> fifth<00:02:04.509> point<00:02:04.869> for

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
wrists can handle the fifth point for

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.919 
wrists can handle the fifth point for
the<00:02:05.259> grip<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.770> independence<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.450> extended

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
the grip is independence so the extended

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.529 
the grip is independence so the extended
cross<00:02:08.229> grip<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.890> much<00:02:09.369> more<00:02:09.700> independent<00:02:10.509> than

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
cross grip is much more independent than

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.559 
cross grip is much more independent than
the<00:02:10.690> Burton<00:02:11.319> grip<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.160> easier<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.940> open

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
the Burton grip so it's easier to open

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.520 
the Burton grip so it's easier to open
and<00:02:13.720> close<00:02:14.010> intervals<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.540> also<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:17.080> big

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
and close intervals and also a big

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.339 
and close intervals and also a big
misunderstanding<00:02:18.030> some<00:02:19.030> people<00:02:19.420> say<00:02:19.690> with

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
misunderstanding some people say with

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.039 
misunderstanding some people say with
the<00:02:20.470> bottom<00:02:20.890> grip<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.550> cannot<00:02:21.940> play<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.480> larger

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
the bottom grip you cannot play a larger

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.220 
the bottom grip you cannot play a larger
intervals<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.819> here<00:02:25.269> with<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.660> grip<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.200> can

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
intervals so here with this grip I can

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.180 
intervals so here with this grip I can
play<00:02:26.769> easily<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:27.880> larger<00:02:28.390> intervals<00:02:29.190> so

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
play easily with larger intervals so

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.699 
play easily with larger intervals so
that's<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:30.760> important<00:02:31.299> thing<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.870> we<00:02:32.500> will

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
that's the important thing so we will

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.750 
that's the important thing so we will
allow<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.010> more<00:02:33.750> independence<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.019> also

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
allow you more independence and also

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.199 
allow you more independence and also
larger<00:02:36.760> intervals<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.110> left<00:02:38.319> hand<00:02:39.209> the

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
larger intervals in the left hand the

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.020 
larger intervals in the left hand the
sixth<00:02:40.660> point<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.470> hand<00:02:41.709> position<00:02:42.030> since

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
sixth point is the hand position since

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.020 
sixth point is the hand position since
the<00:02:43.180> hand<00:02:43.540> position<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:44.590> maura<00:02:45.160> standing<00:02:45.790> hand

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
the hand position is maura standing hand

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.420 
the hand position is maura standing hand
position<00:02:46.569> if<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.840> see<00:02:47.170> here<00:02:47.410> my<00:02:47.620> hands<00:02:48.010> is

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
position if you see here my hands is

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.809 
position if you see here my hands is
much<00:02:49.000> more<00:02:49.239> standing<00:02:49.959> than<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.230> regular<00:02:50.790> then<00:02:51.790> i

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
much more standing than a regular then i

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.440 
much more standing than a regular then i

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
important thing also with the last few

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.970 
important thing also with the last few
years<00:03:28.359> it<00:03:29.319> seems<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:29.950> everybody<00:03:30.400> started

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
years it seems that everybody started

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.500 
years it seems that everybody started
developing<00:03:32.980> much<00:03:33.340> more<00:03:33.670> than<00:03:33.880> marine<00:03:34.239> band

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
developing much more than marine band

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.500 
developing much more than marine band
people's<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.350> students<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:36.609> really<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.329> play

the<00:03:37.660> marimba<00:03:37.959> but<00:03:38.590> I<00:03:38.620> think<00:03:38.980> an<00:03:39.100> important

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
the marimba but I think an important

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.539 
the marimba but I think an important
thing<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:40.120> while<00:03:40.420> we<00:03:40.780> try<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.620> develop<00:03:42.130> this

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
thing is while we try to develop this

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.240 
thing is while we try to develop this
