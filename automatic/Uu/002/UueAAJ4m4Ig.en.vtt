00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:16.900
 Now tankers on 4 in this video I 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.090
 I'll tell you how I change this 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.849
 texture usual 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.110
 workbench here we see it is normal so 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:29.200
 go to the folder minekravt folder 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.899
 maynkavt while closing the Samhain craft 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.350
 here we see the folder bin zu hause butterfly 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.510
 see the minkravt jar file 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.269
 and open but with the help of true win rar 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.350
 archive here because you can change 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.539
 texture mobs picture of armor 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.539
 blocks well in this video i will tell you 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.550
 only how to change blocks 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.269
 texture blocks on about here 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.280
 you can still block things so the action on 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.980
 English but workbenches know exactly what 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.370
 is at the very bottom here it is here 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.440
 position it on top and see on top 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.210
 bottom and side 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.880
 we go over the top at the beginning you will change 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.320
 open with paint you bring closer 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.049
 buttons contour and wheel we bring closer 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.990
 let's take this for example 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:25.229
 the thickness here is this some kind of color 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.229
 red and fill- let's 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.399
 and on the well here is such a rim of us 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.250
 it is red then red will 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.250
 General it does not matter let's poke yellow 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.799
 and here you can eat green 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.450
 take for example you can do the texture 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.380
 for their cards to hide some 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.030
 blocks or something merged for example and 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.689
 here to give them no such here 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:08.009
 purple do and such here such 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:11.060
 us workbench will be such a top view 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.060
 give up still in 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.580
 and try to draw such black lines 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.480
 what book wait 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.500
 we draw such black lines 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.070
 like let's start saving close 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.570
 her here update her in the archive norman yes 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.660
 now perhaps meat on top also we can 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:50.800
 change it 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:53.990
 from the side let's not change you much 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.960
 just draw here such strips diesel 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:03.800
 no he will save 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:09.560
 yes yes yes yes yes save it open 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:14.630
 here in paint we bring children closer 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:21.490
 will give the same color or not cool 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:25.400
 I know that even grandfather save and all 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.610
 Now we close well this archive and this is the tone 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.520
 and close we go in and now we don't 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.440
 we go to our maykravt 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:38.600
 anyway this license is not license everywhere 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:42.290
 it changes no difference what version 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:47.030
 and it does not affect anything we go single 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:52.670
 player and go into our world that we see 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.790
 our seats changed its texture to that 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.549
 which we generally fill 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.079
 since the block is very cheerful now 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.489
 it can be seen that the hole is a window in the sense 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:09.790
 Well, dear friends, from our texture 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.760
