00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.119

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.140

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.350
 christmas magnolia tour 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.120

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.770

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.900
 pully then hopefully wear it 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.670
 work hard for it 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.170
 and I wish you a lot of fun you 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.670
 did you quite a lot of business their 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:02.070
 Let's start Let's go on the sofa 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.070
 angular 3 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.520
 st 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:29.380
 we do not even have that out 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.310
 I know the booklet and that's it 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.310
 Point 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.069
 So now I'll introduce you to the polit 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.560
 have done before the summit of and 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.200
 Although the calculator at the interest 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.560
 rod contains it can make noise 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.450
 and he can even blink and we have 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.920
 simply combines all of it 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.850
 For example, we have Christmas 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.750
 the close 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.670
 through this fluffy little wing here 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.640
 we once had rudolf we 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.680
 we have bells we have 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.300
 Snowflakes give snowstorm and 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.950
 we even have a charm bracelet here 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.019
 made them a little bit more 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.060
 and I think that's just around 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.000
 beautiful sweater and we should 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.200
 So take the hashtag rudi 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.030
 for this policy we want that 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.040
 it's a beautiful one now 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.200
 day could also be something else 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.600
 I have to be the right fan just that 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.870
 it is not even now 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.200
 now this one as well we have one 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.579
 integrated chain just around the neck 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.250
 Of course, wrapped can also be nice 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.109
 new in a scarf and then 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.160
 yet shine decide to do so 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.230
 really nice then yes it lights it up 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.140
 not only has this one tree 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.140
 the tree but it's quite a lot 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.720
 great why him because otherwise he alone 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.370
 is they do not want that he is alone 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.590
 and that's why he has a lot of little ones 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:53.080
 or for the vegan because nature from 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:54.400
 sweet and it is snowing in asymmetry 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.050
 in here because we do not want this 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.270
 whole metric so a bit 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.220
 asymmetric is in europe 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.590
 That's definitely our reaction 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:08.500
 the ultimate with the construction of which the 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.060
 great so our happy mega cool 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.740
 but you still have to decide 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.310
 which is cooler that's why it's true 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:21.330
 either off for the hashtag the tree 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:25.680
 actually still like green sweater rudy 8 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.680
