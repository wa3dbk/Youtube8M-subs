it came with beneficial bacteria that I
added<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.170> tank<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:17.299> jumpstart<00:01:18.299> cycling

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
added to the tank to jumpstart cycling

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.130 
added to the tank to jumpstart cycling
for<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> aquaponic<00:01:19.920> setup<00:01:20.180> I<00:01:21.180> set<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.869> up

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
for the aquaponic setup I set this up

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
for the aquaponic setup I set this up
four<00:01:23.100> days<00:01:23.280> ago<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.320> seeded<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.670> as<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
four days ago and seeded it and as you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.289 
four days ago and seeded it and as you
can<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> seeds<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.780> already<00:01:28.170> coming<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
can see the seeds are already coming in

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.679 
can see the seeds are already coming in
that<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.840> wheatgrass<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:33.299> lettuce

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that is the wheatgrass there the lettuce

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.749 
that is the wheatgrass there the lettuce
in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> middle<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.950> basil<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> scent

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
in the middle and the basil on the scent

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.249 
in the middle and the basil on the scent
so<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> first<00:01:39.090> betta<00:01:39.390> fish<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.900> put<00:01:40.140> in

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
so the first betta fish that I put in

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.840 
so the first betta fish that I put in
here<00:01:40.610> died<00:01:41.610> after<00:01:42.060> two<00:01:42.299> days<00:01:42.710> I'm<00:01:43.710> not<00:01:43.799> sure<00:01:44.159> if

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
here died after two days I'm not sure if

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.649 
here died after two days I'm not sure if
that<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.600> something<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.530> happened<00:01:47.100> because

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
that is something that happened because

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.810

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
healthy fish but then I got this second
betta<00:01:57.630> fish<00:01:57.750> who<00:01:58.049> seems<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> doing<00:01:58.619> pretty

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860

anything<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.689> do<00:02:06.020> with<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.320> system<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:07.130> could

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
anything to do with the system it could

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.940 
anything to do with the system it could
have<00:02:07.490> been<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.729> sick<00:02:08.060> fish<00:02:08.500> but<00:02:09.500> we'll<00:02:09.619> see<00:02:09.800> how

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.040 
have been a sick fish but we'll see how
this<00:02:10.099> guy<00:02:10.310> does<00:02:10.369> over<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.970> next<00:02:11.150> couple<00:02:11.390> weeks

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
this guy does over the next couple weeks

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
and he's happy in there but overall I'm

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.370 
and he's happy in there but overall I'm
pretty<00:02:15.800> happy<00:02:15.980> with<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.430> system<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:18.200> really

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
pretty happy with the system it's really

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.449 
pretty happy with the system it's really
great<00:02:19.190> design<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.630> said<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.959> uses<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.590> air

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
great design like I said it uses a air

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.020 
great design like I said it uses a air
lift<00:02:22.819> pump<00:02:23.319> right<00:02:24.319> there<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.950> that's<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
lift pump right there and that's the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.800 
lift pump right there and that's the
same<00:02:26.510> concept<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:28.190> move<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.819> water<00:02:29.030> up<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.720> I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
same concept to move the water up that I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.720 
same concept to move the water up that I
used<00:02:30.080> on<00:02:30.319> my<00:02:30.530> window<00:02:30.980> farm<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.269> had<00:02:32.599> set<00:02:32.989> up

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
used on my window farm that I had set up

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.670 
used on my window farm that I had set up
in<00:02:34.730> my<00:02:35.060> kitchen<00:02:35.330> I'm<00:02:35.870> trying<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.230> get<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.380> shot

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
in my kitchen I'm trying to get a shot

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.259 
in my kitchen I'm trying to get a shot
right<00:02:36.980> there<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.340> can<00:02:37.459> see<00:02:37.640> where<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.060> water

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
right there you can see where the water

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.110 
right there you can see where the water
bubbles<00:02:38.780> up<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:40.100> tube<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.580> connected<00:02:40.790> to

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
bubbles up and that tube is connected to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.800 
bubbles up and that tube is connected to
an<00:02:41.690> air<00:02:42.380> pump<00:02:42.519> that<00:02:43.519> sits<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.680> back<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.690> I'm

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
an air pump that sits in the back so I'm

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.009 
an air pump that sits in the back so I'm
going<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.080> see<00:02:48.319> that<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.239> has<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.750> little

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
going to see that so it has a little

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.320 
going to see that so it has a little
pump<00:02:51.319> that<00:02:51.620> sits<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.069> in<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.970> top

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
pump that sits in the in this top

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.110 
pump that sits in the in this top
reservoir<00:02:54.019> section<00:02:54.590> where<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.549> plant<00:02:55.819> roots

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
reservoir section where the plant roots

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.640 
reservoir section where the plant roots
grow<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:59.060> yeah<00:02:59.209> it's<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.989> really<00:03:00.230> nice<00:03:00.380> system

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
grow so yeah it's a really nice system

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.740 
grow so yeah it's a really nice system

dollars<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.920> can't<00:03:19.160> get<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.760> better<00:03:20.380> fish<00:03:21.380> tank

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
dollars you can't get a better fish tank

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.380 
dollars you can't get a better fish tank
plus<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.160> have<00:03:22.280> an<00:03:22.370> herb<00:03:22.519> garden<00:03:22.549> it's<00:03:23.120> it's

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
plus you have an herb garden it's it's

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.289 
plus you have an herb garden it's it's
great<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.980> what<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.250> did<00:03:25.400> was<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:25.940> filled<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
great so what you did was I filled the

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.199 
great so what you did was I filled the
tank<00:03:26.510> up<00:03:26.690> halfway<00:03:27.230> with<00:03:27.440> water<00:03:28.209> room

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
tank up halfway with water room

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.599 
tank up halfway with water room
temperature<00:03:29.239> water<00:03:29.870> put<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.829> container<00:03:31.250> that

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
temperature water put the container that

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.069 
temperature water put the container that
the<00:03:31.760> fish<00:03:32.060> came<00:03:32.870> in<00:03:33.250> into<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.630> half<00:03:35.630> filled

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
the fish came in into that half filled

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.069 
the fish came in into that half filled
tank<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:37.430> let<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:38.030> water<00:03:38.359> temperature

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
tank to let the water temperature

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.809 
tank to let the water temperature
equalize<00:03:40.630> then<00:03:41.630> what<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.870> did<00:03:42.200> was<00:03:42.590> I<00:03:42.920> added

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
equalize then what I did was I added

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.250 
equalize then what I did was I added
some<00:03:44.630> chemicals<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:45.170> came<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.980> kit<00:03:46.190> to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
some chemicals that came with the kit to

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.250 
some chemicals that came with the kit to
that<00:03:48.260> half<00:03:48.650> full<00:03:49.220> tank<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.670> water<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.230> put<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
that half full tank of water and put the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.110 
that half full tank of water and put the
fish<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.769> there<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.459> was<00:03:52.609> basically<00:03:53.000> a

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
fish in there and that was basically a

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.699 
fish in there and that was basically a
fish<00:03:53.420> bath

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
fish bath

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.440 
fish bath
I'd<00:03:55.010> never<00:03:55.220> done<00:03:55.489> that<00:03:55.670> with<00:03:55.819> any<00:03:55.970> of<00:03:56.120> my<00:03:56.209> fish

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
I'd never done that with any of my fish

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.370 
I'd never done that with any of my fish
before<00:03:57.310> but<00:03:58.310> apparently<00:03:59.109> that's<00:04:00.109> a<00:04:00.230> good

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
before but apparently that's a good

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.229 
before but apparently that's a good
thing<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.650> do<00:04:00.799> I<00:04:01.100> guess

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
thing to do I guess

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.979 
thing to do I guess
but<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:03.170> guess<00:04:03.790> wash<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.120> fish<00:04:05.389> I<00:04:05.750> don't

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
but it I guess wash the fish I don't

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.570 
but it I guess wash the fish I don't
know<00:04:06.200> what<00:04:06.410> exactly<00:04:06.560> that

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
know what exactly that

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.630 
know what exactly that
as<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.690> can<00:04:08.780> see<00:04:08.960> there's<00:04:09.140> some

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
as you can see there's some

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.920 
as you can see there's some
dechlorinating<00:04:10.640> chemicals<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.450> came<00:04:11.720> with

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
dechlorinating chemicals that came with

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.350 
dechlorinating chemicals that came with
the<00:04:12.050> system<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.160> after<00:04:13.580> giving<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.970> fish<00:04:14.150> its

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
the system so after giving the fish its

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.290 
the system so after giving the fish its
bath<00:04:14.570> emptied<00:04:15.470> that<00:04:15.680> water<00:04:15.920> out<00:04:16.070> filled<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.209> up

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.300 
bath emptied that water out filled it up

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.110 
bath emptied that water out filled it up
with<00:04:17.360> water<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:18.380> about<00:04:18.650> an<00:04:18.830> inch<00:04:19.070> below<00:04:19.370> this

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
with water to about an inch below this

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.680 
with water to about an inch below this
top<00:04:20.840> reservoir<00:04:21.470> out<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.910> dechlorinating

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
top reservoir out of the dechlorinating

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.770 
top reservoir out of the dechlorinating
chemicals<00:04:24.170> added<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.710> beneficial<00:04:25.340> bacteria

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
chemicals added the beneficial bacteria

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.190 
chemicals added the beneficial bacteria
added<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.220> tank<00:04:28.540> Kickstarter<00:04:29.540> or<00:04:29.570> something

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
added the tank Kickstarter or something

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.110 
added the tank Kickstarter or something
that<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.410> was<00:04:30.530> called<00:04:30.770> there<00:04:31.640> was<00:04:31.730> a<00:04:31.760> third

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
that it was called there was a third

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.400 
that it was called there was a third
chemical<00:04:32.390> that<00:04:32.960> came<00:04:33.710> with<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.660> kit<00:04:35.930> some

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
chemical that came with the the kit some

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.990 
chemical that came with the the kit some
kind<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.680> supplement<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.400> added<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.880> the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
kind of supplement that I added to the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.840 
kind of supplement that I added to the
tank<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:39.530> then<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:40.160> introduced<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.700> betta

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
tank and then you introduced the betta

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.650 
tank and then you introduced the betta
fish<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.330> plop<00:04:42.230> them<00:04:42.410> on<00:04:42.530> in<00:04:42.680> there<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.660> I've

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
fish you plop them on in there and I've

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.540 
recommends that the minimum tank size
that<00:05:21.890> uses<00:05:22.340> five<00:05:22.670> gallons<00:05:23.210> for<00:05:24.110> a<00:05:24.140> betta<00:05:24.550> so
