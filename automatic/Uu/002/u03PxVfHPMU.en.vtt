00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.800
 good 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.650
 for those who are not what it is 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.980
 on several islands you have to get 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.980

 those who have seen it 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.730

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.440
 recording a computer 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.440

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 very good that we say 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.119
 let say 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.170
 good 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.580

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.679
 says more 46 are the points when starting the 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.310
 departure 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.560
 when looking at it by heading 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.239
 the game you are given to choose a kit if you 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.280
 you want to buy anything else, you can use it 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.620
 once inside that game and here 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.540
