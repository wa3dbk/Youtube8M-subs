00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
one end a little bit longer this one's a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.230 
one end a little bit longer this one's a
little<00:02:07.829> shorter<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.670> one's<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.970> little<00:02:09.030> bit

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240

then<00:02:12.480> I'm<00:02:12.959> going<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.230> wrap<00:02:13.409> it<00:02:13.440> around<00:02:13.680> once

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
then I'm going to wrap it around once

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.570 
then I'm going to wrap it around once
and<00:02:14.819> I'm<00:02:14.940> going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> wrap<00:02:15.300> it

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580

and I'm going to wrap it
again<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.960> then<00:02:17.380> I'm<00:02:17.500> going<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.710> bring<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.220> up

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
again and then I'm going to bring it up

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.090 
again and then I'm going to bring it up
like<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.390> from<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.200> back<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.680> think<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:20.950> is

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
like this from the back I think this is

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.670 
like this from the back I think this is
kind<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.310> found<00:02:21.490> me<00:02:21.640> into<00:02:21.790> other<00:02:21.910> ties<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:25.680> then

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
kind of found me into other ties so then

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.500 
kind of found me into other ties so then
you<00:02:26.920> have<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.100> loop<00:02:27.370> right<00:02:27.610> here<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.210> you<00:02:28.240> just

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
you have a loop right here and you just

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.820 
you have a loop right here and you just
bring<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.080> down<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:32.500> you

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
bring it down like that and then you

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.530 
bring it down like that and then you
just<00:02:33.010> fix<00:02:33.310> your<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.550> little<00:02:33.730> not<00:02:33.880> however<00:02:34.180> you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
just fix your a little not however you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.690 
just fix your a little not however you
want<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.080> want<00:02:35.290> too<00:02:35.350> thick<00:02:35.590> not<00:02:35.830> or<00:02:36.190> then

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
want if you want too thick not or then

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.900 
want if you want too thick not or then
knife<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.150> thin<00:02:37.600> not<00:02:37.780> my<00:02:38.350> life<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.830> kind<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.760> like

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
knife I thin not my life I kind of like

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.410 
knife I thin not my life I kind of like
a<00:02:39.940> thick<00:02:40.270> or<00:02:40.420> not<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.930> then<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:42.310> just<00:02:42.550> wear<00:02:43.240> it

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
a thick or not and then you just wear it

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.570 
a thick or not and then you just wear it
down<00:02:43.810> like<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.800> perfect<00:02:44.980> look<00:02:45.400> it

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
down like that so it's a perfect look it

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.750 
down like that so it's a perfect look it
just<00:02:45.610> gives<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.150> little<00:02:46.360> bit<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:47.520> texture<00:02:48.520> to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
just gives a little bit of a texture to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.250 
just gives a little bit of a texture to
this<00:02:48.880> alpha<00:02:49.240> there's<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:49.660> much<00:02:49.840> for<00:02:50.080> stopping

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
this alpha there's so much for stopping

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.490 
this alpha there's so much for stopping
by<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.740> hope<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:50.980> have<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.160> great<00:02:51.370> day
