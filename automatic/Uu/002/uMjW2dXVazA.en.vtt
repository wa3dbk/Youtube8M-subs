you<00:00:06.029> know<00:00:06.120> what<00:00:06.299> for<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> lot<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.980> inexperienced

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
you know what for a lot of inexperienced

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.799 
you know what for a lot of inexperienced
players<00:00:08.280> coming<00:00:08.610> into<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.120> game<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.570> we<00:00:09.660> had

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
players coming into this game and we had

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.110 
players coming into this game and we had
a<00:00:09.840> big<00:00:10.050> ten<00:00:10.290> crew<00:00:10.670> officiating<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.910> thought

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
a big ten crew officiating it I thought

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.930 
a big ten crew officiating it I thought
it<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.330> pretty<00:00:12.570> clean<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.110> had<00:00:13.259> some<00:00:13.469> jumps

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
it was pretty clean we had some jumps

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.580 
it was pretty clean we had some jumps
but<00:00:14.940> by<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.240> large<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.660> thought<00:00:15.839> our<00:00:15.960> execution

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
but by and large I thought our execution

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.830 
but by and large I thought our execution
on<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:17.369> both<00:00:17.609> offense<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.210> defense<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
on on both offense and defense in the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.510 
on on both offense and defense in the
kicking<00:00:19.140> game<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.500> pretty<00:00:19.650> clean<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.070> from

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
kicking game was pretty clean so from

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.010 
kicking game was pretty clean so from
that<00:00:20.550> standpoint<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.390> really<00:00:21.600> encouraged

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
that standpoint I was really encouraged

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.990 
that standpoint I was really encouraged
about<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.590> think<00:00:22.800> we've<00:00:23.130> got<00:00:23.340> each<00:00:23.609> year

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
about that I think we've got each year

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.120 
about that I think we've got each year
we've<00:00:24.600> probably<00:00:25.380> got<00:00:25.529> more<00:00:25.619> speed<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
we've probably got more speed and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.429 
we've probably got more speed and
explosion<00:00:26.869> particularly<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:27.960> our<00:00:28.140> younger

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
explosion particularly with our younger

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.230 
explosion particularly with our younger
units<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.340> became<00:00:29.640> apparent<00:00:29.970> with

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
units so and that became apparent with

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.810 
units so and that became apparent with
some<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.660> freshman<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.380> any<00:00:32.369> closer<00:00:32.669> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
some of this freshman here any closer to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.850 
some of this freshman here any closer to
deciding<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.630> redshirt<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.320> Richard<00:00:34.739> up

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
deciding the redshirt not Richard up

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.540 
deciding the redshirt not Richard up
some<00:00:35.100> guys<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.899> we're<00:00:36.899> real<00:00:37.110> close<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.739> this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
some guys or we're real close and this

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.330 
some guys or we're real close and this
scrimmage<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.090> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> determine<00:00:39.510> that

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
scrimmage is going to determine that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.260 
scrimmage is going to determine that
there'll<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.370> some<00:00:41.670> guys<00:00:41.850> will<00:00:42.059> make<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
there'll be some guys will make a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
there'll be some guys will make a
decision<00:00:42.840> right<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.079> they'll<00:00:43.620> probably<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
decision right now they'll probably a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.090 
decision right now they'll probably a
couple<00:00:44.280> guys<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.610> will<00:00:45.140> maybe<00:00:46.140> dress<00:00:46.890> for

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
couple guys that will maybe dress for

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.350 
couple guys that will maybe dress for
some<00:00:47.280> games<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:47.940> make<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> determination

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
some games and then make a determination

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.139 
some games and then make a determination
as<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.440> season<00:00:49.800> goes<00:00:49.950> along<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.940> will<00:00:51.059> be

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
as the season goes along that will be

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.270 
as the season goes along that will be
dictated<00:00:51.690> by<00:00:51.719> injuries<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.680> maybe<00:00:52.920> some<00:00:53.190> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
dictated by injuries of maybe some of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.310 
dictated by injuries of maybe some of
our<00:00:53.399> upper<00:00:53.610> units<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.120> we're<00:00:55.020> getting<00:00:55.289> very

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
our upper units but we're getting very

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.619 
our upper units but we're getting very
close<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:56.699> today's<00:00:57.000> scrimmage<00:00:57.329> all

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
close and I think today's scrimmage all

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.200 
close and I think today's scrimmage all
really<00:00:58.289> kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> cap<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.219> how's<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
really kind of put a cap on it how's the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
really kind of put a cap on it how's the
cornerback<00:01:00.629> battle<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.260> opposite<00:01:01.620> of

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
cornerback battle going opposite of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.930 
cornerback battle going opposite of
Marcus<00:01:02.100> Williams

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
Marcus Williams

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.329 
Marcus Williams
well<00:01:03.539> there's<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> little

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
well there's actually and I was a little

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.100 
well there's actually and I was a little
bit<00:01:05.460> remiss<00:01:05.790> Brendan<00:01:06.180> Pierre<00:01:06.420> has<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.750> been

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
bit remiss Brendan Pierre has not been

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
bit remiss Brendan Pierre has not been
practicing<00:01:07.890> he'll<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.369> ready<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> Kansas

practicing he'll be ready for the Kansas

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.070 
practicing he'll be ready for the Kansas
State<00:01:09.360> game<00:01:09.690> though<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.650> between<00:01:11.250> Pierre

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
State game though but so between Pierre

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
State game though but so between Pierre
you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.229> think<00:01:13.380> CJ<00:01:14.369> Smith's<00:01:14.850> doing<00:01:15.090> some

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you know I think CJ Smith's doing some

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
you know I think CJ Smith's doing some
good<00:01:15.420> things<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.780> Jordan<00:01:16.080> champion<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
good things in Jordan champion and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.789 
good things in Jordan champion and
today's<00:01:17.549> scrimmage<00:01:17.880> those<00:01:18.299> guys<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.680> know

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
today's scrimmage those guys you know

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
today's scrimmage those guys you know
those<00:01:20.420> not<00:01:23.390> Brendan<00:01:24.390> Pierre<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> other

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
those not Brendan Pierre but the other

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170 
those not Brendan Pierre but the other
two<00:01:25.290> guys<00:01:25.470> were<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.190> lot<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.490> that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
two guys were out there a lot and that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.789 
two guys were out there a lot and that
was<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> big<00:01:27.420> reason<00:01:27.810> why<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.259> scrimmaged<00:01:28.710> as

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
was a big reason why we scrimmaged as

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.980 
was a big reason why we scrimmaged as
much<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.880> did<00:01:30.060> typically<00:01:30.539> we've<00:01:30.810> had

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
much as what we did typically we've had

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.810 
much as what we did typically we've had
short<00:01:31.320> scrimmage<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.950> one's<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.280> longer<00:01:32.670> than

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
short scrimmage this one's a longer than

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.700 
short scrimmage this one's a longer than
what<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.030> typically<00:01:33.509> has<00:01:33.630> been<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
what it typically has been for that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
what it typically has been for that
reason<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.509> don't<00:01:36.509> know<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.690> I<00:01:36.780> answer<00:01:37.050> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
reason I don't know if I answer the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 
reason I don't know if I answer the
question<00:01:37.500> probably<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:38.039> with<00:01:38.580> Chase<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.570> know

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
question probably not with Chase I know

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.540 
question probably not with Chase I know
maybe<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.409> made<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:40.800> decision<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> registered

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
maybe I made the decision I registered

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.219 
maybe I made the decision I registered
enough<00:01:41.789> what<00:01:42.210> has<00:01:42.330> he<00:01:42.479> shown<00:01:42.690> you<00:01:42.929> a<00:01:42.960> big

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
does he made that jump well I think a

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.640 
does he made that jump well I think a
lot<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.150> determination<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:51.050> his<00:03:51.260> part<00:03:51.500> he

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
lot of determination on his part he

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.470 
lot of determination on his part he
certainly<00:03:51.890> has<00:03:52.160> some<00:03:52.430> ability<00:03:52.580> but<00:03:53.060> he's<00:03:53.240> come

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
certainly has some ability but he's come

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.440 
certainly has some ability but he's come
in<00:03:53.660> he's<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> self-made<00:03:54.740> player<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.490> he's<00:03:56.420> a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
in he's a self-made player and he's a

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.390 
in he's a self-made player and he's a
legitimate<00:03:57.050> player<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.770> so<00:03:58.100> it's

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
legitimate player and so it's

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.520 
legitimate player and so it's
encouraging<00:03:59.270> he's<00:03:59.420> gone<00:03:59.600> against<00:03:59.870> our<00:04:00.050> top

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530
