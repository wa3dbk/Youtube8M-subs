00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.290 
combination lock little valve of thing
that<00:02:19.230> releases<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.950> I'm<00:02:20.160> thinking<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.180> just

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that releases it I'm thinking it's just

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.729 
that releases it I'm thinking it's just
easier<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.720> pull<00:02:21.870> these<00:02:21.959> two<00:02:22.140> bolts<00:02:22.410> off<00:02:22.560> so

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
easier to pull these two bolts off so

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.830 
easier to pull these two bolts off so
that's<00:02:22.800> what<00:02:22.980> I'm<00:02:23.070> gonna<00:02:23.160> do<00:02:23.370> likewise<00:02:24.360> here

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that's what I'm gonna do likewise here

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.110 
that's what I'm gonna do likewise here
and<00:02:25.440> disconnect<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:28.670> under<00:02:29.670> vacuum<00:02:29.820> hose

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
and disconnect this under vacuum hose

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.699 
and disconnect this under vacuum hose
are<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.360> same<00:02:30.570> one<00:02:34.340> stuff<00:02:36.080> be<00:02:37.080> careful<00:02:37.500> this

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
are the same one stuff be careful this

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.830 
are the same one stuff be careful this
hose<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.220> very<00:02:38.640> fragile<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.270> can<00:02:39.480> feel<00:02:39.690> I'm

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
hose is a very fragile I can feel I'm

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:49.449 
hose is a very fragile I can feel I'm
just<00:02:40.050> moving<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.470> around<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.900> don't<00:02:46.830> break<00:02:47.070> it

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.880 

this<00:02:50.459> one<00:02:50.700> remember<00:02:51.480> guys<00:02:51.750> put<00:02:52.019> your<00:02:52.170> bolts

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
this one remember guys put your bolts

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.870 
this one remember guys put your bolts
back<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.130> again<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.890> kind<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.370> pitted<00:02:56.760> and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
back in again this kind of pitted and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.479 
back in again this kind of pitted and
nasty<00:02:57.410> I'm<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:58.620> gonna<00:02:58.739> have<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.860> replace<00:02:59.220> it

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
nasty I'm just gonna have to replace it

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
on the manifold this one comes off it's

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.220 
on the manifold this one comes off it's

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
that one up that would be really easy to

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.420 
that one up that would be really easy to

then<00:04:45.240> take<00:04:45.360> manifold<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.500> get<00:04:46.650> that<00:04:46.770> out<00:04:46.830> of

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
then take manifold and get that out of

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.150 
then take manifold and get that out of
there<00:04:48.620> okay<00:04:50.480> next<00:04:51.480> step<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:52.020> went<00:04:52.830> ahead<00:04:52.890> and

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
there okay next step I went ahead and

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.770 
there okay next step I went ahead and
moved<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.610> AC<00:04:53.940> compressor<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.510> had<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.750> just

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
moved the AC compressor I had it just

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.750 
moved the AC compressor I had it just
