00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
their racket so what I want to encourage

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.840 
their racket so what I want to encourage
you<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.930> today<00:01:22.260> is<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:23.070> learn<00:01:23.370> how<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you to do today is to learn how to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.150 
you to do today is to learn how to
prepare<00:01:24.479> efficiently<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> way<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
prepare efficiently and the way that I

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.880 
prepare efficiently and the way that I
like<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.729> by<00:01:27.030> using<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.660> left<00:01:27.960> hand<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.560> often

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
like is by using the left hand and often

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.440 
like is by using the left hand and often
we<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> left<00:01:29.580> index<00:01:29.940> finger<00:01:30.030> if

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
we can use the left index finger if

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.730 
we can use the left index finger if
you're<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.840> you're<00:01:30.870> a<00:01:31.020> right-handed<00:01:31.260> player

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you're if you're a right-handed player

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.110 
you're if you're a right-handed player
and<00:01:31.950> reverse<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.610> you're<00:01:32.760> left-handed

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
and reverse that if you're left-handed

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.060 
and reverse that if you're left-handed
player<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:34.020> using<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.470> left<00:01:34.650> index<00:01:34.979> finger

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
player but using that left index finger

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.070 
player but using that left index finger
placing<00:01:35.760> it<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.030> string<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> racket

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
placing it on the string of the racket

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.590

and keeping the racket head high the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390 
and keeping the racket head high the
reason<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.040> keep<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
high is twofold one in this position the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.060 
high is twofold one in this position the
racket<00:01:45.330> is<00:01:45.450> lightest<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.710> allow<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
racket is lightest when we allow the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.070 
racket is lightest when we allow the
racket<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.700> come<00:01:47.880> more<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.150> this<00:01:48.479> position<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
racket to come more to this position the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.200 
racket to come more to this position the
racket<00:01:49.410> becomes<00:01:49.680> heavier<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.280> our<00:01:50.400> hand<00:01:50.700> that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
racket becomes heavier in our hand that

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.690 
racket becomes heavier in our hand that
makes<00:01:51.450> our<00:01:51.600> muscles<00:01:51.930> more<00:01:52.380> contracted<00:01:53.040> yes

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
makes our muscles more contracted yes

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370 
makes our muscles more contracted yes
we're<00:01:53.940> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> get<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.300> more<00:01:54.540> tense<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.080> less

we're going to get a more tense and less
natural<00:01:55.860> swing<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.550> make<00:01:56.790> sure<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
natural swing so make sure that that

that<00:02:10.259> they<00:02:10.350> come<00:02:10.530> into<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.920> position<00:02:11.160> here

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that they come into this position here

something<00:03:14.970> that's<00:03:15.120> highly<00:03:15.330> recommendable

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
something that's highly recommendable

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.600 
something that's highly recommendable
for<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.380> two-handed<00:03:16.830> backhand<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:17.280> we<00:03:17.430> do

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
for the two-handed backhand but we do

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.310 
for the two-handed backhand but we do

see it more often on the one-handed
backhand<00:03:19.680> side<00:03:19.890> but<00:03:20.459> it's<00:03:20.580> crucial<00:03:20.910> but<00:03:21.300> you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
backhand side but it's crucial but you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.030 
backhand side but it's crucial but you

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
more racket control than a two-handed

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
follow-through I've seen this time and

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.940 
follow-through I've seen this time and
time<00:04:15.880> again<00:04:16.030> with<00:04:16.450> players<00:04:16.840> especially<00:04:17.560> in

time again with players especially in

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the slightly lower recreational level

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.960 
the slightly lower recreational level
players<00:04:20.020> like<00:04:20.710> to<00:04:20.920> use<00:04:21.130> their<00:04:21.340> wrists<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.820> lot

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
players like to use their wrists a lot

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.300 
players like to use their wrists a lot
and<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.360> see<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.630> lot<00:04:22.930> of<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.380> as<00:04:24.040> they're

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
and I see a lot of this as they're

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.430 
and I see a lot of this as they're
finishing<00:04:24.700> over<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.330> shop<00:04:25.630> this<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.170> an

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
finishing over the shop this is an

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.500 
finishing over the shop this is an
incorrect<00:04:26.770> technique<00:04:27.160> what<00:04:27.940> we're<00:04:28.090> looking

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
incorrect technique what we're looking

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.710 
incorrect technique what we're looking
for<00:04:28.540> is<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.260> great<00:04:29.680> unit<00:04:30.100> turn<00:04:30.450> preparation<00:04:31.450> and

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
for is a great unit turn preparation and

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.540 
for is a great unit turn preparation and
as<00:04:32.110> we<00:04:32.290> follow<00:04:32.530> through<00:04:32.980> we<00:04:33.160> want<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.430> keep

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
as we follow through we want to keep

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.460 
as we follow through we want to keep
that<00:04:33.730> wrist<00:04:34.030> nice<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.600> firm<00:04:34.840> throughout<00:04:35.200> the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
that wrist nice and firm throughout the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.560 
that wrist nice and firm throughout the
end<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.830> swing<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.730> that<00:04:36.880> we're<00:04:37.030> using<00:04:37.300> the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
end of the swing so that we're using the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.240 
end of the swing so that we're using the
big<00:04:37.750> muscles<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.320> we're<00:04:38.710> allowing<00:04:39.010> the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
big muscles and we're allowing the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.010 
big muscles and we're allowing the
racket<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.730> slide<00:04:40.000> through<00:04:40.240> its<00:04:40.390> natural<00:04:40.780> pop

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
racket to slide through its natural pop

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.010 
racket to slide through its natural pop
I<00:04:41.350> often<00:04:42.070> see<00:04:42.310> players<00:04:42.640> wanting<00:04:43.450> to<00:04:43.570> use<00:04:43.780> this

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
I often see players wanting to use this

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.890 
I often see players wanting to use this
motion<00:04:44.560> here<00:04:44.770> like<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.250> windscreen<00:04:45.700> wiper<00:04:46.150> not

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
motion here like a windscreen wiper not

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.540 
motion here like a windscreen wiper not
efficient<00:04:47.470> not<00:04:47.680> powerful<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.310> will<00:04:48.430> also

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
efficient not powerful and will also

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.370 
efficient not powerful and will also
most<00:04:48.910> likely<00:04:49.270> lead<00:04:49.420> to<00:04:49.450> some<00:04:49.750> wrist<00:04:49.960> problems

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
most likely lead to some wrist problems

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.650 
most likely lead to some wrist problems
in<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.950> long<00:04:51.130> run<00:04:51.310> so<00:04:51.460> very<00:04:51.970> important<00:04:52.510> here

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
in the long run so very important here

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.600 
in the long run so very important here
