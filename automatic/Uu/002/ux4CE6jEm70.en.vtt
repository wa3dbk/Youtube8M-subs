fire but I lost my top teeth when I was
in<00:00:40.469> my<00:00:40.620> early<00:00:40.770> 40s<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.670> had<00:00:41.940> lost<00:00:42.120> my<00:00:42.300> structures

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
in my early 40s I had lost my structures

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
originally at that time and I went to my

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
originally at that time and I went to my
dentist<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.950> repaired<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.700> he<00:00:48.059> said<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
dentist to get it repaired and he said I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.020 
dentist to get it repaired and he said I
had<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> receding<00:00:49.140> gum<00:00:49.469> line<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.039> had<00:00:50.579> some<00:00:50.850> bone

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
had a receding gum line I had some bone

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660 
had a receding gum line I had some bone
loss<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.590> basically<00:00:52.829> I'd<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.489> wasting

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
loss and that basically I'd be wasting

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.729 
loss and that basically I'd be wasting
my<00:00:54.030> money<00:00:54.210> trying<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> keep<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.140> my<00:00:55.469> teeth

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
my money trying to keep up with my teeth

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.400 
my money trying to keep up with my teeth
and<00:00:56.149> in<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> long<00:00:57.480> run<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.899> would<00:00:57.989> cost<00:00:58.170> me

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and in the long run it would cost me

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.819 
and in the long run it would cost me
much<00:00:58.620> more<00:00:58.649> than<00:00:58.920> dentures<00:00:59.910> would<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.320> would

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
much more than dentures would so I would

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
much more than dentures would so I would
buy<00:01:01.949> his<00:01:02.100> recommendations<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.629> what<00:01:03.960> I
