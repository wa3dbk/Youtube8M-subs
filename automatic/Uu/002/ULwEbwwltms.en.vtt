00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
click play and it's kind of load just

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
click play and it's kind of load just
know<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> will<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:37.200> louder<00:01:37.829> like

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
know that it will be much louder like

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340 
know that it will be much louder like
the<00:01:38.460> volume<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.939> guess<00:01:39.090> gets<00:01:39.420> boost<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.930> when

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the volume I guess gets boost it when

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
the volume I guess gets boost it when
you<00:01:40.439> download<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.850> add<00:01:42.270> to
