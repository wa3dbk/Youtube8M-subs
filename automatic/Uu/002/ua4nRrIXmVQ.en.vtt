00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the fact that there is not really a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.500 
the fact that there is not really a
chance<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> Rockets<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.059> him<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
we acquire Carmelo it would kind of be a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.319 
we acquire Carmelo it would kind of be a
smack<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.300> his<00:00:54.420> face<00:00:54.660> move<00:00:55.590> furthermore

another thing I want to tell you guys is

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.099 
another thing I want to tell you guys is
I'm<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.789> your<00:01:00.000> typical<00:01:00.120> Laker<00:01:00.600> fan<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

thinks<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.739> acquire<00:01:02.629> Carmelo<00:01:03.629> Anthony

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
thinks if we acquire Carmelo Anthony

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
thinks if we acquire Carmelo Anthony
where<00:01:04.320> immediate<00:01:04.979> championship<00:01:05.850> contenders

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
where immediate championship contenders

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.359 
where immediate championship contenders
sure<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.470> believe<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.830> could<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
sure I believe we could get into the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
sure I believe we could get into the
playoffs<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.180> remember<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> time<00:01:09.930> where

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
playoffs but I remember a time where

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
playoffs but I remember a time where
Carmelo<00:01:11.280> Anthony<00:01:11.760> teamed<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.750> another

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
Carmelo Anthony teamed up with another

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.800 
Carmelo Anthony teamed up with another
great<00:01:13.799> scorer<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.280> his<00:01:14.580> time<00:01:14.820> Allen<00:01:15.299> Iverson

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
great scorer of his time Allen Iverson

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.899 
great scorer of his time Allen Iverson
and<00:01:15.990> sure<00:01:16.500> they<00:01:16.619> put<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> ton<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.189> points<00:01:17.460> but

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and sure they put up a ton of points but

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.120 
and sure they put up a ton of points but
in<00:01:18.390> terms<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.750> getting<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.080> championship<00:01:19.890> which

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
in terms of getting a championship which

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
in terms of getting a championship which
is<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.430> most<00:01:20.610> people<00:01:20.939> from<00:01:21.119> la<00:01:21.450> expect<00:01:22.080> that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
is what most people from la expect that

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.910 
is what most people from la expect that
didn't<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.640> well<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.770> be

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
didn't really do so well so I would be

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520 
didn't really do so well so I would be
ecstatic<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.150> were<00:01:27.270> able<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.810> him<00:01:28.020> but

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
ecstatic if we were able to get him but

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
ecstatic if we were able to get him but
if<00:01:28.829> we're<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.100> able<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.579> uh<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.420> don't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
if we're not able to uh but I don't

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.120 
if we're not able to uh but I don't
think<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:30.960> gonna<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> final<00:01:31.920> piece

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
think it's gonna be like the final piece

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.789 
think it's gonna be like the final piece
of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.400> puzzle<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.970> team<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.930> powder<00:01:34.439> salt

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
of the puzzle a team with powder salt

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.340 
of the puzzle a team with powder salt
assuming<00:01:35.310> he<00:01:35.340> comes<00:01:35.640> back<00:01:35.880> Julius<00:01:36.869> Randle

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
assuming he comes back Julius Randle
