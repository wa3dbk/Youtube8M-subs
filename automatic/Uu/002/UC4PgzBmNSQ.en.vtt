00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
later never quite looked like getting

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.599 
later never quite looked like getting
there<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.349> way<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.859> race<00:03:10.040> had<00:03:10.310> panned

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
there but the way the race had panned

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.369 
there but the way the race had panned
out<00:03:10.730> behind<00:03:11.060> her<00:03:11.329> really<00:03:11.690> everything<00:03:12.079> fell<00:03:12.260> in

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
out behind her really everything fell in

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.380 
out behind her really everything fell in
a<00:03:12.470> favor<00:03:13.099> but<00:03:13.310> having<00:03:13.549> said<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:13.790> she<00:03:14.150> she

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
a favor but having said that she she

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.599 
a favor but having said that she she
showed<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.200> early<00:03:15.500> speed<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.370> first

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
showed that early speed to the first

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.690 
showed that early speed to the first
corner<00:03:16.849> which<00:03:17.060> was<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:17.419> crucial<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.160> she<00:03:19.160> she

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
corner which was so crucial and she she

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:33.979 
corner which was so crucial and she she
just<00:03:19.730> burned<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.299> others<00:03:20.510> off

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.470 

what<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.019> fantastic<00:03:35.260> performance<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:37.209> think

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
what a fantastic performance and I think

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.959 
what a fantastic performance and I think
she'll<00:03:37.659> be<00:03:37.810> replaying<00:03:38.769> this<00:03:39.249> race<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.849> this

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:39.969 
she'll be replaying this race and this

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.539 
she'll be replaying this race and this
metal<00:03:40.239> ceremony<00:03:41.049> for<00:03:41.739> many<00:03:41.950> years<00:03:42.189> to<00:03:42.340> come

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
metal ceremony for many years to come

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.440 
metal ceremony for many years to come
and<00:03:44.430> when<00:03:45.430> she<00:03:45.609> eventually<00:03:45.670> has<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> family

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
and when she eventually has a family

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.449 
and when she eventually has a family
this<00:03:47.019> will<00:03:47.230> be<00:03:47.379> certainly<00:03:47.739> something<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.219> show

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
this will be certainly something to show
