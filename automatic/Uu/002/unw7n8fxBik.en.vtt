00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 how this mysterious green ray came 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.350
 even the guise of the red moon is not a 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.110
 scene from a science movie 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.360
 fiction the green ray of light and the moon 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 red are completely real and they were 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.000
 photographed in the first hours of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.400
 April 15 said the NASA that chose this 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.800
 image as astronomical photography of the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.750
 day last Friday content 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.640
 related when you can see the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.189
 next eclipses of the red moon 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 images of the shocking eclipse that 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.630
 the red moon turned the moon turns 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 red in most of america and so 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 amazing portrait has a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.160
 scientific explanation the reddish tone of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.899
 the moon is easy to explain since the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.840
 image was taken during the eclipse 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.940
 total lunar from last week that was 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.670
 followed with great fascination in great 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.399
 part of the American continent according to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.230
 Nasa said the moon to be 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.260
 submerged in the shadow of the earth 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.350
 during the eclipse reflects reddish light 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.000
 of all the sunsets and sunrises 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.330
 filtered from the edges of the planet 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 click also read the moon turns red 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.210
 in May 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.579
 part of america retro reflector but the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.640
 green ray is really a laser beam 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.590
 shot from a 35 telescope 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.409
 meters at the point observatory 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.020
 Apache in the south of New Mexico USA 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.539
 red moon from montevideo so you saw the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.810
 eclipse of the moon on April 15 from 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.509
 Montevideo Uruguay The atmosphere dispersed 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.909
 part of the intense laser light what 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.399
 he uncovered the trajectory of 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.280
 ray pointing to the retro reflector 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.599
 apolo 15 an experiment that left the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.640
 astronauts on the moon in 1971 a team 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.789
 experimental of astronomers of the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.739
 University of California San Diego 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.140
 he fired the beam to be able to measure 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.329
 the distance between the earth and the moon 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.909
 with an accuracy of millimeters and 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.640
 prove general relativity theory 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.129
 of the gravity of einstein the nasa 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.319
 explained that the laser experiment ranking 

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:06.329
 retro reflector installed on the moon 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.549
 uses the earth as if it were a 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.130
 cosmic light switch during a 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.770
 total eclipse with direct sunlight 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.170
 blocked the effect of the reflector 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.990
 improvement over a moonlit night 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.000
 full normal the powerful image was 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.160
 captured during the first of four 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.550
 total lunar eclipses that will occur 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.500
 between 2014 and 2015 so the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.840
 scientists will soon have more 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.630
 opportunities to direct your rays to the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.970
 red moon the next eclipse will be 8 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.210
 October of this year and it will be visible 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.210
 from asia australia the pacific and the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.030
 American continent the third will happen 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.210
 on April 4, 2015 and can be seen in 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.000
 the same areas as the previous one on 28 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.760
 September 2015 will be the last of 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.130
 the eclipses of the visible time in 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.290
 almost the entire planet except in 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.290
 australia and the far east
