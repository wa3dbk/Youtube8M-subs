container had leaked we finally got our

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.230 
container had leaked we finally got our
sample<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.099> fully<00:00:14.340> fueled<00:00:14.610> ride<00:00:14.969> out<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.700 

the<00:00:19.300> army<00:00:19.599> had<00:00:19.720> planned<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.109> wipe<00:00:20.349> out<00:00:20.560> the

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
the army had planned to wipe out the

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.490 
the army had planned to wipe out the
infection<00:00:21.220> by<00:00:21.340> deploying<00:00:21.699> new<00:00:22.169> the<00:00:23.169> warheads

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
infection by deploying new the warheads

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:42.350 
infection by deploying new the warheads
were<00:00:23.680> armed<00:00:24.039> so<00:00:24.880> I<00:00:24.939> hit<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.239> button

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.500 

we<00:00:43.360> flew<00:00:43.600> for<00:00:43.840> a<00:00:43.870> long<00:00:44.080> time<00:00:45.510> everywhere

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
we flew for a long time everywhere

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.160 
we flew for a long time everywhere
looked<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.840> same<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:47.379> dead<00:00:47.950> world

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
looked the same a dead world

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.529 
looked the same a dead world
a<00:00:50.260> secluded<00:00:50.980> underground<00:00:51.640> bunker<00:00:52.059> sounded<00:00:52.449> as

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
a secluded underground bunker sounded as

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.919 
a secluded underground bunker sounded as
good<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.780> place<00:00:53.050> as<00:00:53.079> any

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
good a place as any

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.270 
good a place as any
after<00:00:55.929> hours<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.289> flying<00:00:56.649> we<00:00:56.890> finally

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
after hours of flying we finally

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.180 
after hours of flying we finally
approached<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.820> Eco<00:00:58.149> gate<00:00:58.329> facility<00:00:59.190> they

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
approached the Eco gate facility they

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.860 
approached the Eco gate facility they
were<00:01:00.250> probably<00:01:00.550> going<00:01:00.789> to<00:01:01.030> push<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.539> prod<00:01:01.690> us

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
were probably going to push and prod us

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.469 
were probably going to push and prod us
for<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.109> rest<00:01:02.289> lives<00:01:02.769> but<00:01:03.760> we<00:01:03.909> were<00:01:04.000> tired<00:01:04.269> of

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
for the rest lives but we were tired of

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.820 
for the rest lives but we were tired of
running<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:04.869> hiding<00:01:06.899> then<00:01:07.899> did<00:01:08.409> you<00:01:08.530> get<00:01:08.680> my

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
running and hiding then did you get my

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.300 
running and hiding then did you get my
tissue<00:01:09.100> sample<00:01:10.950> yeah

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
tissue sample yeah

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.130 
tissue sample yeah
here's<00:01:13.030> your<00:01:13.240> sample<00:01:18.659> dr.<00:01:19.659> Morton<00:01:20.020> de

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
here's your sample dr. Morton de

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.109 
here's your sample dr. Morton de
signaled<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.920> lab<00:01:21.100> technicians<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:21.909> we<00:01:21.970> were

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
signaled the lab technicians and we were

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.510 
signaled the lab technicians and we were
ushered<00:01:22.479> into<00:01:22.600> bio<00:01:22.899> containers<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.740> lot<00:01:24.369> like

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
ushered into bio containers a lot like

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.990 
ushered into bio containers a lot like
the<00:01:24.670> one<00:01:24.850> we<00:01:25.000> found<00:01:25.179> patient<00:01:25.690> zero<00:01:25.899> in<00:01:26.819> the<00:01:27.819> doc

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
the one we found patient zero in the doc

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.730 
the one we found patient zero in the doc
told<00:01:28.299> us<00:01:28.479> they'd<00:01:28.659> found<00:01:28.840> a<00:01:29.020> way<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.200> fuse<00:01:29.560> our

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
told us they'd found a way to fuse our

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.190 
told us they'd found a way to fuse our
DNA's<00:01:30.220> with<00:01:30.549> that<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:30.850> patient<00:01:31.210> zeros<00:01:31.539> turning

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
DNA's with that of patient zeros turning

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.130 
DNA's with that of patient zeros turning
us<00:01:32.289> into<00:01:32.470> living<00:01:32.740> sources<00:01:33.250> for<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.460> Cure<00:01:34.140> but

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
us into living sources for the Cure but

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.160 
us into living sources for the Cure but
I<00:01:35.200> guess<00:01:35.380> that's<00:01:35.530> what<00:01:35.740> they<00:01:35.860> told<00:01:36.009> everyone

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
I guess that's what they told everyone

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.820 
I guess that's what they told everyone
there<00:01:38.170> was<00:01:38.319> no<00:01:38.530> cure<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:40.450> were<00:01:40.569> to<00:01:40.690> become

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
there was no cure we were to become

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.219 
there was no cure we were to become
bioweapons<00:01:41.830> like<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.399> others<00:01:42.640> before<00:01:42.789> us

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
bioweapons like the others before us

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.639 
bioweapons like the others before us
immune<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.470> virus<00:01:45.090> programmed

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920
