00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
changing Beck's architecture that can

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.360 
changing Beck's architecture that can
block<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> line<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.380> sight<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.250> sounds

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
block the line of sight so this sounds

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.420 
block the line of sight so this sounds
very<00:00:59.489> amazing<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.810> 3v3<00:01:01.440> team<00:01:01.980> deathmatch

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.819 
very amazing it is a 3v3 team deathmatch
so<00:01:02.880> it<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.030> very<00:01:03.300> similar<00:01:03.630> to<00:01:03.750> skirmish<00:01:04.259> which

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.280 
so it is very similar to skirmish which
I<00:01:04.949> did<00:01:05.399> enjoy<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.259> be

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I did enjoy and there is going to be

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.859 
I did enjoy and there is going to be
level<00:01:07.710> advantages<00:01:08.610> enabled<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
level advantages enabled so like the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.050 
level advantages enabled so like the
iron<00:01:10.110> banner<00:01:10.350> these<00:01:10.829> were<00:01:11.100> enabled<00:01:11.639> but<00:01:11.850> they

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
iron banner these were enabled but they

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.999 
iron banner these were enabled but they
didn't<00:01:12.329> really<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.689> much<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.679> the<00:01:13.770> past

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
didn't really do that much in the past

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.340 
didn't really do that much in the past
but<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:15.090> will<00:01:15.329> be<00:01:15.509> having<00:01:15.719> to<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.109> level

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
but now we will be having to the level

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.289 
but now we will be having to the level
advantages<00:01:16.859> enabled<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.520> hopefully<00:01:17.909> that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
advantages enabled so hopefully that

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
advantages enabled so hopefully that
does<00:01:18.479> help<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.899> higher<00:01:19.109> level<00:01:19.409> players<00:01:19.740> so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
does help the higher level players so

in the trials of Osiris if you lose

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.490 
in the trials of Osiris if you lose
three<00:02:41.150> times<00:02:41.420> however<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.930> have<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.380> will

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
three times however you have you will

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.620 
three times however you have you will
need<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.860> buy<00:02:43.010> another<00:02:43.580> coin<00:02:43.970> I'm<00:02:44.210> not<00:02:44.300> sure<00:02:44.510> if

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
need to buy another coin I'm not sure if

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.290 
need to buy another coin I'm not sure if
this<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.780> three<00:02:45.080> times<00:02:45.290> in<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.530> row<00:02:45.710> I<00:02:46.120> am<00:02:47.120> just

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
this is three times in a row I am just

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.510 
this is three times in a row I am just
assuming<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.500> three<00:02:48.770> times<00:02:49.010> overall

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
assuming that it is three times overall

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.260 
assuming that it is three times overall
so<00:02:50.480> with<00:02:50.600> ten<00:02:50.930> wins<00:02:51.200> on<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.530> single<00:02:52.040> coin<00:02:52.250> or<00:02:52.580> 25

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
so with ten wins on a single coin or 25

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.450 
so with ten wins on a single coin or 25
wins<00:02:53.510> total<00:02:53.990> in<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.110> trials<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.500> Osiris<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.130> am

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
wins total in the trials of Osiris I am

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.100 
wins total in the trials of Osiris I am
assuming<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.210> just<00:02:56.660> buy<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> bunch

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.750 
assuming that you can just buy a bunch
of<00:02:57.260> different<00:02:57.560> coins<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:58.100> then<00:02:58.310> even<00:02:58.580> if<00:02:58.670> you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
of different coins and then even if you

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.760 
of different coins and then even if you
lose<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.210> you<00:02:59.270> can<00:02:59.390> just<00:02:59.540> keep<00:02:59.720> going<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.200> it

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
lose and you can just keep going and it

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.010 
lose and you can just keep going and it
just<00:03:00.950> totals<00:03:01.400> up<00:03:01.520> your<00:03:01.670> wins<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.450> after<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.900> do

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
just totals up your wins so after you do

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.870 
just totals up your wins so after you do
that<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.380> complete<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.040> second<00:03:04.459> test<00:03:04.640> and
