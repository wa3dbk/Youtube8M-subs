The work, some of it is just phenomenal, the
techniques that have been covered, for jewellery,

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.800
are not what is normally seen in our world
in our high street. Topshop is young, it is

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.380
exuberant, it is fresh, it needs to be accessible,
that is a very specific criteria. It is inspired

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.770
by the London skyline which is rapidly changing.
I kind of wanted to create a piece for a Londoner

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.800
that is taking all these aspects in.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:57.480
And the
winner is Evie Armstrong-Clarke. Seeing the new buildings that are happening around London
come up really quickly and there was lots

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.369
of development in 2014 and the skyline had
changed. I started going around London where

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.009
there was this really nice mix of old and
the new and as you were walking you'd see

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.231
lines intersect and textures going on top of
each other, a bit like collage. I wanted to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.200
get an element of that building and mix it
with another line or another composition that I like.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.660
And I like that this is quite chaotic,
I think that we want to keep that element,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.200
that excitement. In terms of another colour,
what were you, what did you have in mind?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.800
I think something subtle that is not obviously like too pale
or too baby blue, I was thinking maybe having something a bit more solid.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.860
