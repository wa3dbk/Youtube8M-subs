00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.290
 a wonderful white job 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.539
 pruning a pollard willow 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.979
 nice job but keep few things in mind 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.589
 First, it is actually best to make a pastiche difficult 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.119
 when it is the end of winter 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.169
 who reports a good thing about wonder at the end of February or early March 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.849
 You didn't get a chance to go into the post 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.890
 we see that I am leaving out a bit 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.340
 and that is very useful 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.860
 because look here on the bark put the little brown spots 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.630
 and those are sleeping beats 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.470
 That is the start of the new tasks that must come out 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.470
 after the branches have been sawn off, it is all no longer going up 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 but ends up with those buttons and the young willows come out 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.830
 they were very smooth 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.450
 we no longer have a young crack but only lots of bark but such a bud 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.850
 has to come true and that is difficult every year it gets more and more difficult 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.960
 after a while it doesn't work anymore 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.710
 In addition, if I did not cut so tightly then you will get much more trouble in the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.840
 lotto and fungi in the bud and it also breaks down 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.680
 so just by leaving a baton 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.270
 well your best 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.950
 normally this excuse is the circle of a thud 11 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.980
 once every three years every three years 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.170
 whether the plot wants to be in worse condition than this or we are such a boy 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.540
 then you do it more often 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.550
 keep it in mind as well very fast 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.380
 every year one and a half meters of suits arrive, so to three years is the fourth 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.380
 passed away 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.060
 good tools half the job 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.860
 and just a little saw like this 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.470
 with such a fine dot you can easily get between all those narrow suits and then you can 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 You work much easier with such a large broad brace case 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.580
 by not there at the chainsaw 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.840
 when the chainsaw then you tend to be very close indeed 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.040
 stand as if someone was shaving 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.999
 yes then it doesn't get any nicer 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.009
 pollard willows used to be important 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.149
 and there 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:13.209
 iberia that a targa is growing 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.289
 it has a different name 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:17.739
 so next year after he is beaten 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.569
 are all the branches on it 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.549
 those are willow toes 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.829
 the following year they get a little thicker that is called beanstalks 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.829
 and the latter holds when it gets really thick it is called farmer's wood 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.019
 for posts or other matters
