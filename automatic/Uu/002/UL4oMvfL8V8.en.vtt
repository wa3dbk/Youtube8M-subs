00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.830
 that sad as many people when the 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.460
 probably not seen movies 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.679
 but at the same time have very very 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.910
 many people on the basis of this only the 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.980
 seen movies you have I 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.879
 Again, yes, he must have been so horny 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.650
 his what then the movies to see 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.910
 and the passion to discover yes im 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.290
 january back to the future 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.610
 there are so many parallel ones 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.100
 and I have not synonymous before the movies 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.739
 seen 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.090
 was quite impressed what sir 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.149
 you can really see on the legs 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.890
 put and live in minecraft and be 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.180
 but see for yourself I have scenes 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.190
 edited together 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.400
 they are almost the same one to one 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.400
 are 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.340
 I start with the most obvious 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.100
 that is of course the delorean which one 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.120
 he miner together with dlg in the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.120
 past has traveled 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:53.440
 that is that mister miner here 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.930
 what is that this is the short version 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.220
 that's a time machine and I'm through 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.040
 the time traveled actually come from 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.380
 the year 2015 and I am through one 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.090
 unfortunate coincidence here in your time 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.370
 Traveled is quite plausible we 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.330
 have you traveled the time 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.310
 obviously 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.680
 you just see marty mcfly the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.930
 Delorean with the camera is filming me 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.150
 very reminiscent of the music which 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.660
 Mr. Bergmann and Stoxx on there with him 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.660
 rumschleppen 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.450
 the camera with it we will be you 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.830
 hold everything 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:39.120
 I go to palettes now and now 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.120
 Take a look at the camera and now 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:54.069
 again very briefly 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:07.780
 Do not be scared of everything 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:10.209
 then be careful in this 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.980
 small construction where you see the 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 was quickly fitted compensatory 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.209
 was placed 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.980
 to get the worthy energy together 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.750
 to travel back by car 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.329
 and usually you do that over 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.730
 plutonium but flood young tells him 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.319
 probably nothing absolutely nothing 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.690
 I just have to match some 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.849
 Finding away enough electricity to generate 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.919
 can or enough energy around 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.739
 Incidentally, you also have them here in the film 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.329
 because even in 1955 I format in 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.840
 do not simply raise the plutonium 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.840
 the street 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.390
 the soul with the clown then remembers 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.100
 pay attention to the cow 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.660
 I do not know if that was a coincidence or 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.799
 wanted but if it really wanted 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.370
 it was really cool 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:27.770
 she happened everything is still normal 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:32.540
 I think so, I have to go now 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.800
 you have to break something 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.800
 now pay attention to the music 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:15.240
 and then of course the big finale 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:15.240
 With Herr Bergmann, that too is the substance 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.300
 hey 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.300
 he damned 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.310
 the capital bond 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.070
 God 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.730
 crap 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.730
 success 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.160
 and finally the music the taxi 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.740
 set in the episode as the lord 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.670
 Bergmanns cellar is clearly what the 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:20.440
 music from back to the future is that 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:20.440
 few you hear that you hear that 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:28.610
 but he would not 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.830
 never hope you had one 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.360
 a little fun and really does you 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.310
 please have a look at the movie 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.670
 make is a bit old 1985 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.350
 but still very good is not enough 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.950
 I have made it only after ums 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.060
 Life 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:47.200
 and together hanging inside all 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.200
 really fun to look at
