outs of this got your input right here

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.889 
outs of this got your input right here
actually<00:01:24.399> probably<00:01:24.939> easier<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.509> look<00:01:25.600> at<00:01:25.749> this

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
actually probably easier to look at this

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.219 
actually probably easier to look at this
way<00:01:26.109> input<00:01:26.829> over<00:01:27.009> here<00:01:27.570> got<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.600> direct<00:01:29.020> out

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
way input over here got a direct out

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.639 
way input over here got a direct out
which<00:01:29.530> would<00:01:29.799> be<00:01:30.039> just<00:01:30.969> the<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:32.320> unaffected

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
which would be just the the unaffected

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.270 
which would be just the the unaffected
signal<00:01:33.070> we<00:01:33.490> also<00:01:33.640> have<00:01:33.999> the<00:01:34.799> echo<00:01:35.799> out<00:01:35.979> which

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
signal we also have the echo out which

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.910 
signal we also have the echo out which
is<00:01:36.310> just<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.560> delayed<00:01:40.319> the<00:01:41.319> light<00:01:41.499> output<00:01:41.710> and

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
is just the delayed the light output and

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.059 
is just the delayed the light output and
we<00:01:42.039> can<00:01:42.159> actually<00:01:42.340> control<00:01:42.759> that<00:01:42.999> with<00:01:43.689> our

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
we can actually control that with our

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.999 
we can actually control that with our
blend<00:01:45.069> knob<00:01:46.229> also<00:01:47.229> have<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.380> bypass<00:01:47.740> which

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
blend knob also have the bypass which

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.260 
blend knob also have the bypass which
the<00:01:48.819> true<00:01:49.030> bypass<00:01:49.450> on<00:01:49.840> back<00:01:50.740> here<00:01:50.979> is<00:01:51.159> where<00:01:52.030> we

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
the true bypass on back here is where we

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.730 
the true bypass on back here is where we
plug<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:52.810> our<00:01:54.329> adapter<00:01:55.329> so<00:01:56.229> that's<00:01:56.469> the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
plug in our adapter so that's the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.859 
plug in our adapter so that's the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.930 

alright<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:29.220> can<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.550> there's<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> power

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
alright as you can see there's a power

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.509 
alright as you can see there's a power
switch<00:02:30.209> for<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> pedal<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.650> actually<00:02:32.129> turn<00:02:32.310> on

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
switch for the pedal to actually turn on

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.839 
switch for the pedal to actually turn on
this<00:02:32.819> needs<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.269> over<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:36.150> right<00:02:37.849> all

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
this needs to be over to the right all

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.270 
this needs to be over to the right all
right<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> pedal<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.360> active

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.830 

so<00:02:46.280> we<00:02:46.370> do<00:02:46.520> have<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.700> good<00:02:47.060> amount<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.390> delay<00:02:47.510> as

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
so we do have a good amount of delay as

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.979 
so we do have a good amount of delay as
you<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.739> see<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:48.920> here<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.940> knobs<00:02:50.540> are<00:02:50.840> all

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
you can see on here the knobs are all

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.000 
you can see on here the knobs are all
actually<00:02:51.590> somewhere<00:02:52.069> between<00:02:53.020> 10<00:02:54.020> or<00:02:54.170> 9<00:02:54.650> or

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
actually somewhere between 10 or 9 or

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.280 
actually somewhere between 10 or 9 or
I'm<00:02:55.280> sorry<00:02:55.520> ten<00:02:55.760> or<00:02:55.880> eleven<00:02:56.209> o'clock<00:02:56.300> on<00:02:56.750> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
I'm sorry ten or eleven o'clock on the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.140 
I'm sorry ten or eleven o'clock on the
dial<00:02:57.530> that's<00:02:57.980> because<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.430> low<00:02:58.610> end<00:02:58.849> is

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
dial that's because the low end is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.330 
dial that's because the low end is
actually<00:02:59.660> these<00:03:00.470> knobs<00:03:00.739> are<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.950> little<00:03:01.130> a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
actually these knobs are a little a

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.580 
actually these knobs are a little a
little<00:03:01.670> weird<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.150> way<00:03:02.440> let's<00:03:03.440> check

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
little weird in that way let's check

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.800 
little weird in that way let's check
that<00:03:03.650> out<00:03:03.800> with<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.190> blend<00:03:04.430> Tom<00:03:04.700> if<00:03:04.940> we<00:03:05.630> turn

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
that out with the blend Tom if we turn

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.420 
that out with the blend Tom if we turn
it<00:03:05.930> all<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.050> way<00:03:06.170> down<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:07.040> can<00:03:07.190> see<00:03:07.310> it's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
it all the way down you can see it's

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.000 
it all the way down you can see it's
actually<00:03:07.790> turned<00:03:08.690> in<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.290> direction<00:03:09.560> and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
actually turned in this direction and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.949 
actually turned in this direction and
we're<00:03:11.000> not<00:03:11.120> going<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.300> get<00:03:11.450> any<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.780> fecht

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
we're not going to get any of the fecht

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.680 
we're not going to get any of the fecht
at<00:03:12.080> all

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
at all

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.390 
at all
we<00:03:14.260> turn<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.590> all<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.710> way<00:03:14.860> up<00:03:15.070> we're<00:03:15.220> going<00:03:15.310> to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
we turn it all the way up we're going to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.680 
we turn it all the way up we're going to
get<00:03:15.490> nothing<00:03:16.120> but<00:03:16.840> effect<00:03:20.460> all<00:03:21.460> right<00:03:21.640> i<00:03:21.880> think

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
get nothing but effect all right i think

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.970 
get nothing but effect all right i think
around<00:03:22.960> here<00:03:23.470> would<00:03:23.650> be<00:03:23.860> good<00:03:24.460> spot<00:03:24.790> for<00:03:24.820> it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
around here would be good spot for it

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.700 
around here would be good spot for it
okay<00:03:27.300> next<00:03:28.300> knob<00:03:28.600> down<00:03:28.810> we<00:03:28.990> got<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.230> feedback

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
okay next knob down we got the feedback

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.620 
okay next knob down we got the feedback
knob<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.670> can<00:03:30.790> turn<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.030> down<00:03:31.180> all<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.510> way

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
knob you can turn it down all the way

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.980 
knob you can turn it down all the way
we'll<00:03:31.870> just<00:03:31.900> get<00:03:32.200> one<00:03:32.440> echo<00:03:33.750> turn<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.870> all<00:03:34.960> the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
we'll just get one echo turn it all the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.070 
we'll just get one echo turn it all the
way<00:03:35.170> up<00:03:35.470> let's<00:03:36.400> see<00:03:36.490> what<00:03:36.610> happens<00:03:39.870> alright<00:03:40.870> so

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
way up let's see what happens alright so

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.950 
way up let's see what happens alright so
basically<00:03:41.830> it<00:03:42.160> just<00:03:42.750> keeps<00:03:43.750> on<00:03:43.840> getting

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
basically it just keeps on getting

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.570 
basically it just keeps on getting
louder<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:44.500> louder<00:03:44.620> it's<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.370> positive

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
louder and louder it's it's a positive

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.660 
louder and louder it's it's a positive
feedback<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.930> over<00:03:47.800> here<00:03:47.830> we<00:03:48.100> have<00:03:48.130> our<00:03:48.340> delay

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
feedback and over here we have our delay

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.090 
feedback and over here we have our delay
time<00:03:48.940> we<00:03:49.420> can<00:03:49.570> keep<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.960> low<00:03:52.740> turn<00:03:53.740> up<00:03:53.860> just<00:03:54.070> a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
time we can keep that low turn up just a

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.520 
time we can keep that low turn up just a
little<00:03:54.190> bit<00:03:57.240> there<00:03:58.240> we<00:03:58.330> go<00:03:58.480> sounding<00:03:59.410> here

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
little bit there we go sounding here

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.300 
little bit there we go sounding here
sort<00:03:59.800> of<00:03:59.860> an<00:03:59.980> early<00:04:00.220> reflection<00:04:00.670> reverb<00:04:02.310> and

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
sort of an early reflection reverb and

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.920 
sort of an early reflection reverb and
if<00:04:03.490> we<00:04:03.580> turn<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.850> all<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.000> way<00:04:04.120> up<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:07.690> get<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
if we turn it all the way up we get the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.420 
if we turn it all the way up we get the
longest<00:04:08.290> reverb<00:04:08.590> does<00:04:08.770> this<00:04:08.920> public<00:04:09.190> an<00:04:09.280> offer

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
longest reverb does this public an offer

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.890 
longest reverb does this public an offer
not<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.300> longest<00:04:10.660> river<00:04:11.050> but<00:04:11.790> still<00:04:12.810> it's<00:04:13.810> a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
not the longest river but still it's a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.660 
not the longest river but still it's a
good<00:04:14.050> amount<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.410> delay<00:04:14.590> fferent<00:04:15.040> for<00:04:15.370> an

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
good amount of delay fferent for an

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.610 
good amount of delay fferent for an
analog<00:04:16.060> delay<00:04:17.310> over<00:04:18.310> here<00:04:18.430> we<00:04:18.520> got<00:04:18.609> our<00:04:18.970> level

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
analog delay over here we got our level

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.870 
analog delay over here we got our level
knob<00:04:20.620> that's<00:04:20.980> I'm<00:04:21.130> going<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.310> keep<00:04:21.459> that<00:04:21.609> there

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
knob that's I'm going to keep that there

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.850 
knob that's I'm going to keep that there
because<00:04:22.180> just<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.870> compensate<00:04:23.410> for<00:04:23.560> any<00:04:23.620> loss

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
because just to compensate for any loss

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.880 
because just to compensate for any loss
and<00:04:24.130> level<00:04:24.400> we<00:04:24.490> get<00:04:24.640> and<00:04:25.140> down<00:04:26.140> here<00:04:26.380> here's

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
and level we get and down here here's

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.030 
and level we get and down here here's
the<00:04:26.980> difference<00:04:27.100> between<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.960> delay<00:04:29.740> pedal

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
the difference between this delay pedal

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.040 
the difference between this delay pedal
and<00:04:30.130> other<00:04:30.220> tool<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.430> pedals<00:04:30.730> we<00:04:31.210> get<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.570> chorus

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
and other tool I pedals we get a chorus

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.820 
and other tool I pedals we get a chorus
vibrato<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:33.250> knob<00:04:33.900> right<00:04:34.900> now<00:04:35.169> at<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.620> top<00:04:35.770> of

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
vibrato a knob right now at the top of

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.500 
vibrato a knob right now at the top of
the<00:04:36.040> pedal<00:04:36.310> we<00:04:37.300> got<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:38.380> switch<00:04:38.650> set<00:04:39.160> to

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
the pedal we got the switch set to

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.730 
the pedal we got the switch set to
vibrato<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:40.900> there's<00:04:41.110> two<00:04:41.290> different<00:04:41.470> modes

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
vibrato so there's two different modes

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.409 
vibrato so there's two different modes
on<00:04:41.980> here<00:04:42.190> we<00:04:42.310> can<00:04:42.460> switch<00:04:42.669> at<00:04:42.790> to<00:04:42.940> chorus<00:04:43.240> or

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
on here we can switch at to chorus or

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.810 
on here we can switch at to chorus or
vibrato<00:04:43.720> right<00:04:43.990> now<00:04:44.110> it's<00:04:44.260> on<00:04:44.350> vibrato<00:04:44.830> if<00:04:45.310> we

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
vibrato right now it's on vibrato if we

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.850 
vibrato right now it's on vibrato if we
turn<00:04:46.090> up<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.360> knob<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.570> little<00:04:46.900> bit<00:04:47.080> i'm<00:04:47.740> going

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
turn up the knob a little bit i'm going

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.300 
turn up the knob a little bit i'm going
to<00:04:47.919> start<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.310> hear<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.290> delay<00:04:50.650> is<00:04:50.950> going

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
to start to hear that the delay is going

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.100 
to start to hear that the delay is going
to<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.520> going<00:04:51.640> to<00:04:51.850> start<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.450> sort<00:04:52.780> of<00:04:52.870> a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
to is going to start to sort of a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.390 
to is going to start to sort of a
changing<00:04:53.800> pitch<00:04:55.919> end<00:04:56.919> up<00:04:57.100> some<00:04:57.310> more<00:04:59.310> so<00:05:00.310> we're

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
changing pitch end up some more so we're

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.890 
changing pitch end up some more so we're
getting<00:05:00.550> some<00:05:00.669> modulation<00:05:01.180> effect<00:05:01.660> on<00:05:01.840> there

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
getting some modulation effect on there

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.300 
getting some modulation effect on there
and<00:05:04.900> all<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:05.950> way<00:05:06.130> up

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.469 

we<00:05:11.310> turned<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.669> blend<00:05:11.879> knob<00:05:12.030> that<00:05:12.210> will<00:05:12.330> be<00:05:12.419> at

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
we turned the blend knob that will be at

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:21.260 
we turned the blend knob that will be at
least<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:12.810> little<00:05:12.930> easier<00:05:13.319> to<00:05:13.469> hear<00:05:20.150> all<00:05:21.150> right

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
least a little easier to hear all right

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.459 
least a little easier to hear all right
let's<00:05:21.449> check<00:05:21.689> out<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:22.639> chorus<00:05:23.639> mode<00:05:24.469> switch

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
let's check out the chorus mode switch

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.779 
let's check out the chorus mode switch
the<00:05:26.340> mode<00:05:26.689> switch<00:05:27.689> up<00:05:27.930> there<00:05:28.199> and<00:05:28.610> so<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.729> is

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
the mode switch up there and so this is

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:38.439 
the mode switch up there and so this is
with<00:05:29.999> nothing<00:05:31.909> and<00:05:32.909> a<00:05:33.689> little<00:05:33.960> bit<00:05:34.080> of<00:05:34.110> chorus

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.220 

and<00:05:39.449> a<00:05:39.539> bit<00:05:39.719> more

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.290 

all<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.220> way<00:05:44.340> up

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.739 

so<00:05:49.300> it's<00:05:49.539> sort<00:05:49.749> of<00:05:49.899> both<00:05:50.589> of<00:05:50.619> them<00:05:50.889> are<00:05:50.979> kind<00:05:51.219> of

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:51.749 
so it's sort of both of them are kind of

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:55.559 
so it's sort of both of them are kind of
changing<00:05:52.749> the<00:05:52.779> pitch<00:05:52.990> of<00:05:53.199> the<00:05:53.379> delays<00:05:54.209> but<00:05:55.209> the

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
changing the pitch of the delays but the

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.589 
changing the pitch of the delays but the
vibrato<00:05:56.110> is<00:05:56.289> doing<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:56.889> in<00:05:57.039> a<00:05:57.490> way<00:05:57.520> more<00:05:58.270> more

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
vibrato is doing it in a way more more

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.059 
vibrato is doing it in a way more more
like<00:05:58.719> a<00:05:58.749> pitch<00:05:58.929> bend<00:05:59.169> in<00:05:59.259> a<00:05:59.379> bit<00:05:59.529> faster

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
like a pitch bend in a bit faster

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.369 
like a pitch bend in a bit faster
actually<00:06:00.279> the<00:06:00.789> chorus<00:06:01.089> is<00:06:01.209> slower<00:06:01.599> going<00:06:02.319> to

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
actually the chorus is slower going to

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.100 
actually the chorus is slower going to
give<00:06:02.499> you<00:06:02.619> more<00:06:02.919> of<00:06:03.129> a<00:06:03.360> in<00:06:04.360> effect<00:06:04.779> where<00:06:04.990> it

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
give you more of a in effect where it

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.299 
give you more of a in effect where it
sounds<00:06:05.439> like<00:06:05.529> there's<00:06:05.740> more<00:06:05.949> guitars

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:06.309 
sounds like there's more guitars

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:10.019 
sounds like there's more guitars
happening<00:06:07.209> so<00:06:07.749> that's<00:06:07.959> the<00:06:08.729> deluxe<00:06:09.729> memory

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:10.029 
happening so that's the deluxe memory

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:11.790 
happening so that's the deluxe memory
