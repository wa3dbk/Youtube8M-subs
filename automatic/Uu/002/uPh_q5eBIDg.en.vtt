 but this still gives me and indeed 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.699
 can be the history to 1367 to 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.979

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.590
 elements whether now the old roof beams 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:53.450
 the 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.180

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.880
 long legs or that the old one 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.150

 Everyone should load something special 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.310
 could be tried among other things 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:15.590

 an action area where we go to 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.850
 for example, if you are a Munich artist 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.950
 offer artists a platform around themselves 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.259
