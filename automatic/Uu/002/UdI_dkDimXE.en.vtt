00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.889
 then this is a mold of the shin guard 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.810
 jana 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.559
 He has this wine color as soon as he goes. 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:19.340
 stay on the side and that tip will be fine 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:26.630
 in the middle and this is now going to pass predicts 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:29.110
 to you see here you see it is just 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.110
 cut 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:57.159
 so here are the two molds already cut 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:03.079
 this is the one here 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:06.080
 now I'm going to do even though they'll get the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.840
 you did and will draw 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:15.560
 the details that will vote for him then 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:19.970
 need a year so there is a 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.570
 what 's up and down here 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.510
 it is difficult to record sample design 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.470
 so those are the details that go there and 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:34.520
 Leonel is just this business here and this one. 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.320
 Above a pebble of doha now you 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.070
 will cut here study pass predict 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.700
 records the details that I have already 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.700
 knows 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:59.770
 I passed the details of pen no 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.820
 I do in scales in accra 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.630
 then the details already told that being 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:15.200
 cut is now that I'm going to do 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:18.319
 catch promised me is okay okay okay I 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.570
 I'll take my policy and roll tea. 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:26.860
 all this edge and it will be half 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.860
 rounded cob 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:40.760
 So, who are you going to do this step? 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:44.800
 rent're using cap uses mask uses 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.110
 glasses or anything that has a burka wears 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.239
 To put on my game, I even forgot that. 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.239
 that makes a lot of dirt a lot 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.549
 I already closed one here for you to see. 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.950
 difference in itabi has sanded 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:20.019
 rounded and everything else and another is alone 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:23.530
 sliced bitch who gave birth 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:29.189
 so already litters 4 took half an hour more 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.189
 or less and now I'll leave it from here 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:41.169
 just to squeeze this is fast 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.909
 52 minutes and sandpaper because how is she going? 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.230
 being large is much easier than 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.230
 find those next few minutes 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:55.989
 You are not past is very fast of the 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:04:05.680
 details here on the fire just for him to close 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:08.260
 pores hunger careful not to tinker 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.090
 long time did not run because it goes to 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.729
 tva 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.690
 then you burn everything 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:24.820
 the equipment will look pretty good will 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:26.940
 to look good and see the details 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.940
 also 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.850
 so I've already reaped the details and 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:44.039
 stayed like this 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.039
 Now we're going to warm up to model. 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.889
 then to model the event has several 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.539
 shapes 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.400
 I prefer to use the iron. 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.289
 because I think it says that the party 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:05:01.960
 What I'm going to do, I'll get one. 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:06.940
 cloth in a sun to put is to see here 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.130
 Then I'll cover him and I'll pass the 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.110
 iron on him is not to do this 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.680
 now because I've already told them to 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.820
 filming can not pass the iron director 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:22.510
 nine years will not burn glue pass 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.650
 white with water 6 medium to power 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:49.900
 to mobilize before we paint glue 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:54.479
 white water and that's the zipper I go 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.479
 use to hold and I saw back 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.849
 only happens you can not paste 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.320
 tissue directly into the vein so what 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:08.710
 We're going to make people go and get a 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:11.050
 already thinner will sew here and thence 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.470
 paste and if it comes thinner in this one 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.470
 behind 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.810
 Now you put on the zipper, just paint. 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.200
 So I've already finished with him. 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.670
 another is getting and now just paste the 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.670
 pebble here from the side 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.300
 That's it, I did not film or do a 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.000
 because it has several forms of 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.580
 make a mold many many shapes 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.290
 each one has made a way for example 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.300
 I would pass paper 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.940
 my leg and cover it with tape 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.130
 crepe make the design and after taking 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.470
 he continued and made a mold 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.150
 It just ended in the fifth crepe so I 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.340
 I played a game of 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.230
 can do the mold this here then 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.840
 Could not film but if you give a 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.300
 about how to make the mold 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.900
 will probably find several ways 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.410
 so you do not need to talk about it 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.720
 this video because it 's a faster video 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:36.260
 I just wanted to explain the basics 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.270
 the very fast steps for you both 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:42.320
 for those who do not know how to do so much for whom 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:45.370
 Are you curious just to know then this is it? 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.370
 Thank you for watching.
