over<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:40.680> could<00:01:40.799> say<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.040> me<00:01:41.250> with

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
over the you could say that's me with

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.310

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.510 
light there's a huge mirror right there
which<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.770> guess<00:01:43.890> makes<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.159> look<00:01:44.280> bigger<00:01:44.310> but

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
which I guess makes it look bigger but

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.950 
which I guess makes it look bigger but
it's<00:01:45.329> actually<00:01:45.420> pretty<00:01:45.720> sizable<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.430> I'm

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
it's actually pretty sizable so if I'm

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.330 
it's actually pretty sizable so if I'm
and<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.439> big<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:50.040> definitely

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
and it's it's big it's definitely

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.380 
and it's it's big it's definitely
picking<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> last<00:01:50.729> place<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.180> put<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
picking the last place so if I put the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.719 
picking the last place so if I put the
couch<00:01:51.570> over<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.130> TV<00:01:53.340> over<00:01:53.610> there

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
couch over here and the TV over there

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.539 
couch over here and the TV over there
it's<00:01:54.149> actually<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.659> far<00:01:54.930> apart<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
it's actually really far apart so it's a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.889 
it's actually really far apart so it's a
lot<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.700> space<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.240> lot<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.509> space<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
lot of space a lot more space and I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.139 
lot of space a lot more space and I
thought<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.350> yeah<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.280> anyway<00:01:59.520> hardwood

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
thought and yeah so anyway hardwood

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.209 
thought and yeah so anyway hardwood
everywhere<00:02:00.240> else<00:02:00.799> there's<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> front<00:02:02.070> door

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
everywhere else there's the front door

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.090 
everywhere else there's the front door
but<00:02:03.060> yeah<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.869> again<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
but yeah you can see again it's that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.300 
but yeah you can see again it's that
really<00:02:05.369> weird<00:02:05.930> shape<00:02:06.930> where<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.890> gets<00:02:08.069> bigger

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
really weird shape where it gets bigger
