00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello again, the voice from the box is with you again 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.790
 under the umbrella of sayings better late than 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.660
 never 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.660
 I present you an overview of gta robberies 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.660
 online 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.730
 The first about robberies we were told in 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.740
 special gameplay video 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.680
 dedicated to multiple and one of the living 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.140
 this trailer came out again in about 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.300
 a couple of months before the release of the game to us then 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.600
 Immediately said that the robbery will have 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.420
 wait a bit and we waited waited waited 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.760
 we are a whole year and a half now 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.040
 look god we waited 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.989
 the first thing you need to know about the robbery 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.210
 if for some reason absent 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.339
 on this planet last year is what 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.770
 they are cooperative and for their passage 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.320
 need a cohesive team of four 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.080
 man and it is important that none of them 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.229
 was daun otherwise nothing will come of it 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.550
 there is a big problem of absence 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.160
 accomplices because if you like 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.950
 I have no friends and especially those who have 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.800
 there is a suitable platform and even so 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.259
 more than those who have gta 5 and generally still 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.720
 the much more free time 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.210
 coinciding with your principle 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.350
 lucky but you need people like that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.630
 three copies 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.670
 so even get together for the passage 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.890
 robberies for someone can be very 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.560
 hard to play with random players 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.080
 just doesn't make sense they leave after 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.740
 1 1 map and you have to assemble a team 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.740
 don't even try again don't try 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.010
 but it's certainly not scary, I think not 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.410
 need to tell what's right 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.510
 gameplay difficulty win always on 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.490
 favor and when you take off face 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.100
 well-coordinated team she makes gameplay 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.780
 much more interesting when you do not pass 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.209
 at some point you turn on 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.740
 collective thinking everyone starts 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.930
 suggest any ideas 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.209
 you start to use them in the game and you 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.830
 it starts to get this beautiful 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.170
 feeling but not worth overdoing 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.970
 because four heads are capable 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.760
 come up with and cheat way anything 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.070
 pass and it already kills interest in the game 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.230
 although it is worth thinking about people who 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.330
 nature did not give a direct hand for 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.700
 these people themselves rockstar presented 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.300
 assistant bulletproof car 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.940
 kuruma 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.770
 which divides the difficulty of passing 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.320
 robberies roughly in half and spoil 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.360
 thus all the shooting in the game because 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.370
 that you can just come to the right place 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.580
 you place in four on this tank and 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.200
 just shoot everyone and juices yes but 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.840
 better to do everything as planned 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.850
 initially each operation duties 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.580
 divided among players so that they 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.459
 simultaneously played different roles it gives 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.580
 10 points plus atmosphere and immersion 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.170
 the game is one of the easiest options 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.390
 the mission is to kidnap 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.489
 prisoner from jail two of you 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.220
 dress up in jailers one 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.170
 the prisoner and the other in his guard these 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.450
 two sit in a prison bus which 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.060
 you already hijacked in the preparatory mission 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.670
 and go to jail penetrates her under 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.560
 shelter and begin to knead there two 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.110
 your other accomplices at this time 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.760
 getting ready to take you from the air one 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.739
 takes the plane on which you are all 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.170
 own fly and the second takes 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.660
 military helicopter to protect the aircraft 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.610
 from any KGB men after 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.470
 ground group turn prison 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.180
 security guards in the decoration elements 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.220
 they sit down with recently 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.440
 announced ex-convicts 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.430
 armored car and go to the nearest airport 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.790
 where is the plane waiting for them 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.400
 ingeniously like about macaroni and 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.620
 most of these missions are underway that 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.959
 concerns the diversity of all these assignments 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.030
 thats all about as in singleplayer 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.669
 there is of course both a chase and 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.709
 shootouts as well as sophisticated stealth and 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.770
 all sorts of surveillance missions 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.930
 mini-games and so on and between tasks 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.970
 when you wait for a call organizer like 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.310
 the rule is best to roll into the store 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.520
 to buy m m benson and grenades 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.470
 a single player also resembles storylines. 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.039
 screensaver featuring fact you 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.770
 four 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.139
 and your employer is most pleased 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.389
 Naturally trevor which absolutely not 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.389
 I changed over half of the year 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.170
 Ukraine 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.569
 In general, this mode 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.330
 represents with you a whole separate 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.430
 play on my internal stopwatch on 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.190
 the passage of all these missions is gone 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.960
 approximately 25 hours and despite the fact that we 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.270
 played on medium difficulty 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.520
 the game was not easy but at the same time 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.409
 tightly we never got stuck 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.389
 if you take all this into account a 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.639
 also the fact that this can be said 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.860
 they gave us a separate game 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.590
 free in the appendage and so one of 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.219
 best games in history it makes her still 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.310
 so much better that 10 points to gta 5 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.530
 already somehow not enough and a bonus I will say that 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.780
 at least the game will be quite soon 2 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.900
 years there is still a very big chance 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.819
 see the plot addition to play on 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.039
 it is repeatedly hinted actor 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.139
 voiced by franklin and there is a big 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.050
 the probability that this dlc will be 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.449
 be present great cj then 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.090
 us and there will be a reason to talk again about 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.159
