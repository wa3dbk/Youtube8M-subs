fair so reminder this is not about the
form<00:02:14.500> because<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.430> not<00:02:15.610> going<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.849> look<00:02:15.970> very

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
form because it's not going to look very

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.710 
form because it's not going to look very
pretty<00:02:16.420> with<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.750> resistance<00:02:17.140> bands<00:02:17.560> on<00:02:17.849> okay

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.350 

but<00:02:22.720> your<00:02:22.840> legs<00:02:22.989> together<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:25.090> want<00:02:25.330> to

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
but your legs together we want to

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.990 
but your legs together we want to
control<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.980> you're<00:02:27.220> under<00:02:27.519> control

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
control it so that you're under control

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.089 
control it so that you're under control
and<00:02:28.299> that<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.750> bands<00:02:29.110> aren't<00:02:29.500> controlling

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
and that the bands aren't controlling

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:52.400 
and that the bands aren't controlling
you<00:02:30.340> they<00:02:30.519> are<00:02:30.700> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.030> resist<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:45.510> okay

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.199 

it's<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.560> lot<00:02:53.769> easier<00:02:54.010> going<00:02:54.400> back<00:02:54.670> up<00:02:54.849> into<00:02:55.030> it

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
it's a lot easier going back up into it

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.199 
it's a lot easier going back up into it
your<00:02:55.900> momentum<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.980> million<00:02:57.880> times<00:02:58.060> better

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
your momentum is a million times better

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.720 
your momentum is a million times better
it's<00:02:58.480> just<00:02:58.630> oh<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.709> workout<00:03:00.010> but<00:03:00.700> you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
it's just oh it's a workout but you

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.410 
it's just oh it's a workout but you
definitely<00:03:01.239> feel<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.600> effect<00:03:01.930> immediately
