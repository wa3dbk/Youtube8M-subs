00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.010 
so select your shattered pattern and
from<00:02:53.040> here<00:02:53.370> go<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> place<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.630> various

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
from here go to place it in various

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.800 
from here go to place it in various
areas<00:02:55.440> throughout<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.770> knife<00:02:56.240> now<00:02:57.240> continue

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
areas throughout the knife now continue

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.480 
areas throughout the knife now continue
to<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:58.410> multiple<00:02:58.590> layers<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
to do this with multiple layers of the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.370 
to do this with multiple layers of the
shattered<00:03:00.120> glass<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.420> as<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.900> guys<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.320> see

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
shattered glass and as you guys can see

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.930 
shattered glass and as you guys can see
I'm<00:03:01.770> making<00:03:02.100> them<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.370> bright<00:03:02.700> green<00:03:02.820> color

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
I'm making them a bright green color

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.090 
I'm making them a bright green color
just<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.630> can<00:03:03.690> see<00:03:04.020> them<00:03:04.200> better<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.620> just

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
just so I can see them better and just

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.560 
just so I can see them better and just
so<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.400> line<00:03:05.610> up<00:03:05.640> all<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> shattered

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
so I can line up all of the shattered

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.720 
so I can line up all of the shattered
pieces<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.990> glass<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.650> form<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.070> somewhat<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.640> a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
pieces of glass to form a somewhat of a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.030 
pieces of glass to form a somewhat of a
web<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:09.570> doing<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:09.960> kind<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.320> fast<00:03:10.590> just
