00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
can look sideways with these site

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.630 
can look sideways with these site
imaging<00:00:58.140> units<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.770> enabled<00:00:58.949> us<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> do

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
imaging units and it's enabled us to do

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.520 
imaging units and it's enabled us to do
so<00:00:59.910> many<00:01:00.090> other<00:01:00.270> things<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:01.050> look<00:01:01.350> out

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so many other things I can look out

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.709 
so many other things I can look out
there<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.309> fish<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.510> know

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.510 
that I've got to go 50 feet that way or
50<00:01:06.150> feet<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.570> way<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.100> anywhere

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I got to get wherever those fish are I

I got to get wherever those fish are I
can<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> him<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.430> there's<00:01:11.610> something

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
can get to him but there's something

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
can get to him but there's something
that<00:01:12.119> I've<00:01:12.240> always<00:01:12.510> wished<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.170> had<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.830> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that I've always wished I had and that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.310 
that I've always wished I had and that
was<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> ability<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.000> look<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.869> front<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
was the ability to look out in front of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800 
was the ability to look out in front of
me<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.220> would<00:01:17.280> know<00:01:17.549> two<00:01:17.610> things<00:01:18.030> one

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
me so that I would know two things one

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.990 
me so that I would know two things one
are<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:19.500> fish<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:19.860> there<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.580> two<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
are there fish out there but two and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.270 
are there fish out there but two and
maybe<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.780> importantly<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
maybe just as importantly what is the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.710 
maybe just as importantly what is the
structure<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.060> front<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.270> me<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
structure out in front of me because you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.660 
structure out in front of me because you
take<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> day<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> today<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.250> here's<00:01:26.460> what's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
take a day like today and here's what's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.760 
take a day like today and here's what's
happening<00:01:27.150> these<00:01:27.630> fish<00:01:27.960> are<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.409> laying

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
happening these fish are all laying

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.010 
happening these fish are all laying
right<00:01:29.070> next<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> scattered<00:01:30.150> boulders<00:01:30.689> I've

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
right next to scattered boulders I've

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260 
right next to scattered boulders I've
got<00:01:31.350> boulders<00:01:31.799> scattered<00:01:32.009> all<00:01:32.460> over<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:33.090> my

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
got boulders scattered all over now my

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.270 
got boulders scattered all over now my
graph<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.439> using<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.799> standard

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
graph if I was just using the standard

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.460 
graph if I was just using the standard
sonar<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.060> would<00:01:36.240> show<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> bump<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.079> bottom

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
sonar it would show a bump in the bottom

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.749 
sonar it would show a bump in the bottom
but<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.979> wouldn't<00:01:38.189> tell<00:01:38.340> me<00:01:38.430> what's<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.729> in

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
but it wouldn't tell me what's out in

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
but it wouldn't tell me what's out in
front<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.119> me<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:39.720> trying<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.290> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
front of me and what I'm trying to do is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.310 
front of me and what I'm trying to do is
stay<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.460> toward<00:01:41.790> those<00:01:41.970> areas<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.659> have

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
stay going toward those areas that have

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.139 
stay going toward those areas that have
that<00:01:43.530> stuff<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.579> I'd<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that stuff so what I'd have to do is

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.730 
that stuff so what I'd have to do is
driver<00:01:45.390> I'll<00:01:45.630> mark<00:01:45.930> all<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.079> spots<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.649> then

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
driver I'll mark all the spots and then

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.230 
driver I'll mark all the spots and then
drive<00:01:46.950> back<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.250> them<00:01:47.399> well<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> don't<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
drive back to them well I don't have to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.609 
drive back to them well I don't have to
do<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.509> anymore<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.869> here's<00:01:49.140> why

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
do that anymore and here's why

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.880 
do that anymore and here's why
360<00:01:50.579> sonar<00:01:51.000> from<00:01:51.180> hummingbird<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.290> thing<00:01:52.649> is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
360 sonar from hummingbird this thing is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.010 
360 sonar from hummingbird this thing is
right<00:01:53.220> now<00:01:53.250> looking<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.299> front<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> boat<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
right now looking in front of the boat I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.050 
right now looking in front of the boat I
can<00:01:55.470> look<00:01:55.649> up<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.130> side<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.579> side<00:01:56.820> or

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
can look up to that side that side or

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.959 
can look up to that side that side or
back<00:01:57.570> behind<00:01:57.780> me<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.740> see<00:01:59.130> two<00:01:59.340> things<00:01:59.640> and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
back behind me I can see two things and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.510 
back behind me I can see two things and
it's<00:02:00.119> very<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.719> very<00:02:00.930> important<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:02.280> see

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it's very very very important I can see

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.130 
it's very very very important I can see
the<00:02:02.729> structure<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.390> holding<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> fish

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the structure that's holding the fish

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
the structure that's holding the fish
today<00:02:04.380> whenever<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.159> see<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> scattered<00:02:06.119> rocks

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
today whenever I see the scattered rocks

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.180 
today whenever I see the scattered rocks
that<00:02:06.840> I've<00:02:06.930> got<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.380> over<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.740> screen<00:02:07.979> right

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that I've got all over the screen right

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.550 
that I've got all over the screen right
now<00:02:08.220> out<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:09.000> front<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.330> me<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.959> toward<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
now out in front of me I go toward the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.350 
now out in front of me I go toward the
areas<00:02:10.950> where<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.489> more<00:02:11.670> concentrated

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
areas where it's more concentrated

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.760 
areas where it's more concentrated
because<00:02:12.480> there's<00:02:12.750> more<00:02:12.959> fish<00:02:13.200> there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
because there's more fish there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.990 
because there's more fish there
but<00:02:13.920> here's<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.190> other<00:02:14.220> thing<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.820> also

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
but here's the other thing you can also

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.360 
but here's the other thing you can also
see<00:02:15.450> fish<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.170> unit<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.620> there's<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.130> lot

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
see fish on this unit and there's a lot

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.620 
see fish on this unit and there's a lot
of<00:02:17.490> times<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.820> I'll<00:02:17.970> do<00:02:18.120> what<00:02:18.240> I'm<00:02:18.330> doing

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
of times that I'll do what I'm doing

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.600 
of times that I'll do what I'm doing
today<00:02:18.780> where<00:02:19.380> I'm<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.830> fishing<00:02:20.220> I'm<00:02:20.340> going

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
today where I'm just fishing I'm going

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.040 
today where I'm just fishing I'm going
forward<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.060> I'm<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.360> even<00:02:21.630> running<00:02:21.840> my

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
forward and I'm not even running my

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.350 
forward and I'm not even running my
standard<00:02:22.500> sonar<00:02:22.890> what<00:02:23.430> I'm<00:02:23.550> using<00:02:23.850> today<00:02:24.120> is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
standard sonar what I'm using today is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.140 
standard sonar what I'm using today is
just<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.840> 360<00:02:25.620> side<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.160> then<00:02:26.550> I'm<00:02:26.670> also<00:02:26.820> used

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
just the 360 side and then I'm also used

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.030 
just the 360 side and then I'm also used
my<00:02:27.330> map<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.990> stay<00:02:28.200> right<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.680> area

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
my map so I can stay right on the area

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.260 
my map so I can stay right on the area
that<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.250> want<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.550> be<00:02:29.640> I'm<00:02:29.790> following<00:02:30.210> a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
that I want to be I'm following a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.660 
that I want to be I'm following a
contour<00:02:30.720> line<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.170> as<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:32.100> I'm<00:02:32.400> just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
contour line and as I go I'm just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.310 
contour line and as I go I'm just
looking<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.720> all<00:02:33.990> these<00:02:34.140> different

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
looking in all these different

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.800 
looking in all these different
directions<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.100> when<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.550> see<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> good<00:02:36.480> bunch

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
directions and when I see a good bunch

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.290 
directions and when I see a good bunch
of<00:02:36.990> rock<00:02:37.200> over<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.620> or<00:02:37.980> fish<00:02:38.670> I'll<00:02:38.940> go<00:02:39.180> out

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
of rock over here or fish I'll go out

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.800 
of rock over here or fish I'll go out
that<00:02:39.480> way

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that way

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.750 
that way
a<00:02:39.840> fish<00:02:40.140> will<00:02:40.320> be<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.830> simple<00:02:41.040> white<00:02:41.340> slash

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
a fish will be just a simple white slash

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.640 
a fish will be just a simple white slash
and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.480> bottom<00:02:42.780> content<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.620> be

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
and then bottom content can be

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.680 
and then bottom content can be
differentiated<00:02:44.580> really<00:02:44.970> really<00:02:45.240> easily

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
differentiated really really easily

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.690 
differentiated really really easily
because<00:02:45.930> what<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.710> is<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.520> have<00:02:47.670> a

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
because what that is is if you have a

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.700 
because what that is is if you have a
rock<00:02:48.030> sitting<00:02:48.450> here<00:02:48.630> it'll<00:02:48.990> actually<00:02:49.200> show

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
rock sitting here it'll actually show

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.260 
rock sitting here it'll actually show
that<00:02:49.740> shadow<00:02:50.280> right<00:02:50.580> next<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.060> it'll<00:02:51.240> show

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
that shadow right next to it it'll show

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.600 
that shadow right next to it it'll show
those<00:02:51.660> bumps<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.500> know<00:02:52.710> exactly<00:02:53.160> what<00:02:53.520> it

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
those bumps so you know exactly what it

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.250 
those bumps so you know exactly what it
is<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.180> decipher<00:02:54.540> between<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.080> two

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
is so you can decipher between the two

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.710 
is so you can decipher between the two
I'm<00:02:55.560> telling<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.400> 360<00:02:57.120> unit<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.570> I've

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
I'm telling you this 360 unit that I've

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.390 
I'm telling you this 360 unit that I've
put<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.170> boat<00:02:58.350> from<00:02:58.530> hummingbird<00:02:59.010> has

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
put on the boat from hummingbird has

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.550 
put on the boat from hummingbird has
made<00:02:59.640> such<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> big<00:03:00.270> difference<00:03:00.450> first<00:03:01.170> time<00:03:01.440> in

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
made such a big difference first time in

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.140 
made such a big difference first time in
my<00:03:01.650> life<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.520> front<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.820> me<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:02.910> can

my life I can see in front of me I can

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.700 
my life I can see in front of me I can
see<00:03:03.330> out<00:03:03.480> there<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.990> see<00:03:04.140> out<00:03:04.260> there<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.470> can

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
see over there I know exactly where the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.630 
see over there I know exactly where the
fish<00:03:07.020> are<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.860> know<00:03:07.920> exactly<00:03:08.130> where<00:03:08.490> the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
fish are and I know exactly where the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.310 
fish are and I know exactly where the
structure<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.420> holds<00:03:09.660> them<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.140> can

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
structure is that holds them and I can

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.660 
structure is that holds them and I can
come<00:03:10.500> back<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.860> catch<00:03:11.010> them<00:03:11.160> over<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.610> over

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
come back and catch them over and over
