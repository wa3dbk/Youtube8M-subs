00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:11.180
 The output in this knife carbon to remove 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.160
 Well let's say that's my case forever 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.010
 carbon to remove or 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.949
 stainless steel of course a little carbon 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.519
 Keeps sharpening longer but also carbon 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:27.130
 very cool painted over stainless steel I 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:29.779
 there used to be a supporter of stainless steel 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.630
 easy to sharpen 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.570
 this, too, is you plus this guy here I am 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.040
 I can throw in the car and not worry 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.920
 that with him something will be and now I 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.170
 cut the apple eat it occupied him 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.930
 threw in the car forgot still with him 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.260
 you will even be killed this one this one 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.240
 night 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.610
 borrowed constantly from the lungs 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.890
 it is not necessary to wash it in a cheap night 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.290
 I have to listen even I wounded his call 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.410
 here you are already at work 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.290
 in places 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.120
 and got into a fight my injury nevertheless 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.740
 already tired of his dinner tattoo somehow and 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.699
 savanna for carbon kai need to watch here 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.890
 because it will rust 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.590
 Well, if we do not care right knife nirvana 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.429
 rusty then you should n't be here in case 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.340
 same with stainless steel no such problems that 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:18.319
 everyone chooses on their own and I'll tell you something 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.119
 that right now I have experienced at least him 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:25.100
 mora knives not much not much longer 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.039
 holding on to carbon key 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.759
 because many people said that 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.649
 carbon to this right into something I 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.439
 I write to him compared to stainless steel 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.350
 I will tell you by no means one thing 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.450
 the other has the right to life but oh well 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.759
 as now even practice has shown I 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.060
 I cut where I exposed the wood from 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.840
 tin cans I cut the carpet which 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.390
 I'm hard to cut at all 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.299
 to himself was picking a blowing and the abbot did not climb in 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.000
 I cut our products and after that the knife 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.030
 would still work would work I 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.229
 sure to take some like 3-4 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.329
 You can not even take this knife with you 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.009
 beam beam or take such a bar 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.899
 you know me more by type 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.660
 bitsevsky if already a knife really 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.000
 somewhere blunt is his pair 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.019
 once polished we specify it to hold 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.970
 on the army bar and the knife will recover and will 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.410
 continue to work that is in this too 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.540
 a huge plus in the stainless steel at least 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.220
 that she quickly corrected well and honestly 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.280
 saying not so she quickly dumb 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.989
 and but today even the knives were brought in 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.870
 total worthless but nonetheless they 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.150
 continued to cut and if i were somewhere 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.950
 some sort of marching conditions I even 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.340
 would not do today well maybe 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.769
 know here before bedtime sitting here I am a fire 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.989
 cheat to take was a case to shake with a knife 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.670
 they are so here i am right now i need that 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.530
 then make a knife there let's say products 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.989
 cut I'll help let's hone it to not 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.790
 never did this knife in this life 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.459
 would continue to cut and work and rather 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.049
 I would have gone to bed, and I would have forgotten 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.690
 Paul began to rule only when he came 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:08.609
 home well actually here such here 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.609
