right now for our preflight checks
so<00:02:05.009> what<00:02:05.759> nav<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.179> switched<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.350> want

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so what nav one switched on and we want

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.420 
so what nav one switched on and we want
it<00:02:07.619> set<00:02:07.830> 1<00:02:08.130> 10:30<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.420> I've<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.440> 110<00:02:10.950> 30<00:02:13.430> make

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
it set 1 10:30 and I've to 110 30 make

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.809 
it set 1 10:30 and I've to 110 30 make
sure<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.790> switched<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.440> good<00:02:16.610> we<00:02:17.610> want<00:02:17.700> to

sure it's switched on good we want to
make<00:02:17.910> sure<00:02:18.090> our<00:02:18.420> GPS<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.050> set<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.350> correctly

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.440 

so<00:02:24.130> we<00:02:24.280> have<00:02:24.400> our<00:02:24.550> purple<00:02:24.820> line<00:02:27.180> say<00:02:28.180> we<00:02:28.300> want

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
so we have our purple line say we want

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.440 
so we have our purple line say we want
to<00:02:28.510> go<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.660> our<00:02:28.960> also<00:02:29.920> pilot<00:02:30.250> sell<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.760> mm

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
to go to our also pilot sell it to mm

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.610 
to go to our also pilot sell it to mm
make<00:02:32.170> sure<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.440> attitude<00:02:32.920> hold<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.250> on

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
make sure the attitude hold is on

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.090 
make sure the attitude hold is on
navigation<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.840> Navis<00:02:37.840> which<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.380> GPS<00:02:38.770> so

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
navigation is on Navis which to GPS so

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.020 
navigation is on Navis which to GPS so
we'll<00:02:39.220> follow<00:02:39.400> our<00:02:39.520> GPS<00:02:40.030> line<00:02:44.400> now<00:02:45.400> we<00:02:45.910> already

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
we'll follow our GPS line now we already

00:02:46.030 --> 00:03:12.720 
we'll follow our GPS line now we already
spun<00:02:46.390> down<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.810> runway<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:48.790> go

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.300 

right<00:03:13.360> we're<00:03:13.480> looking<00:03:13.540> about<00:03:13.840> 150<00:03:14.650> K<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:14.920> asked

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
right we're looking about 150 K I asked

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.640 
right we're looking about 150 K I asked
for<00:03:15.760> takeoff<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:17.019> here<00:03:17.110> we<00:03:17.200> go<00:03:17.319> we've<00:03:17.470> lifted

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
for takeoff so here we go we've lifted

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.330 
for takeoff so here we go we've lifted
off<00:03:21.030> climbing<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.239> around<00:03:22.750> about<00:03:22.959> 500<00:03:23.409> feet<00:03:24.010> to

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
off climbing to around about 500 feet to

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.300 
off climbing to around about 500 feet to
turn<00:03:24.640> on<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.909> autopilot<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.950> we<00:03:27.010> see<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
turn on the autopilot so we see the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.100 
turn on the autopilot so we see the
autopilot<00:03:27.730> button<00:03:28.090> ECA<00:03:28.360> e-p<00:03:29.080> which<00:03:29.530> will<00:03:31.110> turn

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
autopilot button ECA e-p which will turn

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.059 
autopilot button ECA e-p which will turn
on<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:33.040> autopilot<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:34.530> make<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.709> follow<00:03:35.890> our

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
on the autopilot and make it follow our

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.289 
on the autopilot and make it follow our
line<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:37.720> we've<00:03:37.870> all<00:03:38.019> set<00:03:38.200> up<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:40.150> we're

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
line that we've all set up so we're

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.880 
line that we've all set up so we're
nearing<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.690> around<00:03:40.959> about<00:03:41.110> now<00:03:41.349> so<00:03:41.769> I've

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
nearing it around about now so I've

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.920 
nearing it around about now so I've
clicked<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.310> button<00:03:42.340> as<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.299> can<00:03:43.360> see<00:03:43.659> it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
clicked the button as you can see it

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.440 
clicked the button as you can see it
might<00:03:44.079> differ<00:03:44.470> bit<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.220> that's<00:03:45.400> okay<00:03:45.700> it's

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
might differ bit but that's okay it's

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.119 
might differ bit but that's okay it's
just<00:03:46.510> natural<00:03:46.810> for<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.290> plane<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.680> adjust

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
just natural for the plane to adjust

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.460 
just natural for the plane to adjust
itself<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:49.180> turning<00:03:49.480> onto<00:03:49.599> a<00:03:49.750> line<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.260> if<00:03:50.349> we

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
itself it's turning onto a line so if we

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.800 
itself it's turning onto a line so if we
look<00:03:50.650> at<00:03:50.769> our<00:03:50.799> GPS<00:03:51.750> if<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.989> can<00:03:53.140> get<00:03:53.290> up<00:03:54.480> as<00:03:55.480> you

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
look at our GPS if I can get up as you

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.449 
look at our GPS if I can get up as you
can<00:03:55.900> see<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.260> plane<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.680> turning<00:03:57.099> on<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.340> its

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
can see the plane is turning on to its

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.869 
can see the plane is turning on to its
course<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:59.290> climbing<00:03:59.829> to<00:04:00.069> around<00:04:00.670> about

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
course and is climbing to around about

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.330 
course and is climbing to around about
2,000<00:04:01.480> feet<00:04:01.680> where<00:04:02.680> I'll<00:04:02.799> follow<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.190> line

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
2,000 feet where I'll follow the line

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.559 
2,000 feet where I'll follow the line
all<00:04:03.370> right<00:04:05.040> we're<00:04:06.040> around<00:04:06.280> about<00:04:06.430> 23<00:04:07.000> North<00:04:07.450> to

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
all right we're around about 23 North to

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.640 
all right we're around about 23 North to
call<00:04:07.720> miles<00:04:07.959> away<00:04:08.290> from<00:04:08.739> our<00:04:09.099> destination<00:04:10.650> so

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
call miles away from our destination so

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.410 
call miles away from our destination so
we<00:04:12.040> want<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.310> start<00:04:12.489> activating<00:04:12.849> everything

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
we want to start activating everything

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.140 
we want to start activating everything
so<00:04:13.569> we<00:04:13.660> go<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.840> processes<00:04:14.530> menu<00:04:14.890> that<00:04:15.760> beeping

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
so we go to processes menu that beeping

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.670 
so we go to processes menu that beeping
is<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.389> ILS<00:04:16.720> we've<00:04:16.930> picked<00:04:17.139> up<00:04:17.349> from<00:04:17.530> our

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
is the ILS we've picked up from our

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.009 
is the ILS we've picked up from our
radio<00:04:18.010> when<00:04:18.579> it<00:04:18.700> activate<00:04:19.090> vectors<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:19.630> final

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
radio when it activate vectors the final

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.760 
radio when it activate vectors the final
and<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.889> plane<00:04:21.099> should<00:04:21.489> turn<00:04:21.970> on<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.330> course

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
and the plane should turn on to course

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.070 
and the plane should turn on to course
to<00:04:23.770> vectors<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:25.030> final<00:04:25.450> where<00:04:25.660> we<00:04:25.810> will<00:04:25.960> begin

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
to vectors to final where we will begin

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.350 
to vectors to final where we will begin
our<00:04:26.229> approach<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:27.010> finally<00:04:27.729> our<00:04:27.910> ILS<00:04:28.330> landing

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
our approach and finally our ILS landing

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.520 
our approach and finally our ILS landing
as<00:04:29.789> we're<00:04:30.789> getting<00:04:30.910> closer<00:04:31.240> we<00:04:32.169> will<00:04:32.320> have<00:04:32.440> the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
as we're getting closer we will have the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.310 
as we're getting closer we will have the
glide<00:04:32.800> slope<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.970> use<00:04:34.180> for<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.990> ILS<00:04:35.139> landing

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
glide slope to use for the ILS landing

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.560 
glide slope to use for the ILS landing
and<00:04:36.099> this<00:04:36.220> depends<00:04:36.610> on<00:04:36.760> height<00:04:37.000> for<00:04:37.270> different

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
and this depends on height for different

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.629 
and this depends on height for different
runways<00:04:37.960> as<00:04:38.229> we<00:04:38.800> don't<00:04:38.919> know<00:04:39.099> the<00:04:39.220> height<00:04:39.460> for

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
runways as we don't know the height for

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.950 
runways as we don't know the height for
this<00:04:39.729> one<00:04:39.940> we<00:04:40.090> just<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.389> be<00:04:40.479> sure<00:04:40.510> we're<00:04:40.870> gonna

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
this one we just to be sure we're gonna

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.000 
this one we just to be sure we're gonna
set<00:04:41.200> it<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.639> 1,500<00:04:42.690> meters<00:04:43.770> plane<00:04:44.770> should

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
set it to 1,500 meters plane should

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.360 
set it to 1,500 meters plane should
decrease<00:04:45.930> as<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.050> can<00:04:47.139> see<00:04:47.349> and<00:04:47.560> then<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:48.280> will

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
decrease as you can see and then it will

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.560 
decrease as you can see and then it will
stabilize<00:04:48.580> at<00:04:48.940> 1,500<00:04:49.930> meters

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.200 

right<00:04:56.570> as<00:04:56.750> we're<00:04:56.930> just<00:04:57.110> pulling<00:04:57.230> onto<00:04:57.470> the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
right as we're just pulling onto the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.820 
right as we're just pulling onto the
exes<00:04:59.210> final<00:04:59.660> maybe<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.200> can<00:05:00.350> rewind<00:05:00.680> this

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
exes final maybe you can rewind this

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.310 
exes final maybe you can rewind this
video<00:05:01.010> at<00:05:01.310> any<00:05:01.340> point<00:05:01.700> it<00:05:02.330> gets<00:05:02.450> too<00:05:02.660> confusing

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
video at any point it gets too confusing

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.650 
video at any point it gets too confusing
it<00:05:03.710> shouldn't<00:05:04.040> I'll<00:05:04.940> just<00:05:05.380> make<00:05:06.380> that<00:05:06.410> smaller

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
it shouldn't I'll just make that smaller

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.130 
it shouldn't I'll just make that smaller
right<00:05:08.660> can<00:05:08.900> you<00:05:08.960> see<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.200> runway<00:05:09.380> ahead

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
right can you see the runway ahead

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.040 
right can you see the runway ahead
always<00:05:12.140> straight<00:05:12.680> your<00:05:12.800> head<00:05:12.890> now<00:05:14.050> she

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
always straight your head now she

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.360 
always straight your head now she
instantly<00:05:15.230> will<00:05:15.470> see<00:05:15.740> we<00:05:15.980> should<00:05:16.100> still<00:05:16.250> got

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
instantly will see we should still got

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.230 
instantly will see we should still got
ILS<00:05:16.840> so<00:05:17.840> now<00:05:17.990> we<00:05:18.560> want<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.770> switch<00:05:18.860> from<00:05:19.220> GPS<00:05:20.060> to

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
ILS so now we want to switch from GPS to

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.450 
ILS so now we want to switch from GPS to
nav<00:05:20.510> now<00:05:21.020> as<00:05:21.170> you<00:05:21.260> can<00:05:21.350> see<00:05:21.410> a<00:05:21.800> little<00:05:22.190> arrow

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
nav now as you can see a little arrow

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.630 
nav now as you can see a little arrow
has<00:05:23.030> appeared<00:05:23.890> this<00:05:24.890> at<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.160> moment<00:05:25.280> means

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
has appeared this at the moment means

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.690

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:06.640 

all<00:06:05.870> right<00:06:05.960> so<00:06:06.139> it's<00:06:06.289> almost<00:06:06.469> on<00:06:06.620> the

all right so it's almost on the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
rectangle now so I'll click approach and

itself don't panic it will come on
course<00:06:37.610> if<00:06:37.820> you<00:06:37.970> set<00:06:38.240> it<00:06:38.270> up<00:06:38.449> correctly<00:06:39.880> the

arrow is dead in the box which means

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.950 
arrow is dead in the box which means

it's following the glide path don't
worry<00:06:45.169> if<00:06:45.289> it<00:06:45.380> means<00:06:45.560> too<00:06:45.800> much<00:06:45.949> out

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.540 
worry if it means too much out
you<00:06:47.509> should<00:06:47.720> still<00:06:48.020> follow<00:06:48.259> it<00:06:48.440> down<00:06:48.590> then<00:06:48.830> be

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
you should still follow it down then be

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.010 
you should still follow it down then be
roundabouts<00:06:50.030> the<00:06:50.180> runway<00:06:50.479> but<00:06:50.780> preferably

roundabouts the runway but preferably

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.620

and as you can see up ahead that the

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.180 
and as you can see up ahead that the

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
lights are too white to red this means

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:05.700 
lights are too white to red this means

you<00:07:06.700> want<00:07:06.880> to<00:07:07.000> cut<00:07:07.210> your<00:07:07.240> throttle<00:07:07.720> so<00:07:08.710> you

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
you want to cut your throttle so you

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.320 
you want to cut your throttle so you
slow<00:07:09.040> right<00:07:09.220> down<00:07:09.250> and<00:07:09.610> maybe<00:07:09.820> give<00:07:10.030> it<00:07:10.060> a<00:07:10.210> bit

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
slow right down and maybe give it a bit

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.570 
slow right down and maybe give it a bit
of<00:07:10.360> flaps<00:07:10.860> in<00:07:11.860> case<00:07:12.040> you're<00:07:12.190> going<00:07:12.370> a<00:07:12.490> little

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
of flaps in case you're going a little

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.740 
of flaps in case you're going a little
bit<00:07:12.730> too<00:07:12.880> fast<00:07:13.120> at<00:07:13.240> the<00:07:13.330> moment<00:07:13.630> I'm<00:07:13.720> doing

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
bit too fast at the moment I'm doing

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.840 
bit too fast at the moment I'm doing
around<00:07:14.200> about<00:07:14.520> 150<00:07:17.670> slowing<00:07:18.670> down

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
around about 150 slowing down

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.180 
around about 150 slowing down
drastically<00:07:19.150> now<00:07:19.770> don't<00:07:20.770> worry<00:07:20.860> about<00:07:21.070> the

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
drastically now don't worry about the

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.890 
drastically now don't worry about the
lights<00:07:21.370> at<00:07:21.580> this<00:07:21.730> point<00:07:22.030> because<00:07:22.480> you<00:07:22.600> can<00:07:22.720> see

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 
lights at this point because you can see

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.180 
lights at this point because you can see
that<00:07:23.050> you're<00:07:23.140> gonna<00:07:23.230> hit<00:07:23.410> down<00:07:23.620> on<00:07:23.650> the<00:07:23.890> runway

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
that you're gonna hit down on the runway

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.510 
that you're gonna hit down on the runway
hopefully<00:07:25.410> they<00:07:26.410> should<00:07:26.620> change<00:07:26.860> back<00:07:27.220> to<00:07:27.250> -

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 
hopefully they should change back to -

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.820 
hopefully they should change back to -
where<00:07:27.700> -<00:07:27.850> right<00:07:28.120> as<00:07:28.870> I'm<00:07:29.140> about<00:07:29.170> touch<00:07:29.590> now

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830

there<00:07:30.160> we<00:07:30.250> go<00:07:31.080> so<00:07:32.080> as<00:07:32.290> I<00:07:32.410> hit<00:07:32.560> the<00:07:32.590> runway<00:07:32.830> I

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:32.980 
there we go so as I hit the runway I

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.800 
there we go so as I hit the runway I
want<00:07:33.220> to<00:07:33.310> apply<00:07:33.580> the<00:07:33.640> brakes<00:07:34.000> not<00:07:34.330> too<00:07:34.510> early

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:34.810 
want to apply the brakes not too early

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.470 
want to apply the brakes not too early
as<00:07:35.080> you<00:07:35.260> may<00:07:35.410> skid<00:07:35.760> so<00:07:36.760> here<00:07:37.000> we<00:07:37.090> have<00:07:37.210> touched

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:37.480 
as you may skid so here we have touched

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.720 
as you may skid so here we have touched
down<00:07:37.600> fully<00:07:38.050> automated<00:07:38.470> all<00:07:39.250> I've<00:07:39.430> just<00:07:39.610> been

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:39.730 
down fully automated all I've just been

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.440 
down fully automated all I've just been
doing<00:07:39.910> is<00:07:40.560> touching<00:07:41.560> the<00:07:41.790> speed<00:07:42.790> and<00:07:43.240> the

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:43.450 
doing is touching the speed and the
