00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.210
 Arm is under the supervision of sco-coach playmaker Tomorrow and special 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.240
 not a pure multi-talent 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.300

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.070
 Show Dolly very clearly 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.370

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.370
 run up quickly done home again 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.990
 should we also were hot 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.890
 The formwork should be absolutely there, that's probably tomorrow life 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.350
 three times not empty 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.370
 or who fancy the Auer 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.780
 so much costs but understood 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.780
 but only movement could 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.100
 Schefvert at home all day long 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.200

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.950
 but alright 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.970
 and then the rain comes from above and lets in for a breeze from the front 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.140
 Keitel 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.320
