00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.130
 the staff comes 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.350
 have photos where you received a question from the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 Antonio Cavalcante asks well. 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.050
 interesting may be the same as in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.689
 you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.260
 case antônio cavalcante has already been 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.199
 Our work from six in the afternoon to six 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.520
 from 6 am to 6 pm 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.590
 hours no d 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.239
 and he went straight to the gym begins 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.430
 training since the 7 hours of the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.559
 morning and the question actually 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 singer is the next one since it would be 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.850
 hindering his training have 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.200
 development of our brand and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.350
 second part of the question on what 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.180
 It could be done and practice using ms 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.980
 if there is a penalty that it could be 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.140
 done will come in and will have to 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.559
 make available the negative effects it 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.390
 What happens, I better have work 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.370
 is all the work of physical training 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.710
 is based on marketing this for sure 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.840
 You also know about food. 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.450
 proper rest the workout 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.260
 appropriate this will not only sad for the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.330
 hypertrophy work was not 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.740
 athlete said that goes for all 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.290
 athletes of any sporting modality 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.270
 that seeks physical performance the trail 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.460
 proper rest food 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
 appropriate appropriate treatment then we 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.119
 we can see with antonio that left in the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.619
 neck that he was fed 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.020
 adequate training in appropriate training 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.020
 of course adequate aloísio rest 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.500
 because the shadow is not much better 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.990
 cases in the evening where at a rate of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.929
 including metabolic 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.960
 positive normal actions the process is a 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.969
 norm that a sleep occurs and lover it 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.859
 he is learning computer antonio 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.740
 tired gates being more wanted 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.840
 rest in the day and have eight 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.240
 hours of sleep during the day to the repository 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.280
 not exactly the same as these 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.560
 eight hours of sleep made up to 14 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.890
 At night time you are walled and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.899
 drove recovering on a night where 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 Do you work at work all the time? 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.560
 so what we 're not going to put in 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.290
 focus I feel when you are having 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.599
 a loss in terms of the repercussion of 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.510
 training you could probably 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.239
 very good to train heavier than you 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.190
 training and the evolution of 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.260
 you're probably having power to be 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.480
 much better since you had a 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.310
 most suitable place to sleep and rest 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.769
 while maintaining the same training to 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.700
 same nutrition nutrition you have one 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.170
 feeling 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.349
 if you had a more 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.319
 with proper there moments after the 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.230
 her mother 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.870
 the bad is because you would probably 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.849
 a great certainty the work of 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.920
 composer has better with that he could 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.439
 training with a higher workload 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.689
 intense then what we understand that 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.670
 if you have a loss with that your 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.459
 biography is probably a more 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.519
 slower than it could have been if 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.719
 process of rest within the path of 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.709
 Currently there are no night of rest 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.019
 suitable 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.409
 so what to do to minimize this 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.030
 1st fair to do the ideal would be in the 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.230
 The first clerk covers 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.760
 appropriate times 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.859
 knowing all your hormonal system 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.750
 and recovery of the ball 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.569
 if this was possible because of its 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.189
 even if it's what you should 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.139
 trying to do is keeping a diet 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:26.530
 most suitable to do a workout 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.510
 more than 45 and worse than adequate sleep is 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.549
 of the day and look for your room 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.120
 totally dark is trying to characterize 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.699
 a bond of this organism is that moment 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.919
 of them great surprise and also has no 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:40.540
 Time to sleep so why boss 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.540
 example if you train from seven in the morning 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.970
 at 8 for a dictionary that time of 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.069
 sound of daytime sleep is 9am 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.099
 until two o'clock in the afternoon the field 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.979
 which raises the hypothesis that was 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.359
 parked on one day and look forward to the team's 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.299
 after noon such thing 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.430
 happened in the resident circuit of citizens 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.340
 UN fees and would be one of the ways 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.549
 that you could try to minimize 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.009
 deleterious effects it is having is due to the 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.209
 the issue of a night of work not only 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.069
 not rest 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.189
 we can put you can not is 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.810
 try to take a note of the training and 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.450
 try to make the most of the 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.910
 rest and paint on the spot 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.550
 Sunday have as many people as possible 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.500
 and got a minimum of lighting 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.600
 also possibly day and keep a 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.270
 your browser then we can put 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.060
 as without commercials its daily its 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.220
 day to day return with the generic standard is 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.860
 Viral followed rags and 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.770
 benefiting from the good eyes that was the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.630
 answer then has today's focus continues 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.690
 to send your questions we have to 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.610
 Our song is I got all the fruits 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.140
 not responding food contribution 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.140
 in the same way as petrobras
