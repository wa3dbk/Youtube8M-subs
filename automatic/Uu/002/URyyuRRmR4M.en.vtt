00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.179
 The first thing I will do is 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.429
 cream with cream stiff and beat the 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:33.059
 we need two to coat dry 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.200

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.550
 Decorate was nuts or hazelnuts the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.050
 Ingredients for the dough are 41 200 grams 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.710
 sugar is about half to one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.170
 tablespoon straws set that was not quite 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.700
 1 tablespoon so three four tablespoons 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 lukewarm water 1 packet 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.989
 vanilla sugar a packet of baking powder 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.899
 about 180 grams of flour and a pinch of salt 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.539
 but need the age of the white 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:14.210
 I will be the first egg yolk 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.210
 Beat it with creamy sugar 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.560
 and then I will protein with a 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.560
 pinch salt also until stiff 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.850
 if the ice is not under pot then 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:38.789
 that's ok so now I give lukewarm 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.369
 water juice of a spoon and throne 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:46.770
 vanilla sugar still pity and beat 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.590
 it then a bit with my 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.520
 Actual in a bowl of rhine 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.569
 given and then give now and always 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:10.830
 Wloch with paint the flour I will 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:15.030
 but just about seven so around 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.230
 comes to the conclusion my white pure and 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.230
 at the beginning 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:35.519
 I have a nice 22 5 here 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:43.049
 introduced and then give the dough then 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:46.859
 Can you make your bubble so completely 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:50.100
 most important is that you have a glass 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.889
 then add water to the oven 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.200
 So the cake and really nice 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.569
 can become airy and easy 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.840
 Now I will look at 180 degrees 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.790
 Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.269
 to look completely now 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.269
 cooling down 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.409
 I've beaten the cream stiff 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:17.499
 and then could just sugar and 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.499
 Simply fold in ground hazelnuts 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.389
 So sugar could just as much as you 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.480
 I would like to do there no quantity 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.689
 because everyone likes it differently so 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.939
 I like me so sweet and then I will 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.120
 the filling first for half 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.590
 place in the fridge for an hour 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.349
 the surface of a cake bottom 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.349
 I've cut off the smooth one 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.699
 I have the first floor in Marl 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:54.280
 springform given and then give the 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:54.280
 half of the filling just on it 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:09.280
 and give the second were easy 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:21.760
 above and the rest of the filling comes 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:23.530
 then on it so now comes the ground 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.780
 is broken more but is not 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.540
 so bad 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.390
 Now I'll do that for about one 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.650
 hour in the fridge 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.770
 I will now 400 grams 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.260
 marzipan crude with 100 grams of her 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.930
 seventh sugar mix it were 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:50.290
 by the way, 400 grams of marzipan was and 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:53.130
 I personally was not for me 300 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.210
 've just taken 50 grams and then will 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.210
 clear that up now 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.320
 and the edges of the then look 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.320
 just cut it out 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.760
 I've then again is about 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.540
 200 milliliters cream beaten and 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.540
