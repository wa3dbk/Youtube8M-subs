00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
pointy side into your foam otherwise

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.400 
pointy side into your foam otherwise
it's<00:03:04.489> really<00:03:04.730> hard<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.180> get<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.630> blunt<00:03:05.930> end<00:03:06.170> to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
it's really hard to get the blunt end to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.890 
it's really hard to get the blunt end to
go<00:03:07.010> through<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> fabrics<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:07.880> everything<00:03:08.270> so

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
go through the fabrics and everything so

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.220 
go through the fabrics and everything so
I<00:03:08.930> push<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:09.470> down<00:03:09.709> through<00:03:10.100> here<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:14.230> the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
I push this down through here so the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.460 
I push this down through here so the
next<00:03:15.440> thing<00:03:15.709> I'm<00:03:15.860> gonna<00:03:16.010> do<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:18.080> going<00:03:18.350> to

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.320 
next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to
put<00:03:18.709> some<00:03:18.860> hot<00:03:19.070> glue<00:03:19.280> onto<00:03:19.640> my<00:03:21.640> wings<00:03:22.640> cure<00:03:23.060> and

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
put some hot glue onto my wings cure and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.590 
put some hot glue onto my wings cure and
I'm<00:03:24.049> going<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.380> stick<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.950> blunt<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.580> now<00:03:25.850> down

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
I'm going to stick the blunt in now down

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.220 
I'm going to stick the blunt in now down
through<00:03:28.180> down<00:03:29.180> through<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:30.010> styrofoam<00:03:31.010> block

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
through down through the styrofoam block

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.570 
through down through the styrofoam block
so<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.260> just<00:03:33.560> hold<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:33.950> place

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
so I just hold it in place

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.350 
so I just hold it in place
and<00:03:35.980> push<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.010> back<00:03:37.370> down<00:03:37.400> through<00:03:37.940> there<00:03:38.209> and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
and push it back down through there and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.050 
and push it back down through there and
I<00:03:38.660> leave<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.019> pointy<00:03:39.530> side<00:03:39.799> up<00:03:39.830> I'll<00:03:40.730> do<00:03:40.910> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
I leave the pointy side up I'll do the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.960 
I leave the pointy side up I'll do the
same<00:03:41.299> thing<00:03:41.540> I'm<00:03:41.690> taking<00:03:42.110> out<00:03:42.350> my<00:03:43.040> wooden

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
same thing I'm taking out my wooden

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.690 
same thing I'm taking out my wooden
skewer<00:03:44.420> I'm<00:03:45.080> going<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.650> put<00:03:45.860> some<00:03:46.040> glue<00:03:46.220> on<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
skewer I'm going to put some glue on the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.220 
skewer I'm going to put some glue on the
blunt<00:03:47.090> end<00:03:47.420> of<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:49.330> this<00:03:50.330> just<00:03:50.540> helps<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.959> stay

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
blunt end of it this just helps it stay

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.770 
blunt end of it this just helps it stay
in<00:03:51.260> place<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.650> little<00:03:51.890> bit<00:03:52.070> better<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.780> I'm

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
in place a little bit better and I'm

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.210 
in place a little bit better and I'm
going<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:53.989> take<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.290> blunt<00:03:54.560> end<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.010> stick

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
going to take the blunt end and stick

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.780 
going to take the blunt end and stick
that<00:03:55.250> back<00:03:55.730> down<00:03:56.090> through<00:03:57.310> my<00:03:58.310> styrofoam

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
that back down through my styrofoam

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.630 
that back down through my styrofoam
block<00:03:59.290> so<00:04:00.290> what<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:00.620> does<00:04:00.890> is<00:04:01.160> when<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.400> want

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
block so what this does is when I want

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.070 
block so what this does is when I want
to<00:04:01.790> attach<00:04:02.060> Carly<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:02.870> Alex<00:04:03.519> it<00:04:04.519> they<00:04:04.790> will

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
to attach Carly and Alex it they will

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.370 
to attach Carly and Alex it they will
the<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:07.190> sharp<00:04:07.459> end<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.090> wooden<00:04:08.989> skewer

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
the the sharp end of the wooden skewer

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.830 
the the sharp end of the wooden skewer
will<00:04:09.620> go<00:04:09.739> through<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.610> C<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.180> X<00:04:11.360> very

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
will go through the C and the X very

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.220 
will go through the C and the X very
easily<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:14.360> here's

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
easily so here's

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.229 
easily so here's
as<00:04:15.319> you<00:04:15.409> can<00:04:15.560> see<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.950> wide<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:16.459> down<00:04:16.760> below

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
as you can see the wide it's down below

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.420 
as you can see the wide it's down below
the<00:04:17.630> other<00:04:17.780> letters<00:04:18.199> and<00:04:18.410> that's<00:04:18.889> why<00:04:19.160> we<00:04:19.310> have

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
the other letters and that's why we have

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.939 
the other letters and that's why we have
to<00:04:19.579> put<00:04:19.760> this<00:04:19.970> particular<00:04:20.660> these<00:04:21.290> particular

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
to put this particular these particular

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.110 
to put this particular these particular
names<00:04:22.190> up<00:04:22.490> on<00:04:22.669> our<00:04:23.090> styrofoam<00:04:23.570> block<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:25.120> am
