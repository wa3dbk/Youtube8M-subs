00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 Today I am going to show you a different way to prepare breakfast in this simple video. 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.160
 First, cut the baguette. 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.670
 Make a hole but do not remove all the white bread inside. 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.510
 Just like this. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.000
 Set aside. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Add the olive oil in a pan and heat the oil over medium heat. 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.710
 Cut and at the same time bacon. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.000
 I am using a bacon board today. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Then cook until brown and crisp. 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 Now transfer to the panel lined kitchen towel to drain excess fat. 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.060
 Then eliminate the fat and bacon on the pan and lightly spray the oil. 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 Reduce the heat to low medium and put the baguette on the pan. 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 Crack the egg into the cup and slowly pour into the hole. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.800
 If you squeeze the baguette firmly with the fingers, 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.500
 You will not get a white egg whip out on the bottom of the bread. 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 Season with salt and pepper and cover the pan. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.700
 Cook for 2 minutes. And flip over. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 Then cook for an additional 1 minute or until the eggs are cooked to your liking. 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 Voila. Sprinkle with bacon on top and serve immediately. 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.970
 This is best when warm. 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.880
 I do not like the crispy baguette with the runny eggs inside. 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 Bon appetite. 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.870
 And here goes each other. 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.910
 They are cooked over it. 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.410
 thanks for watching. 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.410
 And yes I love this work. Oh really. 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.410
 Bye for now!
