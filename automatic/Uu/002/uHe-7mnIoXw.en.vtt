00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
every single lane and yet they went with

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.810 
every single lane and yet they went with
venmo<00:00:40.110> Ghana<00:00:40.440> which<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.340> weakling

harder the guts on towers but the bottom
line<00:01:00.510> they<00:01:00.809> were<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:00.989> got<00:01:01.170> destroyed<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
line they were just got destroyed and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.250 
line they were just got destroyed and
it's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> big<00:01:02.699> issue<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.030> vain<00:01:03.449> brings

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
it's a big issue because vain brings

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
it's a big issue because vain brings
absolutely<00:01:04.710> no<00:01:04.860> wave<00:01:05.040> clear<00:01:05.280> magana<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
absolutely no wave clear magana of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.580 
absolutely no wave clear magana of
course<00:01:06.299> brings<00:01:06.540> very<00:01:06.780> little<00:01:07.020> wave<00:01:07.170> clear<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
course brings very little wave clear and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.350 
course brings very little wave clear and
the<00:01:07.830> whole<00:01:08.010> lineup<00:01:08.250> itself<00:01:08.729> has<00:01:08.850> had<00:01:09.090> no<00:01:09.210> way

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the whole lineup itself has had no way

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.570 
the whole lineup itself has had no way
clear<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.020> once<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.350> fell<00:01:10.530> behind<00:01:10.710> gambit

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
clear so once they fell behind gambit

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.130 
clear so once they fell behind gambit
just<00:01:11.700> took<00:01:11.850> full<00:01:12.119> control<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.510> every<00:01:12.930> single

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
just took full control of every single

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.190 
just took full control of every single
lane<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.680> pressured<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.520> SK<00:01:15.509> did<00:01:15.780> manage

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
lane and pressured it down SK did manage

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.370 
lane and pressured it down SK did manage
to<00:01:17.070> come<00:01:17.310> back<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.820> game<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.509> say<00:01:19.200> that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to come back in that game do we say that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.649 
to come back in that game do we say that
is<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.950> errors<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> gambit<00:01:21.270> side<00:01:21.450> or

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
is because of errors of gambit side or

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.510 
is because of errors of gambit side or
just<00:01:21.900> supreme<00:01:22.439> team<00:01:22.619> play<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:23.009> sk<00:01:23.310> side

risky so I do feel like SK gaming as
soon<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.489> they<00:02:08.580> saw<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.060> was<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.780> 2<00:02:09.929> V

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050

soon as they saw it was going to be 2 V
2<00:02:10.080> 1<00:02:10.440> v1<00:02:10.590> realized<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.700> need<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.940> push<00:02:12.090> our

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
2 1 v1 realized we need to push our

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.640 
2 1 v1 realized we need to push our
advantage<00:02:12.599> top<00:02:12.810> lane<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.379> hope

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650

our bottling can survive by himself

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.970 
our bottling can survive by himself
