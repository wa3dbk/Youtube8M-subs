00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.170
 Of course 4 was certainly without a doubt 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.090
 some one of the stars of this e3 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.500
 2015 and the movie of uncharted well 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.929
 I was under the spotlight of the 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.539
 users and attentive because apparently the 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.880
 uncharted movie has been left 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.770
 paralyzed because good attentive because 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.080
 the director seth gordon would have 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.080
 abandoned the project to carry anchart 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.330
 to the big screen as they echo 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.730
 the different specialized media the 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.860
 movie was already stopped some years 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.530
 it would have become a hell for 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.079
 creative and budget discussions 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.879
 apparently tom rothman president of the 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.980
 cinematographic division has a 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.449
 shawn budget while and 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.339
 Well, you want a budget 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.190
 quite tall for this movie 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.980
 in the words of hero hollywood are 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.499
 I expected it to be his Indiana Jones and 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.479
 Rodman seeks to be a is a kind 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.510
 from resident and bolt the movies of 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.969
 resident and bolt good in short 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.639
 we are talking about profitable movies 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.859
 but do not need so many 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:06.359
 investment the script would have returned to 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.799
 remake something that also 

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:11.109
 complicating the preproduction of the 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.329
 movie all these discussions about 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:15.880
 the course and everything you must take have been 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.469
 filtered next to the sound mail 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.450
 where you could read that they want a 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.579
 Intense and more entertaining tape 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.929
 adults something that may result 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.140
 attractive also for young people 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:28.270
 teenagers who propose a kind of 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.270
 really fun adventure for the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.479
 summer something that would combine tomb raider 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.179
 with the da vinci code so to speak 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.299
 the truth is that good as you imagine 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.759
 you the uncharted movie good 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.439
 Well, there are your opinions for 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.750
 that you express in the box 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.689
 comments on this news and the truth 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.159
 is that good when I mix the 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.049
 world of video games with the world 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.629
 film always say the same give 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.060
 time for good results 

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:59.679
 so that good things are done because if 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.989
 we look back and see each 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.840
 movie based on video games that has 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:06.670
 then it was a real fiasco because almost 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.069
 better in some occasions that neither 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.069
 you can even make movies
