00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.459
 Floriane Coste 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.129
 a christmas drummer is innocent 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.309
 I integrated e to the demonise team of santis has in a year and a half 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.299
 to replace their old drummer on the end of the round their tour 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.339
 e I naturally stay to do 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.660
 to make a new album and we go on tour with a new system 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.710
 I also manage machines on stage I have a lot of good things 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.060
 it's going really well this kit is not necessarily gained advanced because we 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.120
 we will change a little liquid had to go out houllier 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.760
 besides this article eats whatever the new team is really all of 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.400
 suite built around a hard core 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.420
 those who really were their desire to do 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.250
 rocca serra said he was going to make some order 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.990
 and for that a super happy we had still really world on the 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.000
 concerts 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.510
 the benefits for me is that I have the impression that it's only going up 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.450
 the more I play with our animals and health 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.860
 the more I take my foot off 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 at the moment we surround in full tour all over France 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.360
 for december 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.270
 we'll do a little break I think 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.390
 the first quarter 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.890
 minutes 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.890
 to then come back% and until the end of summer 2008 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.490
 in the big cities 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.900
 viguier dancers 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.560
 when are we going to leave this moment where quebec 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.810
 and then maybe projects a little more international dating with 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.470
 other musicians 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.210
 the sale with Christmas music is she is she is it's done 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.960
 the cds and mestizo and finally it takes for granted and that is very 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.070
 present 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.150
 by the big guitars later the culture of those who do this 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.020
 music 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 in this case we 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.299
 in some types to have ddd oriental samples in others of 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.320
 more electro stuff 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.410
 we are going really horizon 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.130
 but his ball but it's a ball 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.580
 zidane 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.439
 why because the word for me is the goal 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.259
 did not act 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.939
 it's going to be a p 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.309
 15 16 years 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.839
 almost 17 years old that I'm doing drums 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.839
 I think I tried everything that can be done in a symbol 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:25.109
 we had to have five positive sessions days always I'm still and I have 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.409
 always bought some also made 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.799
 % and the series and well I fell in love 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.169
 toulon the 2 nd series had said is that stone 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.319
 and she is before any crash projection 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.739
 why because in others that I envisioned the role of cymbals in 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.179
 drums 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:47.029
 this side explosion what you diffuse side of naples sometimes every time 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.399
 they were able to transcribe when it is necessary to make color charts happen 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.749
 it learns but I get to he had to really manage the drives on 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.450
 and then when I got back into the body 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.930
 the honorable ones behind a real paradise of the true harmonic super beautiful what in 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.169
 more than being beefy 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.729
 it's not 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:09.510
 I know not insignificant when we take a step away from 100 or 120 dates per year 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.170
 like you do it
