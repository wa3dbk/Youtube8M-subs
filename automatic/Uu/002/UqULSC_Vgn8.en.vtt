00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:12.769

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 protocol and I'll greet the cleidiane 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.720
 spoke here on behalf of the residents 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.470
 I wanted to greet Cleidiane. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.710
 greeting each of the residents 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.660
 of women who receive rain in two 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.199
 men who receive the key 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.320
 especially of families because my 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.589
 house my life is a program for 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:44.330
 family is a program so that people 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:48.900
 to guarantee Brazilian families 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.790
 they have a ceiling more than the ceiling there 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.790
 where to raise your children 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:58.190
 Brazil was very difficult for a person 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.400
 buy a house 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.110
 especially if a person earned a 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.140
 minimum wage or even less than that 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.030
 because apus wanted was impossible because the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.130
 account did not close at all 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.090
 when the account does not close at all 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:26.010
 one has a way 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:30.360
 the government has responsibility for 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.870
 ensure that people have access to the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:40.860
 own house and that's what we did 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:43.470
 is to ensure that people citizens 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.380
 Brazilians and Brazilians who 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.210
 living in that country has the right to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.229
 access to own house 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.400
 That 's why my home program 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.570
 life 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.830
 he holds it to the income range of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.729
 until you win the family you win until 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.570
 1,600 reais 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:10.580
 it ensures that the Brazilian state 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:16.190
 federal government him 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:21.230
 cover 90% to 95% 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:25.430
 5% depending on the value of the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.700
 property so that the person in that 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.780
 income has a decent living 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.920
 I wanted to tell you that I am 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.890
 here extremely excited because 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.870
 I believe that this is one of the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:48.490
 comprehensive programs that the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.960
 federal government has and that it works 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.250
 in this terrible question that the 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.440
 inequality 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.540
 we know people are 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.090
 many different 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.670
 perfectly now this does not mean 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.840
 that opportunities have to be 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.200
 many different 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.340
 We want Brazil and the people. 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.290
 have the same opportunities in each 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.780
 place that we have the most 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.570
 equal opportunities we 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.520
 for Brazilians and Brazilians all of us 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:30.650
 the more developed will this country be 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:33.620
 that's why I want to say that for us 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.739
 we will only be able to realize our 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.910
 project with the partnership of state and 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.900
 counties 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.270
 It's very important to have partners and I 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.680
 I wanted to close by saying something to 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.050
 you 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:55.550
 Brazil today is a country that has one of the 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.950
 lower rates of unemployment than the 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.600
 its history but not only the history of the 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:06.410
 Brazil is not also in relation to the world. 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.110
 we reached 4.6 percent what is 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:14.300
 considered a very low rate of 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:17.870
 unemployment but we want these 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.549
 jobs exist today are becoming increasingly 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:25.360
 best 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.360
 that's why I wanted to greet you 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.340

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.150
 technical and vocational training 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.310
 important for young and old 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.920
 important because it improves quality 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.220
 of work in Brazil increases the 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.740
 capacity of the work and also increases 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.920
 the income in the worker's pocket 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.740
 and I mean the following I mean the 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:13.070

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.850
 extraordinary 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:27.390
 that slum from the rope 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.260
 I was here in 2010 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:36.300

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:39.270

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.880
 here and I accepted 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.900
 I was very impressed that time 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.840
 with rope 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.140
