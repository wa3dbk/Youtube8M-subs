fish<00:00:09.290> and<00:00:10.290> I've<00:00:10.410> timed<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.550> end

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
fish and I've timed it so that the end

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.120 
fish and I've timed it so that the end
of<00:00:12.030> our<00:00:12.120> backswing<00:00:12.780> happens<00:00:13.559> at<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> same

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
of our backswing happens at the same

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.769 
of our backswing happens at the same
time<00:00:16.039> so<00:00:17.039> if<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.220> bring<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.699> marker<00:00:18.390> back<00:00:18.510> right

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
time so if I bring the marker back right

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.160 
time so if I bring the marker back right
to<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.930> beginning<00:00:19.350> we'll<00:00:19.830> see<00:00:20.010> our<00:00:20.160> backswing

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
to the beginning we'll see our backswing

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.660 
to the beginning we'll see our backswing
ends<00:00:22.170> at<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> same<00:00:22.560> time<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.130> let's<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:23.430> how

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
ends at the same time and let's see how

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.210 
ends at the same time and let's see how
the<00:00:23.730> delivery<00:00:24.150> happens<00:00:24.570> you'll<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the delivery happens you'll see that the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.849 
the delivery happens you'll see that the
yellow<00:00:26.490> line<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.119> my<00:00:27.330> cue<00:00:27.720> which<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> little

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
yellow line is my cue which is a little

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.550 
yellow line is my cue which is a little
bit<00:00:28.949> lower<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.279> I'd<00:00:29.460> said<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.990> don't<00:00:31.289> know

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
bit lower as I'd said and I don't know

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.590 
bit lower as I'd said and I don't know
if<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.859> really<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.790> very<00:00:33.360> clearly

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
if you can really see that very clearly

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.119 
if you can really see that very clearly
but<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:35.280> white<00:00:35.489> line<00:00:36.500> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.559> little<00:00:38.010> bit

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
but the the white line is a little bit

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.069 
but the the white line is a little bit
further<00:00:38.430> that's<00:00:38.820> your<00:00:39.149> cue<00:00:39.450> which<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
further that's your cue which is a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.959 
further that's your cue which is a
little<00:00:40.320> bit<00:00:40.410> higher<00:00:40.620> because<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> bridge

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
little bit higher because of the bridge

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.869 
little bit higher because of the bridge
hand<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.890> see<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.309> bridge<00:00:44.520> hand<00:00:44.550> is

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
hand and you can see your bridge hand is

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.049 
hand and you can see your bridge hand is
about<00:00:45.090> an<00:00:45.239> inch<00:00:45.420> closer<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> cue<00:00:47.760> ball<00:00:47.940> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
about an inch closer so the cue ball you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.479 
about an inch closer so the cue ball you
see<00:00:48.300> there<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.410> tip<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:49.770> fingers<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
see there the tip of your fingers in the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.200 
see there the tip of your fingers in the
black<00:00:50.670> glove<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.520> tip<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.940> my

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
black glove are here and the tip of my

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.959 
black glove are here and the tip of my
fingers<00:00:57.840> without<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.980> black<00:00:59.219> glove<00:00:59.609> are

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
fingers without the black glove are

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.420 
fingers without the black glove are
about<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.930> that's<00:01:01.289> yeah<00:01:01.590> an<00:01:02.039> inch<00:01:02.250> or

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
about there so that's yeah an inch or

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.109 
about there so that's yeah an inch or
two<00:01:03.439> closer<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.710> two<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> balls<00:01:05.580> width

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
two closer to two in the balls width

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.060 
two closer to two in the balls width
away<00:01:06.420> from<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> cue<00:01:07.170> ball<00:01:09.350> more<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
away from the cue ball more of the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:24.810 
away from the cue ball more of the
Newbridge<00:01:11.549> hand<00:01:15.080> press<00:01:16.080> play

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.180 

so<00:01:25.390> that's<00:01:25.600> interesting<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.530> backswing

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
so that's interesting the backswing

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.550 
so that's interesting the backswing
happened<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:28.690> end<00:01:28.900> of<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.140> backswing

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
happened the end of the backswing

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.270 
happened the end of the backswing
happened<00:01:29.920> at<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.070> same<00:01:30.310> time<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:33.040> leaves

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
happened at the same time you leaves

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.710 
happened at the same time you leaves
very<00:01:33.430> quickly<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:34.030> that's<00:01:34.120> not<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.540> that's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
very quickly and that's not it that's

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.360 
very quickly and that's not it that's
not<00:01:34.840> an<00:01:35.050> issue<00:01:35.200> I<00:01:35.380> mean<00:01:35.560> Mark<00:01:35.800> Allen<00:01:36.070> Peter

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
feel that you come to a stop in a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.530 
feel that you come to a stop in a
controlled<00:02:14.530> way<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.890> begin<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.970> delivery<00:02:16.390> in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
controlled way and begin the delivery in

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.970 
controlled way and begin the delivery in
a<00:02:16.600> controlled<00:02:17.110> way<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.530> well<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.650> at<00:02:23.770> half

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
a controlled way as well this is at half

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.100 
a controlled way as well this is at half
speed<00:02:24.190> by<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.580> way<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.209> difference<00:02:25.750> here

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
speed by the way so the difference here

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.670 
speed by the way so the difference here
in<00:02:26.350> gear<00:02:26.890> change<00:02:27.250> time<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.910> about<00:02:28.470> twice<00:02:29.470> what

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
in gear change time is about twice what

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:41.890 
in gear change time is about twice what
it<00:02:29.920> normally<00:02:30.040> would<00:02:30.430> be

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900

the line they started at and yeah both

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.520 
the line they started at and yeah both
plays<00:02:55.159> pretty<00:02:55.370> still<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.060> head<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:57.290> good

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
plays pretty still on the head so good

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.100 
plays pretty still on the head so good
