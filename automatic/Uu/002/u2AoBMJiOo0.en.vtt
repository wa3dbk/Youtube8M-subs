00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
believe except for the in gallon just

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.040 
believe except for the in gallon just
because<00:01:14.000> they're<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:14.330> long<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.600> time<00:01:14.780> when<00:01:14.960> I'm

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
because they're so long a time when I'm

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.330 
because they're so long a time when I'm
getting<00:01:15.140> tangled<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.770> got<00:01:15.950> those<00:01:16.130> in<00:01:16.159> the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
getting tangled so I got those in the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.700 
getting tangled so I got those in the
1.5<00:01:18.280> my<00:01:19.280> umbrella<00:01:20.180> obviously<00:01:20.870> is<00:01:21.100> right<00:01:22.100> there

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
1.5 my umbrella obviously is right there

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.900 
1.5 my umbrella obviously is right there
normally<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:24.830> would<00:01:24.950> be<00:01:24.980> tucked<00:01:25.310> in<00:01:25.490> but<00:01:25.760> the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
normally it would be tucked in but the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.280 
normally it would be tucked in but the
reason<00:01:26.180> it's<00:01:26.330> sitting<00:01:26.660> there<00:01:26.690> right<00:01:26.960> now<00:01:27.110> is

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
reason it's sitting there right now is

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.490 
reason it's sitting there right now is
because<00:01:27.470> all<00:01:28.430> I<00:01:28.520> have<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.030> my<00:01:30.310> my<00:01:31.310> NeoAir

and hadn't had a chance to you it's my
first<00:02:03.920> chance<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.250> really<00:02:04.340> get<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:04.790> thing<00:02:04.850> up

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
first chance to really get this thing up

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.450 
first chance to really get this thing up
and<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:05.510> I<00:02:05.570> figured<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:05.900> would<00:02:06.280> show<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:07.340> guys

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
and so I figured I would show you guys

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.440 
and so I figured I would show you guys
what<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:07.970> look<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.979> obviously<00:02:09.979> I've<00:02:10.129> got<00:02:10.310> a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
what it look like obviously I've got a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.670 
what it look like obviously I've got a
third<00:02:11.450> trekking<00:02:11.870> pole<00:02:12.080> out<00:02:12.260> here<00:02:12.470> but

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
third trekking pole out here but

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.320 
third trekking pole out here but
normally<00:02:12.800> if<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.310> was<00:02:13.459> if<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.849> was<00:02:13.879> going<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.180> tie

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
normally if I was if I was going to tie

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.300 
normally if I was if I was going to tie
that<00:02:14.360> up<00:02:14.629> like<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:15.019> would<00:02:15.260> probably<00:02:16.040> pick

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that up like that I would probably pick

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.570 
that up like that I would probably pick
up<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.519> stick<00:02:16.790> or<00:02:17.000> use<00:02:17.209> something<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
up a stick or use something out on the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.270 
up a stick or use something out on the
trail<00:02:19.879> like<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.450> tree<00:02:20.780> or<00:02:20.959> something<00:02:21.129> on<00:02:22.129> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
trail like a tree or something on the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.620 
trail like a tree or something on the
side<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.519> tied<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.379> swing<00:02:24.379> here<00:02:24.939> but

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
side I tied it to the swing here but

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.200 
side I tied it to the swing here but
this<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.530> what<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.770> looks<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:29.000> quite

half<00:02:50.690> feet<00:02:50.930> long<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:51.290> probably<00:02:51.560> would<00:02:51.770> have

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
half feet long I probably would have

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.320 
half feet long I probably would have
gotten<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.700> little<00:02:52.880> bit<00:02:53.030> longer<00:02:53.390> but<00:02:55.330> because

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
gotten a little bit longer but because

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.640 
gotten a little bit longer but because
Joe<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:57.670> thru-hiking<00:02:58.670> right<00:02:59.090> now<00:02:59.470> he<00:03:00.470> wasn't

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
Joe is a thru-hiking right now he wasn't

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.440 
Joe is a thru-hiking right now he wasn't
available<00:03:00.830> for<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.430> custom<00:03:01.820> setup<00:03:02.240> like<00:03:02.390> that

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
available for a custom setup like that

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.170 
available for a custom setup like that
so<00:03:02.990> I<00:03:03.440> may<00:03:04.070> end<00:03:04.100> up<00:03:04.340> as<00:03:04.520> soon<00:03:04.640> as<00:03:04.730> he<00:03:04.850> gets<00:03:05.000> back

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
so I may end up as soon as he gets back

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.700 
so I may end up as soon as he gets back
I<00:03:05.390> believe<00:03:05.600> he<00:03:05.690> gets<00:03:05.840> back<00:03:06.020> in<00:03:06.200> March<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.680> think
