00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
music in the past ten years I guess it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.010

was<00:01:34.440> only<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:35.820> only<00:01:36.090> gonna<00:01:36.300> take<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.810> long

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
was only it was only gonna take so long

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.190

before it got to an epod as well I think

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.190 
before it got to an epod as well I think
it<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.160> obviously<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.270> supposed<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.020> be
