00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
strings here in midfield I mean it's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.300 
strings here in midfield I mean it's
good<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.780> player<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.650> him<00:01:14.040> is

I'm<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.210> way<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.810> way<00:01:42.990> he<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.579> in<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.729> way<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I'm in a way in a way he was in a way it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
I'm in a way in a way he was in a way it
was<00:01:45.060> good<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.420> he<00:01:45.689> made<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.770> many<00:01:46.890> bad

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
was good that he made so many bad

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.770 
was good that he made so many bad
decisions<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.850> really<00:01:48.149> fired<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
decisions because it really fired up the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
decisions because it really fired up the
crowd<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.170> gave<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> game<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.740> ditch<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.549> I

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
crowd and gave the game a ditch well I

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
crowd and gave the game a ditch well I
think<00:01:50.759> Gary<00:01:51.149> Neville<00:01:51.450> must<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.990> been

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
think Gary Neville must have been

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
think Gary Neville must have been
slating<00:01:53.070> him<00:01:53.189> something<00:01:53.610> chronic<00:01:54.030> when<00:01:54.210> he

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
slating him something chronic when he

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.660 
slating him something chronic when he
was<00:01:54.479> doing<00:01:54.630> his<00:01:54.950> him<00:01:55.950> back<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> studio

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
was doing his him back in the studio

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.639 
was doing his him back in the studio

like he was so poor I've seen something

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.889 
like he was so poor I've seen something

watch with mother video the wooden tops
right<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.940> thought<00:02:09.450> he<00:02:09.599> was<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.170> our

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
right I thought he was going to have our

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.420 
right I thought he was going to have our
attack<00:02:10.709> like

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
attack like

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.699 
attack like
at<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.969> end<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> second<00:02:12.900> half<00:02:13.019> when<00:02:13.680> he

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
at the end in the second half when he

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.559 
at the end in the second half when he
really<00:02:14.219> sprinted<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.909> thought<00:02:15.180> he<00:02:15.299> was<00:02:15.390> going

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
really sprinted I thought he was going

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.030 
really sprinted I thought he was going
to<00:02:15.629> collapse<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:16.109> the<00:02:16.200> end<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.469> that<00:02:16.560> run<00:02:16.769> right

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
to collapse at the end of that run right

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.920 
to collapse at the end of that run right
because<00:02:17.939> he<00:02:18.030> didn't<00:02:18.269> look<00:02:18.359> like<00:02:18.420> he<00:02:18.599> moved

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
because he didn't look like he moved

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.750 
because he didn't look like he moved
anywhere<00:02:19.349> out<00:02:19.530> I'd<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.799> sent<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.099> circle<00:02:20.489> most
