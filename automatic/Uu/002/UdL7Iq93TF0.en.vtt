00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.509
 is starting one more girls geeks in the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.830
 kitchen and if you did not notice the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.880
 the gestures she is making in my 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.010
 head 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.010
 today we are going to make a brain bread 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:28.789
 the roque 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.870
 It is very is very easy to realize it 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.160
 huh 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.070
 I think it was very obvious, we're going 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.250
 make brain bread to brighten your 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.989
 raloim or when you have the Cambridge Chi 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.350
 the walking dead 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.449
 What do you want if you're in the dark? 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.280
 this bread it is relatively simple to 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.500
 do and we will not use the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.520
 The machine will use brute force 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.540
 love is going on the net and there but accepting 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.330
 everything and let the ingredients a spoon 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.830
 of organic yeast soup 3 tablespoons 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.660
 of brown sugar soup an entire egg 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.930
 3 tablespoons melted butter 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.200
 and it is red the flavor of your choice 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.930
 a cup of milk two and a half cups 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.830
 of flour a tablespoon of dye 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.780
 red 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.670
 Good to start, we'll get the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.539
 milk that is at the blood temperature 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.020
 human 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.970
 approximately 36 degrees to have seven 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.590
 and that it warms up a bit in the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.039
 microwave for about 30 seconds 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:44.360
 We'll put a bottle with the 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:49.490
 instant dry yeast that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.619
 This little one is going to let him 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.810
 Let's put it in here and let it 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.240
 He rest and think about his life. 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.259
 leaves him thinking about his life and 10 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.750
 minutes 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.670
 can mix can mix but there 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.670
 left after ten minutes quetinho 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.130
 that to give him a hoe gives a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.179
 It would be more of a chubby reaction, 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.179
 people follow the recipe 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.310
 the same post asked ivete sangalo 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.709
 Good folks after ten minutes is the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.790
 The reaction that will come is not too much 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.620
 It will stay and it will be closed and it is 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.360
 that 's just a lot of stuff 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.940
 it can rain it can go back to your height 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.620
 normal now we will mix the 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.720
 rest egg brown sugar and flour 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.349
 dye touches everything 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.110
 taka everything now director beautiful hands 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.489
 This party has to harvest you will see 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.080
 that but an hour will come that will not 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.130
 move that business will turn a stick 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.450
 only 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:03.130
 then you have to be washed with hands 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.130
 preference or favor 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.470
 the button is stirring here I will're one 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.470
 form with margarine and flour 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.500
 well then you gave the eight minutes that 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.469
 Aloisi is stirring there we go 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.299
 leave the bread in the nando an hour goes 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.859
 cover for over and place in place 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.159
 We 're going to run into the microwave in the dark. 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:44.500
 but I do not turn on the microphone and 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.540
 event like a zombie infected him 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.879
 the infection spread spread a lot 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.680
 people have to focus the bread to kill the 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.519
 and to take the air out of the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.969
 pasta 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.969
 that's a lot less and it would make teams 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.579
 thrash hand before handling this 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.599
 Mass because there it happens here 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:10.269
 following so a clash with angry 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:15.340
 someone who does not like thinks thinking 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:19.269
 thinking of thinking of coming a geleca and there 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.639
 you put your bread 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.930
 modeled in the best possible way 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:30.030
 brain that will give a melted brain 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.030
 it looks like a chewing gum is normal 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.979
 Let's go to the brain. 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.979
 and makes his grooves kind of like that 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.220
 right 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.750
 boot in your preheated oven to 180 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.750
 degrees for 15 minutes 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.520
 only the positive half of the people of 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:05:02.570
 my mother 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:02.570
 we take our brains off 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.480
 He is very fat 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.970
 we finished our brains he left 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.010
 hot of the oven is now giving more 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.680
 shape of the two hemispheres and then the 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.670
 people will decorate and then freeze them 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.830
 all this is that the artist of the house goes 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:26.250
 equity possibility well has already begun 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.110
 doing very slowly some just going 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.570
 separating the two hemispheres of the brain 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.570
 It's so slow and it goes back and forth. 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:43.070
 We're going to use two flavors because one 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.810
 It's going to be raspberry, which is more red. 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.020
 and blackberry that is more curious to give a 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:52.180
 Texture blood brain DRI 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:56.960
 finally let's get a polish first 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.800
 know size does not need your child 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.800
 and she won 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.539
 let's say smear with the jam of 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.970
 raspberry and now she's here by her side 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:21.060
 but to give a decorator that totals 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:29.139
 spread five opinions really does 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:32.199
 waste of power give four in one 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.860
 I think the Leiros peta after the show 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:38.650
 from ozzy eating I saw a pass to be the 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.599
 brain recipe he got googly 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.070
 disgusting will be successful in any 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.430
 halloween party you 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:48.250
 participate and that 's it until the next 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.130
 critical suggestions contact the 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:07:00.940
 steal girls dotcom geeks and this is it 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:07:04.710
 so close to the man it worked and I 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:08.370
 I'm faceless, your brain. 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.370
 Okay, I'm afraid.
