00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.799
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.829
 today we make this pincushion very easy to 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.510
 do and the very useful truth I invite you to 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.130
 that you subscribe to my channel giving 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.860
 click here 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.200
 give me a like and share this video 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.680
 well of the fabric we are going to cut two 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.289
 circles one to cover the cd as you see 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.129
 it has to be bigger bigger and one 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.769
 to cover the can of canned once 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.980
 that we have done this we take needle and 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.260
 thread and over the edge we will pass a 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.390
 sewing uncooked nothing simply 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.370
 we passed the posture on the edge of this 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.739
 way it does not matter if the thread is from another 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.690
 color as you can see since this 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.179
 posture is not going to be seen once 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.269
 we finished doing all the edge let's go 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:58.089
 to put the cde here in this way 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.329
 as focused as possible and we pull the 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.980
 thread until it is closed 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.500
 completely once here 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.050
 to finish and adjust well so that it is 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.409
 all very very sure the next step is 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.000
 do the same with the other circle a 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.790
 once we get to the final part we have to 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.280
 put the tin can here but 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.300
 before we have to put the king right I 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.820
 I think I have enough 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.820
 and now I put the cloth over 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.050
 cover it in this way and I'm going to pull the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.730
 thread as I did with the cde 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.130
 then how can they see has that 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.880
 to stay like this on exit let's finish 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.550
 to keep this in place by watching it 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.590
 is that we already have this and this we go 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.600
 let's stick it with each other 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.409
 in this good way once you have already 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.840
 glued 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.670
 we just have to decorate it 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.429
 so here it depends on your 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.770
 imagination and the materials that 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.140
 have of course I'm going to put a 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.290
 click here 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.230
 I can also paste some flower or 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.980
 something 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.369
 around here and it will be ready and fine so it is 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.280
 how I have stayed today's work 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.220
 a simple pincushion with few 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.200
 good materials friends and friends I hope 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.269
 that you liked today's recycling 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.400
 I hope you do too and 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.790
 see you in the next video until the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.790
 next 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
 Y 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.090
