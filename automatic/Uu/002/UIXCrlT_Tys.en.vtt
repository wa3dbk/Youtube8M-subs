 airport vnukovo his death shook 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.710
 he tried to imagine the whole of France 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.540
 the future and bring it to life it was 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.660
 a man to whom power could completely 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.750
 trust outstanding talent and generous 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.400
 patron death of the president of the concern total 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.800
 caused a storm of emotions and simple 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.960
 the French during his lifetime loved him and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.240
 hated often criticized fiercely but 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.779
 behind the eyes always called affectionately big 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.180
 mustache 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:40.829
 unfortunately in Russia his name is unknown 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:44.399
 no no unfortunately no no 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.070
 No, unfortunately I do not know, no, I can not 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.070
 say something like that day jeans and heir 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.289
 empire of champagne he was born in 1951 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.510
 year as they said the envious silver 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.010
 a spoon in his mouth actually seemed that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.530
 ahead of him waiting for a carefree life 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.689
 full of pleasure but young christoph 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.189
 decided not to go along the beaten track to 

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:03.479
 one moment he will quit marital 

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:04.830
 business and rush into the deep 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.659
 energy industry 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.009
 step by step it will pass through all the steps 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.780
 service ladder 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.340
 until finally one of the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 largest oil and gas companies in the world 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.330
 the very beginning of his career Kristof 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.950
 advocated cooperation with Russia 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.679
 actively participating in many collaborative 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.240
 projects but with a vision of sanctions policy 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.950
 they began to put pressure on him 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.720
 despite the house bans jerry is not 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.479
 I was afraid to come to Petersburg 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.130
 Economic Forum in the summer of 2014 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.319
 speaking for the construction of the south stream 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.429
 he is from his stupid position to put under 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.569
 threat to energy security 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.600
 Europe 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.399
 quote just to spoil Russia sanctions 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.140
 it may lead to nothing, they only 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.850
 will strengthen the cooperation of Russians considered 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.420
 behind the back of europe he said in an interview 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.289
 we are loyal to the French newspaper Russia 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.539
 want to continue 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.910
 invest in your country and we are ready 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.129
 share all the best that we have we 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.110
 oppose sanctions in principle i 

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:57.390
 Already said this before and ready to repeat 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.399
 again you must have heard 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.470
 I did not become more popular in my homeland 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.300
 since I often come across 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.819
 accusations of promoting their 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.190
 Russiaâ€™s vested interests have many 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.690
 friends and partners in the west we are not 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.099
 We believe that Russia can be 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.220
 isolated from global 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.750
 economic and political process 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.030
 as you can see a french man with a big mustache 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.530
 a lot of merit before russia and she 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.530
 will keep the bright memory of him
