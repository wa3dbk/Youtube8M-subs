00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
more wealth melted map Wow why can't I

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.670 
more wealth melted map Wow why can't I
say<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.569> melted<00:02:50.410> wax<00:02:50.769> all<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:52.269> way<00:02:52.390> across

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
say that melted wax all the way across

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.039 
say that melted wax all the way across
so<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.799> does<00:02:54.010> take<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.760> still<00:02:54.970> takes<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.510> couple

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
so it does take it still takes a couple

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.530 
so it does take it still takes a couple
hours<00:02:56.319> for<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.220> wax<00:02:57.609> to<00:02:57.790> pull<00:02:58.090> all<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.420> way

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
hours for the wax to pull all the way

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.960 
hours for the wax to pull all the way
across<00:02:59.250> because<00:03:00.250> even<00:03:00.430> though<00:03:00.609> there's<00:03:00.819> I

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
across because even though there's I

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.460 
across because even though there's I
mean<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.209> helps<00:03:01.690> good<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:01.989> there's<00:03:02.170> three

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
mean it helps good that there's three

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.360 
mean it helps good that there's three
weeks<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.519> melts<00:03:03.700> faster<00:03:04.060> but<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.890> burn<00:03:06.069> all

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
weeks so it melts faster but to burn all

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.789 
weeks so it melts faster but to burn all
the<00:03:06.519> way<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.569> sides<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.319> takes<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.680> couple

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
the way to the sides it takes a couple

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.970 
the way to the sides it takes a couple
hours<00:03:09.099> but<00:03:09.940> since<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.480> have<00:03:10.599> so<00:03:10.810> much<00:03:10.989> wax<00:03:11.349> and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
hours but since you have so much wax and

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.550 
hours but since you have so much wax and
there's<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:12.400> much<00:03:12.579> surface<00:03:13.000> area<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.599> fills<00:03:14.109> it

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
there's so much surface area it fills it

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.430

burned<00:04:15.370> them<00:04:15.549> again<00:04:15.819> but<00:04:16.120> there's<00:04:16.479> no<00:04:16.630> like

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
burned them again but there's no like

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.400 
burned them again but there's no like
huge<00:04:18.250> black<00:04:18.669> bulbs<00:04:19.150> on<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.359> talker<00:04:19.599> top<00:04:20.169> are

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
huge black bulbs on the talker top are

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.990 
huge black bulbs on the talker top are
like<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.709> mushroom<00:04:21.190> tops<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:22.590> there<00:04:23.849> there<00:04:24.849> is

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
like the mushroom tops so there there is

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.270 
like the mushroom tops so there there is
no<00:04:25.650> glass<00:04:26.650> lid

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
no glass lid

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.510 
no glass lid
but<00:04:27.790> they<00:04:27.880> do<00:04:27.940> have<00:04:28.180> this<00:04:28.300> plastic<00:04:28.960> lid<00:04:29.520> and

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
but they do have this plastic lid and

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.570 
but they do have this plastic lid and
actually<00:04:30.850> like<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.180> don't<00:04:31.270> like<00:04:31.540> these<00:04:32.310> lids<00:04:33.310> on

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
actually like I don't like these lids on

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.909 
actually like I don't like these lids on
the<00:04:33.670> top<00:04:33.910> of<00:04:33.940> these<00:04:34.389> you<00:04:35.080> can't<00:04:35.350> stack<00:04:35.680> these

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
the top of these you can't stack these

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.700 
the top of these you can't stack these
when<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:36.880> store<00:04:37.240> them<00:04:37.480> and<00:04:37.780> like<00:04:38.139> this<00:04:38.410> lid<00:04:38.680> is

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
when you store them and like this lid is

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.300 
when you store them and like this lid is
just<00:04:39.070> huge<00:04:39.850> like<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:40.900> creates<00:04:41.230> so<00:04:41.950> much<00:04:42.100> more

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
just huge like it creates so much more

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.740 
just huge like it creates so much more
room<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.700> don't<00:04:42.880> need<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.419> i<00:04:43.450> don't<00:04:43.660> really

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
room you don't need so i don't really

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.060 
room you don't need so i don't really
that's<00:04:44.050> another<00:04:44.320> thing<00:04:44.620> i<00:04:44.740> don't<00:04:44.860> like<00:04:44.980> about

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
that's another thing i don't like about

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.500 
that's another thing i don't like about
the<00:04:45.370> large<00:04:45.550> jars<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:47.560> um<00:04:48.090> I'm<00:04:49.090> actually<00:04:49.240> going

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
the large jars so um I'm actually going

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.850 
the large jars so um I'm actually going
to<00:04:49.600> take<00:04:49.750> another<00:04:49.960> one<00:04:50.169> because<00:04:50.260> this<00:04:50.560> lid

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
to take another one because this lid

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.020 
to take another one because this lid
doesn't<00:04:51.130> have<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:53.200> holes<00:04:53.610> usually<00:04:54.610> there's

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
doesn't have the holes usually there's

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.470 
doesn't have the holes usually there's
these<00:04:55.389> holes<00:04:55.870> on<00:04:56.260> top<00:04:56.490> it's<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.610> plastic<00:04:58.240> lid

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
these holes on top it's a plastic lid

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.560 
these holes on top it's a plastic lid
that<00:04:59.320> fits<00:04:59.350> on<00:04:59.770> top<00:04:59.850> but<00:05:00.850> I<00:05:01.000> mean<00:05:01.180> it's<00:05:01.330> sturdy

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
that fits on top but I mean it's sturdy

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.010 
that fits on top but I mean it's sturdy
enough<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.080> can<00:05:02.200> stack<00:05:02.710> on<00:05:03.690> these<00:05:04.690> three

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
enough that you can stack on these three

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.659 
enough that you can stack on these three
wick<00:05:05.169> tumblers<00:05:05.530> on<00:05:05.740> top<00:05:05.980> of<00:05:06.160> each<00:05:06.250> other<00:05:06.400> and

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
wick tumblers on top of each other and

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.090 
wick tumblers on top of each other and
they<00:05:07.210> have<00:05:07.450> like<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.080> hole<00:05:08.350> on<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.650> top<00:05:08.680> and

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
they have like a hole on the top and

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.659 
they have like a hole on the top and
bottom<00:05:09.600> so<00:05:10.600> that<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:11.050> can<00:05:11.230> smell<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.280> scent

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
bottom so that you can smell the scent

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.130 
bottom so that you can smell the scent
through<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.090> lid<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:16.419> I<00:05:16.600> really<00:05:16.840> like<00:05:16.990> that

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
through the lid and I really like that

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.360 
through the lid and I really like that
because<00:05:17.290> then<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:17.590> ventilates<00:05:17.890> you<00:05:18.220> know<00:05:18.310> you

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
because then it ventilates you know you

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.159 
because then it ventilates you know you
can<00:05:18.610> obviously<00:05:19.210> wait<00:05:19.540> till<00:05:19.720> it<00:05:19.810> cools<00:05:19.930> down

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
can obviously wait till it cools down

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.760 
can obviously wait till it cools down
since<00:05:20.620> it's<00:05:20.860> plastic<00:05:21.850> but<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:23.380> know<00:05:23.470> you<00:05:23.530> can

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
since it's plastic but you know you can

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.950 
since it's plastic but you know you can
put<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.010> lid<00:05:24.160> back<00:05:24.190> on<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.910> then<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:25.840> know

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
put the lid back on and then you know

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.780 
put the lid back on and then you know
you<00:05:26.020> can<00:05:26.290> stack<00:05:26.620> them<00:05:26.889> on<00:05:27.100> top<00:05:27.160> of<00:05:27.400> each<00:05:27.610> other

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
you can stack them on top of each other

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.580 
you can stack them on top of each other
so<00:05:28.150> I<00:05:28.180> love<00:05:28.450> that<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.840> mean<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.290> only<00:05:29.350> thing<00:05:29.440> I

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
so I love that I mean the only thing I

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.469 
so I love that I mean the only thing I
don't<00:05:29.650> like<00:05:29.919> is<00:05:30.040> that<00:05:30.220> they're<00:05:30.490> really<00:05:30.880> huge

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
don't like is that they're really huge

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.050 
don't like is that they're really huge
it's<00:05:31.840> hard<00:05:32.200> to<00:05:32.290> store<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:33.040> mean<00:05:33.520> it's<00:05:33.640> easy<00:05:33.790> you

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
it's hard to store I mean it's easy you

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.880 
it's hard to store I mean it's easy you
can<00:05:34.180> stack<00:05:34.419> them<00:05:34.630> but<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.080> need<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.290> lot<00:05:35.590> of

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
can stack them but you need a lot of

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.490 
can stack them but you need a lot of
room<00:05:36.250> since<00:05:36.610> like<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.720> mouth<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.169> jar<00:05:38.440> is

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
room since like the mouth of the jar is

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.460 
room since like the mouth of the jar is
so<00:05:38.950> why'd<00:05:39.570> they<00:05:40.570> take<00:05:40.720> up<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.930> lot<00:05:41.020> of<00:05:41.080> room<00:05:41.440> that

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
so why'd they take up a lot of room that

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.090 
so why'd they take up a lot of room that
way<00:05:41.919> but<00:05:42.580> if<00:05:42.700> you<00:05:42.940> are<00:05:42.970> looking<00:05:43.270> for<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:44.590> yankee

comparing that to a large jar a large

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.659

takes so long for the wax to pull all

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.700 
takes so long for the wax to pull all
the<00:06:34.479> way<00:06:34.570> across<00:06:34.690> because<00:06:35.140> it's<00:06:35.260> just<00:06:35.409> the<00:06:35.530> one

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
the way across because it's just the one

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.740 
the way across because it's just the one
wick<00:06:35.890> but<00:06:36.700> you<00:06:37.240> don't<00:06:37.360> have<00:06:37.419> to<00:06:37.479> worry<00:06:37.659> about
