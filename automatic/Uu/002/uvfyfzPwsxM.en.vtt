00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.900
 hello all and come a new video on 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.790
 the channel I call house and as 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.870
 always having them a new video and 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.430
 good gameplay people background 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.110
 we will be watching a game of call of 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.060
 duty advanced warfare that the truth more 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.090
 that nothing will be seeing a rookie 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.470
 try to do something however stay 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.820
 As the first place on my team, I think 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.360
 that went quite well because I think that 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.460
 of 1813 is quite positive of what 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.590
 that is not normal in my call of duty the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.600
 truth and in the end because I do not tell them 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.510
 how the game ended because I finished 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.460
 giving the buttocks to the last death already 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.500
 they will see it is something regrettable but good 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.359
 I think I went a little bit in the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.469
 next and so I share them and 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.329
 good people in this video we will be 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.570
 talking about a subject that the truth to 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:59.019
 I personally have what it is like 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.300
 taken out of wave not the exclusivities in 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.420
 the consoles there are many people who from 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.890
 suddenly good krauser is that there 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.930
 different times of exclusivity and are 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.880
 good because it makes like the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.160
 competition the truth is that if there 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.520
 several exclusivities violas would catalog 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.619
 in three in three they are like groups 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.170
 the first ones are the games that are born in 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.700
 the consoles are born 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.670
 because I tell you that consoles are born 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.009
 because because they originate 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.799
 come light as consoles exclusive 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.740
 with mobile software like halo like the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.560
 last of os as god of war games that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.470
 they are really good and why you already 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.909
 you identify a console or you become not 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.979
 I would like to say it like that but like a 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.380
 side is not you already know how good you 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.600
 liked the software in my case and you say 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.460
 chinga the new consoles come out 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 which I'm going though it can be 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.000
 that is a little better playstation 4 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.250
 I know that sooner or later go software 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.930
 will be released on xbox one so he opted for 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.789
 go for xbox band because I know that there they are 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.619
 the games that I like and it's like 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.690
 that what is catching you from the console 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.729
 no unfortunately I could not play 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.729
 the eyes for the same thing makes me a 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.130
 I play and that I do not play it but that 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.830
 is the subject of exclusivities is not 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.420
 the joke is now so the taste 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.890
 that 's good I think this 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.010
 exclusivity there well exclusivity is 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.019
 quite good as a break 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.239
 as of order in playstation 4 the truth 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.769
 are things that call the session and so 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.510
 that you decide to go from one 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.310
 another console there is another kind of 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.609
 exclusivity is that they are like to take back 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.900
 forgotten games 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.910
 it comes to mind games like 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.269
 killer bicing on xbox when a game 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.850
 I had years that nothing came out 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.200
 make network purchases start at 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.780
 work on a killer eating and then the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.730
 exclusive and exclusivity of xbox one 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.609
 there I do not see it wrong or in the case of 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.709
 Nintendo that good bayonet the bayonet 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.049
 2 I had neither feet nor head to where 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.840
 follow and nintendo said good I'll help you 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.500
 come and it becomes exclusive of nintendo 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.180
 out there he did not see the problem and I think that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.960
 that's a good way because because 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.330
 because we win not always 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.710
 as players we win so much in 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.930
 the exclusivities that arise in the 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.460
 consoles because that's where you start to see 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.720
 the competition and good hey I'm going to 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.510
 create this exclusive to give 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.070
 competition to this I am going to give this 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.050
 exclusive I will create the software for 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.290
 give competition to god of war or things 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.930
 so do not start generating ideas and you 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.370
 they come to offer new games and I think 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.100
 that draws much attention and is a 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.350
 healthy competition now the resume games 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.970
 that have already been forgotten I do not see it either 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.620
 bad because because good the players of 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.870
 killing the best and who appointed him 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.340
 it was the game that all bone fans 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.320
 colorado eating hoped the killing 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.450
 but at least there they have some killer 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.950
 instinct then I think it's something 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.320
 good because we keep winning 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.880
 we continue having games of the 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.380
 which are 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.420
 Well, if it had not been for those 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.460
 companies, we would not have the 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.080
 purchase of exclusivity is from games 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.270
 cross-platform is something that 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.920
 personal to me I'm not liking anything and 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.530
 it seems that our generation is going to be 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.050
 something very important for what I see in the 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.540
 console fight at the beginning of that 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.330
 we saw it on xbox one with dead 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.550
 rising 3 that was an exclusivity that 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.110
 later good jumped to pc but a 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.720
 multiplatform game that personally 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.540
 I had not played it but it could be that 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.959
 there are people who are bessÃ³n and that good that 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.030
 he is playstation player he liked 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.860
 a lot of playing of rising and then out of nowhere 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.520
 it came out exclusive and they will have stayed 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.410
 with four and you say one you have one of two 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.630
 or buy a console that maybe 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.200
 you did not plan to buy just for that 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.080
 game or just forget that saga not 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.920
 and I think it's something that is not very 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.990
 well then in these last days months 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.140
 and recently we have been seeing something 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.360
 and a little more marked with this same 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.520
 strategy not to stand out as a console 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.610
 buying exclusivity is like tomb 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.229
 raider 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.479
 very recently as street fighter 5 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.219
 tomb raider obviously for xbox one 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.990
 as exclusivity they still tell us that 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.479
 it's season then they say no 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.610
 Microsoft is going to distribute it and it does not 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.009
 block then they have like that to 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.449
 there goes away personally I am a follower 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.789
 of the tomb raider saga but 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.550
 obviously as I am an xbox one player 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:19.200
 I'm calm but I really do not 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.470
 it just makes me feel that people like 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.090
 as players sony playstation 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.760
 Suddenly, say no, you will not have this 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.920
 game at least in two years 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.720
 either for time I do not know why it's 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.430
 well that they have the possibilities of lcd 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.050
 good content is that thing that is 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.610
 generates for this console but so 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.550
 be a game that you say oral and you 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.650
 I buy it really street fighter 5 a 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.280
 game that has been multiplatform of 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.200
 years that is a super classic game not 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.060
 that from one day to the next they say yes 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.580
 notice that you have a group player 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.620
 you're going to have it really is a kick 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.910
 in the balls and we do not win but 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.340
 I do not swear to you that we do not win 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.050
 us because simply because 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.030
 we will not have the game the 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.570
 companies if they win they will continue to win 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.250
 money obviously the serious ones of game no 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.409
 and but but it is something that is not what 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.050
 staff I think it should not go on like this 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.269
 it's really annoying and bad because 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.679
 because it does not do anything more obviously the 

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:16.569
 companies have money they buy the 

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:18.759
 exclusivity and they do not do anything I do not think 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.800
 that they should strive more to generate 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.449
 good content that they have done but not 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.479
 I understand why they choose to be 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.159
 buying the health exclusives that in 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.959
 the personal I do not see well I do not know how 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.629
 see you people do not usually leave a 

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:33.629
 comment if you like it 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.589
 this to buy exclusive 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.669
 multiplatform to you if you do not 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:38.649
 like to buy exclusivities 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.759
 multiplatform so well then 

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.649
 he feels more than anything of this he wanted 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.149
 deal in the external video or point of 

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:44.979
 view of which is completely in 

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:47.860
 dislike so well people do not know 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.999
 sells comment your opinion your point of 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.349
 seen below in the comments that 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:51.610
 is very important and does not usually leave a 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.729
 like to share it with your friends to see 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.349
 to see what more people think not 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:59.019
 because this really feels like it's going to 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.999
 continue like this and hopefully and hopefully we can not 

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:02.019
 somehow put a stop to this like this 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:03.910
 Well then, good people. 

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:08.140
 liked this video a little 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.790
 in my opinion and it bothered to externalize this 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.620
 kind of things but well I'm not good at 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.360
 subscribe to the subscribed channel for more 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.740
 videos of each advanced uav series because 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.030
 later he will be bringing a tooth 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.890
 and 2.0 already trying to repeat this super 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.210
 game that for me is super game 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.190
 so then, good people, no more than 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.280
 say see you until next time 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.280
 bye
