00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
know will commit to 1.8 which means

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.860 
know will commit to 1.8 which means
obviously<00:00:11.610> it's<00:00:11.730> not<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:12.030> many<00:00:12.240> features<00:00:12.660> but

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
obviously it's not as many features but

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.629 
obviously it's not as many features but
there<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.110> still<00:00:13.259> bug<00:00:14.009> fixes<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
there is still bug fixes and

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.099 
there is still bug fixes and
optimizations<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.570> all<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
optimizations and all of this and the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.220 
optimizations and all of this and the
other<00:00:16.139> kind<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.039> first<00:00:17.250> off<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.109> there's<00:00:19.109> been

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
other kind so first off and there's been

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.859 
other kind so first off and there's been
an<00:00:19.320> improvement<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> f3<00:00:20.400> menu<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.240> I'll

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
an improvement to the f3 menu so I'll

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.710 
an improvement to the f3 menu so I'll
find<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.199> name<00:00:22.350> for<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:23.060> in<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.150> new<00:00:24.300> game<00:00:24.539> will

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
find the name for now in a new game will

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.500 
find the name for now in a new game will
for<00:00:24.930> reduced<00:00:25.320> debug<00:00:25.949> information<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:27.180> it's

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
for reduced debug information so it's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.210 
for reduced debug information so it's
kind<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.779> helpful<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.380> people<00:00:28.650> who<00:00:29.010> like

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
kind of helpful for people who like

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.580 
kind of helpful for people who like
makes<00:00:29.460> maps<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.179> some<00:00:30.449> servers<00:00:30.779> eyes<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.320> if

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
makes maps and some servers eyes so if

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.020 
makes maps and some servers eyes so if
you<00:00:31.679> press<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.830> free<00:00:32.160> first<00:00:32.399> no<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.850> get

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you press that free first no you get

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.639 
you press that free first no you get
your<00:00:33.120> normal<00:00:33.360> default<00:00:33.510> stuff<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.380> then<00:00:34.469> once

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
your normal default stuff and then once

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.750 
your normal default stuff and then once
you've<00:00:34.770> done<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.160> obviously<00:00:35.280> type<00:00:35.579> in

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you've done that you obviously type in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520 
you've done that you obviously type in
such<00:00:35.969> game<00:00:36.239> rule<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:36.840> reduced<00:00:37.200> debug

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
such game rule and it's reduced debug

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.020 
such game rule and it's reduced debug
info<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> weren't<00:00:38.430> true<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.850> false

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
info and then you weren't true or false

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
info and then you weren't true or false
now<00:00:39.510> seeds<00:00:39.780> false<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> moment<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
now seeds false at the moment so if it

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.549 
now seeds false at the moment so if it
had<00:00:41.340> been<00:00:41.370> true<00:00:41.670> comes<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.170> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
had been true comes up with this and you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.840 
had been true comes up with this and you
get<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:43.800> these<00:00:43.920> sub<00:00:44.160> skills<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.700> don't

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
get all these sub skills and I don't

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.369 
get all these sub skills and I don't
know<00:00:44.910> what<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.149> also<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:45.989> well<00:00:46.110> there's

know what this is also as well there's
also<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.550> turn<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:48.510> off<00:00:48.600> like

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809

skulls is so ugh well because you know
that's<00:01:13.380> how<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.530> works<00:01:13.760> but<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> know<00:01:14.880> there

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that's how it works but you know there

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.640 
that's how it works but you know there
was<00:01:15.240> they<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.509> look<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.960> same<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.470> know

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
was they all look the same you know

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.499 
was they all look the same you know
they've<00:01:17.040> been<00:01:17.070> added<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.210> fact<00:01:18.450> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
they've been added just the fact that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.940 
they've been added just the fact that
you<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.960> break<00:01:19.229> them<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you know you can break them like that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
you know you can break them like that
everything<00:01:20.549> pretty<00:01:20.670> cool<00:01:20.909> isn't<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.180> maybe

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
everything pretty cool isn't it maybe

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020 
everything pretty cool isn't it maybe
it's<00:01:22.020> slightly<00:01:22.200> weird<00:01:22.470> because<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:23.030> you're

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it's slightly weird because like you're

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.609 
it's slightly weird because like you're
doing<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.420> side<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> does<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.409> it

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
doing one side and it does all of it

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.170 
doing one side and it does all of it
