okay<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.100> for<00:00:02.399> how<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:02.879> stone<00:00:03.629> not<00:00:03.840> for

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
okay this is for how the stone not for

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.590 
okay this is for how the stone not for
the<00:00:04.200> fiddlestick<00:00:04.710> can<00:00:05.130> introduce<00:00:05.819> twists<00:00:06.450> in

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
the fiddlestick can introduce twists in

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.530 
the fiddlestick can introduce twists in
the<00:00:06.690> rope<00:00:07.370> let's<00:00:08.370> pipe<00:00:08.610> over<00:00:08.820> here<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.420> it's

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
the rope let's pipe over here and it's

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.000 
the rope let's pipe over here and it's
going<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.870> be<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.110> anchor<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.710> moment

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
going to be the anchor for a moment

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.980 
going to be the anchor for a moment
aside<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:14.179> normally<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.360> knot<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.780> want

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
aside so normally with a knot you want

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.689 
aside so normally with a knot you want
to<00:00:16.080> dress<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.500> knot<00:00:16.680> make<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.190> all<00:00:17.340> pretty<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
to dress the knot make it all pretty and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.849 
to dress the knot make it all pretty and
everything<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.539> avoid<00:00:18.840> twisting<00:00:19.500> it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
everything so you avoid twisting it

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.189 
everything so you avoid twisting it
holds<00:00:20.189> better<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.660> visually<00:00:22.109> and

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
holds better it just is visually and

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.070 
holds better it just is visually and
easy<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.680> inspect<00:00:23.100> etc<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.150> rappel<00:00:24.630> rope<00:00:24.660> on

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
easy to inspect etc so rappel rope on

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.980 
easy to inspect etc so rappel rope on
the<00:00:25.199> Left<00:00:25.410> pull<00:00:26.130> side<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.090> short<00:00:27.449> tail<00:00:27.630> left

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the Left pull side the short tail left

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.169 
the Left pull side the short tail left
after<00:00:28.980> you're<00:00:29.130> done<00:00:29.250> tying<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> right

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
after you're done tying it on the right

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.870 
after you're done tying it on the right
so<00:00:31.140> if<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:32.030> that's<00:00:33.030> stone<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:34.190> only<00:00:35.190> tied<00:00:35.579> up

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
so if you that's stone it's only tied up

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.740 
so if you that's stone it's only tied up
position<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.610> you<00:00:38.610> dress<00:00:38.879> everything<00:00:39.480> nice

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
position and you dress everything nice

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.910 
position and you dress everything nice
and<00:00:39.780> neat<00:00:46.760> there<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.930> again<00:00:49.260> rappel

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and neat there you go so again rappel

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.650 
and neat there you go so again rappel

everything's<00:00:52.289> untwisted<00:00:53.010> things<00:00:53.579> I'm

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
everything's untwisted things I'm

everything's untwisted things I'm
twisted<00:00:54.210> inside<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.379> knot<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:55.980> see

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
twisted inside the knot you can see

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.310 
twisted inside the knot you can see
there's<00:00:56.340> no<00:00:56.550> no<00:00:57.180> twists<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
there's no no twists going on in the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.369 
there's no no twists going on in the
knot<00:00:59.329> everything<00:01:00.329> looks<00:01:00.570> nice<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> smooth

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
knot everything looks nice and smooth

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.509 
knot everything looks nice and smooth
and<00:01:02.780> what<00:01:03.780> happens<00:01:04.229> that's<00:01:05.010> why<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> stone

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and what happens that's why the stone

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310 
and what happens that's why the stone
nuts<00:01:05.729> kind<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.060> counterintuitive<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:07.140> that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
nuts kind of counterintuitive in that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.260 
nuts kind of counterintuitive in that
way<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.040> think<00:01:08.250> everything's<00:01:08.670> gonna<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:09.060> nice

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
way you think everything's gonna be nice

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.380 
way you think everything's gonna be nice
and<00:01:09.299> smooth<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.100> have<00:01:11.100> no<00:01:11.250> twists<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.180> pull

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and smooth and have no twists you pull

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
and smooth and have no twists you pull
the<00:01:12.479> fiddlestick<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.770> pull<00:01:13.979> cord

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the fiddlestick out on your pull cord

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
the fiddlestick out on your pull cord
and<00:01:14.939> when<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> undo<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> stone<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and when you undo the stone not you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.140 
and when you undo the stone not you
would<00:01:16.920> pull<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.460> from<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> bottom<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
would pull it from the bottom of the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.240 
would pull it from the bottom of the
rappel<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> full<00:01:19.470> twist<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> rope

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
rappel you have a full twist in the rope

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.499 
rappel you have a full twist in the rope
good<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.420> tail<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.009> 360<00:01:23.009> degrees<00:01:23.340> around<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
good the tail is 360 degrees around the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.590 
good the tail is 360 degrees around the
rope<00:01:24.689> under<00:01:25.290> most<00:01:25.470> cases<00:01:25.909> probably<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.360> much

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
rope under most cases probably not much

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.700 
rope under most cases probably not much
of<00:01:27.720> an<00:01:27.810> issue<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.170> still<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> pull

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
of an issue it's still going to pull

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.830 
of an issue it's still going to pull
pretty<00:01:28.950> easily<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.119> times<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.689> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
pretty easily there are times when that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.410 
pretty easily there are times when that
one<00:01:31.079> twist<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:32.130> make<00:01:32.700> things<00:01:32.939> very<00:01:33.180> difficult

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
one twist can make things very difficult

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450 
one twist can make things very difficult
to<00:01:33.780> pull<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> sometimes<00:01:34.530> possibly<00:01:35.070> lock<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to pull and sometimes possibly lock the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.719 
to pull and sometimes possibly lock the
rope<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.560> when<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> tie<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> stone<00:01:38.460> not

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
rope up so when you tie the stone not

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.370 
rope up so when you tie the stone not
the<00:01:39.030> easiest<00:01:39.390> way<00:01:39.600> I've<00:01:39.720> found<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.200> sure

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the easiest way I've found to be sure

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440 
the easiest way I've found to be sure
that<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> twist<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that it's not going to twist all the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.359 
that it's not going to twist all the
twists<00:01:42.930> need<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.470> happen<00:01:43.890> while<00:01:44.220> you're

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
twists need that happen while you're

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.160 
twists need that happen while you're
tying<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.759> knot<00:01:44.909> need<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.450> maintained<00:01:45.930> in

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
tying a knot need to be maintained in

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
tying a knot need to be maintained in
the<00:01:46.229> knot<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> knot<00:01:47.280> will<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.579> visually

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the knot so the knot will be visually

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.719 
the knot so the knot will be visually
difficult<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> inspect<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.920> trying<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.460> tight

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
difficult to inspect so trying to tight

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.639 
difficult to inspect so trying to tight
a<00:01:50.759> specific<00:01:51.270> way<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.420> look<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.350> rather

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
a specific way and look at it is rather

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.080 
a specific way and look at it is rather
difficult<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.369> could<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> twist<00:01:53.909> going

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
difficult you could have the twist going

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.789 
difficult you could have the twist going
in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> wrong<00:01:54.479> direction<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.619> too

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
in the wrong direction you can have too

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.190 
in the wrong direction you can have too
many<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.219> enough<00:01:56.899> easiest<00:01:57.899> way<00:01:58.049> I've<00:01:58.170> found

is<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.619> take<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> left<00:01:59.460> hand<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.180> this

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
is to take the left hand and in this

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.179 
is to take the left hand and in this
case<00:02:00.570> use<00:02:00.990> whatever<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.409> want<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:01.799> take<00:02:01.979> one

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
case use whatever you want but take one

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.730 
case use whatever you want but take one
hand<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.700> hold<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> tail<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.439> rappel

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
hand and hold the tail and the rappel

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.410 
hand and hold the tail and the rappel
rope<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.280> none<00:02:05.430> twisted<00:02:05.850> fashion<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
rope in a none twisted fashion of the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
rope in a none twisted fashion of the
way<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.570> want<00:02:06.899> while<00:02:07.680> you're<00:02:07.860> holding<00:02:08.039> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
way you want while you're holding that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.940 
way you want while you're holding that
don't<00:02:08.670> allow<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.239> rotate<00:02:09.660> at<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.200> take<00:02:10.770> the

don't allow it to rotate at all take the
other<00:02:11.220> hand<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.720> tie<00:02:12.720> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
other hand and tie this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.320 
other hand and tie this
not<00:02:13.320> with<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.550> go<00:02:14.700> ahead<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.910> pull<00:02:15.240> them

not with it so go ahead and pull them

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.200 
not with it so go ahead and pull them
and<00:02:15.480> give<00:02:15.570> myself<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.960> little<00:02:16.020> more<00:02:16.200> tail<00:02:16.500> here

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
and give myself a little more tail here

more length side with go ahead and then

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.730 
more length side with go ahead and then
make<00:02:20.700> sure<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.030> these<00:02:21.150> aren't<00:02:21.420> rotating<00:02:21.990> tie

the fiddle in it and as you're tying it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.950 
the fiddle in it and as you're tying it
you<00:02:29.340> want<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.730> sure<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.360> kept

all the twists that you created while

all the twists that you created while
tying<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.320> are<00:02:37.500> inside<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.340> knot<00:02:38.550> notice

tying it are inside the knot notice

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.550 
tying it are inside the knot notice
there's<00:02:39.270> some<00:02:39.510> twisting<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:39.959> going<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.320> there

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
there's some twisting is going on there

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.949 
there's some twisting is going on there
there<00:02:41.160> are<00:02:41.610> chances<00:02:42.120> for<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.480> twist<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
there are chances for that twist to

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.720 
there are chances for that twist to
migrate<00:02:43.320> outside<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.070> knot<00:02:44.220> down<00:02:44.490> here

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
migrate outside of the knot down here

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.830 
migrate outside of the knot down here
between<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.180> knot<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.450> your<00:02:45.540> hand<00:02:45.690> while

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
between the knot in your hand while

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.270 
between the knot in your hand while
you're<00:02:45.990> tying<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.709> sure<00:02:46.890> those<00:02:47.100> get

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
you're tying it just be sure those get

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.070 
you're tying it just be sure those get
pushed<00:02:47.580> up<00:02:47.790> inside<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.510> knot<00:02:48.690> when<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.930> do

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
pushed up inside the knot when you do

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.900 
pushed up inside the knot when you do
that<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.740> everything<00:02:50.010> looks<00:02:50.160> good<00:02:50.459> if<00:02:50.700> you'll

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
that so everything looks good if you'll

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.150 
that so everything looks good if you'll
notice<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.390> knot<00:02:51.540> now<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.900> visually<00:02:52.890> more

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
notice that knot now is visually more

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.830 
notice that knot now is visually more
difficult<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.820> inspect<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.390> got<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.570> twist

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
difficult to inspect you got a twist

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.610 
difficult to inspect you got a twist
going<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:55.850> continues<00:02:56.850> around<00:02:57.180> here

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
going on here continues around here

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.320 
going on here continues around here
these<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:59.160> kind<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.400> overlap<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.850> little<00:03:00.180> bit

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
these just kind of overlap a little bit

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.300 
these just kind of overlap a little bit
if<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.720> migrate<00:03:01.260> those<00:03:01.500> twists<00:03:01.920> around<00:03:02.190> to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
if you migrate those twists around to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.010 
if you migrate those twists around to
try<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.489> make<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.850> visually<00:03:03.270> easy<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.660> look<00:03:03.780> at

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
try to make it visually easy to look at

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.710 
try to make it visually easy to look at
you'll<00:03:04.770> find<00:03:05.070> it's<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.550> really<00:03:06.060> an<00:03:06.150> easy<00:03:06.270> task

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
you'll find it's not really an easy task

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.470 
you'll find it's not really an easy task
so<00:03:07.260> tying<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.830> knot<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.310> way<00:03:08.520> keeps<00:03:09.180> things

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
so tying a knot in this way keeps things

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.360 
so tying a knot in this way keeps things
where<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.750> want<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.140> everything's<00:03:11.070> nice<00:03:11.340> and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
where you want it everything's nice and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.690 
where you want it everything's nice and
secure<00:03:12.680> when<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.770> pull<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> fiddlestick<00:03:14.520> out

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
secure when you pull the fiddlestick out

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.289 
secure when you pull the fiddlestick out
in<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:14.940> case<00:03:16.459> then<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.580> release<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.880> stone

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
in this case then you release the stone

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.199 
in this case then you release the stone
knot<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.690> will<00:03:18.720> have<00:03:19.070> no<00:03:20.070> twists<00:03:20.549> everything

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
knot you will have no twists everything

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.870 
knot you will have no twists everything
comes<00:03:21.810> out<00:03:21.959> completely<00:03:22.440> untwisted<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.700> that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
comes out completely untwisted so that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.910 
comes out completely untwisted so that
is<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.269> best<00:03:24.840> way<00:03:25.049> that<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.230> found<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.680> tie<00:03:25.860> it

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
is the best way that I found to tie it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.440 
is the best way that I found to tie it
is<00:03:26.130> again<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:26.700> hold<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.180> with<00:03:27.660> one<00:03:27.900> hand

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
is again just hold that with one hand

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.630 
is again just hold that with one hand
take<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.600> other<00:03:30.900> hand<00:03:31.140> tie<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.799> stone<00:03:32.160> and

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
take the other hand tie the stone and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.750 
take the other hand tie the stone and
just<00:03:33.380> allow<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.440> rope<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.920> twist<00:03:35.190> any<00:03:35.430> way<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
just allow the rope to twist any way it

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.270 
just allow the rope to twist any way it
wants<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.150> twist<00:03:36.480> while<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.930> maintain<00:03:37.470> these

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
wants to twist while you maintain these

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.970 
wants to twist while you maintain these
in<00:03:38.730> one<00:03:39.390> position<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.140> let<00:03:40.410> those<00:03:40.530> stay<00:03:40.860> in

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
in one position and let those stay in

the<00:03:41.100> other<00:03:41.250> position<00:03:41.430> when<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.480> untie<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.900> it

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
the other position when you untie it it

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.490 
the other position when you untie it it
will<00:03:44.010> be<00:03:44.209> tangle<00:03:45.209> free<00:03:45.350> one<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
will be tangle free one of the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.620 
will be tangle free one of the
situations<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.610> make<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.390> little

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
situations that can make this a little

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.360 
situations that can make this a little
bit<00:03:48.840> worse<00:03:49.080> if<00:03:49.350> you're<00:03:49.500> not<00:03:49.650> paying<00:03:49.890> attention

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
bit worse if you're not paying attention

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.120 
bit worse if you're not paying attention
or<00:03:50.519> more<00:03:50.760> difficult<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.480> achieve<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:52.260> if

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
or more difficult to achieve is if

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.620 
or more difficult to achieve is if
you're<00:03:53.250> tying<00:03:53.489> on<00:03:53.700> an<00:03:53.850> anchor<00:03:54.120> such<00:03:54.420> as

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
you're tying on an anchor such as

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.229 
you're tying on an anchor such as
webbing<00:03:54.989> or<00:03:55.080> something<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:55.830> rotate<00:03:56.239> if

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
webbing or something that can rotate if

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.820 
webbing or something that can rotate if
you'll<00:03:57.480> notice<00:03:57.870> when<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.560> go<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:59.030> tie<00:04:00.030> that

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
you'll notice when you go to tie that

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.740 
you'll notice when you go to tie that
watch<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:02.190> webbing<00:04:02.580> at<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.820> top<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.510> will

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
watch that webbing at the top it will

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.320 
watch that webbing at the top it will
rotate<00:04:03.959> see<00:04:04.799> how<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.100> did<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.370> rotating<00:04:05.850> so

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
rotate see how that did the rotating so

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.300 
rotate see how that did the rotating so
you'll<00:04:06.510> think<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.739> tied<00:04:08.040> everything

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
you'll think that you tied everything

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.120 
you'll think that you tied everything
perfect<00:04:08.910> which<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.239> are

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.040 

just<00:04:14.880> like<00:04:15.060> you<00:04:15.210> wanted<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.600> you<00:04:15.810> held

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.050 
just like you wanted it you held

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.530 
just like you wanted it you held
everything<00:04:16.530> perfect<00:04:17.040> but<00:04:17.880> while<00:04:18.300> you<00:04:18.510> were

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
everything perfect but while you were

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.110 
everything perfect but while you were
tying<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.170> this<00:04:19.470> was<00:04:19.680> allowed<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:20.100> rotate<00:04:20.250> so

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
tying it this was allowed to rotate so

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.390 
tying it this was allowed to rotate so
when<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.330> pull<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.630> fiddle<00:04:21.959> stick<00:04:22.400> you'll

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
when you pull the fiddle stick you'll

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.280 
when you pull the fiddle stick you'll
have<00:04:23.640> that<00:04:23.850> twist<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.390> it's<00:04:24.660> not<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.020> twist

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
have that twist and it's not the twist

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.440 
have that twist and it's not the twist
that<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.740> happen<00:04:26.250> inside<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.970> knot<00:04:27.150> it's

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
that you happen inside the knot it's

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.790 
that you happen inside the knot it's
because<00:04:27.780> your<00:04:27.930> webbing<00:04:28.230> was<00:04:28.410> allowed<00:04:28.680> to

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
because your webbing was allowed to

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.730 
because your webbing was allowed to
rotate<00:04:28.980> so<00:04:29.970> keep<00:04:30.870> an<00:04:31.020> eye<00:04:31.110> on<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:31.560> when

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
rotate so keep an eye on that when

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.000 
rotate so keep an eye on that when
you're<00:04:31.860> doing<00:04:31.980> it<00:04:32.220> on<00:04:33.530> anchors<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.560> can

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
you're doing it on anchors that can

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.810 
you're doing it on anchors that can
rotate<00:04:35.310> on<00:04:35.700> you<00:04:35.990> tie<00:04:36.990> your<00:04:37.170> knot<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.680> just<00:04:38.670> pay

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
rotate on you tie your knot and just pay

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.000 
rotate on you tie your knot and just pay
careful<00:04:39.150> attention<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.840> hold<00:04:40.110> things<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:40.860> that

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
careful attention to hold things so that

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.910 
careful attention to hold things so that
that<00:04:41.190> doesn't<00:04:41.580> rotate<00:04:41.760> at<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.120> top<00:04:42.920> makes

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
that doesn't rotate at the top makes

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.220 
that doesn't rotate at the top makes
things<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.280> little<00:04:44.370> more<00:04:44.520> difficult<00:04:45.080> again<00:04:46.080> in

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
things a little more difficult again in

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.530 
things a little more difficult again in
most<00:04:46.410> cases<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:47.010> won't<00:04:47.280> really<00:04:47.550> be<00:04:47.820> too<00:04:48.150> big

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
most cases this won't really be too big

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.960 
most cases this won't really be too big
of<00:04:48.780> an<00:04:49.020> issue<00:04:49.170> but<00:04:49.890> it's<00:04:50.070> nice<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.310> know<00:04:50.610> just

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
of an issue but it's nice to know just

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.910 
of an issue but it's nice to know just
in<00:04:51.060> case<00:04:51.120> they<00:04:51.570> are<00:04:51.750> an<00:04:52.020> issue<00:04:52.290> or<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.740> concern

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
in case they are an issue or a concern

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.980 
in case they are an issue or a concern
if<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.730> get<00:04:53.850> in<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.030> habit<00:04:54.180> of<00:04:54.420> tying<00:04:54.660> it<00:04:54.780> that

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
if you get in the habit of tying it that

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.310 
if you get in the habit of tying it that
way

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
way

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.960 
way
then<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:55.920> usually<00:04:56.100> won't<00:04:56.370> have<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.760> worry

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
then you usually won't have to worry

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.940 
then you usually won't have to worry
about<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:57.360> or<00:04:57.540> try<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.840> figure<00:04:58.110> out<00:04:58.260> when<00:04:58.800> you

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
about it or try to figure out when you

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.560 
about it or try to figure out when you
need<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.190> tie<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.610> with<00:04:59.790> no<00:04:59.940> twist<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:00.450> when

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
need to tie it with no twist and when

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.270 
need to tie it with no twist and when
you<00:05:00.660> don't<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.110> it'll<00:05:01.560> just<00:05:01.680> be<00:05:01.830> habit<00:05:02.190> and

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
you don't and it'll just be habit and

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.690 
you don't and it'll just be habit and
you'll<00:05:02.400> have<00:05:02.580> always<00:05:02.910> have<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.180> untwisted
