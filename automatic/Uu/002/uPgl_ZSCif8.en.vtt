they feel the spring jump and kind of

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.130 
they feel the spring jump and kind of
matches<00:02:12.989> all<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.940> know<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.780> bearing

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
not easy to jump in and then for the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.430 
not easy to jump in and then for the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
all the weight on that if you make a lot

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.280 
all the weight on that if you make a lot
more<00:02:37.920> noise

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
more noise

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.390 
more noise
