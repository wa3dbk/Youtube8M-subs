welcome<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.860> maths<00:00:02.070> master<00:00:02.580> org<00:00:03.210> let's<00:00:04.110> have<00:00:04.259> a

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
welcome to maths master org let's have a

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.619 
welcome to maths master org let's have a
look<00:00:04.470> at<00:00:04.620> doing<00:00:04.770> calculations<00:00:05.580> with<00:00:06.150> mixed

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
look at doing calculations with mixed

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.860 
look at doing calculations with mixed
numbers<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.230> fractions<00:00:08.389> mixed<00:00:09.389> number<00:00:09.719> and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
numbers and fractions mixed number and

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.410 
numbers and fractions mixed number and
frenching<00:00:10.349> calculations<00:00:11.099> look<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.150> as

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
frenching calculations look like this as

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.839 
frenching calculations look like this as
you<00:00:13.170> can<00:00:13.349> see<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:14.130> can<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.400> adding

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
you can see you can be adding

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.300 
you can see you can be adding
subtracting<00:00:15.320> timesing<00:00:16.320> or<00:00:16.470> dividing<00:00:17.100> them

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
subtracting timesing or dividing them

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.230 
subtracting timesing or dividing them
and<00:00:17.720> you<00:00:18.720> may<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.470> mixed<00:00:19.949> number<00:00:20.240> for

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and you may have a mixed number for

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.320 
and you may have a mixed number for
example<00:00:21.660> x<00:00:22.080> by<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> fraction<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.180> look

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
example x by a fraction or if you look

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.300 
example x by a fraction or if you look
at<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> bottom<00:00:24.900> example<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.160> may

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
at the bottom example here you may

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
at the bottom example here you may
actually<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:27.060> two<00:00:27.840> mixed<00:00:28.199> numbers<00:00:28.500> together

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
actually have two mixed numbers together

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.790 
actually have two mixed numbers together
in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> same<00:00:29.310> calculation<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.330> 8<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> 2/3<00:00:31.560> add

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
in the same calculation so 8 and 2/3 add

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
in the same calculation so 8 and 2/3 add
4<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.759> 1/8<00:00:34.520> what<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.760> lesson<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
4 and 1/8 what this lesson is about is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.209 
4 and 1/8 what this lesson is about is
focusing<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.250> how<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.550> would<00:00:38.850> go<00:00:39.059> about

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
focusing on how we would go about

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.560 
focusing on how we would go about
answering<00:00:41.219> these<00:00:41.460> questions<00:00:41.520> how<00:00:42.210> would<00:00:42.390> we

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
answering these questions how would we

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.459 
answering these questions how would we
actually<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:43.500> calculations<00:00:45.469> before

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
actually do these calculations before

there's<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.200> lot<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.530> work<00:01:07.740> there<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:09.000> you've

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
there's a lot of work there but you've

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.870 
there's a lot of work there but you've
really<00:01:09.540> got<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.220> doing

really got to be really good at doing

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.960 
really got to be really good at doing
all<00:01:12.030> those<00:01:12.210> 4<00:01:12.540> operations<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.290> fractions

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
all those 4 operations on fractions

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.820 
all those 4 operations on fractions
before<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.240> move<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.750> learning<00:01:16.320> how<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.530> do

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
before you move on to learning how to do

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.399 
before you move on to learning how to do
calculations<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:18.420> mixed<00:01:18.900> numbers<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
calculations with mixed numbers and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.039 
calculations with mixed numbers and
fractions<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> make<00:01:21.090> sure<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.509> you're<00:01:21.720> okay

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
fractions so make sure that you're okay

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.230 
fractions so make sure that you're okay
at<00:01:22.140> those<00:01:22.380> two<00:01:22.619> things<00:01:22.830> before<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:24.060> on

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
at those two things before you go on

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.569 
at those two things before you go on
with<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> lesson<00:01:27.200> whilst<00:01:28.200> all<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.710> mixed

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
with this lesson whilst all these mixed

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.149 
with this lesson whilst all these mixed
number<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.270> fractions<00:01:30.930> questions<00:01:31.650> look

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
number and fractions questions look

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.730 
number and fractions questions look
different<00:01:32.820> they're<00:01:33.479> actually<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.110> answered

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
different they're actually all answered

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.580 
different they're actually all answered
using<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.549> very<00:01:35.970> very<00:01:36.360> similar<00:01:36.840> process<00:01:37.110> it's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
using a very very similar process it's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.069 
using a very very similar process it's
actually<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.250> same<00:01:38.549> each<00:01:38.759> time<00:01:38.900> it's<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
actually the same each time it's a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.219 
actually the same each time it's a
two-step<00:01:40.590> process<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:42.299> relates<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
two-step process and it relates back to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.899 
two-step process and it relates back to
those<00:01:43.409> two<00:01:43.920> things<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.310> you've<00:01:44.520> got<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> be

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
those two things that you've got to be

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
those two things that you've got to be
able<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.420> before<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.380> go<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.860> do

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
able to do before you can go on and do

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.580 
able to do before you can go on and do
these<00:01:47.130> calculations<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> first<00:01:49.200> thing

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
these calculations so the first thing

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
these calculations so the first thing
you<00:01:49.770> should<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.250> when<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> mixed

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
you should do when you get a mixed

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.069 
you should do when you get a mixed
number<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.700> fracturing<00:01:53.700> calculation<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
number and fracturing calculation the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.770 
number and fracturing calculation the
first<00:01:55.470> thing<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.770> should<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.520> convert<00:01:57.450> all

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
first thing you should do is convert all

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.789 
first thing you should do is convert all
of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.350> mixed<00:01:58.710> numbers<00:01:59.159> into<00:01:59.850> improper

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
of the mixed numbers into improper

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.289 
of the mixed numbers into improper
fractions<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.170> rewrite<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.040> sum<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.460> but

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
fractions so you rewrite the sum out but

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.999 
fractions so you rewrite the sum out but
rather<00:02:06.600> than<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> mixed<00:02:07.350> numbers<00:02:07.770> you

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
rather than the mixed numbers you

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.460 
rather than the mixed numbers you
convert<00:02:08.520> all<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:09.030> them<00:02:09.270> into<00:02:09.569> improper

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
convert all of them into improper

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.290 
convert all of them into improper
fractions<00:02:11.180> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
fractions the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.660 
fractions the
second<00:02:12.660> thing<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.020> do<00:02:13.200> then<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.460> that

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
second thing you do then is now that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.360 
second thing you do then is now that
you've<00:02:14.790> got<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.930> Sun<00:02:16.200> written<00:02:16.530> out<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:17.160> in

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you've got the Sun written out just in

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.600 
you've got the Sun written out just in
fraction<00:02:18.000> form<00:02:18.320> you<00:02:19.320> then<00:02:19.560> go<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.400> add

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
fraction form you then go on and add

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.360 
fraction form you then go on and add
subtract<00:02:21.150> multiply<00:02:21.180> divide<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.890> fractions

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
subtract multiply divide the fractions

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.700 
subtract multiply divide the fractions
as<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.670> normally<00:02:23.820> would<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:25.230> whatever<00:02:25.530> you

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
as you normally would so whatever you

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.500 
as you normally would so whatever you
have<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.190> if<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.610> an<00:02:26.760> addition<00:02:27.150> some<00:02:27.360> you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
have to do if it's an addition some you

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.990 
have to do if it's an addition some you
go<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.810> add<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.110> fractions<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:32.000> let's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
go and add the fractions and so on let's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.760 
go and add the fractions and so on let's
have<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.240> look<00:02:33.360> at<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> few<00:02:33.750> examples<00:02:33.780> now<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.500> see

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
have a look at a few examples now to see

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.490 
have a look at a few examples now to see
if<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.070> get<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> hang<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.510> -<00:02:37.260> Anna

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
if we can get the hang of it so - Anna

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.440 
if we can get the hang of it so - Anna
10th<00:02:37.800> turn<00:02:38.340> 1/10<00:02:38.880> times<00:02:39.480> by<00:02:40.010> 1/3<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:42.180> first

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
10th turn 1/10 times by 1/3 the first

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.540 
10th turn 1/10 times by 1/3 the first
thing<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.110> all<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.010> mixed<00:02:44.220> numbers

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
thing you do is all of the mixed numbers

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.010 
thing you do is all of the mixed numbers
you<00:02:44.970> turn<00:02:45.300> into<00:02:45.800> improper<00:02:46.800> fractions<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.510> 2

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
you turn into improper fractions so 2

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.420 
you turn into improper fractions so 2
and<00:02:49.200> 1/10<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:50.640> 20<00:02:51.330> one<00:02:51.630> tenth<00:02:52.080> as<00:02:52.860> an<00:02:53.070> improper

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
and 1/10 is 20 one tenth as an improper

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.420 
and 1/10 is 20 one tenth as an improper
fraction<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:54.140> now<00:02:55.140> we've<00:02:55.410> rewritten<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:56.160> sum

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
fraction so now we've rewritten the sum

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.390 
fraction so now we've rewritten the sum
out<00:02:57.470> just<00:02:58.520> using<00:02:59.520> fractions<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.920> then<00:03:01.920> we<00:03:02.220> go

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
out just using fractions and then we go

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.240 
out just using fractions and then we go
on<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.840> multiply<00:03:03.840> these<00:03:04.170> two<00:03:04.590> fractions<00:03:04.620> as

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
on and multiply these two fractions as

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.280 
on and multiply these two fractions as
we<00:03:05.370> normally<00:03:05.520> would<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.690> multiplying

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
we normally would so multiplying

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.040 
we normally would so multiplying
fractions<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:08.430> do<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.970> numerator<00:03:09.570> times

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
fractions you do a numerator times

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.120 
fractions you do a numerator times
numerator<00:03:10.520> 21<00:03:11.520> times<00:03:11.820> 1<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.180> 21<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:14.010> do

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
numerator 21 times 1 is 21 and you do

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.670 
numerator 21 times 1 is 21 and you do
denominator<00:03:14.760> times<00:03:15.240> denominator<00:03:15.330> 10<00:03:16.290> times<00:03:16.530> 3

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
denominator times denominator 10 times 3

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.770 
denominator times denominator 10 times 3
is<00:03:16.800> 30<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.760> nominator<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.510> answer

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
is 30 so that a nominator of the answer

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.070 
is 30 so that a nominator of the answer
is<00:03:18.900> 30<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> our<00:03:20.760> answer<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:21.540> question<00:03:21.959> is

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
is 30 so our answer to this question is

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.600 
is 30 so our answer to this question is
21<00:03:23.150> thirtieths<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.890> course<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.250> could<00:03:26.430> go

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
21 thirtieths and of course you could go

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.080 
21 thirtieths and of course you could go
on<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.940> simplify<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.750> fraction<00:03:28.370> if<00:03:29.370> you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
on to simplify that fraction if you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.910 
on to simplify that fraction if you
wanted<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.690> let's<00:03:31.380> have<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> look<00:03:31.739> at<00:03:31.890> a

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
wanted to let's have a look at a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.880 
wanted to let's have a look at a
division<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:32.700> some<00:03:32.910> now<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.810> we'll<00:03:34.110> do<00:03:34.380> 2<00:03:34.800> and

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
division of some now so we'll do 2 and

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.050 
division of some now so we'll do 2 and
1/4<00:03:35.130> divided<00:03:35.760> by<00:03:36.060> one<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.630> five-eighths

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
1/4 divided by one and five-eighths

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.300 
1/4 divided by one and five-eighths
first<00:03:39.060> step<00:03:39.330> convert<00:03:40.050> all<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.530> mixed<00:03:40.920> numbers

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
first step convert all the mixed numbers

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.479 
first step convert all the mixed numbers
into<00:03:41.700> improper<00:03:42.450> fractions<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:44.340> 2<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.150> 1/4<00:03:45.660> is

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
into improper fractions so 2 and 1/4 is

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.870 
into improper fractions so 2 and 1/4 is
nine<00:03:47.600> quarters<00:03:48.600> as<00:03:48.870> an<00:03:49.080> improper<00:03:49.500> fraction<00:03:49.880> 1

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
nine quarters as an improper fraction 1

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.540 
nine quarters as an improper fraction 1
and<00:03:51.060> 5/8<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:52.020> 13<00:03:52.890> eighths

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
and 5/8 is 13 eighths

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.080 
and 5/8 is 13 eighths
as<00:03:53.670> an<00:03:53.880> improper<00:03:54.300> fraction<00:03:55.489> okay<00:03:56.489> now<00:03:56.910> we've

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
as an improper fraction okay now we've

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.479 
as an improper fraction okay now we've
got<00:03:57.270> to<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:57.540> point<00:03:57.840> we<00:03:58.470> adjust<00:03:59.160> do<00:03:59.340> the

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
got to this point we adjust do the

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.940 
got to this point we adjust do the
division<00:03:59.760> sum<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.480> fractions<00:04:01.440> as<00:04:01.650> we're

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
division sum on the fractions as we're

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.130 
division sum on the fractions as we're
familiar<00:04:02.190> with<00:04:04.160> so<00:04:05.330> divide<00:04:06.330> fractions<00:04:06.630> can

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
familiar with so divide fractions can

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.020 
familiar with so divide fractions can
you<00:04:07.230> remember<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.650> rule<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.640> have<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:08.940> take

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
you remember the rule you have to take

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.790 
you remember the rule you have to take
the<00:04:09.150> second<00:04:09.480> fraction<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:09.959> take<00:04:10.620> its

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
the second fraction and take its

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.060 
the second fraction and take its
reciprocal<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:12.480> means<00:04:12.720> turn<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.620> fraction

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
reciprocal that means turn the fraction

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:20.000 
reciprocal that means turn the fraction
upside<00:04:14.310> down<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.720> 13:8<00:04:16.530> become<00:04:17.400> 8<00:04:17.730> 13<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:19.019> we

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
upside down so 13:8 become 8 13 and we

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.900 
upside down so 13:8 become 8 13 and we
change<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.460> divide<00:04:20.789> sign<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.660> times<00:04:22.880> so<00:04:23.880> now

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
change the divide sign to a times so now

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.840 
change the divide sign to a times so now
we'll<00:04:24.300> go<00:04:24.450> on<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:24.900> do<00:04:25.080> nine

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
we'll go on and do nine

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.420 
we'll go on and do nine
waters<00:04:26.060> times<00:04:26.630> 8<00:04:26.960> 13<00:04:29.080> 9<00:04:30.080> times<00:04:30.440> 8<00:04:30.740> in<00:04:31.070> the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
waters times 8 13 9 times 8 in the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.990 
waters times 8 13 9 times 8 in the
numerator<00:04:31.580> gives<00:04:32.360> us<00:04:32.920> 72<00:04:33.920> for<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.550> numerator

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
numerator gives us 72 for the numerator

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.320 
numerator gives us 72 for the numerator
of<00:04:35.150> our<00:04:35.390> answer<00:04:35.780> 4<00:04:36.710> times<00:04:37.100> 13<00:04:37.670> gives<00:04:38.030> us<00:04:38.210> a

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
of our answer 4 times 13 gives us a

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.440 
of our answer 4 times 13 gives us a
denominator<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:39.020> 52<00:04:39.980> as<00:04:40.520> an<00:04:40.790> answer<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:41.360> the

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
denominator of 52 as an answer so the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.660 
denominator of 52 as an answer so the
answer<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.810> our<00:04:41.900> original<00:04:42.170> question<00:04:42.680> 2<00:04:43.640> and

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
answer to our original question 2 and

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:51.420 
answer to our original question 2 and
1/4<00:04:44.210> divided<00:04:44.960> by<00:04:45.290> 105<00:04:45.920> 8<00:04:46.190> is<00:04:47.080> 72<00:04:48.370> over<00:04:49.370> 52<00:04:50.120> and

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
1/4 divided by 105 8 is 72 over 52 and

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.210 
1/4 divided by 105 8 is 72 over 52 and
naturally<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.670> could<00:04:52.940> simplify<00:04:53.690> that<00:04:54.260> if<00:04:54.530> you

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
naturally you could simplify that if you

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.710 
naturally you could simplify that if you
needed<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.820> could<00:04:56.000> write<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.180> fraction

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
needed to you could write that fraction

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.840 
needed to you could write that fraction
in<00:04:56.810> its<00:04:56.990> simplest<00:04:57.380> form<00:04:57.530> or<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.640> could

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
in its simplest form or you could

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.660 
in its simplest form or you could
convert<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.510> answer<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.530> mixed<00:05:01.130> number<00:05:01.160> if

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
convert the answer to a mixed number if

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.670 
convert the answer to a mixed number if
that's<00:05:02.480> what<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.930> question<00:05:03.050> asks<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:04.070> to<00:05:04.250> do

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
that's what the question asks you to do

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.950 
that's what the question asks you to do
here's<00:05:06.680> an<00:05:06.860> example<00:05:07.160> of<00:05:07.460> an<00:05:07.880> addition<00:05:08.600> some

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
here's an example of an addition some

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.010 
here's an example of an addition some
with<00:05:09.920> a<00:05:10.190> mixed<00:05:10.850> number<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.420> a<00:05:11.720> proper

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
with a mixed number and a proper

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.280 
with a mixed number and a proper
fraction<00:05:13.180> same<00:05:14.180> rules<00:05:14.390> still<00:05:14.480> apply<00:05:14.990> first

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
fraction same rules still apply first

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.200 
fraction same rules still apply first
step<00:05:15.650> is<00:05:15.830> convert<00:05:16.340> all<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.640> mixed<00:05:16.880> numbers<00:05:17.180> to

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
step is convert all the mixed numbers to

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.100 
step is convert all the mixed numbers to
improper<00:05:17.650> fractions<00:05:18.650> so<00:05:19.310> 1<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:20.000> 3/5<00:05:20.630> becomes

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
improper fractions so 1 and 3/5 becomes

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.310 
improper fractions so 1 and 3/5 becomes
8<00:05:21.770> fifths<00:05:22.580> it's<00:05:23.330> an<00:05:23.420> improper<00:05:23.690> fraction<00:05:23.840> but

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
8 fifths it's an improper fraction but

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.310 
8 fifths it's an improper fraction but
it's<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:24.650> same<00:05:24.980> size<00:05:25.340> that's<00:05:26.120> 103<00:05:26.510> fifths<00:05:27.140> and

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
it's the same size that's 103 fifths and

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.700 
it's the same size that's 103 fifths and
then<00:05:27.980> we<00:05:28.130> go<00:05:28.280> on<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.730> simply<00:05:29.300> add<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:30.440> pairs

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
then we go on and simply add the pairs

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.260 
then we go on and simply add the pairs
of<00:05:30.800> fractions<00:05:31.310> as<00:05:31.460> we<00:05:31.580> normally<00:05:31.700> would<00:05:31.940> so

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
of fractions as we normally would so

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.370 
of fractions as we normally would so
eight<00:05:32.480> fifths<00:05:32.780> add<00:05:33.050> seven<00:05:33.980> tenths<00:05:34.390> well<00:05:35.390> we

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
eight fifths add seven tenths well we

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.120 
eight fifths add seven tenths well we
have<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.920> make<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.490> denominators<00:05:38.420> the<00:05:38.450> same

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
have to make the denominators the same

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.100 
have to make the denominators the same
so<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.640> denominator<00:05:40.820> of<00:05:41.420> eight<00:05:41.630> fifths<00:05:41.930> and

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
so the denominator of eight fifths and

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.170 
so the denominator of eight fifths and
7/10<00:05:42.710> we<00:05:42.890> have<00:05:43.010> to<00:05:43.130> make<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.460> denominators

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
7/10 we have to make the denominators

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.720 
7/10 we have to make the denominators
the<00:05:44.210> same<00:05:44.390> and<00:05:44.900> we<00:05:45.530> use<00:05:45.770> equivalent<00:05:46.340> fractions

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
the same and we use equivalent fractions

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.330 
the same and we use equivalent fractions
to<00:05:46.910> do<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.240> so<00:05:48.020> I'll<00:05:48.170> change<00:05:48.500> eight<00:05:48.890> fifths

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
to do that so I'll change eight fifths

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.140 
to do that so I'll change eight fifths
into<00:05:50.090> sixteen<00:05:50.660> tenths<00:05:51.610> sixteen<00:05:52.610> tenths<00:05:53.000> is

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
into sixteen tenths sixteen tenths is

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.470 
into sixteen tenths sixteen tenths is
exactly<00:05:53.540> the<00:05:53.750> same<00:05:53.960> size<00:05:54.260> as<00:05:54.560> eight<00:05:54.740> fifths

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
exactly the same size as eight fifths

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.820 
exactly the same size as eight fifths
we're<00:05:56.480> just<00:05:56.660> using<00:05:56.840> that<00:05:57.050> because<00:05:57.350> it's<00:05:57.500> now

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
we're just using that because it's now

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.730 
we're just using that because it's now
the<00:05:57.890> denominators<00:05:58.730> are<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.000> same<00:05:59.740> sixteen

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
the denominators are the same sixteen

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.300 
the denominators are the same sixteen
tenths<00:06:01.520> add<00:06:02.110> seven<00:06:03.110> tenths<00:06:03.380> we<00:06:03.860> can<00:06:04.010> do<00:06:04.130> that

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
tenths add seven tenths we can do that

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.110 
tenths add seven tenths we can do that
nice<00:06:04.490> and<00:06:04.700> easily

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
nice and easily

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.840 
nice and easily
that<00:06:05.480> gives<00:06:05.690> us<00:06:05.840> twenty<00:06:06.380> three<00:06:06.710> tenths<00:06:07.370> all

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
that gives us twenty three tenths all

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.880 
that gives us twenty three tenths all
together<00:06:08.360> so<00:06:09.020> that's<00:06:09.140> the<00:06:09.290> answer<00:06:09.680> to<00:06:09.860> our

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
together so that's the answer to our

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.140 
together so that's the answer to our
original<00:06:10.190> question<00:06:11.770> and<00:06:12.770> once<00:06:13.070> again<00:06:13.340> you

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
original question and once again you

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.510 
original question and once again you
could<00:06:14.590> go<00:06:15.590> on<00:06:15.770> and<00:06:15.950> write<00:06:16.100> that<00:06:16.220> as<00:06:16.280> a<00:06:16.400> mixed

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
could go on and write that as a mixed

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.170 
could go on and write that as a mixed
number<00:06:16.820> if<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.360> question<00:06:17.810> asked<00:06:18.650> you<00:06:18.920> to<00:06:19.180> but

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
number if the question asked you to but

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.000 
number if the question asked you to but
that's<00:06:20.390> the<00:06:20.630> answer<00:06:23.140> let's<00:06:24.140> finish<00:06:24.350> up<00:06:24.650> with<00:06:24.950> a

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
that's the answer let's finish up with a

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.820 
that's the answer let's finish up with a
subtraction<00:06:25.760> so<00:06:26.300> we'll<00:06:26.480> do<00:06:26.630> 3<00:06:27.110> and<00:06:27.260> 1/10

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
subtraction so we'll do 3 and 1/10

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.660 
subtraction so we'll do 3 and 1/10
subtract<00:06:28.760> one<00:06:29.210> and<00:06:29.240> two<00:06:29.570> fifths<00:06:30.430> first<00:06:31.430> step

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
subtract one and two fifths first step

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.300 
subtract one and two fifths first step
exactly<00:06:31.880> the<00:06:32.240> same<00:06:32.450> again<00:06:32.770> convert<00:06:33.770> all<00:06:34.040> the

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
exactly the same again convert all the

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.510 
exactly the same again convert all the
mixed<00:06:34.850> numbers<00:06:35.150> to<00:06:35.180> improper<00:06:35.450> fractions<00:06:35.919> so<00:06:36.919> 3

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
mixed numbers to improper fractions so 3

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.559 
mixed numbers to improper fractions so 3
and<00:06:37.640> 1/10

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
and 1/10

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.369 
and 1/10
is<00:06:38.659> the<00:06:38.869> same<00:06:39.139> as<00:06:39.319> 31<00:06:40.069> tenths<00:06:40.879> and<00:06:41.169> one<00:06:42.169> and<00:06:42.319> two

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:42.379 
is the same as 31 tenths and one and two

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.879 
is the same as 31 tenths and one and two
fifths<00:06:42.830> is<00:06:43.279> the<00:06:43.580> same<00:06:43.819> as<00:06:43.969> seven<00:06:44.419> fifths<00:06:44.889> so

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
fifths is the same as seven fifths so

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:48.070 
fifths is the same as seven fifths so
now<00:06:46.039> we'll<00:06:46.189> go<00:06:46.309> on<00:06:46.429> and<00:06:46.610> do<00:06:46.729> 31<00:06:47.689> tenths

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
now we'll go on and do 31 tenths

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.760 
now we'll go on and do 31 tenths
subtract<00:06:49.069> seven<00:06:49.819> fifths<00:06:50.289> we<00:06:51.289> need<00:06:51.439> to<00:06:51.589> make

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
subtract seven fifths we need to make

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.699 
subtract seven fifths we need to make
the<00:06:52.330> denominators<00:06:53.330> the<00:06:53.360> same<00:06:53.569> I'll<00:06:54.349> do<00:06:54.559> that

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:54.709 
the denominators the same I'll do that

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:58.299 
the denominators the same I'll do that
by<00:06:55.009> using<00:06:55.249> an<00:06:55.580> equivalent<00:06:56.300> fraction<00:06:56.800> to<00:06:57.800> 7/5

00:06:58.299 --> 00:06:58.309 
by using an equivalent fraction to 7/5

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:02.169 
by using an equivalent fraction to 7/5
so<00:06:58.520> we<00:06:58.610> use<00:06:59.020> fourteen<00:07:00.020> tenths<00:07:00.860> same<00:07:01.699> size<00:07:01.969> as

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:02.179 
so we use fourteen tenths same size as

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:04.389 
so we use fourteen tenths same size as
seven<00:07:02.479> fifths<00:07:02.719> but<00:07:03.319> it<00:07:03.409> has<00:07:03.589> the<00:07:03.740> benefit<00:07:04.189> that

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:04.399 
seven fifths but it has the benefit that

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:06.730 
seven fifths but it has the benefit that
we<00:07:04.759> have<00:07:05.179> now<00:07:05.539> made<00:07:05.839> the<00:07:06.020> denominators<00:07:06.709> the

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
we have now made the denominators the

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.459 
we have now made the denominators the
same<00:07:06.919> and<00:07:07.550> we<00:07:08.119> can<00:07:08.270> go<00:07:08.449> on<00:07:08.479> and<00:07:08.689> do<00:07:08.809> thirty-one

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
same and we can go on and do thirty-one

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:12.969 
same and we can go on and do thirty-one
tenths<00:07:09.889> subtract<00:07:10.639> 14<00:07:11.419> tenths<00:07:11.959> now<00:07:12.169> which

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:12.979 
tenths subtract 14 tenths now which

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.389 
tenths subtract 14 tenths now which
gives<00:07:13.249> us<00:07:13.430> 17<00:07:13.909> tenths<00:07:14.659> all<00:07:14.959> together<00:07:15.399> and

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:16.399 
gives us 17 tenths all together and

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:18.070 
gives us 17 tenths all together and
naturally<00:07:16.969> you<00:07:17.149> could<00:07:17.330> go<00:07:17.479> on<00:07:17.629> and<00:07:17.779> convert

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
naturally you could go on and convert

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.230 
naturally you could go on and convert
that<00:07:18.229> to<00:07:18.529> a<00:07:18.559> mixed<00:07:19.430> number<00:07:19.490> if<00:07:19.819> you<00:07:19.939> wanted

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
that to a mixed number if you wanted

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.629 
that to a mixed number if you wanted
that's<00:07:20.360> one<00:07:20.839> in<00:07:21.020> seven<00:07:21.409> tenths<00:07:21.680> if<00:07:22.009> that's<00:07:22.399> the

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 
that's one in seven tenths if that's the

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.499 
that's one in seven tenths if that's the
format<00:07:23.029> that<00:07:23.089> the<00:07:23.559> question<00:07:24.559> asked<00:07:25.279> you<00:07:25.509> that

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:26.509 
format that the question asked you that

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.869 
format that the question asked you that
it<00:07:26.659> wanted<00:07:26.930> the<00:07:27.080> answer<00:07:27.229> in<00:07:27.559> but<00:07:28.490> nonetheless

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 
it wanted the answer in but nonetheless

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:34.899 
it wanted the answer in but nonetheless
17<00:07:29.629> tenths<00:07:30.080> is<00:07:30.229> the<00:07:30.949> answer<00:07:33.729> that<00:07:34.729> was

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:34.909 
17 tenths is the answer that was

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:37.059 
17 tenths is the answer that was
calculations<00:07:35.659> with<00:07:35.930> mixed<00:07:36.469> numbers<00:07:36.830> and
