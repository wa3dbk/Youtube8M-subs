class see this is what I get for talking
to<00:05:14.649> y'all<00:05:18.029> now<00:05:19.029> I've<00:05:19.149> got<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.389> worry<00:05:19.419> about

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629 
to y'all now I've got to worry about

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.829 
to y'all now I've got to worry about
that<00:05:20.019> track<00:05:20.409> slipping<00:05:21.449> anything<00:05:22.449> else<00:05:22.599> has

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:22.839 
that track slipping anything else has

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:36.990 
that track slipping anything else has
met<00:05:23.199> theirs<00:05:23.489> mauritius<00:05:25.860> in<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:27.550> reason<00:05:27.939> why

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.120 

the<00:05:38.000> reason<00:05:38.389> don't<00:05:38.660> do<00:05:38.870> that<00:05:38.900> though<00:05:39.620> don't

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
the reason don't do that though don't

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.040 
the reason don't do that though don't
you<00:05:40.250> do<00:05:40.729> that<00:05:40.789> with<00:05:41.120> your<00:05:41.180> bull<00:05:41.509> drive<00:05:41.780> because

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
you do that with your bull drive because

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.390 
you do that with your bull drive because
your<00:05:42.229> blow-dry<00:05:42.530> would<00:05:42.680> shut<00:05:42.830> off<00:05:42.919> never<00:05:43.190> put

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
your blow-dry would shut off never put

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.860 
your blow-dry would shut off never put
you<00:05:43.520> on<00:05:43.699> board<00:05:43.880> are<00:05:44.090> too<00:05:44.270> close<00:05:44.449> to<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.660> scalp

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
you on board are too close to the scalp

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.279 
you on board are too close to the scalp
because<00:05:45.020> um<00:05:46.330> it'll<00:05:47.330> fuck<00:05:47.570> it<00:05:47.720> up<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:48.139> will

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
because um it'll fuck it up and it will

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.659 
because um it'll fuck it up and it will
end<00:05:48.320> up<00:05:48.620> blowing<00:05:48.800> out<00:05:49.070> whatever<00:05:49.310> may<00:05:49.610> be

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
end up blowing out whatever may be

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.370 
end up blowing out whatever may be
brought<00:05:50.030> your<00:05:50.240> power<00:05:50.449> but<00:05:50.720> I<00:05:50.750> got<00:05:51.020> good<00:05:51.199> power

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
brought your power but I got good power

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.460 
brought your power but I got good power
will<00:05:52.190> grow<00:05:52.400> that<00:05:52.580> power<00:05:52.900> mm-hmm<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.490> mean<00:05:55.490> I

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
will grow that power mm-hmm I mean I

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.749 
will grow that power mm-hmm I mean I
think<00:05:57.470> it's<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.680> alcohol<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:58.340> nose<00:05:58.520> spray

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
think it's the alcohol the nose spray

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.580 
think it's the alcohol the nose spray
but<00:05:59.090> anyway<00:05:59.479> um<00:06:01.509> the<00:06:02.509> reason<00:06:02.660> you<00:06:03.050> use<00:06:03.259> these

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
but anyway um the reason you use these

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.969 
but anyway um the reason you use these
two<00:06:03.889> together<00:06:04.039> I<00:06:04.550> don't<00:06:05.150> know<00:06:05.330> the<00:06:06.320> the<00:06:07.509> like
