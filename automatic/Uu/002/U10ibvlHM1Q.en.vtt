00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.140
 welcome to with ay 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.640
 and here I bring you another video guys and 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.380
 this time we are going to see a new seed 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.940
 for the generation of worlds since 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.010
 now we have the ninth update and 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.779
 it's just new we're going to take advantage 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.920
 to see some of them the one that 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.529
 I bring in today I liked 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.169
 very much is called beowulf so according to 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.939
 sounds with all lowercase w and all together 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.890
 very important guys because if you do not go 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.329
 to come out another little thing so we're going to 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.250
 take a look at it is a seed that 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.989
 has attracted a lot of attention 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.399
 highly recommended seed and how are you going to 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.530
 see on the map that we already have here 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.420
 all explored is a seed that is 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.340
 characterized by having some incredible 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.199
 mountains structures asep but 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.850
 incredible also you can set 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.980
 perfectly that there is a lot of water 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.929
 practically everywhere even 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.879
 some rivers out there in that language that 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:53.059
 we have snowed in what is the seed 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.460
 the biomes are quite varied there 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.530
 pretty normal biome crossed with a 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.629
 little bit of swamp biome some 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.179
 snowy biomes and even a little bit of 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.920
 desert desert biome that is in 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.659
 this southern part this is the only part 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.520
 where we can find cactus and things 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.230
 So the only thing I missed in 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.060
 these seeds are the villas because they do not 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.530
 there is none the only thing that would be around here 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.520
 that looks like a villa is that well 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.219
 that we have there in front 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.740
 since normally maikel to 33 60 I do not know 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.259
 if I started it will be the same but in main crater 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.179
 bosch 360 usually the villas always 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.670
 they come out in what would be desert biomes 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.500
 having so little desert language is 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.600
 seed and having so many mountains seems 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.280
 be that there was no space to put a 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.840
 villa could have put it on top of 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.640
 a mountain or something like that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.079
 I would have been super epic but good 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.909
 in short what is the seed is quite 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.380
 complete you already know that the subject of 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.179
 villas can help us at the time of 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.709
 start at the seed because we can 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.899
 find some materials and shelter 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.489
 fast but other than that what are the 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.709
 villas do not have to influence us to 

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:50.390
 the way to play in this seed and for 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.770
 what is the seed, set the amount 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.929
 of mountains that we are seeing here 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.360
 with quite particular structures 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.530
 as for example this is a mountain 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.840
 that below has some holes 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.880
 We also spectacular also can 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.140
 serve quite well to raise level in 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.119
 survival if we put enough 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.709
 difficulty in those shadow areas 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.750
 under the mountains come many 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.670
 enemies and we can take to kill 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.920
 the ones that do not come badly the truth 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.329
 well while we are flying over all 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.530
 the seed because we are going to fly by 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.000
 over it since we have it 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.950
 explored so that you can see a little 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.850
 structures also fix guys in 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.340
 that there are some 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.660
 natural is really large spacious 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.580
 that you can go in and see a lot 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.350
 material or they would miss putting in the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.880
 entrance of the caves of a poster that 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.770
 would you please click here because 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.150
 come on the seed of materials is 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.130
 really great, yes, it has given me 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 a lap and it's amazing also me 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.660
 I really like the decorative detail or 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.310
 visual that there is a lot of water between 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.950
 all the amount of mountains there are also 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.330
 many waterfalls of lava water of all 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.490
 and long we can also find 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.110
 enough bows between some areas of 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.460
 mountain that always comes in handy 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.860
 if we are in survival out there 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.360
 near the marsh biome that 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.550
 we can find around here especially in 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.140
 the northern zone that you already know that now 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.700
 can pick up the ivy and use it as 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.140
 stairs so it could be quite 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.760
 useful to come for this area in 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.680
 survival to catch some stairs 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.000
 natural apart from that too os 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.680
 I wanted to comment guys while we go 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.600
 flying over and seeing everything that would be 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.160
 the seed that you can share for 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.300
 private message on youtube any 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.460
 seed that has caught your attention 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.320
 so that we can see in the channel and 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.030
 you know simply leave the name of the 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.160
 seed some coordinates that you have 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.020
 called the same attention we will see it not 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.940
 I know if we will make 50,000 seed videos 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.740
 but yes we will see some so if 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.630
 you want to participate in sharing 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.430
 the seeds that you liked 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.320
 it would be great guys would be super 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.360
 happy with that good we continue 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.100
 flying over this zone all the zones 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.290
 they are more or less similar there are many 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.090
 mountains many natural grottos and 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.890
 all accompanied with water that already 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 you are seeing around here now yes we 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.190
 let's go to the south zone of what is the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.570
 seed because there are some areas that 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.180
 I really wanted to share with you 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.920
 that was half hidden and yes that 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.290
 it would be very good in survival to know 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.090
 that is there and it is a giant rage that 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.530
 is underground that is really 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.270
 incredible because there are so many 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.610
 materials in it and also in that same 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.160
 rabbi in those giant diets we can 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.390
 find an abandoned mine that could 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.470
 come to us very well already you know in 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.840
 survival in abandoned mines 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.280
 we can find chests with lots of 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.020
 things whether they are melon seeds 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.430
 pumpkin and other things like that and the 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.350
 reference area to get to this one 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.510
 rabina this giant crack would be what 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.150
 is the desert biome just where 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.980
 is the well in front of these lakes that 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.810
 there are here some holes that fall 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.940
 directly to what would be the crack 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.590
 giant in addition to these holes that 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.090
 let's see what fall directly through the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.400
 lake and that by the water we could go down 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.780
 swimming thing that comes very comfortable to 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.280
 from that there are also some drops 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.780
 natural that connect with this rage 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.950
 that now we'll see if you look 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.450
 guys, I've already passed 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.280
 I left some torches so that 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.750
 I saw a little well what the rabbi is 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.210
 connects with a lot of caves 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.060
 naturals that are incredibly well 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.550
 of materials to see how big it is 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.170
 is connected everywhere would be a 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.820
 little explore it we will not do 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.890
 spoiler of everything we can find 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.630
 here but it is very good and I hope 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.040
 that if you prove what the seed is 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.080
 turn in to this area especially well 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.700
 for the theme of the abandoned mine here 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.260
 it's quite wide is connected with 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.120
 many natural grottos of what is 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.890
 the area and we can find a lot of 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.360
 materials for me this you know guys 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.280
 that is pure fun I love 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.020
 explore this kind of sites I do yo 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.000
 I would recommend that if you are in this area 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.340
 in survival playing in this seed 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.780
 come here in addition to that area of 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.670
 lake in case you are not convinced to enter 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.020
 by water we can access by this 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.730
 described natural there are in the 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.350
 laterals entering and advancing a 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.940
 little bit we would find what 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.770
 is the connection to the natural crack so 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.750
 that there would be no problem and this 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.130
 guys if this is the first seed that 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.210
 we bring from the ninth update 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.580
 I hope you have drawn attention 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.530
 The theme of this rabbit has enchanted me or 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.540
 at least to me personally and what is 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.250
 the seed a mountainous seed almost to the 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.780
 one hundred percent has caught my attention 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.639
 It's been a long time since we got one 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.199
 mountainous seed of these 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.370
 so I hope that we have the same 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.479
 called attention I hope that the 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.069
 try and leave me in the 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.539
 comments that you have thought 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.740

 always if you liked this video 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.639
 this seed leave a like in the video 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.469
 It takes a little while and help 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.999

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.039
 I like the content and I do not expect anything 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:00.960
 soon we will see in new videos a 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.720
 I welcome you and see you later

 teeth with live jazz turkish naim 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.230
 line 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.230
 all right
