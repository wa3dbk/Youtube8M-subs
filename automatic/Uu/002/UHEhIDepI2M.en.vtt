00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.260
 I've always been told that from 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.790
 when to start a diet 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 you had to be ready to do it none 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.980
 away they then have me whoever you 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.500
 said that I think it's a bad 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.810
 boy because already from a point of view 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 psychological if you do not have any 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.600
 small moments of recreation 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 you do not have to tell everything 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.039
 psychologically and more one must know 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.779
 the body sets up 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.700
 adaptations your body it's a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.899
 very very sophisticated machine that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.940
 permanently adapts to what 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.460
 wanted to propose if you put in 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.250
 a real diet in the strict sense of the term 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.379
 you will decrease your contributions 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.510
 nutrients agree for you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.280
 understand the subject here this is your 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.780
 do the sorting that's what you 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.780
 bring as nutrients to your body 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 and that's your calorie expenditure at 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.250
 rest what's called the metabolism of 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.710
 basis as soon as you decrease 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.480
 your nutritional contributions your body 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.690
 him he will understand who is going through a 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.760
 famine and he will decrease his metabolism 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.200
 okay he will not move the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.400
 metabolism will not come back back 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.740
 suddenly when you started again 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 eat you go to fatten 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.470
 so we have to try to make people believe 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.420
 your body does not make you a diet 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.250
 when you go on a diet do not have to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.950
 to be too draconian should not be too much 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.900
 violent with the body is regularly 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.670
 we have to make small differences that go 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.710
 boost the metabolism and who are going 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 give the body the impression that is 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 not in this period of famine then 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.530
 there is also an element that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.790
 is not negligible is that if you 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.990
 make recreations from time to time 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.130
 it's very good from a point of view 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.750
 psychological we can not be all the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.979
 time in frustration we can not 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.369
 be all the time in the miss in 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.369
 deprivation 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.330
 we will do small damage during 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.710
 react bah yes all that you know 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.850
 if you are always having private 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.560
 your body have a diet 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.930
 extremely healthy eating only vegetables 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.860
 steam eat only white meats 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.810
 and fish 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.560
 at some point if you make a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.000
 sauerkraut or a cassoulet you go 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.530
 on the flank your body it's not going 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.020
 understand what is happening so time 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.640
 in time go the assaulted it goes the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.250
 strengthen it will induce phenomena 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.660
 on compensatory see you imagine 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.340
 an army that would never go to battle 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.480
 it would not be competitive at 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.880
 would not be able to go to fight 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.350
 so in every way your body there 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.510
 needs you to think your 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.220
 power that you give him what 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.810
 he needs to function and to 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.610
 from time to time make you happy 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.540
 nice recreation that will allow you 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.490
 to get from a point of view 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.330
 psychological and above all you strengthen 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.330
 from an organic point of view
