work so take your wallet and I've got

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.330 
work so take your wallet and I've got
some<00:03:00.900> blue<00:03:01.140> Turk<00:03:01.410> actually<00:03:01.829> you<00:03:02.129> could<00:03:02.280> use

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
some blue Turk actually you could use

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.900 
some blue Turk actually you could use
blue<00:03:02.940> tack<00:03:03.209> or<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.870> could<00:03:04.079> use<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.590> magic<00:03:05.430> tape

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
blue tack or you could use a magic tape

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.479 
blue tack or you could use a magic tape
but<00:03:06.629> basically<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.379> stick<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
but basically I just stick it in the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.369 
but basically I just stick it in the
cords<00:03:08.819> hold<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.239> steady<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.019> guess<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
cords hold it steady and I guess the

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.110 
cords hold it steady and I guess the
thing<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.650> remember<00:03:11.099> about<00:03:11.250> my<00:03:11.760> opponent
