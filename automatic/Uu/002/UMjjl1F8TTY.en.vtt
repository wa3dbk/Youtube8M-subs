00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.840
 Modest Tastes cuisine from armful loves 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.560
 we have a traditional recipe in this section 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.560
 We'il know about the construction of "imambayılının" 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.040
 But if you want to have a look at the necessary materials before 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.120
 6 eggplants 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.760
 4 pieces of medium onion 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.520
 12 cloves of garlic 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.120
 2 tomatoes 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.560
 1 tea glass of olive oil 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.120
 2 pcs sugar cubes 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.760
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.520
 and 1.5 cups of water 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 imambayıldi needed to learn the materials 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.720
 Let's start with our eggplants 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.360
 You know, our priority application in saltwater eggplant dishes 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.920
 we call our water a little salt 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.200
 eggplants need not be too big 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.480
 enough to be slightly larger than a mix 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 barbed 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.680
 let's take a cut instead of a few 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 and let it into salt water 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.040
 we leave our last eggplant in the water 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.960
 let us continue by chopping our onions 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.920
 chop 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:12.880
 after chopping the onions and finely chopping the garlics 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.920
 this way round, not too small 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.360
 add on onion 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.840
 adding some salt 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.440
 rub 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.360
 now in our tomatoes 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.440
 whether or not peel tomatoes according to desire 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.440
 we are chopping 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.440
 small 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.520
 yes we chopped tomatoes 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.800
 Now we got the eggplants we put in water 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.760
 with onion 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.400
 we are telling the easiest way to make imamabayıldı 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.720
 You know, Modest Flavors don't love pessimism 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.800
 now we leave the tomato on 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.920
 olive oil food is a must-have ... 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.920
 olive oil ... 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.880
 and water up to 1.5 cups. 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.360
 do not want to give the size of water because tomatoes may vary depending on the water condition 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.240
 now we can now set fire 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.080
 imambayıldıı put into the fire 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.840
 we cover the lid, bake until the eggplants are soft 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.400
 let's check 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.680
 yes they have softened 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.680
 we also translated these eggplant 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.680
 Now let's close the lid and let it go 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.800
 imambayıldı the fire, we have waited for half an hour to cool down 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.080
 Now we are in the final stage 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.000
 we take one of our eggplants 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.680
 we open the middle with the help of a spoon 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.080
 as you can see the easiest way to try to explain 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.600
 onion, garlic and tomato 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.160
 already the biggest difference between carnation is having a meal with olive oil 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
 not using meat 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.600
 now we're going to cook it 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.320
 share all material 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.240
 now we are closing the lid 15 minutes we are cooking on the stove 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
 fire 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.920
 imambayıldı 15 minutes cooked, now we are closing the fire 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.920
 and service to cool down 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.400
 yes now service time now 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.680
 we open the cover 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.920
 in fact, it will have a better taste if you wait a night in the refrigerator 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.240
 but we can also consume warmly 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.480
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.800
 we shared a traditional recipe we learned the construction of "İmambayılının" 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.840
 I would ask you to try and remember us as soon as possible, sir 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.880
 goodbye...
