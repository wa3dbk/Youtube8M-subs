00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.150
 That's what the government subsidy is 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.710
 Surely also Mr. Lexington Lee also knew 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:13.019
 The number of people who have pleasure in the form of saying or saying it is also great 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.189
 There are many opportunities for vibrational overhead 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.359
 won 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.359
 Mr. Oribe, the most lonely person in Japan 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.519
 It was born at the engineering society even though it was not limited 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.710
 Though I like my language from today I grew up 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.659
 It was too many to return to the country 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:32.540
 Hourly system 0 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.560
 Seven days later I was still doing it in the bank 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.690
 It was 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.000
 It was good to have a little feeling 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Even though it's a clumsy place 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.120
 And such Mr. Wamiya is actually a person based on the sales of the table. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.800
 I made a large part of the equipment that I made 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.450
 Lead here 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.810
 Dart number is ideal in front of people 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.100
 Doosan beauty is more than a doctor ride to wash out the poison 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.730
 There is no state 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.530
 Nagomi 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.320
 If I wanted to show my power and treated with poison 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.290
 The same excuse 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 Ahead to the old house 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.659
 Moreover, a person should not be able to get in from two companies 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.330
 Low volume of 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.010
 It is called life's 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.950
 Prisoner because he did not offer to so-called byvo 6th death 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.300
 3d to receive our assault 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.869
 Just a lot of things I love 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.410
 the year of 2000 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.079
 Break through being rescued safely 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.290
 Innocent sin will be released 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.450
 Well that's about the fun of this time 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.020
 Anyway, one of the highlights of this time is the abandonment of life 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.020
 There is a place where Go Igarashi goes 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.140
 Well that's right 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 Takasawa Osawa, who is engaged in future business, is 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.170
 In the interview of the official site 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.150
 About having decided to appear in the public hall sequel 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.460
 I think that is not something that was limited to the committee 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.130
 I think creating a sequel is not so easy. 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.939
 Yes 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.689
 As long as you don't make more efforts than when you made your first album, you 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.459
 On the contrary, I made corrections by producing a sequel to people who would not be able to measure 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.729
 I think there is a possibility that it will be useless 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.309
 There is no strong will to decide such nature absolutely 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:32.459
 I think it will be quite a long road as long as it is 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.749
 I'm sorry, but this is the platform for the sequel 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.509
 Where it was, this is more about policy 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:39.859
 Moderately interesting 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.669
 Surely all of the stories written here are up to now 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.839
 Customers who complete energy together and complete 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.939
 I feel that I might be able to answer something that 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:50.769
 I 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.519
 Honestly, at the same time this is a very hard job 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.260
 I thought I want to try because it is a difficult job 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.989
 I was motivated and surpassed previous work in a good sense 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.239
 I felt confident that I could 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.899
 I think that was the biggest decisive factor 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:12.329
 Also, this time the battle against Ishii history that became history is 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.479
 It is a theme 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.339
 The existence of a person who was not originally a person at the end of the Edo period 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:22.189
 There is no change in that the body is contradictory and he is one lane 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.179
 However, in the sequel, the association is not limited to the Edo town. 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.169
 Encounter a new team 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.569
 Mr. Kim should be more natural than ever before 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.849
 Face the patients who did not, and continue to perform treatment 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:36.879
 I know 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.109
 How the history copes with such a person is very 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.279
 And the story goes on 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.739
 I'm looking forward to myself 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.879
 Being a supporter of that kind of thing 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.739
 The head office is located in Kakogawa City, Hyogo Prefecture. 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.109
 Medical corporation corporation which operates nursing homes etc. 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.230
 By the way, I will show the importance of 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.279
 I have been asking 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.709
 In front of that Ikedani present notice 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.439
 Those who received an examination at the Onishi Orthopedic Clinic 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.130
 among 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.669
 I saw a TV show km 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.560
 A small gift for those who reported it 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.219
 It will be to support on the spot, but it was sweet 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.900
 By the way Onishi Orthopedic Clinic ed 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.990
 Contact phone number minutes 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.080
 079 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.669
 0935 to 4q 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.940
 It becomes -0935 in 07949 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.729
 Shock corporation while releasing medical corporation corporation 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.710
 Thank you in advance 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.569
 Dramatic people in the end of the Edo period 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.120
 Currently, knowledge etc. is being used 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.130
 As a matter of fact, since I lived in the present era 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.330
 I regretted having it felt 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.919
 It was net 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.050
 Well you know the establishment of preventive medicine well 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.090
 I think so 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.150
 Only myself was fine 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.940
 It is scary to have an examination, and it is open and somehow 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.520
 It is also the treatment that makes such things mess 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.289
 Preventive medicine is also quite important 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.919
 By finding it quickly 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.340
 It is easy to run 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.210
 Medical cost is very easy when it sees in total 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.939
 So I posted more than anything for that purpose 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:28.449
 That's right 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.089
 It is Yasuma about 10 years ago 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.539
 I tell you that small things are starting 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.679
 It is about grandchild Miri to be found by US inspection 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.930
 Tailored to the background 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.530
 Early rice of about 1 to 2 centimeters 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.360
 Then 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.970
 If it has not been transferred anywhere, and if the incumbent Date cancer is extracted 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.990
 It is an easy operation, but if it exceeds about 2 cm 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.919
 Tow to here 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.539
 This exhibition has 5.4 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.490
 So after all I hope to discover this early 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.680
 Well that inspection equipment 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.229
 1.5 will be cut 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.060
 I wanted to know what this is going on 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.050
 Yes 5 buildings 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.150
 It is a cerebral aneurysm 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.290
 This will burst as it gets bigger, but more 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.689
 Find it quickly 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.020
 I'm doing surgery before it breaks 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.800
 Alzheimer's type number often said now after being rescued 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.789
 I will stop remembering that it has flew 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.029
 I will take a break 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:33.490
 Before and after this also comes out vs 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.180
 We are delivering this 64 different multi-slice ct 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.830
 is 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.400
 This is because I think that there is a high concentration of 12 minutes 64 times the conventional 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.780
 I think it would be nice if you got a forerunner 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.750
 The number of households in the pelvis is about 5 mm 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.010
 There is a small mountain 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.779
 I made use of the exchange while using 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:01.109
 High sensitivity gallbladder pancreas pancreas kidney 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:07.379
 Everything from the adrenal gland to the global ovary method has all led to the situation 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.039
 In the background 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.879
 rear 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.419
 As we say to 16 people now and have breast cancer 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.869
 This is also early detection by mammography 

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:20.749
 You are ready to 

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:21.649
 It's an opportunity 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.519
 When you are young you have a way to find what you want 

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:25.909
 It was not 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:29.930
 However, now that such a latest machine comes out 

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:34.399
 Somehow I can find a disease that I could not find before 

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:35.360
 I am not feeling 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.360
 It is coming out of the mountains that have saved my life 

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:41.619
 Thank you very much mascot lived 

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:44.110
 It was discovered by the person who thinks 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.110
 I thought it would be useful if you could use it 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.050
 Thank you very much 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.610
 Then, the drama's own usage will continue 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.210
 Thank you in the set
