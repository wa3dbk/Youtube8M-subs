straight in front of you if you're going
to<00:00:43.659> start<00:00:43.960> light<00:00:44.460> make<00:00:45.460> sure<00:00:45.489> that<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:45.940> do<00:00:46.120> at

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
to start light make sure that you do at

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.329 
to start light make sure that you do at
least<00:00:46.420> 20<00:00:47.019> reps<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.879> I<00:00:49.210> do<00:00:49.329> four<00:00:49.780> sets<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:51.129> go

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
least 20 reps so I do four sets and I go

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.979 
least 20 reps so I do four sets and I go
up<00:00:51.549> and<00:00:51.729> wait<00:00:51.940> each<00:00:52.179> time<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:54.159> keep<00:00:54.729> it<00:00:54.989> from

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
up and wait each time so I keep it from

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:26.220 
up and wait each time so I keep it from
ten<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.819> 20<00:00:57.819> reps

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.460 

as<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:27.010> gets<00:01:27.160> harder<00:01:27.760> I<00:01:27.970> tend<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.870> have<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.230> go

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
as it gets harder I tend to have to go

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.640 
as it gets harder I tend to have to go
back<00:01:29.650> a<00:01:29.710> little<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.420> then<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.750> went<00:01:31.900> on<00:01:32.080> to<00:01:32.320> close

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
back a little so then I went on to close

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.010 
back a little so then I went on to close
grip<00:01:32.980> pull<00:01:33.490> down<00:01:33.730> and<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:36.520> these<00:01:36.700> it's<00:01:37.420> harder

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
grip pull down and for these it's harder

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.020 
grip pull down and for these it's harder
so<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.710> go<00:01:39.580> really<00:01:39.820> light<00:01:40.180> but<00:01:41.160> like<00:01:42.160> i<00:01:42.340> said<00:01:42.370> if

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
so I go really light but like i said if

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.990 
so I go really light but like i said if
you<00:01:43.270> go<00:01:43.450> light<00:01:44.250> stay<00:01:45.250> above<00:01:45.730> 20<00:01:46.210> reps<00:01:46.480> and<00:01:48.000> make

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
you go light stay above 20 reps and make

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.230 
you go light stay above 20 reps and make
sure<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.390> extend<00:01:49.900> all<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.200> way<00:01:50.350> up<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:51.240> come

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
sure you extend all the way up and come
back<00:01:52.270> down<00:01:52.480> each<00:01:53.080> time<00:01:53.790> don't<00:01:54.790> go<00:01:54.940> half<00:01:55.180> ways

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.640 

let's<00:01:59.710> take<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.190> chest<00:02:00.460> out<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:05.290> you<00:02:05.470> don't

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
let's take that chest out if you don't

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.870
