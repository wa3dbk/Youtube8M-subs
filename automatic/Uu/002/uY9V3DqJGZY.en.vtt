people<00:00:00.960> say<00:00:01.140> these<00:00:01.350> days<00:00:01.650> head<00:00:02.040> was<00:00:02.220> so<00:00:02.689> folks

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
people say these days head was so folks

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.750 
people say these days head was so folks
cube<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.500> cheat<00:00:05.130> instead<00:00:07.069> pulling<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.220> apart

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
cube a cheat instead pulling it apart

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.879 
cube a cheat instead pulling it apart
I<00:00:08.940> don't<00:00:09.269> wanna<00:00:09.420> pull<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.750> apart<00:00:10.410> that

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
I don't wanna pull it apart that

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.360 
I don't wanna pull it apart that
wouldn't<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.370> really<00:00:12.120> really<00:00:12.570> really<00:00:13.370> you

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
wouldn't be really really really you

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.510 
wouldn't be really really really you
know<00:00:16.039> impressive<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.430> for<00:00:17.670> my<00:00:17.760> people<00:00:18.240> but

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
know impressive in for my people but

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.300 
know impressive in for my people but
there<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:21.060> way<00:00:21.289> to<00:00:22.289> solve<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.859> Rubik's<00:00:23.220> Cube

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
there is one way to solve a Rubik's Cube

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.160 
there is one way to solve a Rubik's Cube
today<00:00:24.060> I'm<00:00:24.180> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> show<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.539> other<00:00:24.779> cheat

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
today I'm going to show you other cheat

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.640 
today I'm going to show you other cheat
instead<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.859> pulling<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.460> apart

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
instead of pulling it apart

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.790 
instead of pulling it apart
alright<00:00:29.150> okay<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.660> she<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.560> doing

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
alright okay so that she is is doing

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.850 
alright okay so that she is is doing
this<00:00:32.009> simple<00:00:32.430> algorithm<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.780> need<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
this simple algorithm we need is get a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.010 
this simple algorithm we need is get a
pen<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:37.219> my<00:00:38.219> pen<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.030> over<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.280> paper

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
pen so my pen is over here and paper

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.279 
pen so my pen is over here and paper
even<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.620> rhythm<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:45.020> write<00:00:46.020> down

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
even know it's rhythm on and write down

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.279 
even know it's rhythm on and write down
this<00:00:46.620> algorithm<00:00:47.480> I'm<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.750> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> say<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
this algorithm I'm just going to say it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.119 
this algorithm I'm just going to say it
and<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:50.399> I'll<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> movements

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
and then I'll do the movements

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:09.700 
and then I'll do the movements
it's<00:00:53.129> RI<00:00:57.199> di<00:00:58.969> are<00:01:01.190> D<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.899> again<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.600> di<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:08.150> D

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
it's RI di are D so again are I di are D

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.870 
it's RI di are D so again are I di are D
after<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> want<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> show<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
after that now I want to show you the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:28.480 
after that now I want to show you the
moves<00:01:15.619> all<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:18.000> moves<00:01:18.270> are<00:01:24.200> i.t<00:01:25.200> i.t

let<00:01:47.490> me<00:01:47.640> show<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.240> really<00:01:48.720> slowly

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:03:10.790 

even<00:02:23.710> slower

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.110 

finished<00:03:13.680> that's<00:03:14.680> why<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:14.920> solved<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.700> Rubik's

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
finished that's why I solved the Rubik's

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.610 
finished that's why I solved the Rubik's
Cube<00:03:16.300> cheats<00:03:18.090> there's<00:03:19.090> other<00:03:19.540> ways<00:03:19.870> but<00:03:20.350> this

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
Cube cheats there's other ways but this

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.150 
Cube cheats there's other ways but this
is<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.010> only<00:03:21.130> way<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.700> sold<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.240> Rubik's<00:03:22.600> Cube

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
is the only way I sold the Rubik's Cube

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.960 
is the only way I sold the Rubik's Cube
basically<00:03:24.160> what<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.490> do<00:03:24.550> is<00:03:25.150> do<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.110> really<00:03:26.970> far

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
basically what I do is do it really far

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.050 
basically what I do is do it really far
fast<00:03:28.960> in<00:03:29.290> front<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.680> them<00:03:29.830> I'm<00:03:30.040> not<00:03:30.520> in<00:03:30.910> front

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
fast in front of them I'm not in front

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.300 
fast in front of them I'm not in front
of<00:03:31.210> them<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:31.510> mean<00:03:31.720> after<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:32.920> when<00:03:33.190> you're

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
of them I mean after that when you're

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.370 
of them I mean after that when you're
really<00:03:33.610> close<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.030> solving<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.690> rubik's<00:03:35.050> cube

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
really close to solving the rubik's cube

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.060 
really close to solving the rubik's cube
like<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.930> go<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:37.990> them<00:03:38.290> i<00:03:38.470> can<00:03:38.680> solve<00:03:38.890> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
like this go to them i can solve the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.540 
like this go to them i can solve the
rubik's<00:03:39.400> cube<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.860> then<00:03:41.860> go<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.280> the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
rubik's cube and then go to the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.720 
rubik's cube and then go to the
algorithm<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.180> you're<00:03:43.330> up<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.700> you

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
algorithm that you're up to and you

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.170 
algorithm that you're up to and you
solve<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:47.310> thank<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.370> for<00:03:48.430> watching<00:03:48.640> please

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
solve it thank you for watching please
