sword<00:01:38.360> in<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.690> stone<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:39.320> try<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:39.860> pick<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.100> up

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
sword in the stone I try to pick it up

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.030 
sword in the stone I try to pick it up

the cryo or the freeze or whatever but

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.699 
the cryo or the freeze or whatever but
but<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.630> what<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:44.989> anyway<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.500> want<00:02:45.680> to

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
but it is what it is anyway I want to

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.380 
but it is what it is anyway I want to
show<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.250> action<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.880> would<00:02:47.060> didn't<00:02:47.330> know

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
show you in action I would didn't know

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.670 
show you in action I would didn't know
if<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.959> work<00:02:48.110> very<00:02:48.140> well<00:02:48.530> or

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
if this is going to work very well or

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.280 
if this is going to work very well or
not<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.550> does<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:50.120> thing<00:02:50.300> has<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> super<00:02:51.019> slow

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
not it does this thing has a super slow

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.210 
not it does this thing has a super slow
rate<00:02:51.800> of<00:02:51.830> fire<00:02:51.970> but<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.300> can<00:02:53.420> see<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.690> damage

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
rate of fire but you can see the damage

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.729 
rate of fire but you can see the damage
is<00:02:55.220> taken<00:02:56.209> away<00:02:56.300> down<00:02:56.630> there<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.350> like<00:02:57.560> it's

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
is taken away down there so it like it's

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.990 
is taken away down there so it like it's
stuck<00:02:57.980> with<00:02:58.040> him<00:02:58.310> or<00:02:58.430> something<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:58.970> just

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
stuck with him or something it just

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.260 
stuck with him or something it just
keeps<00:02:59.330> on

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
keeps on

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.620 
keeps on
taking<00:03:01.080> more<00:03:01.200> damage<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:03.120> other<00:03:03.270> thing

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
taking more damage and the other thing

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.060 
taking more damage and the other thing
is<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:03.960> this<00:03:04.230> thing<00:03:04.380> obviously<00:03:04.530> has<00:03:04.920> an

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
is is that this thing obviously has an

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.040 
is is that this thing obviously has an
ailing<00:03:05.340> side<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.180> things<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.510> increases<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:06.990> a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
ailing side of things and increases of a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.720 
ailing side of things and increases of a
light<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:08.010> see<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.370> doesn't<00:03:08.550> do<00:03:08.700> a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
light so you can see it doesn't do a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.150 
light so you can see it doesn't do a
super<00:03:09.180> ton<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.360> damage<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.770> slow<00:03:10.950> rate<00:03:11.130> of

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
super ton of damage and the slow rate of

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.850 
super ton of damage and the slow rate of
fire<00:03:11.280> doesn't<00:03:11.730> necessarily<00:03:12.570> help<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:13.650> it

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
fire doesn't necessarily help but it

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.440 
fire doesn't necessarily help but it
does<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.220> residual<00:03:14.700> damage<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.150> looks<00:03:15.300> like

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
does have residual damage it looks like

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.480 
does have residual damage it looks like
so<00:03:15.600> when<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.780> actually<00:03:15.930> with<00:03:16.320> them<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:17.310> just

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
so when you actually with them it just

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.960 
so when you actually with them it just
kind<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.760> slowly<00:03:18.360> takes<00:03:18.720> away<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.730> yeah<00:03:20.730> not

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
kind of slowly takes away and yeah not

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.050 
kind of slowly takes away and yeah not
the<00:03:21.180> best<00:03:21.210> legendary<00:03:22.340> but<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.400> free<00:03:23.880> one

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the best legendary but a free one

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.800

one other note you cannot use this gun

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
in the grinder so if you're trying to

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.150 
in the grinder so if you're trying to
use<00:03:29.930> some<00:03:30.930> recipes<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.590> grinder<00:03:31.950> you

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
use some recipes in the grinder you

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.850 
use some recipes in the grinder you
can't<00:03:32.430> use<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.820> one<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.180> won't<00:03:33.360> work<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:34.380> the

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
can't use this one it won't work but the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.680 
can't use this one it won't work but the
stabbing<00:03:35.340> feature<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.150> gun

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
stabbing feature of this gun

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.750 
stabbing feature of this gun
I<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:37.230> want<00:03:37.410> crazy<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:37.920> stab<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.340> guy<00:03:38.430> and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
I just want crazy just stab this guy and

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.030 
I just want crazy just stab this guy and
then<00:03:38.850> my<00:03:39.030> setup<00:03:39.750> was<00:03:40.080> ideal<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.830> because

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
then my setup was ideal for that because

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.540 
then my setup was ideal for that because
I<00:03:41.400> have<00:03:41.990> my<00:03:42.990> skill<00:03:43.290> tree<00:03:43.440> built<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:43.800> more<00:03:44.130> for

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
I have my skill tree built up more for

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.630 
I have my skill tree built up more for
melee<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.690> doesn't<00:03:46.050> leave<00:03:46.200> damage<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:47.370> so

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
melee so it doesn't leave damage as so

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.420 
melee so it doesn't leave damage as so
for<00:03:48.330> me<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.960> more<00:03:49.860> beneficial<00:03:50.250> than

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
for me that was more beneficial than

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.560 
for me that was more beneficial than
anything<00:03:51.030> else<00:03:51.410> but<00:03:52.410> again<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:53.610> do<00:03:53.790> use<00:03:54.420> this

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
anything else but again you do use this

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.880 
anything else but again you do use this
maybe<00:03:54.840> on<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.110> appropriate<00:03:55.500> types<00:03:55.680> of

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
maybe on the appropriate types of

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.400 
maybe on the appropriate types of
enemies<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.460> will<00:03:56.580> work<00:03:56.670> really<00:03:56.730> great

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
enemies and it will work really great

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.990 
enemies and it will work really great
but<00:03:58.410> anyway<00:03:58.590> that's<00:03:58.740> pretty<00:03:58.800> much<00:03:59.070> its<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.640> I

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
but anyway that's pretty much its I I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.790
