00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.570
 shadowrun returns 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.640
 this game is in cyberpunk style which 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.310
 looks bright and promising 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.230
 Seattle's dark vision of the future is 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.209
 background for this strategic arpg 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.060
 and moving along the script you uncover 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.890
 secrets of the central plot of the game graphics 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.660
 may seem mediocre but 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.640
 detailed hand-drawn world 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.650
 helps with style like fantasy and 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.529
 science fiction weave with a single 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.359
 the whole quality of the art design will awaken in 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.300
 you desire to reveal all deep 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.469
 Seattle secrets unfortunately you will see 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.440
 only a small area 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.690
 this world shadowrun returns offers 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.059
 you absolutely linear passage that in 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.799
 result in 12 hours of play 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.829
 depending on how much attention you are 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:49.839
 give dialogue by the way they are not voiced 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.549
 but don't get so upset so 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.739
 how will your journey introduce you 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:54.929
 a number of bright characters each 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.190
 with its history 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.649
 some dialogues look trite 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.139
 others are extremely memorable that 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.300
 overall nice story are becoming 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:07.740
 sinister with every turn of the plot that 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.740
 keeps the player at the monitor 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.179
 thanks to the setting, there is a sense of 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.119
 that this is only the first part of the big game 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.219
 This is partly true in the game is 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.799
 built-in level editor what does 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.530
 its fully lpg already at the moment 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.110
 There are several fan add-ons to this. 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.329
 creativity is definitely not limited to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.509
 the game was expected to be interesting enough 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.380
 not enough to tighten for a long time 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.509
 minor quests not really 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.100
 brightens the overall picture and linearity 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.739
 The plot makes them useless 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.630
 the game does not stimulate desire and evil here 

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:45.569
 every nook and cranny away from the intended 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.099
 the way of dialogue similar fate some 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.750
 of which may affect events 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.729
 but for the most part it's just 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.560
 playing the main role 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.439
 the attraction of the game is 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.129
 skill tree it includes magic 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.450
 shooting at home and other skills to choose from 

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:02.489
 most of them are clear enough 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.399
 magicians use magic techniques 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.539
 mechanical drones and so on 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.459
 some hacker skills for example 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.379
 requires ingenuity as he runs along 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.019
 cyber world where electronic meets 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.650
 enemies tree skills first looks 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.750
 scary 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.609
 but spending karma on pumping you will understand 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.100
 what suits your hero better 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.829
 you can become a mercenary and pass 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.940
 combat missions turn-based combat system 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.430
 easy to learn 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.680
 and the details and make it interesting to 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.480
 For example, using the shaman can call 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.430
 spirit in certain places that are not 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.739
 will do a lot of damage but distract attention 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.480
 foe technician with shotgun 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.630
 can deal with a group of nearby ones 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.549
 enemies meanwhile the magician can improve 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.349
 chances of a hacker attack success which 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.630
 sneaks up through cyberspace 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.519
 killing along the way cyber demons on 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.340
 normal difficulty, the game does not go through 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.819
 is labor and skill tree 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.819
 used very actively 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.990
 making a mistake you can expensive 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.900
 pay though the game is in the majority 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.880
 shadowrun returns 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.380
 does not allow to persist anywhere 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.640
 checkpoint system is not always 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.520
 lives up to expectations 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.290
 you can spend a lot of time and poop 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.110
 for pumping to the last battle 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.510
 lose and lose 40 minutes of playing 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.270
 general shadowrun returns 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.010
 good enough and fascinating 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.080
 repulsive world arch hackers cults and 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.870
 corporations create an excellent background for 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.790
 interesting plot and although as a result 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.360
 it may seem to you that the game is not something 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.519
 enough 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.519
 the series can be considered successfully resurrected 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.230
