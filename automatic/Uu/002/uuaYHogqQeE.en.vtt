00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.020 
better role on it would benefit me even
more<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.990> we're<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> go<00:01:35.009> ahead<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.460> we

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
more so we're going to go ahead and we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.080 
more so we're going to go ahead and we
are<00:01:36.299> gonna<00:01:36.689> decode<00:01:37.790> we're<00:01:38.790> gonna<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.060> right

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
are gonna decode we're gonna go right

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.640 
are gonna decode we're gonna go right
way<00:01:39.720> keep<00:01:39.869> we're<00:01:39.990> gonna<00:01:40.079> start<00:01:40.409> from<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
way keep we're gonna start from the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
way keep we're gonna start from the
right<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.430> left<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.880> first<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.780> we

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
right to the left so first up what do we

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.649 
right to the left so first up what do we
get<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.250> got<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.729> heavy<00:01:45.119> machine<00:01:45.509> gun

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
get down we got that heavy machine gun

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
get down we got that heavy machine gun
we<00:01:45.780> always<00:01:45.990> seem<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> heavy<00:01:47.130> machine

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
we always seem to get that heavy machine

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.910 
we always seem to get that heavy machine
gun<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> look<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.920> what

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
gun so we can have a look at that what

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.639 
gun so we can have a look at that what
role<00:01:50.130> did<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.380> kills<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.530> his

let's<00:02:15.990> see<00:02:16.200> what<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.380> get<00:02:16.500> from<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.710> second

let's see what we get from the second

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.880 
let's see what we get from the second
one<00:02:17.430> oh<00:02:17.960> we<00:02:18.960> got<00:02:19.110> two<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.590> morgue

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890

let's take a look at what this one has

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.710 
let's take a look at what this one has
increased<00:02:29.520> reload<00:02:29.850> speed<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.540> weapon

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
increased reload speed of this weapon

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.930 
increased reload speed of this weapon
when<00:02:31.110> it's<00:02:31.260> meg<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.560> empty<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.580> kill<00:02:32.790> where

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
when it's meg is empty and a kill where

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
increases reload speed so we have ranged

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.260 
increases reload speed so we have ranged
there<00:02:39.830> mmm<00:02:40.830> that's<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.910> good<00:02:42.090> Eva
