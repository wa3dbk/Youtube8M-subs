in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.420> description<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.170> there's<00:02:07.619> some

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
in the description and there's some

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.190 
in the description and there's some
people<00:02:07.860> thinking<00:02:08.520> out<00:02:08.970> loud<00:02:09.030> about<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:10.080> they

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
people thinking out loud about what they

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.479 
people thinking out loud about what they
think<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.530> perk<00:02:10.709> might<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.190> might<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
think the perk might be it might be a

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.120 
think the perk might be it might be a
poison<00:02:11.910> effect<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.330> zombies

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
poison effect on zombies

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.680 
poison effect on zombies
or<00:02:13.310> maybe<00:02:13.460> something<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.210> with<00:02:14.450> keeping

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
or maybe something to do with keeping

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.720 
or maybe something to do with keeping
barricades<00:02:15.410> up<00:02:15.590> longer<00:02:15.980> now<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.520> only<00:02:16.670> thing

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
barricades up longer now the only thing

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.890 
barricades up longer now the only thing
I<00:02:16.940> could<00:02:17.000> see<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.330> relating<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
I could see it relating to the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.240 
I could see it relating to the
barricades<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.590> you'd<00:02:18.710> be<00:02:18.860> able<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.070> put

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
barricades is that you'd be able to put

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.640 
barricades is that you'd be able to put
them<00:02:19.370> up<00:02:19.490> faster<00:02:20.060> possibly<00:02:21.020> because<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.470> have

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
them up faster possibly because you have

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.530 
them up faster possibly because you have
more<00:02:22.040> legs<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.430> have<00:02:22.490> like<00:02:22.760> eight<00:02:22.970> legs<00:02:23.240> like

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
more legs you have like eight legs like

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.050 
more legs you have like eight legs like
a<00:02:23.600> spider<00:02:23.930> right<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.500> eight<00:02:24.800> legs<00:02:25.100> equals<00:02:25.340> hey

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
a spider right so eight legs equals hey

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.820 
a spider right so eight legs equals hey
I<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.420> use<00:02:26.600> more<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:26.900> them<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.230> put<00:02:27.380> up<00:02:27.500> boards

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
I can use more of them to put up boards

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.460 
I can use more of them to put up boards
on<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.130> window<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.240> poisonous<00:02:29.720> effect<00:02:30.110> does

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
on a window the poisonous effect does

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.950 
on a window the poisonous effect does
sound<00:02:30.920> interesting<00:02:31.280> perhaps<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:32.270> slow<00:02:32.780> down

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
sound interesting perhaps you slow down

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.500 
sound interesting perhaps you slow down
and<00:02:33.320> slowly<00:02:33.710> kill<00:02:34.160> zombies<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:34.940> they<00:02:35.120> hit<00:02:35.300> you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
and slowly kill zombies if they hit you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.510 
and slowly kill zombies if they hit you
perhaps<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.470> allows<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.040> escape<00:02:37.190> from

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
perhaps and allows you to escape from

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.840 
perhaps and allows you to escape from
possibly<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.450> group<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.780> zombies<00:02:38.930> or<00:02:39.460> maybe<00:02:40.460> I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
possibly a group of zombies or maybe I

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.990 
possibly a group of zombies or maybe I
