 is the recipe of the day is 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.790
 semolina with spring vegetables 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.130
 for 5 people 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.230
 we need 500 g of couscous 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.960
 turnip carrots 2 purple artichokes 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.830
 250 g of shelled peas 250 g of 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.860
 green beans 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.759
 250 g of fresh beans and caused a little 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:32.260
 olive oil salt and pepper 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:35.060
 we start with vegetables 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.550
 well recover good I admit I took the 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.489
 sale I already have them and side the little ones 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.469
 peas are Scottish and the beans are 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.260
 also Scottish 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.609
 thank you to the person who 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.019
 had caused for me it was really 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.030
 super nice i want i like a lot 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.539
 start again when you say more about 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.980
 carrots since they are young 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.179
 carrots tops and I will keep a 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.129
 little bit of isÃ¨re is always him 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.899
 for the presentation I equalize the top 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.899
 and then I'll clean all around 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.160
 certainly it's detail but when 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.580
 even prettier to have that in his 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.350
 plate 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.900
 we go to turnips on had to a 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.330
 very thick skin of the blow those ci ne 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.920
 not enough we take a knife and we 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.400
 do not hesitate to peel well as for 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.930
 the carrot 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.930
 we will keep some of the fans 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.520
 in p2 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.660
 it is the turn of the artichokes to enter 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.490
 track is expected immediately a bowl 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.450
 of water with lemon juice for 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.550
 put inside 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.440
 simply because on artichokes 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.850
 tends to blacken starts with 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.850
 remove the leaves while 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.899
 we will cut the upper part 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.930
 attention for this operation must 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.100
 take a very well sharpened knife 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.720
 because the leaves are pretty 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.390
 hard to cut jeans shortened there 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.390
 I'll come and fluff 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.850
 when removing the leaves from the lathe 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.280
 it's just to get to the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.869
 tender part of the artichoke that is 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.869
 eat even raw cut them in four 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.050
 m 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.790
 and then on realizes that a lot of 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.950
 points we do not hesitate to remove it 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.990
 they are then put in lemon water 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.300
 I then cut all the vegetables 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.130
 turnips I cut them into four or six 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.319
 and I take good care to make 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.230
 be careful that there is a piece of 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:43.400
 fans on every piece for them 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:45.290
 carrots I cut them into pieces if 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.790
 you're lucky to have a couscous 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.400
 here's how 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.100
 first step you wet your meal 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.020
 with half a liter of water a spoon 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.720
 free oil soup is a little salt 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.580
 you seed them with a fork and 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.040
 then simply you will put the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.160
 vegetables greeted in the steamer bowl of 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.470
 cushioned toulouse it puts about 10 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.510
 minutes to cook then you put by 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.459
 above the couscous seed for ten 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.930
 additional cooking minutes like 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.880
 you do not have the chance to have a 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.739
 Couscoussier do not panic 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.320
 several solutions are available to us 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.780
 already we are going to cook the vegetables and the 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.150
 semolina separately first solution the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.680
 microwave cooking 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.670
 I know it's not very academic but 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.530
 It works very well 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.510
 we start with washing the seed three 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.220
 once in the water and then drop them 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.709
 well we are at the bottom of a seed 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.019
 big dish that goes to the microphone I dirty and 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:41.299
 then I close tightly with 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:42.799
 two special microwave films and that's 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.090
 gone for 20 minutes in position of 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.980
 thawing second solution i'm going 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.489
 simply add water to him 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.079
 boiling 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.750
 I put the couscous seed in 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.489
 valence to say it I put the same volume 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.769
 of water to boil while waiting for the water 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.329
 comes to a boil have vassal and the 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.290
 red-haired frog and add him a 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.290
 good tablespoon of oil 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.599
 I pour boiling water on the seed 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.599
 couscous 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.690
 at 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.540
 we cover and we wait patiently we go 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.699
 now cook the vegetables to the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.229
 steam for 15 to 20 minutes 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.940
 when I say vegetables Thursday every 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.440
 vegetables except small artichokes 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.729
 purple that we will cook in the water 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.880
 lemon to prevent them from 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.880
 blacken 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.580
 the water is boiling it will have to 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.940
 cover for it to cook at the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.500
 steam 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.910
 I have a small problem is that words 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.660
 covered that the holes hole of the blow 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.130
 I put a sheet of paper 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.720
 cooking between the two for it to be 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.610
 well hermetically sealed and common sense 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.480
 I'll put my artichokes to cook 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.640
 for 15 minutes and remains only 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.430
 wait time before cooking 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.870
 to be able to eat all that both 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.790
 lovers are ready we will be able everything 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.650
 right away see the difference at the level of 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.510
 cooking then at the level of those 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.460
 that we cooked in the same volume 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.780
 of water and that's well inflated she is a 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.130
 little compact then suddenly we will 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.820
 serve as a fork for the greens 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.770
 and there was a sort of valve couscous 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.480
 welcomed in savior jondeau so she 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.040
 is good it knows a little bit heavy 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.720
 we will see the difference with that 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.610
 steamed at the subway 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.590
 and it's the same we will come the gray noses 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.270
 with the fork at the level of the 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.080
 texture we get a seed of 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.680
 couscous much more the ja the 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.430
 steamed vegetables are cooked we go 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.430
 be able to switch to service 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.430
 m 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.010
 this recipe will be perfect in 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.590
 accompaniment of roast leg of lamb 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.680
 oven but also simply in dishes 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.090

 vegetables that's when you balance a 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.500
 carrot it can be cut in half 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.500
 like that
