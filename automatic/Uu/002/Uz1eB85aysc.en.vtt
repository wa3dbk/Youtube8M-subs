there<00:06:34.130> one<00:06:34.520> behind<00:06:34.820> it<00:06:35.030> come<00:06:35.750> one<00:06:35.960> through

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
there one behind it come one through

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.110 
there one behind it come one through
those<00:06:36.620> trees<00:06:37.010> then<00:06:37.520> we<00:06:37.640> have<00:06:37.790> one<00:06:37.970> in<00:06:38.090> the

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
those trees then we have one in the

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.730 
those trees then we have one in the
front<00:06:40.419> based<00:06:41.419> on<00:06:41.660> how<00:06:41.870> low<00:06:42.050> that<00:06:42.080> is<00:06:42.470> i<00:06:42.500> would

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
front based on how low that is i would

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.590 
front based on how low that is i would
say<00:06:43.010> maybe<00:06:43.280> that's<00:06:43.610> next<00:06:44.030> style<00:06:44.270> now

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
say maybe that's next style now

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.180 
say maybe that's next style now
hopefully<00:06:45.380> no<00:06:45.560> more<00:06:45.740> is<00:06:45.919> next<00:06:46.870> okay<00:06:47.919> now<00:06:48.919> we're

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
hopefully no more is next okay now we're

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.270 
hopefully no more is next okay now we're
gonna<00:06:49.340> go<00:06:49.550> hit<00:06:49.729> the<00:06:49.880> road

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280
