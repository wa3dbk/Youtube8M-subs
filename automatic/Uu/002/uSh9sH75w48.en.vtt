 what happened we are going fiercely 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.040
 bleeding in an ambulance on the way 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.130
 to the hospital 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.070
 He thinks back often to quasi 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840
 few friends this is already a big can 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.849

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.080
 and instead of me doing it

 fireworks victims want the following 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.730
 sometimes just go back to work 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.950
 but it is no longer there 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.510
 driving and practicing hobbies 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.460
 even put on pants 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.410
 everything goes differently mikey has with 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.940
 switch three years after the accident 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 always struggling 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.050
 well i'm looking for my own of course 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.750
 completely broken I could literally get into my 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.860
 look at your fingers 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.469
 when it happened itself i was a little bit 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.879
 sure to do not quite understand me yet 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.559
 but once I wasn't in the hospital 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.309
 in the drink was also a bit 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.739
 worked out 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.030
 yet you're a photo shock I was 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.080
 rather scared I'd lose my fingers 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.700
 to be 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.770
 the simple things like for example 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.119
 watching television it has taken months 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.680
 I lasted my fingers really 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.970
 use cool 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.650
 I will never have that feeling in him again 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.950
 in my index finger or on that fell 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.509
 with it 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.130
 men's middle finger in my thumb 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.100
 really felt completely gone 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.939
 but then on that first leg 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.060
 feel in it 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.560
 and my middle finger to second coaching 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.909
 but, for example, every physical look then 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.250
 I started to get my fingers back on 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.180
 use with daily things began to 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.009
 to do 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.299
 the sleeve to sample too much in a thought 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.680
 I why don't I and so will I 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.420
 just next to the remote control 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 busy because I just don't feel the inside 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.579

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.570

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.280
 just for a year 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.810
 jogging pants walked because we nail 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.470

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.689
 with your work 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.549
 I lost my job because 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.990

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.630
 years in which you sit late 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.729
 so you also have a tiltable cost 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.490
