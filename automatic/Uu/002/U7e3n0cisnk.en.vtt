00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.800
 being able not to blaspheme at the beginning of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.259
 video 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.900

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 they offered us for free 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.080
 more than anything else today I call ourselves 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.309
 had the chance to try the drink 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.350
 single player in the game coop e 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.969
