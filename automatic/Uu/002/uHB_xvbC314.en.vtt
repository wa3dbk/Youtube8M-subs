00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.450
 also how were you welcome to how 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.590
 play interpret on the guitar and good 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.870
 this case we will learn a technique 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.099
 to make regios differently 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.099
 using these two fingers 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.510
 then the technique 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.160
 very well already saw that what you have to 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.160
 to do is let's click here 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.320
 and we return 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.660
 well and now we are going through a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.660
 thing 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.799
 I am going up and down 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.120
 and the other one is so it's important is 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.159
 that the middle ring finger is supported 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.030
 here 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:14.340
 so that I'm more comfortable 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:18.640
 from all of this 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.790
 so that the middle ring finger is that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.790
 have 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.220
 and this is good because it helps 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.430
 indeed 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.750
 but first 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.050
 and always supports 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.840
 this is like an axis that makes one 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.840
 when leaning on it leans on the shaft 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.740
 happy 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.940
 do not 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.950
 very good, I hope you liked it 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.950
 see you next
