00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
stuff like an enchanting room my

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.910 
stuff like an enchanting room my
particles<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.780> flow<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> always

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
particles go flow and you can always

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.910 
particles go flow and you can always
look<00:01:44.250> at<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.909> puts<00:01:45.649> simulations<00:01:46.649> such

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
look at that like puts simulations such

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.730 
look at that like puts simulations such
as<00:01:47.130> trees<00:01:47.490> moving<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> ring<00:01:48.570> grass<00:01:49.170> moving

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
as trees moving in the ring grass moving

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.210 
as trees moving in the ring grass moving
and<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:50.909> always<00:01:51.060> learn<00:01:51.450> from<00:01:51.509> that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and you can always learn from that

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.280 
and you can always learn from that
then<00:01:54.220> she<00:01:54.880> look<00:01:55.060> in<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.330> expressive<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.140> how

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
then she look in the expressive and how

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.670 
then she look in the expressive and how
I<00:01:56.320> did<00:01:56.620> them<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:57.130> did<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.790> moms<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.330> can<00:01:58.680> find
