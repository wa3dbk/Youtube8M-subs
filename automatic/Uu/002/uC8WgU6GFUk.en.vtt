 Hi, my name is Darek KraÅ›nicki 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:11.133
 and in this video I will remind all professional drivers to when they must exchange a new EU driving license with a code 

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:18.133
 95 - this applies to both truck and bus drivers, but the dates are slightly different. 

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:29.533
 Unfortunately, by September 10, 2012, the largest exchange of professional driving rights is true and I remind you: truck drivers 

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:41.133
 who did their law before December 31, 2000 must unfortunately go to periodic training, pass this training 

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:48.667
 then do medical and psychotechnical tests and go to the communication department with these documents. 

00:00:48.667 --> 00:01:02.000
 So truck drivers until September 10, 2012 - all of them have right before December 31, 2000. 

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:16.667
 Of course, bus drivers - all who have a right before 31 December 2005 are also required by 10 September 2012 

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.000
 to do periodic training. 

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:33.000
 In 2013, by September 10, truck drivers who obtained the right cat. C between January 1, 2001 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.800
 until December 31, 2005. 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:49.130
 Bus drivers who obtained the law from January 1, 2006 to September 10, 2008. 

00:01:49.933 --> 00:02:03.470
 By September 10, 2014, only a small group of truck drivers who obtained the law between January 1, 2006 

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:14.730
 until September 10, 2009 we remember that since 2009, new regulations have been in force. 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:25.270
 I would like to remind you once again that we must do periodic training first, then only after periodic training 

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:35.000
 we do medical and psychological examinations, we go to the communication department and exchange driving license there. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 I mentioned it nicely - for one, the second and you have to pay for the third one, that is for the training, for the doctor, for the psychologist. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.930
 All fees related to the exchange of driving licenses. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.730
 Validity periods are usually 5 years for drivers aged up to 60 or 30 months for older drivers. 

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:03.470
 However, the doctor or psychologist can shorten it. 

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:10.600
 Also on this end, the system is a bit complicated, but I invite all drivers to comment 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.200
 this video. 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.200
 Is such exchange of driving licenses every few years on the EU with the code 95 instead of old indefinite courses on the carriage of goods and people 

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:22.670
 makes sense.
