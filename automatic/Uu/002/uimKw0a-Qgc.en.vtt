00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.030
 Hi Guys, I'm the worst registered. 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.639
 I'm making this channel holder 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.779
 give some performance tips to people who are starting wanting 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.109
 learn something 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.599
 in this first video here I've done a drawing 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.179
 here you can see 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.739
 It's already missing here. 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.919
 the fine is a program that is very basic very simple to work with it 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.190
 and the benefit of basic education to show you how I 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.010
 process of deviation 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.290
 before we make the drawing itself 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.300
 Yes, I need what, but let's think about the drawing. 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.350
 as father 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.940
 geometric shapes or 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.050
 good squares 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 circled five balls, right? 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.720
 or anything that is the doctor that we may be 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.000
 using whole transform the calf that we want it is principle 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.250
 basic of any drawing and this is what I'm showing you can see 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.650
 on that red line 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.200
 How about making the markings? 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.130
 of the character 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.130
 basically with framed balls 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.050
 which forms cylinders there also 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.050
 that this can be very very confusing perspective 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.170
 The style of the foot foot shape so you would rather not work with it 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.600
 the basic principle of design which 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.719
 that was often the people say that it does not have 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.390
 some know how to start 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.420
 But for you to start, just come in to win. Example is a felipe doll. 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.510
 holes so you make a ball turn your head and more viscount to 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.260
 arm and another leg and 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.280
 only we put a little more depth 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.970
 putting 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.320
 The pieces themselves will now move on. 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.110
 part of the latex we already have the certificate of free choice 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 we'll know what to do 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.020
 now Scottish 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.189
 we can say that yes finishing the body of the character 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.049
 here is going to put it in fact we want to put the expressions of the face 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.719
 the happy rock band 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.989
 whatever you want 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.419
 and it is possible 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.319
 in this also change some things and is lucid 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.829
 we do not have any problem 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.809
 but having the base 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.739
 underneath the tvs 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.599
 but I do 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.629
 where to put the hair all this helps a lot when it comes to making everything right 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.659
 cartoonist use much simpler in the end 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.969
 many details nothing 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.969
 practically alone 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.179
 now I'm going to go down a little faster than 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.299
 the decision which 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.299
 the sexy process 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.969
 if it were to say that it is so easy to structure it then synapses pension 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.509
 frozen military cup may want to do it 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.949
 the character 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.119
 Hehehe 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.860
 shortly after the tricolor 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.090
 the guests the case 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.090
 I'll put your query to finalize. 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.889
 well this is the first of them 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.539
 who leaves the team is ahead I will teach a little more 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:45.859
 this index who has questions with the parties the comments below
