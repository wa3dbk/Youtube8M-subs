here<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:07.040> BH<00:01:08.960> 1750<00:01:09.960> light

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
here we have the the BH 1750 light

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.940 
here we have the the BH 1750 light
sensor<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.790> let's<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.049> set<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> give

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
sensor so let's get this set up and give

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.560 
sensor so let's get this set up and give
it<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.100> go<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.310> sensor<00:01:17.820> I'll<00:01:18.360> go

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it a go so this is the sensor I'll go

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.810 
it a go so this is the sensor I'll go
ahead<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.040> package<00:01:20.520> here

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
ahead and get it out of the package here

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.370 
ahead and get it out of the package here
it<00:01:20.939> looks<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.180> we've<00:01:21.420> got<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.900> bit<00:01:22.259> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
it looks like we've got a little bit of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
it looks like we've got a little bit of
assembly<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:25.759> simple<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:27.030> header<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
assembly to do simple little header and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.130 
assembly to do simple little header and
a<00:01:28.439> nice<00:01:29.009> little<00:01:29.369> package<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> board<00:01:30.540> set<00:01:31.110> up

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
a nice little package for a board set up

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.859 
a nice little package for a board set up
and<00:01:31.500> these<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.670> supposed<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.240> 5<00:01:33.630> volt

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and these are supposed to be 5 volt

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.870 
and these are supposed to be 5 volt
compliant<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.619> well<00:01:34.979> according<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.579> IC

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
compliant as well according to IC

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730 
compliant as well according to IC
station<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:36.869> need<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.290> any<00:01:37.500> fancy

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
station so we don't need to do any fancy

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.340 
station so we don't need to do any fancy
there<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.479> we'll<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.570> ahead<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.960> let's<00:01:40.140> get

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
there and we'll go ahead and let's get

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.300 
there and we'll go ahead and let's get
this<00:01:40.530> started<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.950> there's<00:01:44.159> many

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
this started up so there's many

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
this started up so there's many
different<00:01:44.490> ways<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
different ways you can do this

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.469 
different ways you can do this
my<00:01:46.439> preference<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.460> putting<00:01:48.000> these<00:01:48.119> headers

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
my preference for putting these headers

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.950 
my preference for putting these headers
on<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.990> use<00:01:49.890> my<00:01:50.100> third<00:01:50.399> hand<00:01:50.729> alligator<00:01:51.570> clip

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
on I use my third hand alligator clip

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.380 
on I use my third hand alligator clip
here<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.610> coincidentally<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.149> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
here and coincidentally when you do this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.870 
here and coincidentally when you do this
if<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.079> clamp<00:01:55.320> onto<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> pins<00:01:56.130> you're<00:01:56.490> also

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
if you clamp onto the pins you're also

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.660 
if you clamp onto the pins you're also
giving<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.270> heat<00:01:57.509> sink<00:01:57.869> which<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.860> stop<00:01:59.369> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
giving a heat sink which will stop you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
giving a heat sink which will stop you
from<00:01:59.700> melting<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> header<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
from melting the header if you're a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
from melting the header if you're a
little<00:02:02.070> overzealous<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> heat<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.229> what

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
little overzealous with the heat so what

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.969 
little overzealous with the heat so what
you<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.460> take<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.560> set<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
you do is just take this set it on the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.490 
you do is just take this set it on the
pins<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.179> our<00:02:09.330> case<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.410> going

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
pins and in our case this one is going

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.380 
pins and in our case this one is going
to<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:10.920> easy<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.580> really<00:02:11.940> tight<00:02:12.150> fit

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
to be really easy it's really tight fit

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.200 
to be really easy it's really tight fit
on<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> pin

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210

so<00:02:13.600> we<00:02:13.720> don't<00:02:13.810> need<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.080> worry<00:02:14.440> about<00:02:14.560> our

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
so we don't need to worry about our

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.200 
so we don't need to worry about our

someone will knock my soldering job but

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.630 
someone will knock my soldering job but
that's<00:02:41.410> plenty<00:02:41.709> good<00:02:41.890> enough<00:02:42.130> for<00:02:42.340> what<00:02:42.490> we

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
that's plenty good enough for what we

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.030 
that's plenty good enough for what we
need<00:02:42.670> there<00:02:43.660> we<00:02:43.780> go<00:02:43.900> we're<00:02:44.170> all<00:02:44.290> set<00:02:44.560> let's<00:02:44.800> get

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
need there we go we're all set let's get

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.410 
need there we go we're all set let's get
this<00:02:45.190> on<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.430> breadboard<00:02:47.760> my<00:02:48.760> only<00:02:49.060> complaint

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
this on the breadboard my only complaint

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.740 
this on the breadboard my only complaint
with<00:02:49.810> some<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.200> these<00:02:50.550> sensors<00:02:51.550> they're<00:02:52.450> very

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
with some of these sensors they're very

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.540 
with some of these sensors they're very
clearly<00:02:53.050> labeled<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:53.950> we're<00:02:54.130> going<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.459> use

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
clearly labeled what we're going to use

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.140 
clearly labeled what we're going to use
is<00:02:54.970> VCC<00:02:55.360> ground<00:02:55.840> SCL<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.500> SDA<00:02:56.790> we<00:02:57.790> won't<00:02:57.970> need

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
is VCC ground SCL and SDA we won't need

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.229 
is VCC ground SCL and SDA we won't need
the<00:02:58.360> address<00:02:58.660> pin<00:02:58.959> today<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.350> don't<00:02:59.500> think<00:03:00.239> but

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
the address pin today I don't think but

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.390 
the address pin today I don't think but
as<00:03:01.450> usual<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.590> wrong<00:03:02.770> side<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.340> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
as usual it's on the wrong side of the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.750 
as usual it's on the wrong side of the
board<00:03:03.720> hey<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:05.110> wonder<00:03:05.830> whether<00:03:06.220> there's<00:03:06.580> some

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
board hey I wonder whether there's some

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.400 
board hey I wonder whether there's some
way<00:03:06.910> we<00:03:06.940> can<00:03:07.150> get<00:03:07.300> around<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.840> some<00:03:08.140> day<00:03:08.380> that

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
way we can get around this some day that

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.800 
way we can get around this some day that
we<00:03:09.130> can<00:03:09.310> think<00:03:09.489> ahead<00:03:09.670> on<00:03:09.970> our<00:03:10.000> silk-screening

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
we can think ahead on our silk-screening

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.600 
we can think ahead on our silk-screening
of<00:03:11.020> these<00:03:11.170> sensors<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.860> get<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.100> on<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.370> crack

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
of these sensors and get it on the crack

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.540 
of these sensors and get it on the crack
side<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.209> we<00:03:13.780> can<00:03:13.810> see<00:03:13.989> them<00:03:14.380> just<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.340> thought

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
side so we can see them just the thought

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.479 
side so we can see them just the thought
till<00:03:15.880> your<00:03:16.150> manufacturers<00:03:16.959> out<00:03:17.260> there<00:03:17.489> so

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
till your manufacturers out there so

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.280 
till your manufacturers out there so
we'll<00:03:18.850> go<00:03:18.970> ahead<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.450> we're<00:03:19.870> going<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.080> set

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
we'll go ahead and we're going to set

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.590 
we'll go ahead and we're going to set
this<00:03:20.440> up<00:03:20.500> on<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:20.860> board<00:03:20.980> we'll<00:03:21.970> set<00:03:22.299> our

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
this up on the board we'll set our

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.920 
this up on the board we'll set our
Arduino<00:03:23.140> into<00:03:23.620> place<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.280> we'll<00:03:25.090> get<00:03:25.660> started

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
Arduino into place and we'll get started

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:35.580 
Arduino into place and we'll get started
here

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.690 

so<00:03:36.069> we're<00:03:36.190> gonna<00:03:36.310> hook<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.819> serial<00:03:37.569> clock<00:03:38.700> to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
so we're gonna hook the serial clock to

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.460 
so we're gonna hook the serial clock to
analog<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.540> five<00:03:41.490> should<00:03:42.490> be<00:03:42.610> right<00:03:42.819> here

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
analog a five should be right here

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.110 
analog a five should be right here
the<00:03:44.470> SD<00:03:44.830> a<00:03:44.860> 2<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.550> 4<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:48.550> should<00:03:48.730> be<00:03:48.819> all<00:03:48.940> we

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
the SD a 2 a 4 that should be all we

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.699 
the SD a 2 a 4 that should be all we
need<00:03:49.150> guys<00:03:49.540> let's<00:03:50.020> go<00:03:50.140> ahead<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.470> get<00:03:50.560> the

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
need guys let's go ahead and get the

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.680 
need guys let's go ahead and get the
laptop<00:03:51.220> fired<00:03:51.670> up<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.060> get<00:03:52.150> some<00:03:52.300> code<00:03:52.510> on

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
laptop fired up and get some code on

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.479 
laptop fired up and get some code on
this<00:03:52.870> thing<00:03:55.530> already<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:56.980> finished<00:03:57.220> hooking

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
this thing already so I finished hooking

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.449 
this thing already so I finished hooking
this<00:03:57.790> up<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:58.209> did<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.510> hook<00:03:59.050> up<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.350> a3<00:03:59.800> to<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
this up I did a hook up the a3 to the

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.800 
this up I did a hook up the a3 to the
address<00:04:00.790> pin<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.060> don't<00:04:01.330> know<00:04:01.420> why<00:04:01.510> I<00:04:01.540> thought<00:04:01.750> I

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
address pin I don't know why I thought I

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.559 
address pin I don't know why I thought I
didn't<00:04:02.110> need<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.260> but<00:04:02.910> I'll<00:04:03.910> go<00:04:04.209> ahead<00:04:04.330> and

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
didn't need that but I'll go ahead and

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.510 
didn't need that but I'll go ahead and
I'll<00:04:04.630> make<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> forum<00:04:05.319> post<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:05.890> explain<00:04:06.280> this

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
I'll make a forum post to explain this

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.240 
I'll make a forum post to explain this
because<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.320> screenshare<00:04:08.320> this<00:04:08.560> way<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:08.980> just

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
because the screenshare this way is just

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.030 
because the screenshare this way is just
going<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.580> suck<00:04:09.850> but<00:04:10.450> I'll<00:04:11.110> explain<00:04:11.530> where<00:04:11.920> to

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
going to suck but I'll explain where to

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.100 
going to suck but I'll explain where to
get<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.280> code<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:12.519> how<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.000> do<00:04:13.269> it<00:04:13.300> I've

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
get the code and how to do it I've

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.319 
get the code and how to do it I've
already<00:04:14.650> hit<00:04:14.890> upload<00:04:15.250> on<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.550> code<00:04:15.760> will<00:04:16.030> open

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
already hit upload on the code will open

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.670 
already hit upload on the code will open
the<00:04:16.450> serial<00:04:16.660> monitor<00:04:16.900> here<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.489> we'll<00:04:19.209> see

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
the serial monitor here and we'll see

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.590 
the serial monitor here and we'll see
perfect<00:04:20.680> looks<00:04:21.100> like<00:04:21.310> we're<00:04:21.549> getting<00:04:21.730> varying

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
perfect looks like we're getting varying

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.440 
perfect looks like we're getting varying
luxe<00:04:22.870> readings<00:04:23.350> put<00:04:24.310> my<00:04:24.430> finger<00:04:24.760> over<00:04:24.790> it<00:04:25.210> and

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
luxe readings put my finger over it and

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.990 
luxe readings put my finger over it and
we<00:04:26.080> should<00:04:26.260> see<00:04:26.500> that<00:04:26.530> drop<00:04:26.950> down<00:04:27.000> perfect

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
we should see that drop down perfect

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.180 
we should see that drop down perfect
look<00:04:28.419> at<00:04:28.540> that<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.350> know<00:04:29.590> that's<00:04:29.979> a<00:04:30.100> little

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
look at that so I know that's a little

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.870 
look at that so I know that's a little
hard<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.669> read<00:04:30.880> so<00:04:31.630> let's<00:04:32.050> go<00:04:32.320> ahead<00:04:32.470> and

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
hard to read so let's go ahead and

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.610 
hard to read so let's go ahead and
remake<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.840> you<00:04:34.930> can<00:04:35.110> read<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.500> little

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
remake this so you can read it a little

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.980 
remake this so you can read it a little
bit<00:04:35.860> better<00:04:37.889> alrighty<00:04:38.889> guys<00:04:39.510> so<00:04:40.510> what<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:40.780> did

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
bit better alrighty guys so what it did

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.690 
bit better alrighty guys so what it did
as<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.800> hooked<00:04:42.010> up<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:43.180> sensor<00:04:43.600> same<00:04:43.870> as<00:04:44.080> before

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
as I hooked up the sensor same as before

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.940 
as I hooked up the sensor same as before
to<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:45.820> Arduino<00:04:46.180> Nano<00:04:46.300> but<00:04:47.080> I<00:04:47.110> added<00:04:47.410> the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
to the Arduino Nano but I added the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.050 
to the Arduino Nano but I added the
Nokia<00:04:48.370> 5110<00:04:49.090> LCD<00:04:49.630> screen<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.860> as<00:04:51.280> any<00:04:51.669> of<00:04:51.850> my

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
Nokia 5110 LCD screen and as any of my

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.750 
Nokia 5110 LCD screen and as any of my
subscribers<00:04:52.510> know<00:04:53.140> I<00:04:53.410> simply<00:04:53.860> love<00:04:54.460> these

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
subscribers know I simply love these

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.659 
subscribers know I simply love these
screens<00:04:55.210> for<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.630> price<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.830> we'll<00:04:57.340> see<00:04:57.550> if

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
screens for the price so we'll see if

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.700 
screens for the price so we'll see if
that<00:04:57.700> lets<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.780> view<00:04:59.020> this<00:04:59.229> a<00:04:59.289> little<00:04:59.470> bit

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
that lets you view this a little bit

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.580 
that lets you view this a little bit
better<00:04:59.860> i<00:05:00.070> modded<00:05:00.700> up<00:05:00.820> the<00:05:01.000> code<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.630> I'll

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
better i modded up the code and I'll

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.490 
better i modded up the code and I'll
post<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:03.100> code<00:05:03.250> on<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.550> on<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.300> on<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.080> forum

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
post the code on the on the on the forum

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.940 
post the code on the on the on the forum
so<00:05:06.190> everyone<00:05:06.580> can<00:05:06.760> have<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.770> let's<00:05:08.770> see

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
so everyone can have it and let's see

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.130 
so everyone can have it and let's see
what<00:05:09.100> we<00:05:09.220> get

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
what we get

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.420 
what we get
hopefully<00:05:11.140> this<00:05:11.470> should<00:05:11.710> fire<00:05:11.950> up<00:05:12.190> with<00:05:12.400> a

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
hopefully this should fire up with a

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.520 
hopefully this should fire up with a
splash<00:05:12.789> screen

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
splash screen

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.029 
splash screen
anylock<00:05:14.880> and<00:05:15.880> we've<00:05:16.600> got<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:17.050> light<00:05:17.410> sensor<00:05:17.860> and

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
anylock and we've got a light sensor and

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.670 
anylock and we've got a light sensor and
sure<00:05:18.550> enough<00:05:18.850> we've<00:05:19.180> got<00:05:19.330> a<00:05:19.360> lux<00:05:19.660> value<00:05:20.260> so

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
sure enough we've got a lux value so

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.020 
sure enough we've got a lux value so
let's<00:05:20.830> go<00:05:20.979> ahead<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.310> put<00:05:21.430> our<00:05:21.460> finger<00:05:21.850> over

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
let's go ahead and put our finger over

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.070 
let's go ahead and put our finger over
the<00:05:22.390> sensor<00:05:23.020> ah<00:05:23.610> perfect<00:05:24.610> look<00:05:25.000> that<00:05:25.240> works

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
the sensor ah perfect look that works

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.800 
the sensor ah perfect look that works
like<00:05:26.289> a<00:05:26.350> champ<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:26.950> right<00:05:27.910> here<00:05:28.210> on<00:05:28.240> the<00:05:28.570> bench

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
like a champ so right here on the bench

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.460 
like a champ so right here on the bench
we're<00:05:29.350> looking<00:05:29.650> at<00:05:29.770> about<00:05:30.090> 770<00:05:31.090> lux<00:05:31.390> I'll<00:05:32.229> take

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
we're looking at about 770 lux I'll take

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.060 
we're looking at about 770 lux I'll take
flashlight<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:33.539> let's<00:05:34.680> start<00:05:35.680> hitting<00:05:36.010> it

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
flashlight and let's start hitting it

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.370 
flashlight and let's start hitting it
and<00:05:36.250> you<00:05:36.340> can<00:05:36.490> see<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:37.539> value<00:05:37.930> goes<00:05:38.110> up

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
and you can see the value goes up

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.219 
and you can see the value goes up
exponentially<00:05:39.039> and<00:05:39.600> there's<00:05:40.600> a<00:05:40.690> laser<00:05:40.960> in

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
exponentially and there's a laser in

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.980 
exponentially and there's a laser in
this<00:05:41.410> flashlight<00:05:41.740> too<00:05:42.100> but<00:05:42.370> I

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
this flashlight too but I

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.180 
this flashlight too but I
know<00:05:43.169> whether<00:05:43.319> I'll<00:05:43.530> hit<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:43.740> with<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.009> I

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
know whether I'll hit it with that I

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.730 
know whether I'll hit it with that I
sure<00:05:44.759> how<00:05:44.880> good<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:45.270> would<00:05:45.419> be<00:05:45.600> for<00:05:45.900> us<00:05:45.930> but

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
sure how good that would be for us but

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.070 
sure how good that would be for us but
we<00:05:46.919> can<00:05:47.069> get<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:47.340> up<00:05:47.490> into<00:05:47.669> the<00:05:47.880> 16,000<00:05:48.840> range

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
we can get it up into the 16,000 range

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.510 
we can get it up into the 16,000 range
with<00:05:49.319> this<00:05:49.440> flashlight<00:05:49.710> no<00:05:50.190> problem<00:05:51.199> I've<00:05:52.199> got

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
with this flashlight no problem I've got

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.249 
with this flashlight no problem I've got
pretty<00:05:53.520> fast<00:05:53.819> reaction<00:05:54.509> time<00:05:54.539> in<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.050> code

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
pretty fast reaction time in the code

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.950 
pretty fast reaction time in the code
and<00:05:55.580> yeah<00:05:56.580> you<00:05:56.940> can<00:05:57.060> display<00:05:57.360> it<00:05:57.449> out<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.840> an

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
and yeah you can display it out to an

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.469 
and yeah you can display it out to an
LCD<00:05:58.319> screen<00:05:58.470> or<00:05:58.979> do<00:05:59.160> whatever<00:05:59.610> you<00:06:00.030> like<00:06:00.060> with
