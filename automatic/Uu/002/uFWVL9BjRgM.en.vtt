00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.830
 because it is standing official fashion week ' 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.920
 in this season not good this 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.990
 season and all seasons because 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.640
 because it is already a reference because the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.640
 quality of what we see every time is 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.759
 better and because I come to learn I have to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.499
 soak I come to cut out my old 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.350
 times because it is important to have a 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:33.410
 picture a style 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.450
 because it makes you feel good to you beyond 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.230
 from my point of view beyond what 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.600
 that people think of you I think what 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.240
 important is how you feel and how 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.250
 you see yourself 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.580
 I really am as selfish in that 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.040
 sense and I notice first that I 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.750
 feel good and that I feel comfortable do not 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.080
 I go out a lot of the schemes 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.930
 square and I do not break, I do not eat too much 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.870
 but when you give it to me , I look good, I think 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:08.040
 that automatically project safety 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.040
 and trust and that is finally connecting 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.550
 has because it is important to do for the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.680
 official in fashion week for official 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.640
 Well, you think it's my first fashion 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.770

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.140
 that is father and live in this type of 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.729
 events know support friends come 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.229
 here also support then I think the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.840
 support is important who are the 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.729
 friends who invited me here is 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.990
 important for a person in the eye 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.450
 public because it is important to have a 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.850
 modern style image 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.310
 I think being unique is the most important 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.729
 no more than a fashion definitely be 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.990
 unique and be be yourself be honest with 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:59.140
 one with yourself with what you like 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:02:00.640
 use and what you want to express good 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.130
 it's important to come to fashion week ' 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.289
 because good I put two reasons 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.369
 I come because I'm a fan of rolling closet 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.560
 and this and the other reason is because I 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.300
 Mexican fashion is very popular 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 Mexican talent and I feel that there is 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.430
 support it and it gives me great pleasure that big 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.840
 brands sponsor events like this the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.780
 Mexican designers who are your 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.910
 favorite clara gonzÃ¡lez this royal 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.380
 closet ok when you have to choose a 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.420
 look for an event in which is what 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.310
 you think 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.640
 then do not depend on my state of 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.640
 encouragement but always think of black 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.640
 statement 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.120
 because the flower handkerchief rather as 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.760
 I think for a little bit to play 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.010
 to change if I put on a handkerchief and 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.170
 now in spring the flower I think 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.910
 It's perfect for the season and 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.099
 combining the striking colors of the 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.680
 flower with a tie a little more 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.660
 elegant then it was fun 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.670
 I tell that I always do to who else 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.620
 supports is that who else do you like 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.650
 and the support that I present 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.959
 great proposals I have always said no 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.440
 just doing mode is good good quality 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.180
 manufacture good style proposal and not 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.360
 copy other designs but really 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:33.920
 propose I think that 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:35.960
 who replenishes the good front that is 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.450
 so important to come to the decision weeks as 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.730
 watch the news every morning 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.350
 you have to keep updated and if you 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.240
 invite to such a fashion event 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.980
 important as the fashion week 'because 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.050
 what better opportunity to know that 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.520
 is carrying and know how to see you 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.830
 perfect and what it is more smoke 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.000
 of fashion every day and you consider 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.290
 that coming to the fault very much that is 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.780
 raising your bit to support 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.620
 to Mexican designers 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.690
 I am one hundred percent fashionista 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.150
 national even though I'm not Mexican 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.010
 well my heart i live in mexico and 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.190
 I thank Mexico for everything I have and 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.270
 I am already my heart is more Mexican than 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.620
 something else then if I'm a fan of the 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.620
 national designers 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.220
 how important an image is in a 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.409
 own style is very important always 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.569
 so I always think that for 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:33.030
 everyone is important around the world 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.629
 uses a disguise not a uniform those 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.060
 doctors waiters lawyers 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:41.400
 then everything is part of an image one 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.099
 picture of every day to me then I 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.319
 It's a lot of fun and it's part of who I am 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.960
 from tiny and you like to play with the 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.030
 Fashion a lot I really like to have fun today 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.500
 for example I thought 50 times if I put 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.009
 this little thing of the head or not and of 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.470
 repeat 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.690
 Well because it is not real and is not a 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.650
 life or death decision is to put text 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.650
 and go outside
