00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.440
 chevrolet lacetti 2000 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:20.160
 number of years the car is ready 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.010
 such certificate on which the screw is specified 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.720
 my car machines are registered on 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.780
 manufacturer's website 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.910
 studying it apa yes i mean it 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.520
 ensures that the firmware is not 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.739
 stolen not downloaded from so here forms 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.170
 and so on that is 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.150
 software is all non-original when you 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.960
 here que tu cauldron of which is possible for 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:51.269
 In addition, as well, and only three phku period letters 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.630
 on tell me briefly what with 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.960
 I wanted to flash the machine 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.420
 increase capacity decrease available 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.270
 and what did not like the car factory 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.480
 I don't like the method 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.540
 long 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.310
 dad chases buy where did she know all 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.270
 same there is a chip tuning total nafig it 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.780
 men took me a friend and areva this 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.000
 a leg 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.030
 went petition 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.600
 immediately felt that is on the air conditioner 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.120
 already she is not wrong she is with a collector 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.420
 leaves faster she liked him 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.310
 this friends are also the same buying 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.310
 let's go ride up now tell me 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.060
 what did you do you did a trial 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.430
 the trip is a lot true here is 23 kilometers 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.900
 sweep well tell us what we have 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.350
 there were changes before the car 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:53.119
 failures now failure no car clearly 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.950
 reacts to how the failure looked well 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.420
 like a pedal when you press it 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.090
 dulled already only then begins 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 slowly smoothly accelerate on now 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.119
 put everything on odd he pressed the pedal she 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.100
 shot here is cheeky to live 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.610
 more importantly some kind of power even on 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.209
 joy or more important to the car 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.800
 obeyed the driver 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.489
 faster or both and one another 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.480
 does not interfere 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.830
 it accelerates as faster faster 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.900
 inside the shooting gallery I realized that it makes sense 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:33.590
 swept and this is before doubted 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.320
 Group breaks are something your car oh well 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.739
 Thank you all for choosing our luck 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.739
