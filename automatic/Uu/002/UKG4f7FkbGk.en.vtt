00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
going to do is take some time here to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.330 
going to do is take some time here to
show<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.130> how<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.609> pieces<00:00:30.300> work<00:00:30.900> together

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
show you how the pieces work together

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.240 
show you how the pieces work together
first<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.520> all<00:00:33.079> we<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.230> these<00:00:34.410> utility<00:00:35.010> bowls

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
first of all we have these utility bowls

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130 
first of all we have these utility bowls
there's<00:00:35.730> two<00:00:35.940> different<00:00:36.270> sizes<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.719> them<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
there's two different sizes of them and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.930 
there's two different sizes of them and
they<00:00:37.350> come<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> plastic<00:00:38.219> lid<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.730> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
they come with a plastic lid so that you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.729 
they come with a plastic lid so that you
can<00:00:39.090> actually<00:00:39.210> store<00:00:39.750> food<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
can actually store food in the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.889 
can actually store food in the
refrigerator<00:00:40.969> now<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> benefits<00:00:42.480> is

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
refrigerator now one of the benefits is

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
refrigerator now one of the benefits is
is<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.649> made<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.370> surgical<00:00:44.730> steel<00:00:45.059> so

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
is that made out of surgical steel so

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.310 
is that made out of surgical steel so
that<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.809> food<00:00:46.020> will<00:00:46.230> never<00:00:46.500> react<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.670> your

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
that the food will never react with your

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.770 
that the food will never react with your
bowl<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:50.399> bulls<00:00:50.640> also<00:00:51.449> work<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:53.480> dome<00:00:54.480> lid

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
bowl the bulls also work as a dome lid

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.110 
bowl the bulls also work as a dome lid
so<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> things<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so one of the things that you can do is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.750 
so one of the things that you can do is
cook<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> larger<00:00:58.590> volume<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.219> food<00:00:59.399> let's

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
cook like a larger volume of food let's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
cook like a larger volume of food let's
say<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> standing<00:01:00.420> rib<00:01:00.570> roast<00:01:00.629> or<00:01:01.109> something

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
say a standing rib roast or something

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.850 
say a standing rib roast or something
like<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.640> now<00:01:02.719> one<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> drawbacks<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
like that now one of the drawbacks is is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.350 
like that now one of the drawbacks is is
that<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> lids<00:01:05.369> don't<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> knob<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
that the lids don't have a knob on the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.670 
that the lids don't have a knob on the
top<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.900> company<00:01:07.799> invented<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:09.680> heat-resistant

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
top so company invented a heat-resistant

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.500 
top so company invented a heat-resistant
suction<00:01:11.130> knob<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.850> allows<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> remove

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
suction knob so it allows you to remove

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.510 
suction knob so it allows you to remove
the<00:01:12.720> lid<00:01:12.900> without<00:01:13.470> burning<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:13.860> fingers<00:01:14.070> or

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the lid without burning your fingers or

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.749 
the lid without burning your fingers or
having<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> use<00:01:15.270> oven<00:01:15.689> mitts

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
having to use oven mitts

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
having to use oven mitts
now<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> bowls<00:01:18.180> also<00:01:18.900> work<00:01:19.700> as<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:22.350> double

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
now the bowls also work as a double

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
now the bowls also work as a double
boiler<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> melt<00:01:24.210> chocolate

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
boiler so if you like to melt chocolate

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.899 
boiler so if you like to melt chocolate
or<00:01:24.960> heat<00:01:25.320> milk<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.759> there

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
or heat milk you can do that in there

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.240 
or heat milk you can do that in there
quite<00:01:27.119> efficiently<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.170> lids<00:01:28.409> also<00:01:29.009> work

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
quite efficiently the lids also work

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.760 
quite efficiently the lids also work
with<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> utility<00:01:30.090> bowls<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:31.020> when<00:01:31.619> you're

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
with the utility bowls so when you're

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770 
with the utility bowls so when you're
taking<00:01:31.979> food<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.970> fridge<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.630> can

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
taking food out of the fridge you can

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
taking food out of the fridge you can
actually<00:01:33.930> reheat<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.400> back<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
actually reheat it right back in the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.620 
actually reheat it right back in the
same<00:01:36.119> unit<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.840> stored<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:38.630> stack

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
same unit that you stored it in stack

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.390 
same unit that you stored it in stack
cooking<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> real<00:01:40.439> benefit<00:01:40.920> using<00:01:41.130> this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
cooking is a real benefit using this

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.789 
cooking is a real benefit using this
cookware<00:01:41.670> using<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> large<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.770> small

inside<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.950> 8<00:02:17.160> quart<00:02:18.740> now<00:02:19.740> we<00:02:19.830> could<00:02:20.190> be

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
inside the 8 quart now we could be

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.640 
inside the 8 quart now we could be
cooking<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.880> roast<00:02:21.210> beef<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.810> vegetables<00:02:22.530> in

of the roast with a small utility bowl

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.360 
of the roast with a small utility bowl
and<00:02:29.850> then<00:02:29.940> use<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.300> large<00:02:30.510> utility<00:02:31.110> bowl<00:02:31.370> to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
and then use the large utility bowl to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.760 
and then use the large utility bowl to
cover<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.180> create<00:02:33.480> an<00:02:33.660> oven<00:02:34.020> infect<00:02:34.410> right

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
cover it to create an oven infect right

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.710 
cover it to create an oven infect right
inside<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.340> we<00:02:35.460> have<00:02:35.610> roast<00:02:35.880> beef<00:02:35.970> vegetables

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
inside so we have roast beef vegetables

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.820 
inside so we have roast beef vegetables
and<00:02:37.050> cake<00:02:37.410> for<00:02:37.590> dessert<00:02:37.890> all<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.430> one<00:02:38.610> unit<00:02:39.830> so

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
and cake for dessert all in one unit so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.680 
and cake for dessert all in one unit so
that's<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.280> efficient<00:02:41.730> use<00:02:41.790> with<00:02:42.540> these

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
that's the efficient use with these

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.430 
that's the efficient use with these
utility<00:02:43.260> bowls<00:02:43.610> now<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:45.360> utility<00:02:45.810> rack<00:02:46.020> has

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
utility bowls now the utility rack has

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.310 
utility bowls now the utility rack has
another<00:02:46.830> feature<00:02:47.300> comes<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.450> two<00:02:48.660> parts<00:02:49.110> so

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
another feature comes in two parts so

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.199 
another feature comes in two parts so
that<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.770> can<00:02:49.890> be<00:02:49.980> used<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.520> two<00:02:50.940> different

rather<00:02:54.330> than<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:54.780> drilling<00:02:55.020> holes<00:02:55.440> we

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
rather than just drilling holes we

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.699 
rather than just drilling holes we
actually<00:02:56.630> created<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.690> greater<00:02:57.959> system<00:02:58.530> so

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
actually created a greater system so
