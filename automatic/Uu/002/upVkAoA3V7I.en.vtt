 ac current signal addition 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.430
 pulse transformer can 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.520
 also be used as 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.010
 converters 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.760

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.130

 on inductance russia did not work 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.060
 also on a design with high durability 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.190
 isolating the problem of stress not having 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.259
 two kilovolts 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.109
 these requirements are primarily due to 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.009
 rectangular shape voltage with greater 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.380

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.020

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.620
 Didkovsky have inside a

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.130
 coils 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.799
 for getting small value 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.080
 inductance russia think 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.110
 one of the works of the window matur gossip between 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.490
 which put the second winding 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.360
 in some pulse transformer 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.740
 primary and secondary winding is wound 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.110
 simultaneously two wires so 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.060
 children of one job are located between 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.939
 in rows of another 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.230

 pulse transformer not 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.089
 fail practically 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:28.319
 which explains their high reliability 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.319
 which is embedded in technology 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.589
 manufacturing 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:32.989
 pulse transformer 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.580
 is one of the most 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.439
 responsible system elements 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.319
 switching power supply 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.369
 making it yourself 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.339
 leads to sad consequences 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.589
 harnessed calculation bucha system 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:46.239
 especially since each model 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.819
 transformers designed for the 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.320
 or another system 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.579
 individually 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.459
 characteristic feature 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.689
 pulse transformers in 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.119
 difference from transformer 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.740
 voltage is something 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.780
 that the second time its winding should be 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.510
 necessarily 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.670
 closed load openness 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.409
 the state of the secondary is 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.789
 unknown for various reasons 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:09.449
 pulsed operating mode 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:10.710

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.520
 its power voltage cascade is all intact 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.680
 depends on the parameters and quality 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.110
 by transformer assembly that 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.420
 entirely affects the performance 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.870
 subject collections for the sake of 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.290
