00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.480
 Hi Jakob, Unisport WebTV. 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.150
 And today it's finally time - 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.550
 - to report: Nike Mercurial Superfly 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.460
 As Nike says is made for explosive - speed 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.130
 And to be honest, I've had high expectations for Superfly. 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.730
 But the question is: Can it live up to them? 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.400
 Hang on and find out. 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.750
 As you probably know, Superfly is made to remove distractions - 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.510
 - and give you a smooth feel by using a Flyknit top and this iconic Dynamic Fit Collar. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.370
 But taking Superfly on can seem a bit difficult at first because of Dynamic Fit Collar. 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.060
 But once you've caught it, it's actually not that hard. See for yourself. 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.330
 Pretty easy. 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.840
 When you first get Superfly on your feet, you can really feel that it is made with Nikes V12 read. 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.660
 Simply because it is quite narrow around the middle foot and has a rather low and pointed snout. 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.040
 So the fit is really close all around the foot. 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.080
 Especially if you have a broad footing. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.170
 In which case Superfly might not be for you. 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.930
 However, it is a bit wider than the previous generations of Mercurial. 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.770
 The V12 reading also means that Superfly is 1/4 to 1/2 size longer. 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.060
 So keep in mind when choosing size, and maybe consider going down 1/2 size if you want the closest possible fit. 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.280
 The fact that it is a little long means that I have a little room in the front of the boot. 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.750
 Which is a bit of a shame and I was hoping that Nike had adjusted it on the V12 read to the new Superfly. 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.950
 As far as the fit is concerned, the Superfly, yes, let's just say: It's great! 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.330
 The Flyknit top is so thin and so extremely soft that it really sneaks around the foot and hugs it - 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
 - basically as if it were made for your feet. 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.000
 It feels a bit like a thin sock, because there are no distractions and no extra space. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.220
 That, combined with the Dynamic Fit Collar, really gives the foot a feeling of being more free. 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.530
 Simply because there is no plague and no further distractions on the upper part of the foot. 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.510
 And I think some might feel that this gives some limitations - 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.240
 - and that was also for me at the beginning, but as soon as I got used to there being material around this part of the foot - 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.510
 - I actually really liked it. 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.600
 Added to this close-fitting sensation are the Brio cables. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.420
 Because when you tighten laces, you can really feel how they pack in the foot, next as a harness - 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.310
 - and keep the foot in place on top of the sole. 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.730
 And that gives Superfly a sense of being really responsive. 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.680
 For the effect of locking the foot firmly is really that good. 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.130
 If I were to say something, I would probably have wanted a little more lockdown on the outside of the boot. 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.680
 Simply to keep my foot even more firm on the sole when I change direction with great force. 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.150
 For the foot has a slight tendency to slide when I change direction. 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.930
 But it's a minor detail and it works fine without it. 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.220
 Mercurial is not exactly known for its agonizing comfort. 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.370
 But to be honest, I actually think Superfly is comfortable. 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.170
 Not on an over-wet, classic comfort way - 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.950
 - but more like a "I-have-not-something-in" way. 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.260
 And when it comes to protection, there is not much protection, - 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.280
 - But it is probably the kind of compromise you have to live with, on a skinny soccer boot like this one. 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.240
 The new Superfly also gave a comeback to the Carbon fiber outsole. 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.910
 But this time it is two- instead of three-layer construction. 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.420
 And Nike has really worked hard to make the outsole more flexible - 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.280
 - based on feedback from professionals who wanted greater comfort in the new Mercurial than previous generations. 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.800
 And fortunately, this added flexibility also means that the new Superfly is much more comfortable - 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.170
 - But then again, it also means that the outsole is slightly less rigid and resilient than the previous model. 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.480
 It is probably a new direction for the Superfly and the carbon fiber outsole. 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.800
 But while you get a little less of the aggressive snapback when bending your foot - 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.080
 - Superfly is also a much more flexible experience. 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.480
 And it's an inevitable compromise with comfort and stiffness in a carbon fiber outsole. 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.370
 It's just as it is right now. 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.820
 Another change is found in the button configuration. 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.750
 Here Nike goes back to the four knobs in the heel and added another knob in the forefoot. 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.620
 And especially the front four knobs are great when it comes to acceleration. 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.970
 Simply because they let you add a lot of energy to the ground very quickly and efficiently - 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.260
 - They work well no matter which direction you would like to accelerate. 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.400
 They really let me put off a lot of power - 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.750
 - for it gives me a certainty that I will not slip, simply because the grip is so good. 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.730
 For me, the Mercurial Superfly has, without a doubt, the best knob configuration on the market when it comes to speed. 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.150
 There is no competition. 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.750
 When it comes to ball sensing, the thin flyknit upper part also plays an important role. 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.400
 For you get a really precise touch on the ball. 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.000
 Where you can feel pretty much everything you do. 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.770
 And it's really close to the feeling of playing barefoot. 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.750
 With just a small amount of support. 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.150
 I have to be honest and say I was expecting a really thin top on this Superfly, - 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.840
 - maybe even the thinnest ever made. 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:00.910
 And while it is really thin and really good, I actually think it can be compared to Hypervenom and Vapor 9. 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.880
 As always, the ACC works without any problems - no questions asked here. 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.060
 But NikeSkin at Flyknit is actually a bit sticky, especially when it's dry - 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.880
 - which gives a little more friction and therefore grips the ball. 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.510
 And it actually feels pretty good when you dribble for sticking a little more to the ball than for example Vapor 9. 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.020
 When it comes to shooting, there is no nonsense with Superfly. 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.350
 And what I mean by that is that there are no distractions at all between the foot and the ball. 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.930
 So shooting and handing over with Superfly is a fairly straightforward experience. 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:45.370
 And the tip is also quite low, so there is no problem getting under the ball, which I'm pretty happy about. 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.310
 I had really high expectations for Superfly - 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.220
 - and I really have to say it delivers to the fullest. 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:01.350
 Especially around the fit, which in my opinion is one of the best market at the moment. 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.660
 And it is true in the truth here that the true revolution can be found at Superfly. 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.620
 But nevertheless, although Superfly is a super boot, it may not be for everyone. 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.950
 Because it is a very special and unique feeling to take them on. 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.330
 But what do you really think about this Superfly? 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.710
 Is it something for you? Let me hear in the comments below. 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.060
 Because that was all I had for you today. 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.800
 But we will soon see you again in Unisport WebTV. 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.480
 Thanks for you. Cheerio! 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.330
 As a fan of speed boots, I am completely sold on Superfly. 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.440
 But there is a small but: 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.200
 Sweat. For when you play and you start to sweat - 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.860
 - Then the Dynamic Fit Collar will start to smell a little. 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.820
 And that will probably bother anyone of you. 

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.970
 And I was not able to remove the smell just with water. 

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.680
 So I took this Bio spray, which is designed to remove the smell - 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.170
 - and shake it well and spray on and then it will actually remove some of the smell.
