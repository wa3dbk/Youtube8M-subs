which ground is actually good so you

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.730

you<00:03:27.310> not<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.640> use<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.000> tool<00:03:28.210> I'm<00:03:28.540> simply

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
you not to use the tool I'm simply

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.110 
you not to use the tool I'm simply
telling<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.560> need<00:03:29.710> to<00:03:29.830> understand<00:03:30.310> what

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
telling you you need to understand what

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.140 
telling you you need to understand what
the<00:03:31.390> limitations<00:03:31.840> are<00:03:32.520> right<00:03:33.520> now<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.120> a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
the limitations are right now this is a

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.050 
the limitations are right now this is a
piece<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.450> anodized<00:03:35.140> aluminum<00:03:35.880> okay

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
piece of anodized aluminum okay

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.080 
piece of anodized aluminum okay
and<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:38.620> grounded

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
and it's grounded

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.839 
and it's grounded
all<00:03:40.660> right<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.959> aluminum's<00:03:41.349> grounded<00:03:42.040> but

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
all right the aluminum's grounded but

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.820 
all right the aluminum's grounded but
there's<00:03:43.330> corrosion<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.260> corrosion<00:03:44.560> is

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
there's corrosion and the corrosion is

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.369 
there's corrosion and the corrosion is
is<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.099> thousandth<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:45.970> an<00:03:46.090> inch<00:03:46.180> thick<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.780> if

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
is a thousandth of an inch thick and if

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.729 
is a thousandth of an inch thick and if
I<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.860> lay<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.910> here<00:03:49.560> nothing<00:03:50.560> happens

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
I just lay this on here nothing happens

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.500 
I just lay this on here nothing happens
well<00:03:51.129> that's<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.430> correct<00:03:51.790> way<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.030> use<00:03:52.180> the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
well that's the correct way to use the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.009 
well that's the correct way to use the
tool

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
tool

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.500 
tool
let<00:03:53.560> me<00:03:53.650> just<00:03:53.860> caution<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.879> sharp<00:03:55.180> point

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
let me just caution you the sharp point

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.940 
let me just caution you the sharp point
doesn't<00:03:55.930> mean<00:03:56.280> do<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:57.549> because<00:03:58.540> when<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:58.950> do

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
doesn't mean do that because when you do

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.369 
doesn't mean do that because when you do
that<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:03.730> get<00:04:03.849> a<00:04:03.910> ground<00:04:04.180> problem<00:04:04.989> is<00:04:05.110> you

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
that you get a ground problem is you

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.280 
that you get a ground problem is you
don't<00:04:05.590> have<00:04:05.769> a<00:04:05.799> ground<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:07.299> have<00:04:07.569> a<00:04:07.599> corroded

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
don't have a ground you have a corroded

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.059 
don't have a ground you have a corroded
connection<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.489> isn't<00:04:09.700> unless<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:11.069> drive

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
connection and it isn't unless you drive

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.990 
connection and it isn't unless you drive
this<00:04:12.549> sharp<00:04:12.849> point<00:04:13.319> past<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.560> corrosion<00:04:15.000> if

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
this sharp point past the corrosion if

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.759 
this sharp point past the corrosion if
you<00:04:16.150> drive<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.660> sharp<00:04:16.900> point<00:04:17.200> past<00:04:17.530> the

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
you drive the sharp point past the

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.280 
you drive the sharp point past the
corrosion<00:04:18.310> then<00:04:19.269> you're<00:04:19.630> not<00:04:19.750> seeing<00:04:20.139> the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
corrosion then you're not seeing the

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
corrosion then you're not seeing the
answer<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:21.459> if<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.510> have<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.720> clean<00:04:23.440> ground<00:04:23.860> and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
answer so if you have a clean ground and

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.670 
answer so if you have a clean ground and
you<00:04:24.729> have<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:24.910> clean<00:04:25.360> connection<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.560> have

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
you have a clean connection and you have

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.310 
you have a clean connection and you have
a<00:04:26.710> clean<00:04:27.130> pin<00:04:27.580> then<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.389> shouldn't<00:04:28.660> matter<00:04:28.930> you

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
a clean pin then it shouldn't matter you

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.440 
a clean pin then it shouldn't matter you
just<00:04:29.350> lay<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.220> probe<00:04:30.460> in<00:04:30.669> there<00:04:30.850> just<00:04:31.090> lay<00:04:31.389> it

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
just lay the probe in there just lay it

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.440 
just lay the probe in there just lay it
in<00:04:31.720> there<00:04:31.870> gently<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:33.010> if<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:33.910> get<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.120> reading

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
in there gently and if you get a reading

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.140 
in there gently and if you get a reading
then<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:35.289> get<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.530> reading<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.669> don't<00:04:36.850> want<00:04:37.060> to

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
then you get a reading you don't want to

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.029 
then you get a reading you don't want to
force<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.630> reading<00:04:37.990> though<00:04:38.169> that's<00:04:38.919> the

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
force the reading though that's the

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.159 
force the reading though that's the
problem<00:04:39.370> with<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:39.760> sharp<00:04:40.000> point<00:04:40.300> we<00:04:40.780> use<00:04:41.020> it

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
problem with the sharp point we use it

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.659 
problem with the sharp point we use it
just<00:04:41.320> poke<00:04:41.590> holes<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.070> wires<00:04:42.250> which<00:04:42.550> you

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
just poke holes and wires which you

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.640 
just poke holes and wires which you
should<00:04:42.850> never<00:04:43.090> do<00:04:43.330> because<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.289> go<00:04:44.440> right

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
should never do because you go right

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.010 
should never do because you go right
past<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:45.100> problem<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:46.300> need<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.690> make<00:04:46.840> sure

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
past the problem you need to make sure

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.170 
past the problem you need to make sure
that<00:04:47.169> you<00:04:47.320> don't<00:04:47.410> goof<00:04:47.710> that<00:04:47.919> up<00:04:48.130> by<00:04:48.789> going<00:04:49.060> out
