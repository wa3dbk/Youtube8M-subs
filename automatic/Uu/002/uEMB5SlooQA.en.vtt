00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.090
 hello this time, let's talk about the 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.340
 addition and subtraction of the nationalized number 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.160
 for that we must consider two 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.810
 considerations the first that the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.810
 fractions are homogeneous 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.310
 that is, they have the same denominator 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 to solve this is done in a way 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.550
 simple 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:38.750
 the numerators are added in this case 95 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.030
 and the same denominator is placed 4 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.050
 then this is the same 95 14 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.020
 this about 4 now we can simplify 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.940
 the fraction 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.110
 both have half half of 14-7 half 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.500
 of 42 we have the answer as 7 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.500
 media 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.710
 now if the fractions are homogeneous and 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.090
 is a subtraction is done in the same way 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.090
 we would stay the same 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.850
 the numerators are operated ie three 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.710
 minus one and they place the same 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.990
 the denominator being homogeneous 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.510
 fractions this is the same 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.840
 we solve 3 minus 12 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.539
 divided 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.829
 the same denominator 4 now we can 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:33.609
 simplify both have half half of 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.540
 21 and half of 42 the result is a 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.110
 medium 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:43.220
 now when they are more than two fractions and 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.730
 they are homogeneous it is exactly the same 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.090
 we add we operate the numerators we 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.090
 it would be 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.190
 7 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.580
 25 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:07.470
 8 on the same denominator as in this 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:10.500
 case is 3 then this is the same 7 295 14 + 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.300
 8 22 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.560
 about 3 this fraction is irreducible is 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.000
 say that it can no longer be simplified 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.000
 then it is the result 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.900
 Now let's look at this operation which is a 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.140
 combination the first term is 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.010
 positive but the others are negative 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.220
 we have the next thing that's the same 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:38.560
 we operate the numerators we would be 3 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:42.579
 positive minus 7 minus 5 on it 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:47.590
 denominator which is 8 this is equal 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.950
 3 - 7 is minus four minus five minus 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.950
 9 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.470
 about it 8 then we have one 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.660
 negative and irreducible expression 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.910
 then the answer is minus 9 eighths 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.100
 now let's look at the other condition and it's 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.530
 when the fractions are heterogeneous 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.080
 that is, the denominators 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.690
 numbers that are on the bottom 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.490
 are different to solve this there is a 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.260
 appropriate mechanism that is the following 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.190
 although we are talking about a sum 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.580
 we make multiplications in x having 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.380
 consider this as the first diagonal of 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.700
 the following form 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.700
 we would stay the same 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.670
 8 multiplied which is the first 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.960
 diagonal the sign of the operation that is 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.080
 plus 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:46.840
 then on the second diagonal that is this 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:49.330
 we would be 7 multiplied 2 remember 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.800
 that although it is a sum the diagonals are 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.370
 multiply 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.590
 all this about the product of the 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.590
 denominators ie 7 by 9 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:12.770
 then this is equal 8 times 9 is 72 + 7 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:15.440
 for 214 this / 7 for 9 63 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.370
 and then in solving this we have to 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.530
 it's 86 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.710
 on 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.419
 63 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.669
 note that this fraction is 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.569
 irreducible can not get half or 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.430
 third or fifth then this is the way 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.250
 one of the appropriate ways to 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.139
 perform the sum when the 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.139
 denominators are different 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.210
 now let's look at this case when they are 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.370
 more than two terms and the fractions are 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.009
 heterogeneous all the denominators are 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.430
 different what we should do in these 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.849
 cases is to work the first two 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.849
 fractions 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.640
 and add them up as we saw here at the beginning 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.840
 then the result is added with the 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.590
 third fraction 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.820
 to which we have the following start 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.690
 we multiplied diagonally as we saw the 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.940
 principle we would be 1 for 33 more 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:22.169
 the second diagonal would be 2 by 4 which is 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:24.490
 8 divided two by three that six more 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.729
 we put this fraction that we have not 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.590
 touched five ninths remember that this 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.010
 is the result of the first two 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:37.600
 fractions this will remain the same 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:42.610
 we solve here three more 811 out of 6 11 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:45.400
 sixth plus the third fraction that is 5 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.389
 ninth now we have 2 left and we go back to 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.600
 do it in X or diagonally that is given 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.600
 same 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:06:01.430
 then when multiplying in x we have 11 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:07.750
 9 which is 99 plus 6 by 5 30 the second 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.750
 diagonal all this about 6 times 9 54 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.990
 we solve the operation above and we 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:18.940
 remains 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:20.569
 this is 129/54 now to simplify 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.149
 expression 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:25.309
 both quantities have third so much 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:29.190
 numerator as denominator then the 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:34.360
 third of 129 is 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:38.590
 43 then we put 43 on the third 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.950
 of 54 is 18 and that is the result of 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:45.120
 operate heterogeneous fractions with more 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.120
 of a term
