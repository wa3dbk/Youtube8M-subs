 semipermanent then that some guys me 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.029
 asked to record a video 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.410
 where to apply the semi-permanent polish 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.960
 to my mom and she had to be here too 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.369
 however, he is a bit ashamed then 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.610
 it is not present and rightly I had to 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.090
 take something back from her anyway mic 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.760
 shyness and one of these is nothing I have 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.430
 used by permanent glaze of the tops 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.059
 that you know they are becoming mine 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.040
 favorite 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.200
 I enjoy it very much both for the duration 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.120
 that anyway for the application e 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.930
 even so, however, the brand itself mi 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.540
 I like it very much anyway site 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.840
 apart from that anyway I could 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.830
 work with them very serious company 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.110
 and professional and therefore if you have to 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.800
 let's say if you don't have a brand yet 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.360
 always the favorite moments 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.580
 I recommend you try their products 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.160
 because they are very good they are me 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:23.140
 like them and then nothing else besides 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.640
 jamal superman the dlc to do a little 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.450
 glitter decoration as you like 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.250
 even my mom used mornings 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.680
 of the jazz at home of essence that they are 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.960
 already with semi-permanent glazes they have 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.020
 created them however I don't use the line 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.790
 complete first in you I tried long ago 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.430
 a 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.670
 morning always of these four with 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 glitter wings, however, they found me 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.619
 in the application it lasted for three 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.450
 weeks so he had no problems 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.950
 with which you dispose of it and then 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.080
 this time used another color 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.670
 combined however with the enamel that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.409
 you will find in the video 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.280
 I hope you can enjoy it then 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.750
 know how for you result do me 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.620
 know even if you have these lawn 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.140
 enamels of essence because it will be anyway 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.819
 a novelty a little discussed by me if you have 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.769
 some hair will let us know 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.140
 in the comments I will be happy to 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.630
 welcome her and maybe I 'll be able to do with 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.819
 video where your request 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.750
 see you at the next video and send a 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.790
 big kiss after making a manager 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.280
 therefore having fixed the length of the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.209
 movie of nails and send them back 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.129
 cuticles go pacify long for 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.129
 preparing it for the enamel saver is not 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.689
 sweep away excess dust with 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.370
 a brush and now I'm going to 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:58.840
 apply the primer prim 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.840
 and leaves the sugar in the air 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.660
 this scores a base lc and therefore 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.300
 a thin pass all the nails and 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.450
 then to catalyze in a lamp for 120 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.450
 seconds 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.060
 now it's the turn of color so I go 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.180
 to spend this polish this value 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.370
 stick up for 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.370
 number to 16 which is a bit 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.670
 now very well 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.300
 elegant only flaw we say of the 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.300
 experiments 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.860
 a bit of difficulty 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.560
 this wanted that was spinning 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.130
 all very much in many years 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.530
 we only will so see everything in 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.960
 fair 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.030
 is to take 30 light wineries of 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.280
 she 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.280
 the second passed with questions we thought 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.039
 now how to see the color I did 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:39.860
 two passes the result much more 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.860
 opaque can use the days 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.949
 Special 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.220
 rays that with this movement so 

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:53.100
 such that they do not trust 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.100
 the legal group inside trento 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.490
 we are 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.889
 and I go to positioning on the long in 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.889
 these movements a bit we say films 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.680
 transparent but I don't want myself then 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.070
 in this way I ask for salads a 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.460
 arrange a few more levels 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.460
 the packages 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.710
 and right 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.710
 my name is the coast from the physical to 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.990
 store canalizing lamp for 120 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.030
 the PA has doubts now it's the top time 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.040
 cotton therefore the obligation on all 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.610
 nails always with themselves for 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.669
 distant cuticles and 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.110
 the tip is sealed 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.070
 which we then always catalyze in 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.070
 lamp from 2000 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.140
 the final essay or joke 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.900
 when they were much 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.740
 and we apply 1 net per category 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.750
 mum 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.319
 I hope the fair liked it 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.690
 in this I'm going to ds and excuse the voice 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.490
 but I don't know why now it is me 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.220
 lowered in this way 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.890
 nothing this final result let me 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.550
 know what you think he quoted this video 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.550
 bye Bye
