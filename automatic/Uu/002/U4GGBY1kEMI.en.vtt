00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
basically if you add a fish that is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.749 
basically if you add a fish that is
bigger<00:02:00.000> than<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:01.469> gourami<00:02:02.070> aggression

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
bigger than your gourami aggression

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.569 
bigger than your gourami aggression
aggression<00:02:03.590> it's<00:02:04.590> basically<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> make

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
aggression it's basically going to make

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.730 
aggression it's basically going to make
the<00:02:05.880> aggression<00:02:06.360> go<00:02:06.479> way<00:02:06.719> down<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.290> pretty

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the aggression go way down and pretty

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.300 
the aggression go way down and pretty
