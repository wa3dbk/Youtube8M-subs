00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
alright this is a review of transformers

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.470 
alright this is a review of transformers
prime<00:00:09.269> beast<00:00:09.330> hunters<00:00:10.019> cyberverse<00:00:10.260> commander

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
prime beast hunters cyberverse commander

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.829 
prime beast hunters cyberverse commander
Predaking<00:00:12.679> so<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.280> actually<00:00:15.210> my<00:00:15.570> first

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
Predaking so this is actually my first

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.080 
Predaking so this is actually my first
cyberverse<00:00:16.680> commander<00:00:16.830> figure<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.640> it's

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
cyberverse commander figure and it's

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.870 
cyberverse commander figure and it's
actually<00:00:18.930> pretty<00:00:19.529> decent<00:00:20.630> this<00:00:21.630> guy<00:00:21.859> is

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
actually pretty decent this guy is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.040 
actually pretty decent this guy is
pretty<00:00:23.880> much<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> opposite<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> Voyager

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
pretty much the opposite of the Voyager

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.410 
pretty much the opposite of the Voyager
to<00:00:25.199> me<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.920> robot<00:00:26.519> mode<00:00:26.849> better<00:00:27.150> than

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
to me I like the robot mode better than

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.400 
to me I like the robot mode better than
the<00:00:28.199> dragon<00:00:28.560> mode<00:00:28.680> drag<00:00:29.369> mode<00:00:29.550> suffers<00:00:29.970> from

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
the dragon mode drag mode suffers from

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.860 
the dragon mode drag mode suffers from
two<00:00:31.410> pretty<00:00:32.009> major<00:00:32.250> flaws<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:33.000> far<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:33.780> I'm

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
two pretty major flaws as far as I'm

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.840 
two pretty major flaws as far as I'm
concerned<00:00:33.899> first<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.559> which<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.850> absolutely

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
concerned first of which is absolutely

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.319 
concerned first of which is absolutely
no<00:00:36.290> articulation<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> head<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.329> that's

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
no articulation in the head and that's

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.410 
no articulation in the head and that's
due<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.840> how<00:00:40.079> transforms<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.059> I<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.300> would

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
due to how transforms that I just would

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.770 
due to how transforms that I just would
have<00:00:42.480> liked<00:00:42.719> something<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
have liked something going on here and

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.529 
have liked something going on here and
the<00:00:45.780> other<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.079> being<00:00:46.640> no<00:00:47.640> articulation<00:00:48.210> in

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the other one being no articulation in

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.660 
the other one being no articulation in
like<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.440> back<00:00:49.590> leg<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.039> what's<00:00:50.219> over<00:00:50.460> it's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
like the back leg here what's over it's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.819 
like the back leg here what's over it's
locked<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.210> place<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.840> height<00:00:52.050> which

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
locked in place at this height which

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
locked in place at this height which
really<00:00:53.219> actually<00:00:53.550> hampers<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.149> front<00:00:54.690> like

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
really actually hampers the front like

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720 
really actually hampers the front like
because<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.530> front<00:00:55.739> leg<00:00:55.829> has<00:00:56.100> some<00:00:56.550> decent

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
because the front leg has some decent

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.200 
because the front leg has some decent
amount<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.320> articulation<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.579> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.820> try

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
amount of articulation and if you try

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.920 
amount of articulation and if you try
and<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:03.480> run<00:01:03.780> into

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and use that at all you run into

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
and use that at all you run into
problems<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.309> these<00:01:05.640> back<00:01:06.030> legs<00:01:06.299> not

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
problems with it not these back legs not

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.920 
problems with it not these back legs not
touching<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.409> ground<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> take<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
touching the ground so we can take the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.469 
touching the ground so we can take the
front<00:01:10.080> leg<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:12.030> some

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
front leg here and actually get some

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.850 
front leg here and actually get some
very<00:01:13.020> decent<00:01:13.619> looking<00:01:14.570> kind<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> poses<00:01:16.409> i<00:01:16.680> mean

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
very decent looking kind of poses i mean

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890 
very decent looking kind of poses i mean
the<00:01:16.979> least<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> size<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> do

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the least for the size but when you do

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.929 
the least for the size but when you do
that<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.830> back<00:01:20.040> leg<00:01:20.250> doesn't<00:01:20.490> touch<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that the back leg doesn't touch the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.280 
that the back leg doesn't touch the
ground<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.570> can't<00:01:21.780> extend<00:01:22.020> them<00:01:22.170> out

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
ground because you can't extend them out

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.940 
ground because you can't extend them out
and<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.040> handle<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> gun<00:01:24.470> just<00:01:25.470> prevents

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and the handle of the gun just prevents

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.890 
and the handle of the gun just prevents
it<00:01:26.070> from<00:01:26.400> touching<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.090> ground<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.659> kind

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it from touching the ground so it's kind

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.580 
it from touching the ground so it's kind
of<00:01:27.930> propped<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> was

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
of propped up like that so I was

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.100 
of propped up like that so I was
thinking<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.340> possibly<00:01:32.670> shaving<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
thinking about possibly shaving the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.149 
thinking about possibly shaving the
handle<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> gun<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:36.560> we'll<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.770> if

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
handle of the gun here down we'll see if

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.460 
handle of the gun here down we'll see if
I<00:01:38.280> actually<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.729> ahead<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.470> only

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I actually go ahead with that but only

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
I actually go ahead with that but only
that<00:01:40.650> those<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.220> kind<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.579> my<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:41.880> gripes

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that those are kind of my two gripes

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
that those are kind of my two gripes
about<00:01:44.060> dragon<00:01:45.060> mode<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:46.020> wings<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:47.369> move

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
about dragon mode the wings don't move

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.120 
about dragon mode the wings don't move
very<00:01:47.880> much<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:49.020> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> some

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
very much but they do have kind of some

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.420 
very much but they do have kind of some
in<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.939> get<00:01:51.180> them<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:52.430> some

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
in and out you can get them in some

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.929 
in and out you can get them in some
different<00:01:53.850> shapes<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:55.049> terribly<00:01:55.409> bad<00:01:55.939> I'm

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
different shapes so not terribly bad I'm

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.399 
different shapes so not terribly bad I'm
going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> go<00:01:57.270> through<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> transformation

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
going to go through the transformation

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.639 
going to go through the transformation
real<00:01:58.590> quick<00:01:59.299> because<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:00.960> pretty<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.469> it

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
real quick because that's pretty much it

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.880 
real quick because that's pretty much it
for<00:02:01.710> articulation<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:03.350> dragon<00:02:04.350> boat<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.680> I'm

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
for articulation in dragon boat so I'm

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.520 
for articulation in dragon boat so I'm
going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.070> start<00:02:05.250> by<00:02:05.450> popping<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.840> tail<00:02:07.259> off

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
going to start by popping the tail off

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.619 
going to start by popping the tail off
which<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.829> once<00:02:08.670> again<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.060> gun<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.539> like

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
which is once again the gun just like

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.960 
which is once again the gun just like
the<00:02:09.840> Voyager<00:02:10.289> 1<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.670> see

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
the Voyager 1 and you can see

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.010 
the Voyager 1 and you can see
it<00:02:13.210> is<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:14.290> very<00:02:14.890> simple<00:02:15.220> gun<00:02:15.400> there's<00:02:15.640> no

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
it is a very simple gun there's no

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.630 
it is a very simple gun there's no
firing<00:02:17.020> mechanism<00:02:17.740> i<00:02:17.830> think<00:02:18.040> they're<00:02:18.280> there

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
firing mechanism i think they're there

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.760 
firing mechanism i think they're there
might<00:02:18.910> have<00:02:18.940> been<00:02:19.120> at<00:02:19.870> some<00:02:20.080> point<00:02:20.320> but<00:02:20.530> there

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
might have been at some point but there

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.550 
might have been at some point but there
definitely<00:02:20.950> isn't<00:02:21.220> now<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.330> fire<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.350> gun

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
definitely isn't now so to fire the gun

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.050 
definitely isn't now so to fire the gun
you<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.430> kind<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.230> unpack<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.500> then

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
you have to kind of unpack it and then

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.330 
you have to kind of unpack it and then
shoot<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.150> like<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.480> which<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:30.310> very

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
shoot it like that which is not very

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.670 
shoot it like that which is not very
impressive<00:02:30.880> but<00:02:31.090> whatever<00:02:34.290> next<00:02:35.290> part<00:02:35.530> is

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
impressive but whatever next part is

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.530 
impressive but whatever next part is
just<00:02:36.310> getting<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.030> wings<00:02:37.210> of<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.390> way

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
just getting it the wings of the way

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.070 
just getting it the wings of the way
here<00:02:37.720> for<00:02:37.870> sec<00:02:38.050> we're<00:02:38.230> going<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.410> pop<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:40.080> legs

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
here for sec we're going to pop the legs

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.280 
here for sec we're going to pop the legs
off<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:43.450> i<00:02:43.480> send<00:02:43.600> them<00:02:43.930> out<00:02:44.050> and

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
off like that can i send them out and

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.840 
off like that can i send them out and
I'm<00:02:44.740> tag<00:02:45.070> them<00:02:45.310> than<00:02:46.000> these<00:02:46.590> flip<00:02:47.590> then<00:02:47.850> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
I'm tag them than these flip then the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:56.760 
I'm tag them than these flip then the
feed<00:02:50.280> untag<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:53.520> you're<00:02:55.110> fair<00:02:56.110> way

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
feed untag like that and you're fair way

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.240 
feed untag like that and you're fair way
of<00:02:56.800> long<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.520> transformation<00:02:58.470> arms<00:02:59.470> pull

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
of long in the transformation arms pull

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.290 
of long in the transformation arms pull
down<00:03:00.430> like<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:01.290> pull<00:03:02.290> down<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.800> and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
down like that pull down like that and

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.990 
down like that pull down like that and
little<00:03:04.300> hand<00:03:04.930> things<00:03:05.230> here<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:06.250> fold<00:03:06.580> up<00:03:06.760> and

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
little hand things here you fold up and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.920 
little hand things here you fold up and
then<00:03:07.950> rotate<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.220> forearms<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.600> can<00:03:10.750> see

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
then rotate the forearms you can see

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.960 
then rotate the forearms you can see
you've<00:03:11.200> got<00:03:11.320> some<00:03:11.530> rotation<00:03:11.950> there<00:03:12.130> got<00:03:12.790> some

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
you've got some rotation there got some

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.260 
you've got some rotation there got some
swivel<00:03:13.530> loss<00:03:14.530> will<00:03:14.770> in<00:03:14.950> their<00:03:15.160> raw<00:03:15.730> altering

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
swivel loss will in their raw altering

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.290 
swivel loss will in their raw altering
and<00:03:16.450> then<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:17.680> can<00:03:17.830> do<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.190> couple<00:03:18.970> will<00:03:19.120> need

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
and then you can do a couple will need

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.410 
and then you can do a couple will need
things<00:03:19.600> like<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:23.220> now<00:03:24.220> we<00:03:24.280> get<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.670> the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
things like that but now we get to the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.240 
things like that but now we get to the
wings<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.590> head<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:29.380> instructions

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
wings and the head and the instructions

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.180 
wings and the head and the instructions
leave<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.030> head<00:03:31.660> in<00:03:31.810> one<00:03:32.019> way<00:03:32.739> widget<00:03:33.160> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
leave the head in one way widget the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.880 
leave the head in one way widget the
wings<00:03:33.550> kind<00:03:33.820> of<00:03:33.940> or<00:03:34.780> not<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.140> links<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.530> head

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
wings kind of or not the links the head

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.759 
wings kind of or not the links the head
kind<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.340> sits<00:03:36.640> down<00:03:37.030> here<00:03:37.450> so<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.170> don't<00:03:38.350> like

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
kind of sits down here so I don't like

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.070 
kind of sits down here so I don't like
the<00:03:38.920> way<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.130> looks<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:40.030> box<00:03:40.239> art<00:03:40.480> has<00:03:40.660> the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
the way that looks the box art has the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.270 
the way that looks the box art has the
head<00:03:41.260> up<00:03:41.500> here<00:03:41.890> in<00:03:42.130> these<00:03:42.730> wings<00:03:43.030> down<00:03:43.900> here<00:03:44.350> so

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
head up here in these wings down here so

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.430 
head up here in these wings down here so
I'm<00:03:45.489> just<00:03:45.640> going<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.820> show<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.510> how<00:03:46.870> that

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
I'm just going to show you how that

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.360 
I'm just going to show you how that
looks<00:03:48.390> which<00:03:49.390> is<00:03:49.709> take<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.630> take<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.959> and

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
looks which is take this take that and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.250 
looks which is take this take that and
you<00:03:54.370> split<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:56.799> head<00:03:57.040> each<00:03:57.720> having<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.840> little

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
you split the head each having a little

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.370 
you split the head each having a little
bit<00:03:59.380> difficult<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.890> do<00:04:00.120> there<00:04:01.120> we<00:04:01.299> go<00:04:01.390> split

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
bit difficult to do there we go split

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.509 
bit difficult to do there we go split
the<00:04:02.500> head<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:03.489> can<00:04:03.640> see<00:04:05.070> these<00:04:06.070> guys<00:04:06.340> are

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
the head you can see these guys are

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.800 
the head you can see these guys are
actually<00:04:06.670> on<00:04:07.560> ball<00:04:08.560> joints<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.720> idea

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
actually on ball joints so the idea

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.740 
actually on ball joints so the idea
being<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.290> you<00:04:11.680> actually<00:04:11.890> leave<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.750> heads

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
being that you actually leave the heads

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.380 
being that you actually leave the heads
up<00:04:14.140> here<00:04:14.890> split<00:04:15.519> like<00:04:15.670> that<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:19.180> wing

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
up here split like that and the wing

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.420 
up here split like that and the wing
down<00:04:20.140> there<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.990> I'm<00:04:22.990> not<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.530> fan<00:04:24.099> of<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.340> way

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
down there and I'm not a fan of the way

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.090 
down there and I'm not a fan of the way
that<00:04:24.640> looks<00:04:24.820> either<00:04:25.349> what<00:04:26.349> I<00:04:26.380> like<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.740> do

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
that looks either what I like to do

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.170 
that looks either what I like to do
is<00:04:27.390> actually<00:04:29.070> finish<00:04:30.070> this<00:04:30.280> by<00:04:30.490> pulling<00:04:31.060> this

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
is actually finish this by pulling this

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.980 
is actually finish this by pulling this
down<00:04:31.240> here<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:34.390> then<00:04:34.510> taking<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.020> links<00:04:35.430> and

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
down here and then taking the links and

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.680 
down here and then taking the links and
folding<00:04:37.990> them<00:04:38.140> up<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.760> i'm<00:04:42.880> taking<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.450> heads

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
folding them up and i'm taking the heads

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.240 
folding them up and i'm taking the heads
and<00:04:45.120> tucking<00:04:46.120> them<00:04:46.390> in<00:04:46.590> behind<00:04:47.590> like<00:04:47.770> that<00:04:47.980> and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
and tucking them in behind like that and

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.540 
and tucking them in behind like that and
to<00:04:48.940> me<00:04:49.060> that's<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.660> best<00:04:50.170> way<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:51.520> best

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
to me that's the best way the best

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.700 
to me that's the best way the best
looking<00:04:51.850> way<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.870> do<00:04:53.020> kind<00:04:53.380> of<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.530> wing

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
looking way to do kind of the wing

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.390 
looking way to do kind of the wing
configuration<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:55.540> shoulder<00:04:56.050> pads<00:04:56.290> raise<00:04:57.220> up

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
configuration the shoulder pads raise up

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.580 
configuration the shoulder pads raise up
like<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:58.350> then<00:04:59.430> you've<00:05:00.430> got<00:05:01.590> an

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
like that and then you've got an

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.980 
like that and then you've got an
imposing<00:05:02.950> little<00:05:03.340> guy<00:05:03.460> like<00:05:03.640> that<00:05:03.870> it's<00:05:04.870> not

that<00:05:05.050> not<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.770> best<00:05:05.890> figure<00:05:06.220> in<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.430> world

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
that not the best figure in the world

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.450 
that not the best figure in the world
but<00:05:06.790> it's<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.810> fun<00:05:08.170> little<00:05:08.380> transformation<00:05:09.190> and

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
but it's a fun little transformation and

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.550 
but it's a fun little transformation and
ends<00:05:10.330> up<00:05:10.420> looking<00:05:10.810> pretty<00:05:11.940> pretty<00:05:12.940> nice<00:05:13.560> you

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
can see that's in there not too much of

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.040

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
guy now the other thing i don't like

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.160 
guy now the other thing i don't like
about<00:05:26.020> this<00:05:26.350> gun<00:05:26.560> is<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:28.120> fact<00:05:28.330> that<00:05:28.420> when<00:05:28.840> you

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
about this gun is the fact that when you

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.620 
about this gun is the fact that when you
put<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.500> in<00:05:29.620> its<00:05:29.740> hand<00:05:29.980> if<00:05:30.670> you<00:05:30.850> want<00:05:31.060> him<00:05:31.390> to

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
put it in its hand if you want him to

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.820 
put it in its hand if you want him to
actually<00:05:31.870> point<00:05:32.200> it<00:05:32.350> forward<00:05:33.090> it<00:05:34.090> can't<00:05:34.600> be

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
actually point it forward it can't be

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.410 
actually point it forward it can't be
held<00:05:35.830> straight<00:05:36.340> because<00:05:36.640> of<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:39.120> tail<00:05:40.120> of<00:05:40.150> the

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
held straight because of the tail of the

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.090 
held straight because of the tail of the
missile<00:05:40.720> there<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:41.020> i<00:05:41.050> was<00:05:41.230> thinking<00:05:41.890> about

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
missile there so i was thinking about

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.460 
missile there so i was thinking about
possibly<00:05:42.370> cutting<00:05:42.910> that<00:05:43.120> off<00:05:43.180> as<00:05:44.050> well<00:05:44.140> just

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
possibly cutting that off as well just

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.280 
possibly cutting that off as well just
trimming<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:44.830> down<00:05:44.860> so<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:45.280> he<00:05:45.520> can<00:05:45.640> at<00:05:45.820> least

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
trimming it down so that he can at least

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.890 
trimming it down so that he can at least
hold<00:05:47.290> it<00:05:47.470> forward<00:05:48.220> but<00:05:48.520> again<00:05:49.300> that's<00:05:49.570> just<00:05:49.720> me

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
hold it forward but again that's just me

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.750 
hold it forward but again that's just me
I'm<00:05:50.560> just<00:05:50.710> not<00:05:50.890> a<00:05:50.950> fan<00:05:51.010> of<00:05:51.160> the<00:05:51.310> way<00:05:51.400> that<00:05:51.580> is

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
I'm just not a fan of the way that is

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.100 
I'm just not a fan of the way that is
but<00:05:52.540> that<00:05:53.440> is<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:54.510> transformed<00:05:55.510> product<00:05:56.020> in

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
but that is the transformed product in

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.320 
but that is the transformed product in
there<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:57.330> get<00:05:58.330> some<00:05:58.540> size<00:05:58.720> comparisons<00:05:59.380> to

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
there and get some size comparisons to

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.120 
there and get some size comparisons to
oops<00:06:01.740> cyberverse<00:06:02.740> commander<00:06:03.240> bulkhead<00:06:04.240> here

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
oops cyberverse commander bulkhead here

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:15.530 
oops cyberverse commander bulkhead here
and<00:06:08.460> cyberverse<00:06:09.460> commander<00:06:10.620> prime<00:06:13.560> way<00:06:14.560> and

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
and cyberverse commander prime way and

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.170 
and cyberverse commander prime way and
put<00:06:16.540> Prime<00:06:16.840> in<00:06:16.990> there<00:06:17.140> as<00:06:17.500> well<00:06:17.860> so<00:06:18.070> you<00:06:19.000> got

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
put Prime in there as well so you got

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.770 
put Prime in there as well so you got
those<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.660> then<00:06:19.900> just<00:06:20.200> for<00:06:20.440> kicks<00:06:21.540> there<00:06:22.540> they

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
those and then just for kicks there they

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.170 
those and then just for kicks there they
are<00:06:22.810> against<00:06:23.910> motor<00:06:24.910> breath

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.920 

so<00:06:27.810> you<00:06:28.320> can<00:06:28.500> see<00:06:29.180> they're<00:06:30.180> all<00:06:30.300> kind<00:06:30.539> of<00:06:30.660> in

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
so you can see they're all kind of in

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:37.520 
so you can see they're all kind of in
scale<00:06:31.410> with<00:06:31.440> each<00:06:31.680> other<00:06:36.259> bulkhead<00:06:37.259> being

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
scale with each other bulkhead being

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.249 
scale with each other bulkhead being
short<00:06:38.009> just<00:06:38.910> like<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.300> deluxe<00:06:39.780> versus<00:06:40.139> the
