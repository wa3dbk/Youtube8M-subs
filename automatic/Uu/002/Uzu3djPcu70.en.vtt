new griffin reveal for the iphone 5 but

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.000 
new griffin reveal for the iphone 5 but
the<00:00:35.940> old<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.630> area<00:00:36.989> all<00:00:37.170> around<00:00:37.200> here

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the old one this area all around here

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.760 
the old one this area all around here
was<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.090> rigid<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> belkin

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
was not as rigid as it is on the belkin

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100 
was not as rigid as it is on the belkin
so<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:42.059> actually<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> nice<00:00:42.809> here

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so it's actually kind of nice here

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
so it's actually kind of nice here
because<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> holds<00:00:43.770> its<00:00:43.980> shape<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.850> bit

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
because it holds its shape a little bit

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.670 
because it holds its shape a little bit
better<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> phone<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.500> let's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
better when it's on the phone so let's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.900 
better when it's on the phone so let's
go<00:00:46.770> ahead<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> phone<00:00:47.399> into<00:00:47.670> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
go ahead and put the phone into this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.779 
go ahead and put the phone into this
case<00:00:48.180> i<00:00:48.890> always<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> put<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> buttons<00:00:50.610> in

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
case i always like to put the buttons in

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.090 
case i always like to put the buttons in
first<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.960> don't<00:00:52.110> run<00:00:52.260> any<00:00:52.559> risk<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
first so you don't run any risk of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
first so you don't run any risk of
damage<00:00:53.610> there<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.420> basically<00:00:54.570> you're

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
damage there and then basically you're

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660 
damage there and then basically you're
going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> snap<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.039> other<00:00:56.160> ends<00:00:56.489> into

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
going to snap all the other ends into

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.250 
going to snap all the other ends into
place<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
place and that's really all there is to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.529 
place and that's really all there is to
it<00:00:58.289> i<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.890> mention<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.640> case<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.300> too

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it i will mention this case is not too

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.119 
it i will mention this case is not too
difficult<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:01.109> take<00:01:01.320> off<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.920> kind<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
difficult to take off you just kind of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.520 
difficult to take off you just kind of
work<00:01:02.340> your<00:01:02.520> top<00:01:02.760> end<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.690> pops<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
work your top end here it pops out and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
work your top end here it pops out and
you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.799> pull<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> from<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.210> get

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you can pull it from there so you do get

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.280 
you can pull it from there so you do get
a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.570> bit<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.869> lay<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> table

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
a little bit of a lay on the table

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.350 
a little bit of a lay on the table
design<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.640> extreme<00:01:09.180> but

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
design with this it's not extreme but

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.850 
design with this it's not extreme but
it's<00:01:09.510> enough<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> put<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> face<00:01:10.830> down

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it's enough that if you put it face down

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010 
it's enough that if you put it face down
your<00:01:11.790> screen<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> touch<00:01:12.780> the

as I've tested and reviewed other cases
with<00:02:28.050> clear<00:02:28.380> backs<00:02:28.620> like<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.190> unless

with clear backs like this unless

with clear backs like this unless
there's<00:02:30.510> something<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.410> belkin<00:02:31.920> grip

candy sheer that if you haven't checked
my<00:02:34.500> video<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:34.980> go<00:02:35.490> ahead<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.760> check<00:02:36.000> it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
my video on that go ahead and check it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.140 
my video on that go ahead and check it
out<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.720> unless<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.140> something<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:37.530> that

out but unless it's something like that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.810 
out but unless it's something like that
these<00:02:39.150> cases<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> clear<00:02:40.410> plastic<00:02:40.820> back

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
these cases with the clear plastic back

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.330 
these cases with the clear plastic back
like<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.330> usually<00:02:42.989> will<00:02:43.470> show<00:02:43.800> these<00:02:44.069> kind

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
like this usually will show these kind

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.930 
like this usually will show these kind
of<00:02:44.400> scuffs<00:02:44.819> over<00:02:45.209> time<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:45.720> well<00:02:46.500> as

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
of scuffs over time as well as

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.790 
of scuffs over time as well as
fingerprinting<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.120> whatnot<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:49.140> tend<00:02:49.680> to

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
fingerprinting and whatnot so I tend to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800 
fingerprinting and whatnot so I tend to
stay<00:02:49.980> away<00:02:50.010> from<00:02:50.280> these<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.780> that

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
stay away from these just for that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.690 
stay away from these just for that
reason<00:02:51.959> you've<00:02:52.830> got<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.070> camera<00:02:53.280> cut<00:02:53.580> out

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
reason you've got your camera cut out

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.120 
reason you've got your camera cut out
here<00:02:54.030> it's<00:02:54.630> lined<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.500> black<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:55.920> you're<00:02:56.070> not

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
here it's lined in black so you're not

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.009 
here it's lined in black so you're not

there are better options especially we

there are better options especially we

can compare it to something like the

can compare it to something like the
belkin<00:03:33.239> grip<00:03:33.420> candy<00:03:34.200> sheer<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> belkin
