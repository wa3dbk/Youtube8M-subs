thing we've done is we disabled the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.830 
thing we've done is we disabled the
vehicle<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.160> doesn't<00:01:33.520> start<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:34.570> can<00:01:34.720> do

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
vehicle so it doesn't start you can do

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.490 
vehicle so it doesn't start you can do
that<00:01:35.020> by<00:01:35.200> ignition<00:01:36.130> coils<00:01:36.460> or<00:01:36.610> fuel<00:01:37.200> next<00:01:38.200> we

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
problem in this cylinder we can see that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.810 
problem in this cylinder we can see that
