00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.640 
the next thing we'll do is put it into
the<00:00:27.019> edge<00:00:28.390> and<00:00:29.390> work<00:00:29.630> it<00:00:29.779> out<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.169> it<00:00:30.289> shows<00:00:30.500> the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
the edge and work it out so it shows the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:40.149 
the edge and work it out so it shows the
hardening<00:00:30.980> line<00:00:36.730> so<00:00:37.730> there<00:00:37.879> you<00:00:38.000> go<00:00:39.040> I'll<00:00:40.040> be

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
hardening line so there you go I'll be

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:47.210 
hardening line so there you go I'll be
back<00:00:40.339> shortly
