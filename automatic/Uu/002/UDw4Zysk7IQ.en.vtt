00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.230
 I'm going to prepare a delicious shrimp broth 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.060
 here we are going to use 3 kilos of 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.980
 Shrimp look two shades of shrimp 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.369
 because one is from the sea and the other is from the river 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.090
 let's use a quarter of chile 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.550
 guajillo a medium purple onions the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.770
 garlic clove and epazote to taste 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.830
 let's also use salt and that 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.070
 is also to our liking here I already 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.559
 I put my water to live and I added the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.000
 half of the purple onion for it to go 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.030
 grabbing the flavor 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.129
 then we are going to add the chiles 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.909
 that here they are knowing this is 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.909
 must cook 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.690

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.600
 the cloves of garlic this is so that to give 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.210
 good taste everything and once you 're 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.330
 cooked completely we are going to liquefy 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.310
 we will strain and once it is 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.790
 boiling let's loosen the shrimp 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.790
 and the step 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.040
 I already have chili cooked 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.470
 I have put in my container a liter of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.500
 water to boil now we are going to add 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 the glass and the passage of the amount that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.650
 you want me to put a little bit 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 frame that I really like the taste 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.610
 on the way 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.610
 now let's liquefy the chile 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.360
 we are going to incorporate the glass of the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.360
 blender 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.360
 let's do a little singing 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.360
 gas 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.750
 of the chile to appear can liquefy 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.750
 is infecting 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.330
 now let's strain is a strainer and it 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.129
 they realize here we already have a tone 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.519

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.519

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.770
 we are going to give him a pat to be 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.630
 let go 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.630
 the liquefied in the clean and a strainer 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.239
 we will be doing it like that 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.990
 constantly so that we can quickly 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.660
 strain it 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.260
 and our broth goes knowing little to 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.860
 little bit 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.980

 more or less an amount 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.040
 so that it is not too salty and 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.040

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.239

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.650
 boil for 20 minutes let's cover 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.750
