this case we're going to show you how to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.250 
this case we're going to show you how to
bring<00:00:54.089> in<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.440> cut<00:00:56.069> line<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.300> small

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
bring in the cut line just a small

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.500 
bring in the cut line just a small
amount<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:59.339> prevent<00:00:59.729> it<00:00:59.850> so<00:00:59.999> that<00:01:00.149> way<00:01:00.300> there's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
amount to prevent it so that way there's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.000 
amount to prevent it so that way there's
a<00:01:00.600> solid<00:01:01.079> black<00:01:01.289> line<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.589> around

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
a solid black line going around

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
a solid black line going around
everything<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.239> definitely<00:01:03.539> something

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
everything this is definitely something

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.700 
everything this is definitely something
that<00:01:04.050> becomes<00:01:04.620> more<00:01:06.020> advantageous<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.500> use

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that becomes more advantageous to use

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.639 
that becomes more advantageous to use
when<00:01:07.950> doing<00:01:08.310> dark<00:01:08.790> transfer<00:01:09.299> paper<00:01:09.649> so

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
when doing dark transfer paper so

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.109 
when doing dark transfer paper so

we'll<00:02:41.940> use<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.510> image<00:02:43.280> density<00:02:44.630> adjustment

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
we'll use the image density adjustment

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.250 
we'll use the image density adjustment
slider<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.710> just<00:02:46.920> move<00:02:47.130> left<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.670> right

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
slider to just move left and right

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.510 
slider to just move left and right
farther<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.410> move<00:02:49.560> left<00:02:49.800> unless<00:02:50.220> some<00:02:50.430> of

this the lesson of the design you'll see
you<00:02:52.920> don't<00:02:52.980> want<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.370> cut<00:02:53.520> more<00:02:53.730> move<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:54.870> the

way to the right and you'll start to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.590 
way to the right and you'll start to
look<00:02:56.310> at<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.550> edges<00:02:56.850> you'll<00:02:57.000> notice<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.420> gets

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
look at the edges you'll notice it gets

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.070 
look at the edges you'll notice it gets
a<00:02:57.690> little<00:02:58.100> edgy<00:02:59.100> or<00:02:59.520> jagged<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.959> don't

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
a little edgy or jagged so you don't

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.760 
a little edgy or jagged so you don't
want<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.260> go<00:03:01.320> all<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> way<00:03:01.530> there<00:03:01.709> right

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.160 
this is kind of long about way of doing
the<00:03:41.250> way<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.370> recommend<00:03:41.970> doing<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.720> going<00:03:43.050> up

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
the way I recommend doing it is going up

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.540 
the way I recommend doing it is going up
to<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.380> top<00:03:43.560> once<00:03:43.890> you're<00:03:44.040> clicked<00:03:44.250> on<00:03:44.430> your

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
to the top once you're clicked on your

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.600 
to the top once you're clicked on your
cutting<00:03:44.790> lines<00:03:45.290> go<00:03:46.290> up<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.680> object<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.459> go

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
cutting lines go up to object and go

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.300 
cutting lines go up to object and go
down<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.760> break<00:03:48.090> polyline<00:03:48.709> it'll<00:03:49.709> now<00:03:49.890> break

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
down to break polyline it'll now break

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.120 
down to break polyline it'll now break
all<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.730> these<00:03:50.850> individual<00:03:51.450> cut<00:03:51.690> lines<00:03:51.959> up<00:03:52.230> at

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
all of these individual cut lines up at

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.490 
all of these individual cut lines up at
which<00:03:53.280> point<00:03:53.580> I<00:03:53.640> can<00:03:53.850> hold<00:03:54.600> my<00:03:54.780> cursor<00:03:54.840> off

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
which point I can hold my cursor off

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.009 
which point I can hold my cursor off
just<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.519> edge<00:03:56.730> left<00:03:57.239> click<00:03:57.390> down<00:03:57.690> and

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
just the edge left click down and

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.100 
just the edge left click down and
highlight<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:59.370> what<00:04:00.180> it's<00:04:00.360> going<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.720> do<00:04:00.959> is

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
highlight and what it's going to do is

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.900 
highlight and what it's going to do is
it's<00:04:01.260> gonna<00:04:01.440> highlight<00:04:01.769> all<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.610> nodes

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
it's gonna highlight all of the nodes

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.080 
it's gonna highlight all of the nodes
that<00:04:03.560> are<00:04:04.560> within<00:04:05.069> each<00:04:05.400> individual<00:04:06.120> polyline

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
that are within each individual polyline

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.300 
that are within each individual polyline
so<00:04:08.050> if<00:04:08.140> I<00:04:08.200> let<00:04:08.349> down<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.800> notice<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.160> it

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
so if I let down you notice that it

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.890 
so if I let down you notice that it
highlighted<00:04:09.819> all<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.030> these<00:04:10.360> but<00:04:10.599> it<00:04:10.660> didn't

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
highlighted all of these but it didn't

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.240 
highlighted all of these but it didn't
like<00:04:11.140> this<00:04:11.260> one<00:04:11.470> because<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.769> didn't<00:04:11.980> get<00:04:12.069> that

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
like this one because I didn't get that

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.490 
like this one because I didn't get that
very<00:04:12.580> last<00:04:12.849> edge<00:04:13.180> of<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.540> I'll<00:04:14.140> just<00:04:14.200> go<00:04:14.319> ahead

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
very last edge of it I'll just go ahead

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.590 
very last edge of it I'll just go ahead
and<00:04:14.680> click<00:04:14.830> delete<00:04:15.120> I'll<00:04:16.120> have<00:04:16.269> to<00:04:16.359> do<00:04:16.479> the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
how in some cases the cut line is just a

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.390 
how in some cases the cut line is just a
little<00:04:40.990> bit<00:04:41.200> off<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.530> it's<00:04:42.010> gonna<00:04:42.070> leave<00:04:42.370> a
