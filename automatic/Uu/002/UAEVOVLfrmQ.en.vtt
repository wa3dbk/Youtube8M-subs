00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.750

though<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.930> 12<00:02:17.230> inch<00:02:17.440> laptop<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.550> as<00:02:18.640> you

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
though it's a 12 inch laptop but as you

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.090 
though it's a 12 inch laptop but as you
can<00:02:18.880> see<00:02:18.940> here<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.540> extended<00:02:20.410> battery<00:02:20.560> might

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
can see here the extended battery might

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.330 
can see here the extended battery might
pose<00:02:21.580> as<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.820> threat<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.630> won't<00:02:22.810> fit<00:02:23.020> so<00:02:23.350> it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
pose as a threat that it won't fit so it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.949 
pose as a threat that it won't fit so it
might<00:02:24.610> fit<00:02:24.880> but<00:02:25.150> it's<00:02:25.270> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> fit<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.690> little

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
might fit but it's going to fit a little

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.440 
might fit but it's going to fit a little
tight<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.700> might<00:02:27.880> want<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.120> consider

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
tight so you might want to consider

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.850 
tight so you might want to consider
getting<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.840> much<00:02:29.020> bigger<00:02:29.230> size<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.680> your
