carnival in 16th centuries for nine
months<00:01:36.369> per<00:01:36.820> year<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.570> meaning<00:01:38.020> really<00:01:38.560> the

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
months per year the meaning really the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.190

think<00:01:41.829> Venetian<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.439> city<00:01:44.679> is<00:01:44.860> more

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
think Venetian because the city is more

think Venetian because the city is more
personal<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:46.860> carnival<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:48.369> Venice<00:01:48.490> goes<00:01:49.090> with
