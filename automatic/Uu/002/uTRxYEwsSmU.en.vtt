the displace so the HTC desire x has got

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.990 
the displace so the HTC desire x has got
a<00:00:27.869> 4-inch<00:00:28.470> display<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:29.669> a<00:00:30.320> 800<00:00:31.320> x<00:00:31.560> 480<00:00:32.460> pixels

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
a 4-inch display with a 800 x 480 pixels

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.720 
a 4-inch display with a 800 x 480 pixels
resolution<00:00:33.200> which<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.350> quite<00:00:34.620> well<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.400> good

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
resolution which is quite well it's good

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.040 
resolution which is quite well it's good
readable<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.510> not<00:00:37.110> set<00:00:37.470> not<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.430> good<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.150> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
readable but not set not as good as the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.280 
readable but not set not as good as the
display<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.470> B<00:00:40.860> 1<00:00:41.340> B<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.750> same<00:00:42.960> resolution

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
display on B 1 B so the same resolution

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.680 
display on B 1 B so the same resolution
800<00:00:44.100> x<00:00:44.250> 480<00:00:44.910> pixels<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.380> has<00:00:46.590> got<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.690> 3.7

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
800 x 480 pixels but it has got a 3.7

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
800 x 480 pixels but it has got a 3.7
inch<00:00:49.340> diagonal<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.470> it's<00:00:52.470> better<00:00:53.040> readable

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
inch diagonal and it's better readable

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.560 
inch diagonal and it's better readable
so<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:54.690> looks<00:00:55.050> better<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.400> is<00:00:56.790> sharper

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
so that looks better it is sharper

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.360 
so that looks better it is sharper
because<00:00:57.780> resolution<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:58.860> same<00:00:58.980> although

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because resolution is the same although

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.780 
because resolution is the same although
the<00:00:59.610> screen<00:00:59.880> is<00:01:00.060> smaller<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:01.320> overall<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
the screen is smaller but overall the

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.630 
the screen is smaller but overall the
display<00:01:03.180> only<00:01:03.360> one<00:01:03.960> B<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> bit<00:01:04.830> better<00:01:05.040> also

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
display only one B is a bit better also

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.649 
display only one B is a bit better also
from<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.770> viewing<00:01:07.770> angles<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.970> still<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.509> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
from the viewing angles but still if you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.349 
from the viewing angles but still if you
want<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.930> bigger<00:01:10.140> display<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.039> desire<00:01:11.520> x<00:01:11.820> is

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
want a bigger display the desire x is

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:17.270 
want a bigger display the desire x is

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
difference is in the processor so we've

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.560 
difference is in the processor so we've

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:17.469 
it's not a very big difference so if you

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.719 
it's not a very big difference so if you
pick<00:07:17.710> one<00:07:18.550> over<00:07:18.849> the<00:07:19.479> other<00:07:19.800> you<00:07:20.800> won't<00:07:21.129> make<00:07:21.460> a

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:21.729 
pick one over the other you won't make a

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:24.360 
pick one over the other you won't make a
mistake<00:07:22.379> so<00:07:23.379> this<00:07:23.740> is<00:07:23.770> a<00:07:23.919> quick<00:07:24.159> comparison

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
mistake so this is a quick comparison

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.409
