00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:47.650
 hello welcome to ggm videoblog with 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.360
 chains chaos in the single and 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:56.630
 main role and also in the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.380
 very first follow and already breaking all 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.120
 together again 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.650
 actually I wanted to have one today 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.350
 to want to go to the big ministry 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.840
 that means actually ggm but I can 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.200
 not because as many of you know 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.420
 come from all sorts of fruits and 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.250
 the videos that I usually make and 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.890
 today we were such a ticket 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.869
 cock again statements among the ten 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.390
 ask and must immediately go into it 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.050
 we are a pity that is already but must 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.540
 be tough 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.040
 and I'm going to read it out now and that 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.470
 loud this incredible statement 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.340
 following the love is a book 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.479
 who does not contain the word of God 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.190
 people written down 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.900
 in the new testament they are the 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.280
 stories about jesus from nazareth the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.490
 letters of the apostles respectively 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.130
 But early Christians also need them 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.270
 always be interpreted 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.979
 and that's how it is 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.509
 different religious groups out 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.810
 have formed and christianity im 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.340
 why does that fall because of that 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.229
 ask about God 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.069
 this results in many 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:02.270
 possibilities he writes seriously 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.899
 this results in many 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.679
 possibilities 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.539
 it is obvious 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.830
 I mean in the last 2000 years 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.720
 about the numerous possibilities of the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.209
 christianity village clearly tried 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.300
 There is nothing and nobody in the world 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.220
 not even the fascism of so many 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.380
 death victims would have to complain like that 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.209
 Christian churches 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.770
 it is really unbelievable 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.190
 answer I gave him then 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.170
 was what the direction of love 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.690
 at hand and compares them with the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.700
 instruction manual for your television 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.730
 but that certainly did not do 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.380
 I do that now I have here on the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.360
 one side mine 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.650
 I only have this one and you see the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.600
 By the way, are quite old and 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.910
 tattered that has a simple reason 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.100
 that I really do it very often 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.790
 I've got a lot in my hand 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.350
 often read in this book that on the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.240
 one side and on the other side 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.540
 the manual promised how 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.760
 said for a tv you see 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.050
 can equal in several volumes therefore 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.410
 comes the are all different 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.070
 now see what it's all about 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.510
 comparisons are they are coming 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.100
 instruction manual five TVs not 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.050
 quite to the fog zoom 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.250
 the paper of bible it also thinner that 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.500
 means there are a bit more 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.000
 but we can do that too 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.050
 go out that this is the 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.360
 instruction manual for a 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.190
 electronic device is and that here 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.770
 the user manual for the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.540
 humanity in the world we can probably 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.570
 expect that here a bit 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.220
 Extensive is missing us yet 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.480
 Now if we look at the manual 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.580
 then watch for the tv 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.320
 we are here so little riders these little ones 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.100
 rider as german english pocsay 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.460
 nederlands and that goes here of course 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.860
 continue espanyol italiano postage goes that 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.720
 can not read at all 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.880
 polski still can not read something today 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.920
 chesky that should be russian time and so on 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.050
 So many more 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.030
 languages 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.050
 Of course they are 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.090
 instruction manuals for devices 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.100
 nowadays in different languages 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.930
 printed with it the different people 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.660
 Each language speaks the right one 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.209
 can find out for themselves that aviva 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.350
 the bible not that we have one now 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.880
 translated bible that is one 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.989
 unit translation what exactly you there and 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.880
 she is in german language 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.709
 but if you ask the right people 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.120
 will they tell at no the bible 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.620
 you can not speak German properly 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.940
 read there you actually understand 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.920
 not what you are talking about you have to go in 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:35.180
 ancient Greek or ancient Hebrew on 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:37.520
 best people read the mine 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.560
 tvs were so smart 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.340
 the manual in many 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.110
 to write different languages 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.370
 the people in god's order the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.260
 manual for the world 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.910
 apparently have not written 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.320
 so smart probably 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.760
 God told him that maybe not 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.720
 or did not think so can 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.070
 a busy god is happening 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.630
 the manual for my 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.700
 tv contains many things the 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.290
 relatively comprehensible and above all 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.910
 things then bring a lot of meaning 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.070
 if you sit right in front of the tv 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.660
 Ask yourself what you 're doing here 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.840
 Searching in vain will be phrases 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.150
 as in the beginning was a screen of 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.590
 screen but desolate and empty and 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.960
 Darkness lay on him 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.510
 Then said the color would linux 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.520
 Infrared light and see it was inka 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.670
 red light of which ones like me find it 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.840
 we do not find her very much 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.750
 comprehensible very secular 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.190
 written very clear before all 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.530
 things completely consistent 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.150
 Instructions on how to use televisions too 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.140
 operate and until now I have 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.450
 so no big problems 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.490
 had and I think that the 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.020
 most fascinating though I the 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.760
 manual for my television 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.820
 never been from start to finish 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.190
 if I'm against it in the world 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.120
 move and use this book as a benchmark 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.860
 take to orient myself 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.770
 I do not get very far 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.550
 There is a kind of quick reference here 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.040
 guide 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.890
 in this book and that's called the 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.320
 ten commandments and commanded in the ten 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.570
 some things are written 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.270
 Everything is written you should not 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:11.240
 other gods besides i am god yours 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.590
 Lord you shall sacred the sabbath 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.360
 did not want to hold false testimony 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.810
 so on next update 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.610
 and so on 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.840
 but if I stick to it then 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.310
 does not mean that the world 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.950
 opens up better than usual 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.820
 somehow overall are in this book 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.260
 but very many contradictions and 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.800
 yes i do not know so overall 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.810
 I say 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.270
 these two staples together 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.660
 then compare this one here 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.980
 very clearly outlined focus then can 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.960
 to start a lot 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.430
 from this book and from one 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.410
 contradiction on the next it is 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.290
 simply not logically comprehensible 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.650
 and dear people you actually 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.930
 always 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.880
 This thing believes when you come 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.050
 with one has to interpret or one 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.490
 these and each must provide 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.389
 raussuchen then look at the times 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.580
 ten questions 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.500
 In the ten questions is more common the speech 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.210
 of apologies in the name of God 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.460
 God will probably be able to do that 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.770
 book to write that from the beginning to 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.389
 Rear logically comprehensible and above 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.039
 all things not so full schwafel 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:13.940
 is like i have for device side 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:15.830
 I am the king with the people who 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.900
 they preferred to follow him 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.360
 last house and all his die 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.320
 nation past him to all the caterers 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:27.020
 and Peter and all gattiker those 600 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.030
 The man who followed him from guard was her 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.800
 all moved in front of the king as temporary 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.320
 said the king degenerated police 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.449
 you also want to let us go to sweeping 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:40.580
 and remains clinging to the new king 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:43.340
 second book samuel 17 to 19 was that 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.550
 what helps me that coping 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:49.340
 my life why should this heap 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.620
 klopapier in any form for 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.289
 contribute to the satisfaction of my life 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.570
 think about it in this sense 

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:58.960
 until next time, make the chains 

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.960
 chaos
