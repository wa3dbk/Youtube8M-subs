00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.900
 no handbags homemade thats 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.330
 no problem today 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.870
 Juliet Brinckman is out of the pockets office 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.540
 Munich 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.859
 He shows us how to do it today 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.300
 Sewing trinket yourself times can 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.220
 co-founder joined a few years ago 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.660
 he stood before the problematic that himself 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.119
 His girlfriend wanted a handbag 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.439
 has and he has been looking for a long time but it was 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.609
 just did not find anything and did 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.380
 But then it is much nicer 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.740
 if you make a bag yourself 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.059
 would 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.370
 That's why the idea did not come up 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.600
 offer with the nice bags from 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.600
 make leather easily yourself 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.960
 the special thing is that you really 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.730
 No previous knowledge is needed 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.680
 Sewing machine and it can really anyone 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 do it Yourself 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 Aspect different the pattern of us 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.300
 this is drawn on the leather 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.830
 means one cuts easily on basis 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.930
 the line cut pattern 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.360
 and then there is a special one 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.590
 suggestion template with the help of this 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.030
 stencil will be engraved holes in front 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.040
 That's why we developed it with it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.840
 however, the seam distances are the same 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.729
 Distances and the seam in the end really 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.869
 clean and looks exactly then one has 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.400
 just his markings with the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.990
 made and stings with one 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.770
 Art from the tool around holes of a 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.080
 leather to sting 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.399
 the holes before and then missing at the end 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.300
 really only the garden with two 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.300
 for hours 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.350
 You can often do with us the time 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.030
 or here in the shop you can 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.380
 first choose his model 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.690
 then you can add a few components 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.210
 Choose as leather color yarn color 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.620
 shutter color relatively easy everything 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.560
 also on the site in the configurator 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.150
 and then exactly there you can order that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.740
 or order from us here and 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.190
 we then really make individual 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.190
 sap together 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.470
 and this is how the set looks like 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.450
 everything you need for the production 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.660
 but a little talent that results 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.020
 with the exercise now say the package to 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.020
 post brought
