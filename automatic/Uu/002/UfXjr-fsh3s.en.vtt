00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 very good to all kids to 4.5 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.580
 Welcome to another tribune server for 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 minecraft and this time we are in the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.690
 version 1.8 point 5 so from 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.130
 today I'm going to start uploading servers 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.349
 for this version 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.330
 many of the servers that I'm going to upload 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.490
 I have already promoted them previously 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.570
 that most forgiveness you will already know 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.859
 but it is that many of the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.150
 administrators have asked me to come back 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.560
 to upload their servers because they have been 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.019
 updated because it has introduced new 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.789
 things new game modes so then 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.080
 Most, as I say, you will know them 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.640
 but good 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.840
 if you see that a server already know 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.820
 that you already have it then nothing happens 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.140
 closing the video is already worth it so 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.510
 good today we are with the servel 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.360

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.840
 is going fatal or the internet 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.200

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.820
 so creative and skype blog apart we have 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.590
 here quite these days that as you see 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.810
 well this is just that the store for 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.280
 pay and to go to the spawn area 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.900
 then we have here what is the lobby 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 menu that is good to select in it 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.590
 it comes what we want to be and then 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.000
 we have this that is the player menu that 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.430
 this is then to change our 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.450

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.560

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.509
 etcetera these plans pound and nothing else 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.310
 the truth is that it does not look pretty cool 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.750
 has many things and then the description 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.420
 of thriller and I ordered the whole subject as 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.680
 always and nothing else gave me a little spin 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.180
 around here in the lobby as you see then 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.789
 it's pretty cool very elegant very 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.430

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.600

 I hope you liked me more 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.690

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.759

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.310

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.160
 upload the series of mods 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.290
 but I do not have time because I had to 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.120
 render the video and now it's eight o'clock 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.430

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.440

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.910
 Spanish schedule video then I do not 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.470
 it took time to render the episode and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.599
 upload it is worth it because I had to 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.190
 record quite late because it was 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.290
 the pot and since it did not give me it did not give me 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.000
 time so I have it recorded I have it 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.769
 to make and upload so surely 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.180
 if everything goes well tomorrow you will have the 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.010

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.239
 Now, yes, and also tell you what's going on 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.890
 to have a lot of variety I will try 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.810

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.459
