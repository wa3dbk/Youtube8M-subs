00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
bail out of the jet while it's flying

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
bail out of the jet while it's flying
and<00:00:36.300> you've<00:00:36.870> got<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.110> try<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.440> land<00:00:37.649> without

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
glitches like the one where Trevor can

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030 
glitches like the one where Trevor can
activate<00:00:42.030> his<00:00:42.210> action<00:00:42.600> skill<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.469> survive<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000
