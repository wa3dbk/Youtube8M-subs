00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
full of imperfections and they're very

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.400

subtle<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.820> that's<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> first<00:00:49.320> ways

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
subtle but that's one of the first ways

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.920 
subtle but that's one of the first ways
we're<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.160> look<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.239> telling<00:00:51.719> real

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.480 
usually the holes are driven very very
small<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.740> most<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> pearl<00:01:47.280> is

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
small so that most of the pearl is

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
small so that most of the pearl is
preserved<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> times<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.810> fake<00:01:49.079> strands

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
preserved a lot of times on fake strands

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.679 
preserved a lot of times on fake strands
of<00:01:49.590> pearls<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.670> very<00:01:50.909> carelessly

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
of pearls see just very carelessly

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.929 
of pearls see just very carelessly
drilled<00:01:52.880> large<00:01:53.880> holes<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:56.310> take<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> look

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
drilled large holes so just take a look

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.270 
drilled large holes so just take a look
between<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.570> threading<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.829> if<00:01:59.040> you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
between the threading and see if you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.730 
between the threading and see if you
have<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.430> larger<00:01:59.820> small<00:02:00.090> hole<00:02:00.360> small<00:02:01.140> more

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
have a larger small hole small more

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.160 
have a larger small hole small more

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
to be fake this has been how to tell

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.110 
to be fake this has been how to tell
