edition superclocked addition you can
see<00:00:22.320> how<00:00:22.470> small<00:00:22.920> compact<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.000> card<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.710> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
see how small compact the card is you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.060 
see how small compact the card is you
can<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:25.980> how<00:00:26.189> long<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.580> motherboard<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:28.070> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
can see how long the motherboard is so

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.269 
can see how long the motherboard is so
this<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.660> about<00:00:30.660> 6<00:00:31.019> inches<00:00:31.140> long<00:00:31.590> six<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.250> a

loading<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:30.030> going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.210> come<00:02:30.330> out<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.660> this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
loading it's going to come out like this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.170 
loading it's going to come out like this
I'm<00:02:31.080> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.260> come<00:02:31.380> out<00:02:31.500> straight<00:02:32.180> instead

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
I'm going to come out straight instead

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.920 
I'm going to come out straight instead
of<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.480> big<00:02:33.720> curve<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:36.000> over<00:02:36.210> here<00:02:36.630> going<00:02:36.840> to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
of this big curve and over here going to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.930 
of this big curve and over here going to
have<00:02:37.020> an<00:02:37.110> atty<00:02:37.290> degree<00:02:37.590> fitting<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.520> it's

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
have an atty degree fitting and it's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.520 
have an atty degree fitting and it's
going<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.120> go<00:02:39.210> nice<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.510> straight<00:02:39.990> instead<00:02:40.410> of

going to go nice and straight instead of
having<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.890> curve<00:02:41.190> over<00:02:41.460> here<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
having this curve over here and you

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.010 
having this curve over here and you
could<00:02:43.770> have<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.950> back<00:02:44.190> plate<00:02:44.370> as<00:02:44.610> well<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.900> i'll

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
could have a back plate as well and i'll

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.960 
could have a back plate as well and i'll
put<00:02:46.140> some<00:02:46.200> thermal<00:02:46.680> passing<00:02:47.070> those<00:02:47.220> thermal<00:02:47.790> i

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
put some thermal passing those thermal i

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.620 
put some thermal passing those thermal i
mean<00:02:48.210> those<00:02:48.590> brm<00:02:49.590> chipset<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.330> put<00:02:51.330> some<00:02:51.510> of

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
mean those brm chipset and put some of

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.370 
mean those brm chipset and put some of
those<00:02:51.720> see<00:02:52.170> how<00:02:52.290> their<00:02:52.500> performance<00:02:53.100> goes<00:02:53.330> and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
those see how their performance goes and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.690 
those see how their performance goes and
let's<00:02:55.380> put<00:02:55.530> them<00:02:55.620> i<00:02:55.709> said<00:02:55.920> i'm<00:02:56.100> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> get
