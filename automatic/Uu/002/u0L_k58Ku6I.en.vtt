00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.770 
wipes and realized some things that were
catching<00:00:40.719> me<00:00:40.870> up<00:00:41.160> namely<00:00:42.160> one<00:00:42.399> being<00:00:42.640> my<00:00:42.940> NBC's

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
catching me up namely one being my NBC's

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.470 
catching me up namely one being my NBC's
getting<00:00:44.109> they<00:00:45.070> were<00:00:45.219> being<00:00:45.429> ignited<00:00:45.940> into

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
getting they were being ignited into

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.380 
getting they were being ignited into
other<00:00:46.629> mobs<00:00:47.309> ignite<00:00:48.309> is<00:00:48.460> an<00:00:48.609> ability<00:00:48.879> that

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
other mobs ignite is an ability that

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.290 
other mobs ignite is an ability that
Sierra's<00:00:49.899> has<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.440> was<00:00:50.559> basically<00:00:50.769> his<00:00:51.370> fear

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
Sierra's has it was basically his fear

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.590 
Sierra's has it was basically his fear
and<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.399> little<00:00:54.579> bit<00:00:54.699> of<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.940> damage<00:00:55.329> to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
and with it a little bit of a damage to

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.009 
and with it a little bit of a damage to
it<00:00:55.749> and<00:00:55.929> so<00:00:56.679> randomly<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:58.179> MPC's<00:00:58.780> were

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
it and so randomly the MPC's were

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.020 
it and so randomly the MPC's were
getting<00:00:59.350> feared<00:00:59.649> and<00:00:59.859> other<00:01:00.010> mobs<00:01:00.339> and<00:01:00.730> I<00:01:00.850> was

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
getting feared and other mobs and I was

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.930 
getting feared and other mobs and I was
having<00:01:01.179> a<00:01:01.390> hard<00:01:01.570> time<00:01:01.629> keeping<00:01:02.199> up<00:01:02.320> with<00:01:02.530> that

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
having a hard time keeping up with that

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.170 
having a hard time keeping up with that
so<00:01:03.940> I've<00:01:04.059> got<00:01:04.239> myself<00:01:04.390> here<00:01:04.870> at<00:01:04.960> max<00:01:05.260> range<00:01:05.620> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so I've got myself here at max range and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.210 
so I've got myself here at max range and
the<00:01:07.180> reason<00:01:07.570> for<00:01:07.600> that<00:01:07.780> is<00:01:08.080> I'm<00:01:08.530> not<00:01:08.800> in<00:01:09.010> range

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
the reason for that is I'm not in range

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.020 
the reason for that is I'm not in range
of<00:01:09.689> serious<00:01:10.689> fear<00:01:11.110> as<00:01:11.890> well<00:01:12.250> as<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.700> am<00:01:12.820> in<00:01:13.000> a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
of serious fear as well as I am in a

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.080 
of serious fear as well as I am in a
perfect<00:01:13.509> position<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:14.430> pluck<00:01:15.430> down<00:01:15.700> those

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
perfect position to pluck down those

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.240 
perfect position to pluck down those
Cedars<00:01:16.479> every<00:01:17.140> time<00:01:17.320> they<00:01:17.530> spawn<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.070> keep

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
Cedars every time they spawn to keep

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.609
