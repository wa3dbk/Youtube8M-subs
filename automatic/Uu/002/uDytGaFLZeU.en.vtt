come<00:01:12.340> on<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.610> model<00:01:12.939> sees<00:01:13.180> where<00:01:13.509> some

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
cancers are found lying around I think

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.419

there are false galactic cars I found in
a<00:01:21.520> box<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.329> managed<00:01:22.719> to<00:01:22.749> put<00:01:23.740> them<00:01:23.890> onto<00:01:24.039> here

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
a box so I managed to put them onto here

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.649 
a box so I managed to put them onto here
just<00:01:24.579> to<00:01:24.670> make<00:01:24.789> them<00:01:24.969> look<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.359> bit<00:01:25.509> more

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
just to make them look a bit more

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.800 
just to make them look a bit more
realistic<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.549> that<00:01:27.579> was<00:01:27.969> at<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.179> time<00:01:28.390> when

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
realistic and that was at the time when

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.069 
realistic and that was at the time when
I<00:01:28.840> used<00:01:28.929> to<00:01:29.140> play<00:01:29.200> with<00:01:29.590> them<00:01:29.740> loads<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:31.299> as

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.080 
I used to play with them loads and as
you<00:01:32.200> can<00:01:32.319> see<00:01:32.469> it's<00:01:32.590> really<00:01:32.740> lightweight<00:01:33.100> this

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
you can see it's really lightweight this

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.120 
you can see it's really lightweight this
particular<00:01:34.390> van<00:01:34.719> is<00:01:34.990> roadside<00:01:35.289> maintenance

as<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.789> can<00:01:36.939> tell<00:01:37.179> and<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.759> is<00:01:40.859> just<00:01:41.859> like<00:01:42.039> a

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
as you can tell and it is just like a

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.059 
as you can tell and it is just like a
real<00:01:42.939> time<00:01:43.149> maintenance<00:01:43.659> van<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:44.740> obviously

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
real time maintenance van that obviously

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.690 
real time maintenance van that obviously
serviced<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.939> fleet<00:01:47.249> remember<00:01:48.249> the<00:01:48.399> but

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
serviced the fleet remember the but

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.399 
serviced the fleet remember the but
doors<00:01:49.240> open<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.689> don't<00:01:49.869> think<00:01:50.049> they<00:01:50.229> do<00:01:50.700> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
doors open I don't think they do so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.959 
doors open I don't think they do so
that's<00:01:53.409> that<00:01:53.619> one<00:01:53.740> out<00:01:53.889> the<00:01:54.069> way<00:01:54.219> what<00:01:54.700> this

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
that's that one out the way what this

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.309 
that's that one out the way what this
one<00:01:55.270> thing<00:01:55.450> particular<00:01:55.689> was<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:56.049> first

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
one thing particular was the first

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.910 
one thing particular was the first
Stobart<00:01:57.219> farmer<00:01:57.549> actually<00:01:57.700> had<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:59.439> I<00:01:59.619> used<00:01:59.829> to

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
Stobart farmer actually had as I used to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.919

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.640 
long ago and obviously I still keep them
because<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.340> brings<00:02:15.550> back<00:02:15.700> memories<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.650> due

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
because it brings back memories and due

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.580 
because it brings back memories and due
to<00:02:17.680> them<00:02:18.040> being<00:02:18.069> snow<00:02:18.580> bars<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.200> that's<00:02:20.379> that

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
to them being snow bars so that's that

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.890 
to them being snow bars so that's that

obviously<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.860> employees<00:03:33.400> went<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.239> this<00:03:34.420> to

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
obviously the employees went in this to

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.900 
obviously the employees went in this to
meetings<00:03:36.930> all<00:03:37.930> drivers<00:03:38.350> went<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.400> places<00:03:39.640> in

it<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:41.100> not<00:03:42.100> too<00:03:42.280> sure<00:03:42.780> but<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:44.440> says<00:03:44.590> all

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
it and not too sure but it says all

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.560 
it and not too sure but it says all
about<00:03:44.950> personnel<00:03:45.489> carrier<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.090> I'm<00:03:46.209> guessing

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
about personnel carrier so I'm guessing

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.020 
about personnel carrier so I'm guessing
that<00:03:46.600> might<00:03:46.810> be<00:03:46.959> right<00:03:47.140> but<00:03:47.530> luckily<00:03:48.160> show<00:03:48.940> you

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
that might be right but luckily show you

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.090 
that might be right but luckily show you
that<00:03:49.180> these<00:03:49.630> doors<00:03:49.900> open<00:03:50.320> now<00:03:50.830> if<00:03:50.890> we<00:03:50.980> look

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
that these doors open now if we look

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.280 
that these doors open now if we look
just<00:03:51.340> inside<00:03:51.760> we<00:03:52.120> can<00:03:52.239> see<00:03:52.270> all<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.840> seats<00:03:53.260> so

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
just inside we can see all the seats so

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.610 
just inside we can see all the seats so
if<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.380> take<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> look<00:03:56.680> at<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:57.070> other<00:03:57.220> side<00:03:57.430> now

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
if you take a look at the other side now

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.470 
if you take a look at the other side now
you<00:03:59.620> can<00:03:59.860> see<00:04:00.070> it's<00:04:00.489> exactly<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:01.209> same<00:04:02.010> so

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
you can see it's exactly the same so

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.949 
you can see it's exactly the same so

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
praying the fleet at the time and this

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.629 
praying the fleet at the time and this
