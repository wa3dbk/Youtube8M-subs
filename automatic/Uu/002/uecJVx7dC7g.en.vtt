00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.760
 Hello and we do not welcome you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.710
 in matthias around here on the mwc and got 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.580
 can lend a hand to the new here 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.210
 iphone 6s plus if you are natural 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.430
 Not 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.609
 I am here at the booth, and this and that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.980
 is the zte blade 6 plus and in fact 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.369
 there is next to the 6 plus one too 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.710
 normal s6 and if you like that a bit 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.300
 the optics look then is also without 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.790
 that I mentioned the same from the beginning 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.399
 It was completely clear from whom zte here 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.629
 was inspired told 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.629
 at the same time but at the price that 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.710
 smaller is supposed to be sold for $ 250 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.780
 So probably yes 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.820
 Also in Germany think tropez 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.620
 and here at 66 plus there are none 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.390
 exact prices or never very clear though 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 it comes out and will be his chance the 3 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.859
 now it will be a little lawyer 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.719
 probably around 350 euros cost 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.879
 and it really looks like that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.399
 very pretty we have here in 5.5 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 inch display and it solves with net 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.510
 full hd on what i really really nice 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.759
 finds and it has got it too 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.890
 managed the relatively large battery too 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.020
 namely build a 3000 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.259
 milliamp battery that device can 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.899
 Lte and of course the other usual 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.860
 connection methods and it works 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.750
 android 5.0 lollipop here it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.250
 Tears we see here is the camera that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.220
 after all, with 3 10 megapixel camera 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.570
 we also see a roulette here 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.390
 actually not even that 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.420
 worst components installed 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.620
 the whole is not really easy with 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.870
 156 grams but tell me for a device in 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.760
 the size is quite okay and it is 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.080
 8 millimeters thick and what's up 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.000
 so to speak , we will say look now 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.640
 Kate at the side and we see here 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.830
 left of course that's all complete 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.600
 plastic and 40 folders plastic 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.520
 but it does not look so bad 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.290
 It has become a bit metal 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.670
 look and if it does not get better that way 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.350
 Do not think otherwise, that's it 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.270
 Metal on top have a whole 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.509
 classic jack and even 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.890
 an infrared jack and here will 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.570
 Camera is a bit of a story 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.500
 if you have other side he still has 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.930
 this camp's turn 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.260
 we have the volume rocker the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.400
 really does not feel so free 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.720
 accept complete plastic feeling 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.320
 shared below the on and off switch 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.900
 told here in person is an msm 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.780
 89 39 boxer core processor in there the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.230
 after all clocked with 1 5 gigahertz and 2 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.709
 gb ram has also heard of this device 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.230
 8gb permanently installed memory to the man 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.180
 but like many android phones canon 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.250
 can be extended with 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.200
 micro sd cards I do not see any here 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.980
 slot that means you can somehow here 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.480
 this back probably will decrease 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.510
 so that was it 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.560
 zte blade it six 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.290
 Plus how does that happen to you? 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.420
 even only a few euros people iphone 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.390
 imitation you can find the brazen or 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.280
 that does not really matter because that would have 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.329
 anyway everyone will look the same 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.459
 opinion because I'm really interested 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.019
 curious what's down in the comments 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.019
 that mathematics of nbc
