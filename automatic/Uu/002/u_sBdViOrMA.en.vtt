I don't know about you but when I first
gave<00:00:04.230> up<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.470> corpse<00:00:04.740> products<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.460> the

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
gave up the corpse products and the

gave up the corpse products and the
dairy<00:00:05.700> products<00:00:06.240> one<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.230> my<00:00:07.410> primary

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
was had this idea that that dairy was

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.830 
was had this idea that that dairy was
responsible<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:17.550> strong<00:00:17.850> healthy<00:00:18.210> bones<00:00:18.390> I

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
responsible for strong healthy bones I

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.630 
responsible for strong healthy bones I
don't<00:00:19.140> know<00:00:19.199> how<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.770> idea<00:00:19.890> maybe<00:00:20.430> all

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
don't know how I got that idea maybe all

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.330 
don't know how I got that idea maybe all
the<00:00:20.789> thousands<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:22.160> advertisements<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.250> my

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.830 
face like got milk and you know all this
garbage<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.029> dairy<00:00:27.210> industry<00:00:27.300> puts<00:00:27.720> out

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
garbage that the dairy industry puts out

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.070 
garbage that the dairy industry puts out
there<00:00:28.609> but<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> imagine<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.300> anybody<00:00:30.869> who

went through the public school system

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.940 
went through the public school system
especially<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.570> America<00:00:33.960> has<00:00:34.770> been

brainwashed with this idea and the idea

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.240 
brainwashed with this idea and the idea
of<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:38.160> video<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.770> turn<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.890> idea<00:00:41.190> on

of this video is to turn that idea on

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
of this video is to turn that idea on

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
true at all and furthermore I want to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.139 
true at all and furthermore I want to
explain<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> exactly<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.000> do

explain to you exactly what you can do

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.430 
explain to you exactly what you can do
to<00:00:48.450> ensure<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:48.930> strong<00:00:49.230> healthy

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
to ensure that you have strong healthy

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
to ensure that you have strong healthy
bones<00:00:49.739> until<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> day<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.360> die<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:52.860> begin<00:00:53.600> let

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
bones until the day you die to begin let

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.170 
bones until the day you die to begin let
me<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.750> reiterate<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> point<00:00:56.180> that

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
me just reiterate to the point that

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.720 
me just reiterate to the point that
calcium<00:00:58.050> consumption<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.710> osteoporosis<00:00:59.250> are

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
calcium consumption and osteoporosis are

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.779 
calcium consumption and osteoporosis are
positively<00:01:00.359> correlated<00:01:01.340> people<00:01:02.340> who<00:01:02.430> consume

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
positively correlated people who consume

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.369 
positively correlated people who consume
the<00:01:03.000> highest<00:01:03.270> amounts<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> calcium<00:01:03.780> tend<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the highest amounts of calcium tend to

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.600 
the highest amounts of calcium tend to
suffer<00:01:04.619> from<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> highest<00:01:05.339> rates<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
suffer from the highest rates of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.170 
suffer from the highest rates of
osteoporosis<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.409> reason<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.520> these

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
osteoporosis the reason is because these

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
osteoporosis the reason is because these
same<00:01:09.420> people<00:01:09.840> consume<00:01:10.409> high<00:01:10.619> amounts<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
same people consume high amounts of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.320 
same people consume high amounts of
animal<00:01:11.159> products<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:12.030> where<00:01:12.210> they're

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
animal products that's where they're

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.630 
animal products that's where they're
getting<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> calcium<00:01:13.140> from<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.220> reason

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
getting all the calcium from the reason

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
getting all the calcium from the reason
that<00:01:15.180> higher<00:01:15.810> consumption<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> animal

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that higher consumption of animal

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.640 
that higher consumption of animal
products<00:01:17.390> tends<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.630> correlate<00:01:18.869> positively

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
products tends to correlate positively

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.480 
products tends to correlate positively
with<00:01:20.250> high<00:01:20.400> rates<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.700> osteoporosis<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:22.490> two

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
with high rates of osteoporosis is two

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.420 
with high rates of osteoporosis is two
reasons<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.030> first<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.860> acid<00:01:26.250> buffer

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
reasons the first is the acid buffer

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.980 
reasons the first is the acid buffer
mechanism<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> second<00:01:29.840> which<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
mechanism and the second which is the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.840 
mechanism and the second which is the
main<00:01:31.200> topic<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.740> video<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.670> lack<00:01:32.820> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
main topic of this video is the lack of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.630 
main topic of this video is the lack of
strontium<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.930> animal<00:01:34.439> foods<00:01:35.990> strontium<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.640> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
strontium in animal foods strontium is a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.499 
strontium in animal foods strontium is a
trace<00:01:39.090> mineral<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> comes<00:01:40.350> from<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.860> soil

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
trace mineral that comes from the soil

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.960 
trace mineral that comes from the soil
the<00:01:42.509> foods<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the foods that are going to be the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.819 
the foods that are going to be the
richest<00:01:45.390> sources<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.899> strontium<00:01:46.140> are<00:01:46.649> gonna

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
richest sources of strontium are gonna

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.219 
richest sources of strontium are gonna
be<00:01:47.040> foods<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:48.390> their<00:01:48.659> nutrients

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
be foods that get their nutrients

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.280 
be foods that get their nutrients

mention there was another study done on
strontium<00:05:49.780> and<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:52.000> effect<00:05:52.270> it<00:05:52.360> has<00:05:52.479> on<00:05:52.510> teeth

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
strontium and the effect it has on teeth

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.900 
strontium and the effect it has on teeth
and<00:05:53.169> it<00:05:53.710> showed<00:05:53.919> to<00:05:54.130> strengthen<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:54.610> enamel

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.310 
and it showed to strengthen the enamel
of<00:05:54.970> teeth<00:05:55.150> as<00:05:55.300> well<00:05:55.510> and<00:05:55.930> reduce<00:05:56.200> the
