00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.730
 challenge because it is possible but 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.099
 everyone is watching them here 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.620
 uncontested part of the show so I 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.900
 I'm getting expert tineu subtexts of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.109
 conversations or intention that exists 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.830
 behind the words if you want to see if he 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.600
 win the first thing for this 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 is a dialogue the person who is the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.859
 other side needs to respond to the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.650
 to this number the monologue is 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.800
 make an example, you go there and say hello 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.370
 okay is personal it answers everything okay 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.180
 Everything without you was lacking in the case. 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.000
 should answer everything is you right to roll 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.590
 a micro disinterest, but here it was 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.420
 You want the show if you have to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.420
 responsibility continues the conversation there 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.949
 You go there and you're fine, it 's me today. 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.230

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.370

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.670

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:13.140
 It's all good, is cool, is everything ok? 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.290
 because the generic ones of the tchan flame 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.500
 subtext I am not in the mood to dialogue 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.509

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.939

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.590
 Good, and you answer for everything and you're there. 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.590
 For free, go back and respond to everything. 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.220

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.630
 my life 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.150
 Do you think I 'm wasting time? 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.010

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.250
 less any topic of that conversation 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:44.050
 because I did not take my life to 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:46.540

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:53.230

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.610
 This with me also has the story 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.290
 unanswered message 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.920

 I have an answer to help in that 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.420
 I need to think after that 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.200
 understanding only when 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.989
 people see 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.010
 my message and they do not respond 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.530

 An answer will connect the person and speak 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.220
 Look what 's happening this, this. 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.720
 You draw Swiss but only in the chat. 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.489
 even and I did not have anything important 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.489
 waiting to talk has answered 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.500
 taking misadventures can lease garlic not 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.989
 have all the time in the world to talk about 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.760
 treadmill understood that at some point in the 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.640
 My life has to do serious things. 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.220
 how to write the script to make a 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.049
 video but today lost the crisis of bobbi 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.880

 2010 wreck beast and loads there 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.579
 In my house it was called the motion today. 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.380
 I do not know how they are anymore 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.540
 called the one that facilitated the life neca 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.639
 express emotions but today I have 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.860
 perceived it has to create that zuma 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.290
 and federal have given problem has given 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.850
 communication failures because of 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.470
 certain faces right here 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.360
 looking from moor who is example knows 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.669
 that smile that has there knows that 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.280
 From corner to corner, I can not 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.460
 persuading that this is a happy 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.500
 for me it is an irony and apprehension and 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.500
 I'm from the south 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.999
 debauchery that's bocce 

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:55.309
 're there in the middle of a serious conversation with 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:57.169
 Your band is making fun of me. 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:59.240
 not short then what happens is 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.399
 stressed and willing to send 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.089
 Back does not have and does not have a hand like that. 

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:06.740
 to send the face that hides employment 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:10.580
 Dad says forever 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.860
 This is very mature on my part. 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.360
 Now I love the little monkey. 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.740
 marketing that makes it to my face that 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.839
 I am always the most often in 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.430
 70% of the cases that now have the 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.050
 connection is that it frightens me because 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.089
 so before when you were in the middle 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.830
 of a conversation there, someone said stone 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:30.199
 I'll get you, you already knew I had a 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.180
 half I did not think so at the time she 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.689
 you can record there you can record the 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.839
 she wants to hear the voice live is because 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:40.339
 so it 's a rather serious thing I already 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.139
 It was so well thought unaware that 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:44.240
 It is had when he was a reverse know 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.939
 when I needed to call the person 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.389
 because I wanted to shout at you 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:52.099
 Do you understand then you always think that 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.479
 otherwise it will be the same understood 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.949
 when someone wants to call me because she 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.809
 You want to yell at me for what happens 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.330
 some shit understood and did not have 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:01.669
 how do I know what it's called? 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.369
 if today they express enough 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.139
 irritation of that moment and the reaction 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:08.149
 It's very scary, but I'm very 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.860
 because at any moment I can take a 

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:12.139
 anyway, people think the program 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.180
 of selection of texts of the accused and I 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.669
 I think there's a lot more to talk about. 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.589
 For you, only for today it's just you. 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.479
 I wish I could continue telling 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:22.669
 you who have behind the conversations that 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.149
 I did not even get it heavy or I spoke of crush 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:28.399
 I did not even talk about mother or mother. 

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:31.099
 Mom is also spending five hours 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:33.740
 typing to say hello, how are you? 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:35.110

 I have not been so diversified. 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:44.090
 You want me to do especially for you. 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.430
 You with the streets, the conversation here is with you. 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:50.360

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.630
