00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello today would like to 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.710
 present you the fourth version 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.620
 capstone knife sharpeners would immediately 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.470
 I wanted to start with the question that we 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.160
 often asked on the internet 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:24.090
 what size stones can weight 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.430
 inserted and clamped in the crack and then 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.500
 tell you about the size and difference from 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.820
 previous versions 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:36.920
 mean for experiment we will take 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.920
 base bread moan only 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.690
 raw 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.750
 not painted because so heavy 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.649
 stone so that we can put here at 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.870
 we have no you use and the weight of this 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.239
 one kilogram plates now together 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.239
 will come how much does it weigh 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:15.780
 He showed up 90 grams of it. 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:20.979
 stone simulator clamp plate 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.479
 clamping blocks will remind you that my wife 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.640
 blocks there are rezinochki which is now 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.869
 show on camera as you can see 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 plate size which 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:37.290
 300 to 70 millimeters put well 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.369
 keeps well not falling out well 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:47.220
 theoretically there would have been a stone then 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:47.220
 behind . would have looked like a plate off 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:57.030
 show clamping blocks so focus 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.640
 start clamping may not be very 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.840
 clearly visible but in these parts on clamp 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.950
 there are special rubber bands on the blocks 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.540
 who run into a stone and does not give him 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.110
 slide it off with a novelty which is a movie 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.660
 today tell further why 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.450
 fourth version what is different means 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.799
 in brief in brief rubrics like i said 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.840
 plate 300 on 70 and 7 thick 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.380
 millimeters 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.640
 horizontal rail 640 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.230
 millimeters long and 8 thick 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.560
 millimeters and vertical guide 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.099
 220 millimeters long tour also 8 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:49.519
 millimeters thick mean 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.519
 Further difference from previous versions 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.709
 here we use such rubber 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.670
 nozzles 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.160
 Before this were thin such rubber 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.980
 sanitary strips which are not 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.350
 allowed to stand firm on 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.510
 surface 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.400
 this sharpener costs well on any 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.060
 surface and will not move during 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.260
 sharpening time further horizontally 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.700
 sending before it was before the composition 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.720
 two parts now this price 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:30.470
 guide therefore no backlash and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:34.799
 can not be so further here here 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.690
 on the ground here this gum stands 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.730
 neodymium magnet before it was 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.700
 capacity of 9 kilograms now he 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.349
 12 kilogram knife stays firm 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.980
 pressed tightly 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.290
 You can just grab here but 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.670
 in the main constructive points I 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.220
 I will not tell you because it is from 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:00.430
 previous video reviews are now arren 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.480
 only about the difference also unlike 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.860
 previous versions 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:11.379
 tires on this site and tires 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.519
 Here is a sticking which is put under 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.079
 which is clamped on top of the knife is made 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.720
 in the factory 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.500
 it is vulcanized rubber which 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.190
 applied under pressure and under high 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.699
 temperatures 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.699
 I will show on the basis of a drove 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.830
 it is very problematic to tear her 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:44.169
 very very hard here is worth that is 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:46.120
 so probably seen that is applied to it 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:51.970
 very very good and will serve you 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:55.870
 long and main point now how are you 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.490
 ate on the Internet . 4 versions will be strong 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.720
 I would like to demonstrate the magnet 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:08.340
 what do I mean by removable magnet 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.340
 give guidance to us yet 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.700
 unscrew the leg 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.860
 so mean here are two hexagons 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.669
 which we will most likely replace later 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:47.210
 on the booth under the screwdriver let's unscrew them 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.210
 and show days 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.620
 love 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.590
 but 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.740
 these hexagons 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.870
 Here is such a plastic plate 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.630
 she performs especially decorative 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.720
 no load function it carries 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:22.280
 so trasher 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:25.509
 next we see here a magnet we see 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.220
 here a magnet can be pulled out 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:31.039
 pushing on the gum from the inside 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.199
 Well, I would not advise you to do it because 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.169
 there is a chance to break the rubber we do it 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:39.039
 easier to take any legs would be some 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:45.860
 plate which is not a pity 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:48.800
 magnetized and take out such 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.039
 magnetically by the way in previous versions he 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:57.110
 was not only powerful in me many 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:59.259
 a bit already this one that allows that 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.300
 allows 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:07.340
 magnet and large blade area means 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:10.570
 gum remains under the magnet 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.400
 in the middle and such a notch which 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.520
 The date is laid plastic thing 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.539
 there can be close to be neat 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:22.180
 rubber cloak from one to one and a half 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:27.349
 I will try to show millimeters 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:29.270
 I will try to show its thickness of rubber 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:31.669
 strong new naturally it is possible 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.849
 break therefore advantage is desirable 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:40.250
 neatly if you come in later beckons 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:42.310
 put here also in reverse 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.310
 okay 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:50.630
 and further records and closes 

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.740
 hexagons are all i wanted 

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:56.240
 tell in this video 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.590
 other points on sharpening and assembly and 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.870
 use of the machine will 

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.320
 other videos thanks for watching up 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.320
 new meetings
