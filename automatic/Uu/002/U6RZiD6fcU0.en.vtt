the<00:02:42.350> game<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.709> guess<00:02:42.920> though<00:02:43.880> if<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:45.019> Ralph<00:02:45.290> is

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
the game I guess though if this Ralph is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.840 
the game I guess though if this Ralph is
a<00:02:45.470> little<00:02:45.680> odd<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.190> wanted<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.550> know<00:02:46.700> how

there's<00:06:48.169> a<00:06:48.560> paralyzed<00:06:49.219> yield<00:06:49.490> there<00:06:49.819> it's

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
there's a paralyzed yield there it's

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.149 
there's a paralyzed yield there it's
kind<00:06:50.449> of<00:06:50.599> useful<00:06:50.749> but<00:06:51.560> you<00:06:51.830> don't<00:06:52.069> really

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:52.159 
kind of useful but you don't really

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.950 
kind of useful but you don't really
don't<00:06:52.370> run<00:06:52.580> into<00:06:52.729> parallel<00:06:53.120> such<00:06:53.419> as<00:06:53.569> much<00:06:53.750> as

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
don't run into parallel such as much as

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.480 
don't run into parallel such as much as
poisoning<00:06:54.529> in<00:06:54.680> these<00:06:54.800> early<00:06:54.979> parts<00:06:55.310> of<00:06:55.370> the

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
poisoning in these early parts of the

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.129 
poisoning in these early parts of the
game<00:06:55.699> so<00:06:56.300> poisoning<00:06:56.810> it<00:06:56.870> would<00:06:56.990> have<00:06:57.080> been

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 
game so poisoning it would have been

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:58.420 
game so poisoning it would have been
more<00:06:57.319> useful<00:06:57.529> but<00:06:57.830> I<00:06:57.860> actually<00:06:58.009> get<00:06:58.279> to<00:06:58.339> use

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
more useful but I actually get to use

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.599 
more useful but I actually get to use
that<00:06:58.550> paralyzed<00:06:59.389> heal
