00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.240 
here's a fun little reading game
practicing<00:00:03.120> that<00:00:03.300> with<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.780> earth<00:00:03.959> sounds<00:00:04.440> so

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
practicing that with the earth sounds so

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.110 
practicing that with the earth sounds so
I<00:00:05.310> made<00:00:05.490> some<00:00:05.700> little<00:00:06.980> nest<00:00:07.980> shapes<00:00:08.309> from<00:00:08.760> foam

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
I made some little nest shapes from foam

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.509 
I made some little nest shapes from foam
paper<00:00:09.590> just<00:00:10.590> drew<00:00:10.889> little<00:00:12.380> zig<00:00:13.380> zag<00:00:13.559> lines<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
paper just drew little zig zag lines and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.400 
paper just drew little zig zag lines and
wrote<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.089> earth<00:00:15.240> sound<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.080> three

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
wrote the earth sound so we have three

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.099 
wrote the earth sound so we have three
nests<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.949> three<00:00:17.250> hour<00:00:17.430> sounds<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.930> then<00:00:19.080> I

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
nests for a three hour sounds and then I

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.609 
nests for a three hour sounds and then I
made<00:00:19.380> some<00:00:19.560> little<00:00:19.680> eggs<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:21.470> printed<00:00:22.470> these

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
made some little eggs I printed these

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.830 
made some little eggs I printed these
out<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.859> giggle<00:00:23.369> some<00:00:23.550> pictures<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.330> wanted

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
out I giggle some pictures that I wanted

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.009 
out I giggle some pictures that I wanted
that<00:00:24.990> had<00:00:25.140> different<00:00:25.560> first<00:00:25.710> sounds<00:00:26.449> so<00:00:27.449> this

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
that had different first sounds so this

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.599 
that had different first sounds so this
is<00:00:28.199> something<00:00:28.380> very<00:00:28.619> simple<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.429> I've

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
is something very simple you can do I've

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.440 
is something very simple you can do I've
also<00:00:29.789> added<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:32.189> PDF<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> want<00:00:33.360> to

little<00:00:36.870> eggs<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.620> pictures<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.489> her<00:00:38.790> words

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
little eggs have pictures of her words

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.580 
little eggs have pictures of her words
so<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.710> example<00:00:41.190> he'll<00:00:41.640> say<00:00:41.850> hammer<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.840> then

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
so for example he'll say hammer and then

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.690 
so for example he'll say hammer and then
you'll<00:00:43.829> find<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.399> which<00:00:44.879> sound<00:00:46.430> this<00:00:47.430> word

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you'll find out which sound this word

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.990 
you'll find out which sound this word
has<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.390> he<00:00:49.379> puts<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.820> first

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
has and he puts it in so for the first

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
has and he puts it in so for the first
few<00:00:51.300> goes<00:00:51.539> he<00:00:51.809> got<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> few<00:00:52.320> wrong<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.370> would

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
few goes he got a few wrong and it would

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090 
few goes he got a few wrong and it would
be<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> guessing<00:00:54.090> game<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:55.110> after<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.500> while<00:00:55.710> he

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
be a guessing game but after a while he

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.790 
be a guessing game but after a while he
learned<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.570> well<00:00:59.180> third<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
learned them very well third so that's a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.650 
learned them very well third so that's a
good<00:01:01.980> way<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> learn<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.670> even<00:01:02.910> though<00:01:03.059> he

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
good way to learn it even though he

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.870 
good way to learn it even though he
doesn't<00:01:03.840> know<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.439> first<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.189> makes<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
doesn't know them at first it makes it a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.359 
doesn't know them at first it makes it a
fun<00:01:06.090> game<00:01:06.360> all<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.350> ones<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.740> he<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:08.070> wrong

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
fun game all the ones that he got wrong

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.429 
fun game all the ones that he got wrong
for<00:01:08.700> example<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:09.210> he'll<00:01:09.390> put<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> bird<00:01:09.960> here

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
for example if he'll put the bird here

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
he might try this one next and then I'll

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.210 
he might try this one next and then I'll
have<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.990> put<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.259> back<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:22.860> he<00:01:23.040> might
