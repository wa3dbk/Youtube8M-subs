00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
the thing about sculpting is I really do

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.030 
the thing about sculpting is I really do
believe<00:00:02.600> anybody<00:00:03.600> can<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:04.020> it<00:00:04.049> it's<00:00:04.319> not<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
believe anybody can do it it's not a

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.059 
believe anybody can do it it's not a
case<00:00:05.279> if<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.580> have<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> barn<00:00:06.270> sculptor

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
case if you have to be a barn sculptor

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.610 
case if you have to be a barn sculptor
as<00:00:08.069> long<00:00:08.400> as<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.639> reasonably<00:00:09.120> good<00:00:09.620> with

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
as long as you reasonably good with

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.070 
as long as you reasonably good with
judgment<00:00:11.099> that's<00:00:12.059> all<00:00:12.300> you'll<00:00:12.480> ever<00:00:12.570> need<00:00:12.719> you

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
judgment that's all you'll ever need you

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.200 
judgment that's all you'll ever need you
don't<00:00:13.230> even<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> good<00:00:13.980> drawer<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
don't even have to be a good drawer you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.720 
don't even have to be a good drawer you
know<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.599> isn't<00:00:16.289> art<00:00:16.830> isn't<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.250> thing<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.670> don't

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
know I isn't art isn't a thing I don't

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.160 
know I isn't art isn't a thing I don't
think<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.420> totally<00:00:18.810> different<00:00:18.869> thing

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
think it's a totally different thing

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.470 
think it's a totally different thing
altogether<00:00:19.699> there<00:00:20.699> was<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> time<00:00:21.150> when<00:00:21.449> I

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
altogether there was a time when I

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.439 
altogether there was a time when I
couldn't<00:00:21.779> scoped<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.760> I<00:00:23.760> wouldn't<00:00:24.330> even

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
couldn't scoped and I wouldn't even

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.480 
couldn't scoped and I wouldn't even
attempt<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.990> sculpt<00:00:25.410> because<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.070> didn't

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
attempt to sculpt because I just didn't

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.900 
attempt to sculpt because I just didn't
think<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.760> could<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.710> that's<00:00:28.710> why<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.250> me<00:00:29.760> get

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
think I could do it that's why I me get

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.170 
think I could do it that's why I me get
to<00:00:30.029> let<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.359> guys<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.380> how<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.460> how

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
to let you guys see how I do it how

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
to let you guys see how I do it how
simple<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:34.320> there's<00:00:34.829> nothing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
simple it is really there's nothing

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.030 
simple it is really there's nothing
special<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.149> doing<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.590> such

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
special in what I'm doing it's just such

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.940 
special in what I'm doing it's just such
a<00:00:38.070> simple<00:00:38.610> technique<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.559> long<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
a simple technique and as long as you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.729 
a simple technique and as long as you
keep<00:00:41.100> things<00:00:41.820> simple<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.020> take<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.440> bit<00:00:43.469> at

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
keep things simple and take it a bit at

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.470 
keep things simple and take it a bit at
a<00:00:43.800> time<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.930> won't<00:00:46.289> ever<00:00:47.010> backfire<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.360> bad

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
a time it won't ever backfire in a bad

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.100 
a time it won't ever backfire in a bad
way<00:00:52.699> this<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.879> where<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.329> forearm<00:00:54.809> elbow

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
way this is where the forearm elbow

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.080 
way this is where the forearm elbow
joint<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.059> only

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
joint is going to go so that's the only

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.700 
joint is going to go so that's the only
reason<00:00:57.390> they're<00:00:57.719> there<00:00:57.750> we're<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
reason they're there we're going to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
reason they're there we're going to
stick<00:00:58.980> them<00:00:59.190> very<00:00:59.430> basically<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> figure

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
stick them very basically to the figure

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.140 
stick them very basically to the figure
you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> figure<00:01:02.280> has<00:01:02.430> actually<00:01:02.850> been

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.280 

undressed<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> certain<00:01:06.720> degree<00:01:06.869> with

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
undressed to a certain degree with

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.330 
undressed to a certain degree with
removed<00:01:07.619> his<00:01:07.770> trousers<00:01:08.250> we've<00:01:09.979> removed<00:01:10.979> its

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
removed his trousers we've removed its

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.890 
removed his trousers we've removed its
mustache<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.619> haven't<00:01:13.799> even<00:01:13.950> put<00:01:14.280> his

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
mustache and we haven't even put his

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.719 
mustache and we haven't even put his
shoes<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.140> yet<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.430> we've

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
shoes on yet this is because we've

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.359 
shoes on yet this is because we've
reduced<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.299> mass<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:19.080> order<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> reese<00:01:20.130> cup

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
reduced the mass in order to reese cup

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.920 
reduced the mass in order to reese cup
the<00:01:20.520> new<00:01:20.640> mass<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.270> very<00:01:21.450> important

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the new mass that's a very important

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870 
the new mass that's a very important
thing<00:01:22.140> otherwise<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.159> will<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.280> look<00:01:23.549> way

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
thing otherwise it will just look way

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.870 
thing otherwise it will just look way
too<00:01:23.909> bulky<00:01:25.100> I've<00:01:26.100> got<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> good<00:01:26.520> old<00:01:26.670> green

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
too bulky I've got a good old green

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.580 
too bulky I've got a good old green
stuff<00:01:27.090> mixed<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.570> there<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.290> I've

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
stuff mixed up there as you can see I've

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.270 
stuff mixed up there as you can see I've
already<00:01:28.799> started<00:01:29.130> filling<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.280> going

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
already started filling it this is going

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
already started filling it this is going
to<00:01:32.430> eliminate<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.270> those<00:01:33.450> gaps<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.079> we're

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
to eliminate all those gaps and we're

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.630 
to eliminate all those gaps and we're
actually<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> sculpt<00:01:35.009> some<00:01:35.460> new

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
actually going to sculpt some new

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.510 
actually going to sculpt some new
anatomy<00:01:35.880> onto<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.040> technique<00:01:38.369> for

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
anatomy onto this so the technique for

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.600 
anatomy onto this so the technique for
actually<00:01:38.820> filling<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> gaps<00:01:40.490> is<00:01:43.610> just

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
actually filling the gaps is just

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.780 
actually filling the gaps is just
squashing<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.299> sausage<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.869> green<00:01:46.110> stuff<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
squashing a sausage of green stuff the

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
squashing a sausage of green stuff the
gaps<00:01:47.790> are<00:01:48.000> quite<00:01:48.180> big<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.020> just

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
gaps are quite big on this but just

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.530 
gaps are quite big on this but just
scrape<00:01:49.619> off<00:01:49.829> any<00:01:49.950> excess<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> nail<00:01:50.820> don't

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
scrape off any excess with a nail don't

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.800 
scrape off any excess with a nail don't
worry<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.049> goes<00:01:52.290> into<00:01:52.560> or<00:01:53.280> onto<00:01:53.810> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
worry if it goes into or onto the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
worry if it goes into or onto the
surrounding<00:01:55.350> areas<00:01:55.710> at<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.880> won't<00:01:57.090> affect

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
surrounding areas at all it won't affect

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.670 
surrounding areas at all it won't affect
it<00:01:59.570> these<00:02:00.570> are<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> clay<00:02:00.930> shapers<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it these are the clay shapers if you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.370 
it these are the clay shapers if you
remember<00:02:02.659> we're<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.960> use<00:02:04.200> this

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
remember we're just going to use this

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.749 
remember we're just going to use this
flat<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.520> tease<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.119> into<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> joint<00:02:07.759> all

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
flat one to tease it into the joint all

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.340 
flat one to tease it into the joint all
the<00:02:09.149> way<00:02:09.239> up

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
the way up

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:20.470 
the way up
and<00:02:12.350> again<00:02:12.830> under<00:02:13.130> there<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.240> going<00:02:20.360> to

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
and again under there this is going to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.900 
and again under there this is going to
make<00:02:20.600> sure<00:02:21.190> like<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.280> said<00:02:22.430> before<00:02:22.580> that

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
make sure like I said before that

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.210 
make sure like I said before that
there's<00:02:23.120> no<00:02:23.240> gaps<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.840> on<00:02:24.530> top<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.010> we

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
there's no gaps and on top of this we

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.520 
there's no gaps and on top of this we
can<00:02:25.370> now<00:02:25.550> sculpt<00:02:25.970> some<00:02:26.210> new<00:02:26.360> anatomy<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:27.440> we

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
can now sculpt some new anatomy so we

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.260 
can now sculpt some new anatomy so we
can<00:02:27.680> actually<00:02:27.740> start<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.310> form<00:02:28.610> an<00:02:28.730> armpit<00:02:29.000> in

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
can actually start to form an armpit in

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.660 
can actually start to form an armpit in
there<00:02:29.510> too<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:30.620> I'm<00:02:30.920> just<00:02:31.190> going<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.370> squash

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
there too so I'm just going to squash

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.130 
there too so I'm just going to squash
this<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.080> pointed<00:02:33.560> one<00:02:35.140> just

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
this this is the the pointed one just

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.610 
this this is the the pointed one just
going<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.410> squash<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.830> in<00:02:38.470> we<00:02:39.470> could

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
going to squash that in we could

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.780 
going to squash that in we could
actually<00:02:39.770> start<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.310> form<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:42.550> bit<00:02:43.550> of<00:02:43.610> an

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
actually start to form a bit of an

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.020 
actually start to form a bit of an
armpit<00:02:44.060> in<00:02:44.360> there<00:02:45.190> now<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.700> simple

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
armpit in there now this is so simple

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.220 
armpit in there now this is so simple
you'll<00:02:47.360> want<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.570> do<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.750> all<00:02:47.900> over<00:02:47.930> your

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
you'll want to do it all over your

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.530 
you'll want to do it all over your
figure<00:02:48.580> because<00:02:49.580> i<00:02:49.670> know<00:02:49.790> i<00:02:49.820> did<00:02:49.970> when<00:02:50.270> i<00:02:50.330> first

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
figure because i know i did when i first

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.660 
figure because i know i did when i first
discovered<00:02:50.750> out<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.170> do<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:57.370> because<00:02:58.370> it's

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
discovered out to do it because it's

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.420 
discovered out to do it because it's
quite<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:58.970> short<00:02:59.330> length<00:03:00.010> pick<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.130> up<00:03:01.220> with<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
quite a short length pick it up with the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.310 
quite a short length pick it up with the
pointy<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:03.850> lay<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:04.970> onto<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.420> belly<00:03:08.110> pinch<00:03:09.110> it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
pointy to lay it onto the belly pinch it

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.729 
pointy to lay it onto the belly pinch it
at<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.500> central<00:03:09.920> point<00:03:10.900> bring<00:03:11.900> one<00:03:12.170> side<00:03:12.500> up

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
at the central point bring one side up

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:22.890 
at the central point bring one side up
and<00:03:13.660> bring<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.810> other<00:03:14.900> side<00:03:15.230> up

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.600 

so<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.769> end<00:03:23.890> up<00:03:23.980> with<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.159> U<00:03:24.370> shape<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:27.220> again

top again on the other side once all
those<00:03:51.819> areas<00:03:52.239> are<00:03:52.269> filled<00:03:52.569> in<00:03:53.159> I'm<00:03:54.159> now<00:03:54.340> going

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
those areas are filled in I'm now going

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.970 
those areas are filled in I'm now going
to<00:03:54.549> start<00:03:54.819> smoothing<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.620> now<00:03:56.620> it's<00:03:56.769> going<00:03:56.889> to

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
to start smoothing it now it's going to

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.449 
to start smoothing it now it's going to
wet<00:03:57.099> the<00:03:57.220> tool<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:58.200> should<00:03:59.200> mention<00:03:59.349> that<00:03:59.620> for

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
wet the tool I should mention that for

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.399 
wet the tool I should mention that for
lubricating<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.060> tool<00:04:01.329> I<00:04:01.599> always<00:04:01.810> just<00:04:02.139> use

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
lubricating the tool I always just use

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.550 
lubricating the tool I always just use
spit<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:04.060> may<00:04:04.329> not<00:04:04.450> sound<00:04:04.690> very<00:04:04.840> nice<00:04:05.200> but<00:04:05.470> it

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
spit it may not sound very nice but it

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.170 
spit it may not sound very nice but it
is<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.709> cheap<00:04:06.040> commodity<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.790> it's<00:04:06.909> probably

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
is a cheap commodity and it's probably

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.849 
is a cheap commodity and it's probably
about<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.540> best<00:04:07.569> lubricant<00:04:08.319> I've<00:04:08.470> ever<00:04:08.590> found

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
about the best lubricant I've ever found

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.390 
about the best lubricant I've ever found
you<00:04:09.790> can<00:04:10.000> actually<00:04:10.150> buy<00:04:11.400> biodegradable

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
you can actually buy biodegradable

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.580 
you can actually buy biodegradable
lubricants<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.269> I've<00:04:13.780> even<00:04:13.870> heard<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.290> people

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
lubricants and I've even heard of people

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.740 
lubricants and I've even heard of people
here<00:04:14.739> using<00:04:15.280> earwax<00:04:15.609> really<00:04:16.510> wouldn't

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
here using earwax really wouldn't

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.830 
here using earwax really wouldn't
recommend<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:18.579> I<00:04:18.609> always<00:04:19.000> find<00:04:19.209> spit<00:04:19.660> is

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
recommend that so I always find spit is

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.439 
recommend that so I always find spit is
a<00:04:20.310> very<00:04:21.310> good<00:04:21.370> option<00:04:21.880> at<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.210> end<00:04:22.330> of<00:04:22.389> the

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
a very good option at the end of the

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.460 
a very good option at the end of the
days<00:04:22.570> on<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:22.990> that's<00:04:23.110> going<00:04:23.349> to<00:04:23.410> be

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
days on the you that's going to be

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.540 
days on the you that's going to be
touching<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.830> model<00:04:26.010> keep<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.130> stroking

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
touching the model keep you stroking

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.860 
touching the model keep you stroking
motions<00:04:27.940> with<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.300> stuff<00:04:28.860> along<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.870> around

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
motions with this stuff along and around

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.170 
motions with this stuff along and around
any<00:04:32.169> contours<00:04:32.740> keep<00:04:33.099> it<00:04:33.250> all<00:04:33.370> quite<00:04:33.699> fluid

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
any contours keep it all quite fluid

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.589 
any contours keep it all quite fluid
that<00:04:35.110> way<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.380> won't<00:04:35.500> cause<00:04:35.800> any<00:04:35.830> problems

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
that way it won't cause any problems

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.089 
that way it won't cause any problems
with<00:04:37.599> brush<00:04:37.900> streets<00:04:38.260> or<00:04:38.560> anything<00:04:38.889> like<00:04:38.919> that

with brush streets or anything like that

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.129 
with brush streets or anything like that
and<00:04:39.729> once<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.090> give<00:04:40.240> it<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.419> good<00:04:40.570> spray<00:04:40.930> with

going to make some more of them veins

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.370 
going to make some more of them veins

for the forearm and going to roll out

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.409 
for the forearm and going to roll out
some<00:04:53.590> more<00:04:53.770> green<00:04:54.010> stuff<00:04:57.210> roughly<00:04:58.210> about<00:04:58.300> the

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
some more green stuff roughly about the

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:08.090 
some more green stuff roughly about the
same<00:04:58.539> size<00:04:58.960> for<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.320> main<00:04:59.560> vein<00:04:59.770> this<00:05:00.010> time

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.960 

I<00:05:08.660> set<00:05:09.660> that<00:05:09.690> at<00:05:09.960> one<00:05:10.170> point<00:05:10.580> make<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.730> quite

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
I set that at one point make it quite

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.590 
I set that at one point make it quite
squiggly<00:05:12.800> just<00:05:13.800> point<00:05:14.400> in<00:05:14.610> each<00:05:15.060> time<00:05:15.450> you

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
squiggly just point in each time you

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.930 
squiggly just point in each time you
make<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.750> curve<00:05:16.160> point<00:05:17.160> in<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.490> make<00:05:17.610> sure<00:05:17.640> it

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
make a curve point in and make sure it

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.150 
make a curve point in and make sure it
sets<00:05:18.210> down<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:21.150> this<00:05:21.600> time<00:05:21.980> we're<00:05:22.980> going<00:05:23.100> to

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
sets down and this time we're going to

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.480 
sets down and this time we're going to
have<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:24.440> second<00:05:25.440> small<00:05:26.340> vein<00:05:28.370> branching<00:05:29.370> off

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
have a second small vein branching off

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:44.620 
have a second small vein branching off
to<00:05:30.090> one<00:05:30.240> side<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.720> it<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:38.310> again

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.990 

quite<00:05:45.260> curly<00:05:45.740> just<00:05:46.040> serves<00:05:46.310> to<00:05:46.490> make<00:05:46.760> him<00:05:46.970> look

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
quite curly just serves to make him look

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.570 
quite curly just serves to make him look
really<00:05:47.780> pumped<00:05:48.170> up<00:05:48.320> and<00:05:48.560> and<00:05:48.770> full<00:05:49.550> of
