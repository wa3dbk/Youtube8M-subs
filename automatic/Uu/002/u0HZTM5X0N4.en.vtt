00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
little rachie clip joints and I could go

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.580 
little rachie clip joints and I could go
in<00:05:27.280> and<00:05:27.670> out<00:05:27.910> like<00:05:28.450> Sarah<00:05:29.880> his<00:05:30.880> bicep<00:05:31.570> can<00:05:32.380> move

think<00:05:40.210> it's<00:05:40.300> a<00:05:40.360> problem<00:05:40.510> and<00:05:41.110> his<00:05:41.680> wrists<00:05:42.100> can

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
think it's a problem and his wrists can

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.450 
think it's a problem and his wrists can
rotate<00:05:43.420> and<00:05:44.170> for<00:05:44.530> his<00:05:44.770> lower<00:05:44.950> part<00:05:45.040> of<00:05:45.340> his

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.820 
rotate and for his lower part of his
body<00:05:45.520> no<00:05:46.450> waste<00:05:46.750> articulation<00:05:47.500> that's<00:05:47.710> a

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.140 
body no waste articulation that's a
bummer<00:05:48.280> but<00:05:48.820> his<00:05:49.030> legs<00:05:49.270> do<00:05:49.480> go<00:05:49.830> forward<00:05:50.830> and

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
bummer but his legs do go forward and

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.190 
bummer but his legs do go forward and
back<00:05:52.320> in<00:05:53.320> and<00:05:53.740> out<00:05:53.980> not<00:05:54.460> as<00:05:54.610> far<00:05:54.990> turn<00:05:55.990> at<00:05:56.110> the
