there'd be quite a hassle with that
scenario<00:01:47.840> what<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.259> I'm<00:01:49.649> sure<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.009> has

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
scenario what if and I'm sure this has

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.460 
scenario what if and I'm sure this has
happened<00:01:50.520> before<00:01:50.640> both<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> finder<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.320> the

happened before both the finder and the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.710 
happened before both the finder and the

landowner want the ring or what if the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.970 
landowner want the ring or what if the
detector<00:01:55.290> response<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.410 
and the landowner wants the value of the
