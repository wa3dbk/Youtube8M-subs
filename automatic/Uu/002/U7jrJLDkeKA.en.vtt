 battery charged to more than 50% and 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.670
 remember that you are going to lose all 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.550
 memory that you have except the things 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.500
 that you have saved in the sd card 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.040
 such as music the images 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.329
 etc. otherwise it is worth contacts 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.480
 have you saved in the memory of 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.140
 phone notes or applications are going to 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.219
 erase well, well, to begin with 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.789
 you have to put the zip file in the 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:59.390
 memory that is in the root of the card 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.770
 sd vale I will leave the download link in 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.719
 the description of the video and good 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.600
 you just have to copy and paste to 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.130
 the root of sd memory well for 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.280
 start let's go to the club 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.689
 recovery mode by pressing the power key 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.689
 and home at the same time 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.440
 As you can see we are already in the cloud work 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.040
 recovery then what we have to 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.140
 are these steps to start we're going 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.660
 to make a white datafactory ricet vale 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.800
 we handle ourselves with the volume keys 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:52.280
 let's go to white datafactory ricet click 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.440
 in home and we go to where it says yes 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.390
 from lete to the user data then it is already 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.320
 endowed white complete now we are going to 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.670
 go where it says in white cache partition 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.670
 repartition while h 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.879
 katie white complete and now we're going to 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.879
 go here where it says warn 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.730
 and let's go to this white dalit option 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.730
 cache 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.170
 and jesse white dalvik h 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.990
 alright now let's go back with the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.560
 key back and we will go where 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.270
 says install fit forecast 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.330
 we go to the first section that is 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.160
 your icann citations 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:50.910
 and we look for the rice in this case it would be 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.910
 sg2 in its version 9 we look for it 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.400
 here we have it as you can see there 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:10.410
 samsung galaxy s2 version 9.5 worth it 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.410
 we give the home button and yesistas 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.820
 and we will be installing the rÃºa 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.820
 OK 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.290
 this process will take a little bit right now 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.200
 here they are assembling the data from 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.200
 forgive system by formatting the system 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.510
 and good 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.360
 I am not responsible for this 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.909
 of any failure that you have now 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.069
 I guarantee that if you do it following 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:01.240
 my steps will go perfectly 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:05.970
 you are not going to have any kind of problem 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.970
 now we see that it is formatting data 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.730
 get the cachi 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.480
 for the star that is extracting 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.480
 the zip point file 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.730
 and well this phrase 'not the kernel 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.449
 and it's going to end 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.360
 and it has already finished as you see puts install 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.699
 from the heart complete but 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.689
 then now we are going to give the key 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.179
 back 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.560
 and we're going to go here to the first 

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:17.070
 action that I did the system reboot 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.070
 we give him 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.880
 we wait for us to understand 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.880
 phone 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.730
 as you can see we get a little blue tito there 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.050
 in the corner that tells us that we have 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.550
 installed a cooked rom 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.910
 in this case this rock is based on 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:45.180
 gingerbread 2.3 points 6 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:49.670
 although it also has a small style 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.670
 of skin sandwich the little touch 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:05.110
 as you see this would be the butano nation of 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:07.870
 the rom samsung galaxy s2 version 9 voucher 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.610
 I remind you that in this network the led or 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.030
 be the leds of the capacitive buttons 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.960
 we light it brings to roo 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:20.010
 deactivated to save energy not 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.010
 you can activate them 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.290
 in no problem 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:32.430
 I'll leave a link in the description of 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.290
 a video review video development 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.930
 that you can find the video also in 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.580
 my channel is worth it but I will leave the link 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.060

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.050
 easy 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.050
 find him 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.100
 always the first start takes longer 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.580
 because he's riding the data of the 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:58.270
 system with which it is normal that late 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:02.780
 do not worry so much 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:06.170
 completely normal, well, since 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.080
 has started but as you can see we 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:11.379
 asks 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:14.159
 right now it is in English it is worth 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:14.159
 change the language 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.620
 and that is simply times as you see 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:24.330
 we have the rom 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:27.240
