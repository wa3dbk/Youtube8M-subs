00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
background of this commentary but really

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.269 
background of this commentary but really
it<00:00:21.600> didn't<00:00:21.869> take<00:00:22.020> me<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.230> long<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:23.070> guess

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
it didn't take me that long I guess

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.429 
it didn't take me that long I guess
because<00:00:23.640> when<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> was<00:00:24.660> getting<00:00:24.810> all<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> guns

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
because when I was getting all the guns

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.980 
because when I was getting all the guns
diamond<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.609> quotes<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.240> was<00:00:27.539> only<00:00:27.689> getting

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
diamond in quotes I was only getting

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.689 
diamond in quotes I was only getting
them<00:00:28.170> gold<00:00:28.380> because<00:00:28.740> when<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:28.949> was<00:00:29.189> working<00:00:29.340> for

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
them gold because when I was working for

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.669 
them gold because when I was working for
it<00:00:29.849> there<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.269> no<00:00:30.449> diamond<00:00:30.779> camo<00:00:30.990> so

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
it there was no diamond camo so

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.380 
it there was no diamond camo so
basically<00:00:32.070> whenever<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.640> was<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> new<00:00:32.940> gun<00:00:33.149> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
basically whenever there was a new gun I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.569 
basically whenever there was a new gun I
just<00:00:33.719> spent<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.260> half<00:00:34.739> hour<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.160> 45<00:00:35.370> minutes

and I didn't even know there was a ?
until<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> went<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
until I went on to and all just just to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.459 
until I went on to and all just just to
see<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:53.940> if<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.360> hadn't<00:00:54.750> had<00:00:55.289> all

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
see what it was like if I hadn't had all

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.189 
see what it was like if I hadn't had all
the<00:00:55.590> guns<00:00:55.770> gold<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.780> brace

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the guns gold now I just like to brace

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.110 
the guns gold now I just like to brace
we<00:00:58.379> break<00:00:58.620> down<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.100> four<00:00:59.309> classes<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
we break down the four classes that you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
we break down the four classes that you
can<00:01:00.270> get<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:00.809> give<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> tips<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.530> them

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
can get and like give you tips for them

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
can get and like give you tips for them
and<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.550> maps<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:02.940> best<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and like what maps are best for what I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.770 
and like what maps are best for what I
guess<00:01:04.650> basically<00:01:05.309> how<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> get<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.299> fast<00:01:06.540> as

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
guess basically how to get it as fast as

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.649 
guess basically how to get it as fast as
possible<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.650> other<00:01:08.250> than<00:01:08.430> don't<00:01:08.880> die<00:01:09.150> there

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
possible but other than don't die there

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
possible but other than don't die there
really<00:01:09.840> isn't<00:01:10.140> much<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.740> help<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
really isn't much that can help you a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.570 
really isn't much that can help you a
lot<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:12.540> there<00:01:12.750> are<00:01:12.920> seven<00:01:13.920> assault<00:01:14.220> rifles

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
lot now there are seven assault rifles

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.510 
lot now there are seven assault rifles
so<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.880> means<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.299> will<00:01:15.420> need<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:16.520> 1400

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
so that means you will need to get 1400

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.940 
so that means you will need to get 1400
kills<00:01:17.810> which<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.020> seems<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> lot<00:01:19.650> on

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
kills which that seems like a lot on

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.160 
kills which that seems like a lot on
paper<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> did<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.840> spread

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
paper but when I did it was so spread

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.990 
paper but when I did it was so spread
out<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.830> didn't<00:01:23.040> feel<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.640> all<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
out that it didn't feel like it at all I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.760 
out that it didn't feel like it at all I
would<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> say<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> hardest<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.619> is

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
would have to say the hardest to get is

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.950 
would have to say the hardest to get is
the<00:01:25.799> OGG<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:27.299> because<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> scope

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
gonna just gun you down really fast the
easiest<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.670> definitely<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> HK<00:01:33.600> because<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
easiest was definitely the HK because it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.310 
easiest was definitely the HK because it
was<00:01:34.049> competing<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.680> pretty<00:01:34.950> much<00:01:35.040> any<00:01:35.280> map<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
was competing on pretty much any map and

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.069 
was competing on pretty much any map and
I<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.950> say<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:38.970> take<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.630> took<00:01:39.750> me

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
I would say it would take it took me

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.429 
I would say it would take it took me
about<00:01:40.590> 10<00:01:41.159> games<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.610> each<00:01:41.880> gun<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.200> would

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
about 10 games for each gun so I would

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.020 
about 10 games for each gun so I would
say<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.770> you're<00:01:43.950> getting<00:01:44.280> them<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.549> 20<00:01:44.880> games

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
say if you're getting them in 20 games

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.410 
say if you're getting them in 20 games
you<00:01:45.479> should<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.840> pretty<00:01:46.590> good<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.119> mean

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you should be pretty good because I mean

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.870 
you should be pretty good because I mean
you're<00:01:48.840> never<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.619> everyone<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.340> drop<00:01:50.640> like

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you're never not everyone can drop like

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.330 
you're never not everyone can drop like
27<00:01:51.479> kills<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.930> game<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.220> not

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
27 kills in a game it's just it's not

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.090 
27 kills in a game it's just it's not
possible<00:01:53.600> now<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> SMGs<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.500> definitely

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
possible now the SMGs are definitely

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.740 
possible now the SMGs are definitely
easier<00:01:56.490> since<00:01:56.850> there's<00:01:57.090> only<00:01:57.119> five<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.509> them

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
easier since there's only five of them

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.289 
easier since there's only five of them
you<00:01:58.020> only<00:01:58.170> need<00:01:58.350> 1000<00:01:59.070> kills<00:01:59.250> how<00:01:59.880> did<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.119> say

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you only need 1000 kills how did I say

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.469 
you only need 1000 kills how did I say
the<00:02:00.479> hardest<00:02:00.899> was<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> Mac<00:02:01.290> 11<00:02:01.770> because<00:02:02.549> well

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the hardest was the Mac 11 because well

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.990 
the hardest was the Mac 11 because well
it's<00:02:03.840> basically<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> Glock<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
it's basically like a Glock and then the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.389 
it's basically like a Glock and then the
easiest<00:02:06.450> was<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> p90<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.860> people<00:02:08.280> think

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
easiest was the p90 because people think

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.850 
easiest was the p90 because people think
it's<00:02:08.580> Opie<00:02:08.940> personally<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.869> don't<00:02:10.020> find<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.500> ope

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
it's Opie personally I don't find it ope

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.860 
it's Opie personally I don't find it ope
it's<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.270> good<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.690> more

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it's just it's just good in more

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.950 
it's just it's just good in more
situations<00:02:13.110> than<00:02:13.680> not

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
situations than not

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.050 
situations than not
it<00:02:14.050> but<00:02:14.740> they're<00:02:15.010> really<00:02:15.280> working<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.670> nerfing

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
it but they're really working on nerfing

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.130 
it but they're really working on nerfing
that<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:16.660> they've<00:02:16.750> done<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.930> good<00:02:17.080> job

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
that and I think they've done a good job

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.850 
that and I think they've done a good job
thus<00:02:17.860> far<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.970> took<00:02:19.180> me<00:02:19.390> about<00:02:19.660> nine<00:02:20.110> games<00:02:20.140> for

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
thus far it took me about nine games for

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.320 
thus far it took me about nine games for
each<00:02:20.890> with<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> submachine<00:02:21.640> guns<00:02:22.060> because<00:02:22.180> I

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
each with a submachine guns because I

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.590 
each with a submachine guns because I
was<00:02:22.480> getting<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:23.020> ton<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.500> kills<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.390> would

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
was getting a ton of kills so I would

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.370 
was getting a ton of kills so I would
guess<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:27.540> would<00:02:28.540> say<00:02:28.690> it's<00:02:28.810> again<00:02:29.230> if

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
guess if you I would say it's again if

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.830 
guess if you I would say it's again if
you<00:02:29.470> going<00:02:29.770> for<00:02:30.160> 20<00:02:30.490> games<00:02:30.760> per<00:02:31.210> gun<00:02:31.450> that

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
you going for 20 games per gun that

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.960 
you going for 20 games per gun that
should<00:02:32.020> be<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.170> good<00:02:32.350> pace<00:02:32.620> now<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.640> one<00:02:33.880> that

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
should be a good pace now the one that

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.730 
should be a good pace now the one that
you're<00:02:34.060> gonna<00:02:34.210> have<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.540> grind<00:02:34.870> out<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.260> lot<00:02:35.560> is

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
you're gonna have to grind out a lot is

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.460 
you're gonna have to grind out a lot is
the<00:02:35.770> snipers<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:37.060> since<00:02:37.900> there's<00:02:38.110> only<00:02:38.140> four

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
the snipers that since there's only four

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.870 
the snipers that since there's only four
guns<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.860> only<00:02:39.010> need<00:02:39.190> eight<00:02:39.340> hundred<00:02:39.670> kills

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
guns you only need eight hundred kills

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.010 
guns you only need eight hundred kills
but<00:02:40.270> 400<00:02:40.960> of<00:02:41.410> those<00:02:41.500> kills<00:02:41.860> are<00:02:42.190> like<00:02:42.370> Oh<00:02:43.020> hair

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
but 400 of those kills are like Oh hair

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.590 
but 400 of those kills are like Oh hair
so<00:02:44.410> painful<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> gate<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.850> dragunov<00:02:46.360> and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
so painful the gate the dragunov and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.900 
so painful the gate the dragunov and
attack<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.380> well<00:02:48.130> especially<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.610> TAC<00:02:48.880> I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
attack this well especially the TAC I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.910 
attack this well especially the TAC I
mean<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.240> dragunov<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:50.020> can<00:02:50.200> get<00:02:50.590> pretty

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
mean the dragunov you can get pretty

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.610 
mean the dragunov you can get pretty
good<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.730> TAC<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.270> just<00:02:52.540> it's<00:02:53.350> just<00:02:53.440> a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
good but the TAC is just it's just a

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.140 
good but the TAC is just it's just a
grind<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.130> just<00:02:54.280> got<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.520> keep<00:02:54.640> working<00:02:54.790> at<00:02:55.120> it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
grind you just got to keep working at it

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.900 
grind you just got to keep working at it
that's<00:02:55.750> all<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.930> can<00:02:56.080> tell<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.850> now<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
that's all I can tell you now the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.760 
that's all I can tell you now the
shotguns<00:02:58.360> also<00:02:58.750> have<00:02:58.930> four<00:02:59.230> but<00:02:59.530> they're<00:02:59.740> a

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
shotguns also have four but they're a

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.620 
shotguns also have four but they're a
little<00:03:00.100> bit<00:03:00.340> easier<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.210> can't<00:03:01.450> use

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
little bit easier you just can't use

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.110 
little bit easier you just can't use
them<00:03:01.810> on<00:03:01.930> certain<00:03:02.320> maps<00:03:02.500> because<00:03:02.830> like<00:03:03.820> say

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
them on certain maps because like say

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.320 
them on certain maps because like say
you're<00:03:04.270> using<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.870> on<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:06.220> giant<00:03:06.670> wide<00:03:07.000> open

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
you're using it on that giant wide open

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.150 
you're using it on that giant wide open
desert<00:03:07.510> map<00:03:07.840> you're<00:03:08.500> not<00:03:08.620> gonna<00:03:08.740> kill<00:03:08.950> anyone

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
desert map you're not gonna kill anyone

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.820 
desert map you're not gonna kill anyone
in<00:03:09.400> there<00:03:09.580> don't<00:03:10.030> let's<00:03:10.390> be<00:03:10.450> honest<00:03:10.840> here<00:03:11.020> if

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
in there don't let's be honest here if

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.740 
in there don't let's be honest here if
there's<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.100> sniper<00:03:12.280> in<00:03:12.490> that<00:03:12.700> window<00:03:13.000> you're

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
there's a sniper in that window you're

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.510 
there's a sniper in that window you're
not<00:03:13.960> gonna<00:03:14.110> even<00:03:14.320> make<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> building

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
not gonna even make it to the building

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.540 
not gonna even make it to the building
for<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.480> shotguns<00:03:16.960> it<00:03:17.230> was<00:03:17.410> hardest<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.400> me

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
for the shotguns it was hardest for me

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.910 
for the shotguns it was hardest for me
with<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.820> aa-12<00:03:19.450> solely<00:03:19.990> because<00:03:20.260> i<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:22.600> i

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
with the aa-12 solely because i just i

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.190 
with the aa-12 solely because i just i
don't<00:03:23.920> i<00:03:24.130> don't<00:03:24.190> know<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.420> there

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
don't i don't know it's just there

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.960 
don't i don't know it's just there
wasn't<00:03:26.530> very<00:03:26.560> much<00:03:26.800> range<00:03:27.100> on<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.880> was

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
wasn't very much range on it and it was

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.850 
wasn't very much range on it and it was
just<00:03:28.120> really<00:03:28.210> hard<00:03:28.660> even<00:03:29.380> though<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.680> was

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
just really hard even though it was

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.400 
just really hard even though it was
fully<00:03:30.130> auto<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.670> whatnot<00:03:30.970> i<00:03:31.210> guess<00:03:32.080> most

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
fully auto and whatnot i guess most

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.320 
fully auto and whatnot i guess most
people<00:03:32.560> will<00:03:32.830> probably<00:03:33.160> save<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.460> r870<00:03:34.150> is

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
people will probably save the r870 is

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.780 
people will probably save the r870 is
the<00:03:34.480> hardest<00:03:34.780> but<00:03:35.200> i'm<00:03:36.160> still<00:03:36.310> going<00:03:36.490> with<00:03:36.700> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
the hardest but i'm still going with the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.850 
the hardest but i'm still going with the
aa-12<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.660> easiest<00:03:38.110> was<00:03:38.260> definitely<00:03:38.740> the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
aa-12 the easiest was definitely the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.830 
aa-12 the easiest was definitely the
striker<00:03:39.130> not<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.730> Vanilli<00:03:40.180> I'm<00:03:40.480> just<00:03:40.660> glad

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
striker not the Vanilli I'm just glad

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.390 
striker not the Vanilli I'm just glad
that<00:03:40.960> because<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.560> vanilla<00:03:41.860> is<00:03:42.040> in<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.250> game

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
that because the vanilla is in the game

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.640 
that because the vanilla is in the game
the<00:03:42.940> striker<00:03:43.300> is<00:03:43.720> kind<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:43.990> being<00:03:44.080> overlooked

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
the striker is kind of being overlooked

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.770 
the striker is kind of being overlooked
so<00:03:45.310> there's<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.700> whole<00:03:45.850> lot<00:03:46.060> less<00:03:46.240> strikers<00:03:46.630> out

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
so there's a whole lot less strikers out

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.020 
so there's a whole lot less strikers out
there<00:03:46.990> which<00:03:47.230> is<00:03:47.260> always<00:03:47.530> good<00:03:47.830> on<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.790> games

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
there which is always good on the games

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.730 
there which is always good on the games
that<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.240> did<00:03:49.540> use<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.750> shotguns<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.560> was

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
that I did use the shotguns I was

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.730 
that I did use the shotguns I was
getting<00:03:51.070> about<00:03:51.310> 20<00:03:52.270> ish<00:03:52.390> kills<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.110> if<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.710> was

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
getting about 20 ish kills so if it was

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.820 
getting about 20 ish kills so if it was
only<00:03:54.040> small<00:03:54.580> maps<00:03:54.850> for<00:03:55.180> about<00:03:55.570> 10<00:03:55.960> games<00:03:56.230> then

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
only small maps for about 10 games then

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.900 
only small maps for about 10 games then
I<00:03:57.340> would<00:03:57.820> have<00:03:57.990> the<00:03:58.990> gold<00:03:59.730> shotguns<00:04:00.730> and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
I would have the gold shotguns and

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.750 
I would have the gold shotguns and
