 meanwhile the devices 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.990

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.370

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.219
 it with this type 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.549

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.979
 the 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.399
 cullum and marieke built in 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.479

 short films also sinked 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.859

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.179
 but I never have one lower 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.179

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.809
 display rack 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:50.799

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.959

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.349

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.860
 koenders will therefore be promising 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.860

 vocal talent

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.009
 slightly faster ahead 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.509
