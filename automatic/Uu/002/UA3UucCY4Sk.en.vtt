00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.190
 little ones we have fought cleaned and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.449
 cut and we add them 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.449

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.980

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.580
 unless this is almost done 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.720
 we now incorporate the drained curry and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.720
 how I like it 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.159

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.570

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.570
 time 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.030

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.010

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.810
 broth 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.810
 we add to taste 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.960

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.840
