00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.399
 well here we are in another tutorial 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.609
 now from the call me baby song 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.820
 bait I do not know what things that are 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:13.780
 asking today so I'm going to do the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.250
 first part of this song d 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.250
 from the choir 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.720
 it's the stickiest 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.720
 and it goes more or less like this 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.750
 i 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.620
 Y 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.010
 good 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.740
 today I'm going to leave the video until here and 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.350
 then I'm going to do the melody and everything 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.820
 that with the verses and all those things 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 but right now I can not because it does not give me 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.399
 long time 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.020
 but let's go with this part that is 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.110
 simple in the left hand 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.500
 we simply mark the major chords and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500
 higher 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.690
 that is formed nation 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.690
 i 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.280
 and in the right hand the melody would be 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.420
 i 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.420
 Y 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.380
 Y 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.140
 but more or less basically that we go 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.140
 do it with both slow hands 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.229
 and 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.210
 Y 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.210
 Y 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.640
 and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.229
 i 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.680
 i 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.969
 well basically it's 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.230
 and if in the left hand they want 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.170
 put him 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.670
 the same all the groupers with harmonics 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.750
 as I say 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.750
 that would sound something like that 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.439
 Y 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.760
 ah 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.610
 i 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.530
 and well basically that would be the chorus of 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.299
 that part of sin quotes and then 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.980
 I would mount the verse and the chorus and 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.739
 practically the whole song with the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.310
 melodies in the right hand and the 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.560
 chords with the left 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.750
 good up here 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.050
 and see you in the second video of this 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.050
 part
