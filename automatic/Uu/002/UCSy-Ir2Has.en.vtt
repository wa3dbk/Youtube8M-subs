computer to know beyond and a computer
pretty<00:00:23.100> much<00:00:23.250> becomes<00:00:23.640> useless<00:00:24.029> at<00:00:24.480> that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
pretty much becomes useless at that

that bar that comes up you let go and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.290 
that bar that comes up you let go and
here<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.719> steer<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.910> as<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.120> see

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
here you can steer it as you can see

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.770 
here you can steer it as you can see
there<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> explosion<00:00:50.489> comes<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.600> we

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
there and the explosion comes up so we

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.090 
there and the explosion comes up so we
just<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.260> again<00:00:56.149> here<00:00:57.149> too<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.920> it's<00:00:58.920> as

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
just do this again here too and it's as

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.299 
just do this again here too and it's as
simple<00:00:59.489> as<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:03.559> when<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.739> rendering<00:01:05.100> new

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
simple as that when it's rendering new

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.270 
simple as that when it's rendering new
terrain<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.850> gets<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.270> laggy<00:01:06.600> but

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
terrain it gets a little laggy but

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.800 
terrain it gets a little laggy but
generally<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.490> won't<00:01:08.729> lag<00:01:09.180> too<00:01:09.450> much<00:01:10.729> alright

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
generally it won't lag too much alright

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.420 
generally it won't lag too much alright
so<00:01:12.810> now<00:01:12.960> let's<00:01:13.170> move<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> laser

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so now let's move on this is the laser

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.170 
so now let's move on this is the laser
beam<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:16.140> see<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.920> raised<00:01:17.640> Sun<00:01:17.939> comes

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
beam you see there a raised Sun comes

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.880 
beam you see there a raised Sun comes
down<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.830> disappears<00:01:24.320> lava<00:01:25.320> will<00:01:25.590> go<00:01:25.740> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
down and then disappears lava will go in

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.170 
down and then disappears lava will go in
there<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:27.650> it's<00:01:28.650> pretty<00:01:28.890> much<00:01:29.009> hell<00:01:29.880> breaks

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
there and it's pretty much hell breaks

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:52.010 
there and it's pretty much hell breaks

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
attach it to a mega nuke let's just do a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.660 
attach it to a mega nuke let's just do a
mega<00:02:23.470> nuke<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:26.080> go<00:02:26.290> here<00:02:26.680> we<00:02:26.709> can<00:02:26.950> place<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.370> mega

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
mega nuke we go here we can place a mega

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.180 
mega nuke we go here we can place a mega
nuke<00:02:27.940> down<00:02:29.280> catch<00:02:30.300> c4<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:36.010> goes<00:02:36.160> a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
nuke down catch c4 to it there goes a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:46.040 
nuke down catch c4 to it there goes a
mega<00:02:36.489> nuke<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:42.870> as<00:02:43.870> my<00:02:44.080> computer's<00:02:44.500> lagging<00:02:45.100> I

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
mega nuke and as my computer's lagging I

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.250 
mega nuke and as my computer's lagging I
hope<00:02:47.050> my<00:02:47.380> recording<00:02:48.130> stop<00:02:48.400> doesn't<00:02:48.820> stop

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
hope my recording stop doesn't stop
