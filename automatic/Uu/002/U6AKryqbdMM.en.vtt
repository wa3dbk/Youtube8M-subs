 five years after the brilliant realization of the first telephone 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.480
 electromagnetic that explained more or less like this 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.160
 it consists of a vibrating diaphragm and a magnet with a spiral thread that it

 these current alterations transmitted to the other end of the wire impress 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.210
 similar vibrations to the receiving diaphragm reproduce the word

 of electrotherapy to treat pain 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:16.059
 he had built an equipment consisting of two electrodes with a copper tab

 insulated handle connected by a wire to a battery placed in an instant room 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.679
 about twenty meters 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.819
 woah his patient who suffered from rheumatism

 its electrode 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.599
 as soon as i connected to the battery the patient felt a shock and threw 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.419
 a scream

 meucci nudi reproduced from the copper tongue 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.289
 a maze called 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.879

 feverishly experimenting with a large number of types in about twenty years 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.189
 phone empathy for now 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.599
 when in 1871

 today an unpublished document demonstrates priority without possibility of misunderstanding 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.349
 think about the invention of the telephone 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.349
 a
