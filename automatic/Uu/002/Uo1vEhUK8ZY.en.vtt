these<00:03:56.709> black<00:03:56.920> ops<00:03:57.160> 2<00:03:57.310> x-rays<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:58.300> has<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> 2.5

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
these black ops 2 x-rays it has a 2.5

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.280 
these black ops 2 x-rays it has a 2.5
millimeter<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.520> cable<00:04:01.390> able<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.020> use<00:04:02.140> the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
millimeter a cable able to use the

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.050 
millimeter a cable able to use the
headset<00:04:02.500> so<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.280> where<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.489> data<00:04:03.910> comes

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
headset so this is where the data comes

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.360 
headset so this is where the data comes
in<00:04:04.360> now<00:04:05.110> here's<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.560> art<00:04:05.800> issue<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.130> found

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
in now here's the art issue I found

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
about it now I'm gonna just connect the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.420 
about it now I'm gonna just connect the
2.5<00:04:09.250> part<00:04:09.550> to<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:09.970> adapter<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:12.040> adapter

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
2.5 part to the adapter and the adapter

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.260 
2.5 part to the adapter and the adapter
is<00:04:12.550> going<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.760> go<00:04:12.880> inside<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.600> controller<00:04:15.270> and

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
is going to go inside the controller and

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.550 
is going to go inside the controller and
the<00:04:16.330> other<00:04:16.540> end<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:16.959> going<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.230> go<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.380> the

as the chat aspect goes but the weird

as the chat aspect goes but the weird
issue<00:04:32.620> that<00:04:32.919> I'm<00:04:33.010> running<00:04:33.250> into<00:04:33.400> right<00:04:33.820> now<00:04:34.000> I

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
issue that I'm running into right now I

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.990 
issue that I'm running into right now I
have<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:35.290> headset<00:04:35.650> has<00:04:35.680> its<00:04:35.980> own<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:36.970> know

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
have the headset has its own you know

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.640 
have the headset has its own you know
volume<00:04:37.990> dial<00:04:38.890> so<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.550> can<00:04:39.760> adjust<00:04:40.650> increase

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
volume dial so you can adjust increase

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.500 
volume dial so you can adjust increase
and<00:04:41.890> decrease<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.370> volume<00:04:42.669> dial<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.360> game

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
and decrease the volume dial to the game

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.080 
and decrease the volume dial to the game
accordingly<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.740> only<00:04:45.010> problem<00:04:45.370> is<00:04:45.490> the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
accordingly the only problem is the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.909 
accordingly the only problem is the
adapter<00:04:46.600> treats<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.140> headset<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.530> forward

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
adapter treats the headset the forward

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.670 
adapter treats the headset the forward
sound<00:04:48.220> similar<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.210> way<00:04:49.300> that<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.750> GAO

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
sound similar to the way that the GAO

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.950 
sound similar to the way that the GAO
see<00:04:50.950> as<00:04:51.190> for<00:04:51.460> headphones<00:04:51.820> does<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.690> can<00:04:52.840> be

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
see as for headphones does that can be

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.390 
see as for headphones does that can be
an<00:04:53.050> issue<00:04:53.200> because<00:04:53.500> if<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:53.890> turn<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.280> volume

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
an issue because if you turn the volume

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.150 
an issue because if you turn the volume
all<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.760> way<00:04:54.850> down<00:04:55.060> not<00:04:55.840> always<00:04:56.440> but

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
all the way down not always but

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.680 
all the way down not always but
occasionally<00:04:57.670> you<00:04:57.820> will<00:04:57.910> still<00:04:58.240> hear<00:04:58.420> game

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
occasionally you will still hear game

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.170 
occasionally you will still hear game
audio<00:04:59.080> sound<00:04:59.530> despite<00:05:00.190> divine<00:05:00.640> being<00:05:00.940> at<00:05:01.150> its

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
audio sound despite divine being at its

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.030 
audio sound despite divine being at its
laws<00:05:01.450> that's<00:05:01.990> because<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.410> controller<00:05:02.800> is

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
laws that's because the controller is

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.550 
laws that's because the controller is
forwarding<00:05:03.730> its<00:05:03.940> sound<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.050> headset<00:05:05.410> as

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
forwarding its sound to the headset as

similarly<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:06.910> gas<00:05:07.060> has<00:05:07.240> headphones<00:05:07.630> now

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
similarly to the gas has headphones now

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.820 
similarly to the gas has headphones now
normally<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.520> RF<00:05:09.790> transmitter<00:05:10.300> for<00:05:10.540> my

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
normally the RF transmitter for my

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.960 
normally the RF transmitter for my
turtle<00:05:11.830> beach's<00:05:12.100> would<00:05:12.280> forward<00:05:12.490> sound<00:05:12.820> which

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
turtle beach's would forward sound which

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:13.950 
turtle beach's would forward sound which
I'm<00:05:13.060> going<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:13.240> show<00:05:13.360> you<00:05:13.450> right<00:05:13.540> here<00:05:13.690> on<00:05:13.720> top

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
I'm going to show you right here on top

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.140 
I'm going to show you right here on top
of<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.140> ps4<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:15.250> normally<00:05:15.730> forwards<00:05:16.060> the

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
of that ps4 that normally forwards the

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.800 
of that ps4 that normally forwards the
sound<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.860> headset<00:05:18.280> so<00:05:18.940> now<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.330> have<00:05:19.600> two

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
sound to the headset so now I have two

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.630 
sound to the headset so now I have two
devices<00:05:20.080> forwarding<00:05:20.620> sound<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:21.010> it<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.310> I'll

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
devices forwarding sound to it and I'll

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.850 
devices forwarding sound to it and I'll
recreate<00:05:22.030> audio<00:05:22.390> issues<00:05:22.720> so<00:05:23.350> just<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.740> keep

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
recreate audio issues so just to keep

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.590 
recreate audio issues so just to keep
you<00:05:24.040> guys<00:05:24.160> you<00:05:24.700> know<00:05:24.790> let<00:05:24.970> you<00:05:25.060> guys<00:05:25.210> know<00:05:25.420> give

you a heads up on it that's a little

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.210 
you a heads up on it that's a little
problem<00:05:27.430> that<00:05:27.460> I'm<00:05:27.610> running<00:05:27.760> into<00:05:28.020> so<00:05:29.220> that's

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
problem that I'm running into so that's

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.160 
problem that I'm running into so that's
that<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.970> convenience<00:05:31.510> about<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.900> headset

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
that the convenience about the headset

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.050 
that the convenience about the headset
adapted<00:05:32.620> for<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.830> Xbox<00:05:33.190> one<00:05:33.400> Microsoft<00:05:33.940> has
