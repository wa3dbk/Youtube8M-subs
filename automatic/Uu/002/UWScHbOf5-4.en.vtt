00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the way that ice blink works if you're

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.340 
the way that ice blink works if you're
cold<00:00:56.850> skills<00:00:57.120> now<00:00:57.300> plate<00:00:57.570> applied<00:00:58.079> chill

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
cold skills now plate applied chill

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
cold skills now plate applied chill
effects<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.640> cold<00:01:00.030> skill<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.539> used

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
effects and the cold skill that you used

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.360 
effects and the cold skill that you used
this<00:01:00.870> has<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.320> called<00:01:01.530> damage<00:01:01.859> type<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
this has to be called damage type so it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.500 
this has to be called damage type so it
doesn't<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> fries<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.120> children<00:01:03.449> do

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
doesn't have the fries or children do

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.850 
doesn't have the fries or children do
anything<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.260> has<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.650> cold

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
anything like that just has to be cold

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.740 
anything like that just has to be cold
in<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.729> case<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.060> gonna<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.270> using<00:01:06.390> evasive

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
in this case I'm gonna be using evasive

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.289 
in this case I'm gonna be using evasive
fire<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.200> focus<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.760> applies<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.030> chill

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
fire with focus so it applies the chill

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.090 
fire with focus so it applies the chill
effects<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.840> chill<00:01:10.080> effects<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:10.500> slow<00:01:10.770> enemy

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
effects and chill effects now slow enemy

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.679 
effects and chill effects now slow enemy
movement<00:01:11.430> speed<00:01:11.610> by<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> certain<00:01:12.240> percentage

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
movement speed by a certain percentage

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.330 
movement speed by a certain percentage
that<00:01:12.930> increases<00:01:13.470> every<00:01:13.740> rank<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that increases every rank and then it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
that increases every rank and then it
ranked<00:01:14.549> 25<00:01:14.909> began<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.420> 10<00:01:15.600> percent<00:01:15.780> increased

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
ranked 25 began at 10 percent increased

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.170 
ranked 25 began at 10 percent increased
crit<00:01:16.650> chance<00:01:16.830> against<00:01:17.400> chilled<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.880> frozen

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
crit chance against chilled and frozen

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.630 
crit chance against chilled and frozen
enemies<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.770> basically<00:01:20.130> any<00:01:20.280> time<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.490> hit

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
enemies so basically any time you hit

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.330 
enemies so basically any time you hit
and<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.570> cold<00:01:21.810> skill<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:23.220> going

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and we with your cold skill it's going

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.950 
and we with your cold skill it's going
to<00:01:23.400> chill<00:01:23.580> them<00:01:23.700> slow<00:01:24.030> them<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.659> give

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
to chill them slow them and then give

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.899 
to chill them slow them and then give
you<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> 10%<00:01:25.439> increase<00:01:25.950> crit<00:01:26.310> chance<00:01:26.460> against

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you a 10% increase crit chance against

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.480 
you a 10% increase crit chance against
them<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.150> 10%<00:01:27.360> crit<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.590> chance<00:01:29.009> against

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
them that 10% crit is a chance against

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.280 
them that 10% crit is a chance against
them<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> does<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.000> impact<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.840> crit<00:01:31.079> chance

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
them it does not impact your crit chance

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.090 
them it does not impact your crit chance
so<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.920> actually<00:01:32.340> reflected<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:34.100> but

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so it's not actually reflected here but

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.770 
so it's not actually reflected here but
again<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> proctor<00:01:36.450> bane<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
again it's going to proctor bane of the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.210 
again it's going to proctor bane of the
trap<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.380> i'm<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> show<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> you

trap so i'm going to show this to you

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.020 
trap so i'm going to show this to you
guys<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:39.170> gone<00:01:40.170> real<00:01:40.409> quick<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.759> very

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
guys on gone real quick and it's a very

guys on gone real quick and it's a very
substantial<00:01:42.750> damage<00:01:43.229> difference<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.390> we're

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
substantial damage difference so we're

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.760 
substantial damage difference so we're
just<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:45.990> look<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.259> him<00:01:46.439> right<00:01:46.649> now

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
just going to look at him right now

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.350 
just going to look at him right now
again<00:01:47.040> i<00:01:47.070> don't<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.579> equipped<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.119> i'm

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
again i don't have it equipped and i'm

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.899 
again i don't have it equipped and i'm
just<00:01:48.479> going<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.720> switch<00:01:48.990> out<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:50.310> switched

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
just going to switch out it switched

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.370 
just going to switch out it switched
this<00:01:51.090> out<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> other<00:01:51.780> bring<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.110> granger

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
this out with the other bring up granger

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.990 
this out with the other bring up granger
that<00:01:52.500> i<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.740> they<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.610> about<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that i have they they have about the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.240 
that i have they they have about the
same<00:01:54.180> amount<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.170> damage<00:01:55.350> output<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
same amount of damage output so the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.190 
same amount of damage output so the
numbers<00:01:56.520> should<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.820> quite<00:01:57.780> different<00:01:57.960> so

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
numbers should be quite different so

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.130 
numbers should be quite different so
anyway<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.469> we're<00:01:58.979> looking<00:01:59.219> at<00:01:59.570> about<00:02:00.570> 50<00:02:00.869> mil

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
anyway so we're looking at about 50 mil

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.890 
anyway so we're looking at about 50 mil
crits<00:02:01.409> if<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> guys<00:02:01.740> look<00:02:02.009> at<00:02:02.100> this

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
crits if you guys look at this

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:12.199 
crits if you guys look at this
40<00:02:04.900> mil<00:02:05.049> crit<00:02:06.479> see<00:02:07.479> here's<00:02:07.920> 37<00:02:10.770> there's<00:02:11.770> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
40 mil crit see here's 37 there's a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.910 
40 mil crit see here's 37 there's a
there's<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.270> 50<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:13.810> about<00:02:13.959> 50<00:02:14.319> mil<00:02:14.470> crits<00:02:14.709> right

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
there's a 50 so about 50 mil crits right

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.339 
there's a 50 so about 50 mil crits right
now<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:15.970> swapped<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.420> out<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:16.870> now<00:02:17.050> it's

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
now it's swapped this out so now it's

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.380 
now it's swapped this out so now it's
going<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.620> proc<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> beta<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.310> trapped<00:02:18.580> and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
going to proc a beta the trapped and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.770 
going to proc a beta the trapped and
call<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.840> week<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.800> now<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.630> gonna<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.720> a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
call the week and now it's gonna be a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.550 
call the week and now it's gonna be a
lot<00:02:22.870> higher<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.290> there's<00:02:23.440> 86<00:02:23.890> mil<00:02:24.069> crit

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.470 

there's<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:31.319> sixty<00:02:32.319> five<00:02:32.500> mil<00:02:32.739> crit<00:02:33.269> 88<00:02:34.269> milk

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
there's a sixty five mil crit 88 milk

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.640 
there's a sixty five mil crit 88 milk
rate<00:02:34.720> 88<00:02:35.110> mil<00:02:35.260> crit<00:02:35.880> 70<00:02:36.880> mil<00:02:37.030> crit<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.470> can

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
rate 88 mil crit 70 mil crit so you can

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.259 
rate 88 mil crit 70 mil crit so you can
see<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.010> goes<00:02:39.100> from<00:02:39.160> approximately<00:02:39.550> 50

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
see that it goes from approximately 50

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.559 
see that it goes from approximately 50
to<00:02:40.300> like<00:02:40.750> almost<00:02:41.080> 90<00:02:41.580> 70<00:02:42.580> mil<00:02:42.700> crit<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.269> can

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
to like almost 90 70 mil crit so can

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.809 
to like almost 90 70 mil crit so can
almost<00:02:43.780> double<00:02:44.200> there's<00:02:45.069> an<00:02:45.190> eating<00:02:45.459> old<00:02:45.580> crit

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
almost double there's an eating old crit

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.370 
almost double there's an eating old crit
so<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.209> almost<00:02:46.360> like<00:02:46.569> double<00:02:46.989> damage<00:02:47.260> not

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
so it's almost like double damage not

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.050 
so it's almost like double damage not
exactly<00:02:47.799> double<00:02:48.069> damage<00:02:48.370> but<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.760> know<00:02:48.850> kind

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
exactly double damage but you know kind

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.280 
exactly double damage but you know kind
of<00:02:49.090> depends<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.510> ranks<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.780> your<00:02:49.900> gems<00:02:50.140> in

this<00:02:50.410> case<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.799> have<00:02:51.030> almost<00:02:52.030> 30%<00:02:52.330> on<00:02:52.840> my<00:02:52.959> being

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
this case I have almost 30% on my being

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.440 
this case I have almost 30% on my being
of<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.350> trap<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.890> then<00:02:54.239> getting<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.330> extra

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
of the trap and then getting the extra

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.420 
of the trap and then getting the extra
chance<00:02:55.900> obviously<00:02:56.470> from<00:02:56.650> ice<00:02:56.799> blink<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.310> that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
chance obviously from ice blink but that

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.949 
chance obviously from ice blink but that
doesn't<00:02:57.640> impact<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:57.970> crit<00:02:58.150> damage<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.810> then

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
doesn't impact a crit damage and then

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.020 
doesn't impact a crit damage and then
also<00:02:59.380> 20%<00:02:59.709> phone<00:03:00.160> call<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> week<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.850> they<00:03:00.910> are

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
also 20% phone call a week and they are

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.449 
also 20% phone call a week and they are
separate<00:03:01.390> multipliers<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.350> it<00:03:03.010> does<00:03:03.160> end<00:03:03.370> up

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
separate multipliers so it does end up

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.759 
separate multipliers so it does end up
to<00:03:03.610> be<00:03:03.640> like<00:03:03.850> fairly<00:03:04.180> significant<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.049> that's

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
to be like fairly significant so that's

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.099 
to be like fairly significant so that's
in<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.430> nutshell<00:03:06.459> that's<00:03:06.970> ice<00:03:07.150> blink<00:03:07.450> it's<00:03:07.900> it's

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
in a nutshell that's ice blink it's it's

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.130
