 ask a question yuri tell me how in the us 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.880
 works in the sphere of apartment renovation services 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.640
 and houses 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.650
 Shoot again, has traveled to Russia you 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.560
 find brigade say whatever you want 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.080
 do they say what and how much is needed 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.210
 buy you go buy everything yourself 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.210
 bring them and they do 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.460
 removal of construction waste is your concern 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.219
 clean entrance too 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.980
 here is such a question 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.949
 different interested 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.540
 generally amazed at so many different things 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:51.210
 in general, people write what I want to say 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.949
 probably the option to buy yourself too 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.170
 if something is all the more so then you 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.570
 you choose some tile of course you 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.519
 go there you buy yourself but only people 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.890
 who make repairs they are all themselves 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.810
 will believe and say how much you need to buy 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.479
 there square feet well yet 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.479
 measured in English units here 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.660
 on it and you know but it is in principle 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.530
 no matter what the difference in inches feet there 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:23.310
 either in meters or centimeters 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.649
 but usually I don’t usually remember those 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.770
 cases with us or with friends to 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:32.850
 trash was customer's personal concern 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.100
 usually these are all people who are a team 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.350
 who make repairs it and take out 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.380
 garbage for themselves because in general 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.680
 throw it you just like that in the trash 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.579
 you have no right if it is large 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.439
 some kind of repair 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.600
 if you yourself do something fine without 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.810
 problems can be thrown if it is large 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.560
 repair usually take the garbage too 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.520
 there is either the team itself the company itself 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.299
 repair 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.009
 somehow it does either they are there 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.729
 contractor hire contractor that is 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.160
 when but it's all kind of like but i don't 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.440
 I heard that it was necessary to separate someone 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.320
 call take out the trash they usually they 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.190
 bring such a healthy container near 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.640
 at home if it is 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.010
 private house put it either on arrival 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.320
 where cars usually stand before 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.130
 home put this healthy container 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.990
 then it comes then comes 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.270
 special car she plunges it on 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.930
 yourself on your back and takes everything 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:39.250
 when rome he ended my like this 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.920
 happens the same way you call well 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.140
 preferably several different companies and 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.980
 here they call in English the end 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.470
 contract russia that is it in Russian 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:56.380
 some contract frame they are also called 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:59.140
 type on the English style well as if 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.250
 the name of the essence does not change in general those 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.740
 repair crews mean they are you 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.990
 you call them what you need to say 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.670
 make it either something small or it 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:16.210
 something big and they all usually immediately 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.910
 you do not say the price if you want 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.459
 what kind of stuff do you buy yourself 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.350
 this he says let's say I say 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.110
 what you need to choose there with 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.390
 drawing anything or Che as well as usual 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.640
 Here are all such materials they are ordinary 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.290
 assume that they come all 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.640
 believe everyone will look 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.550
 then somewhere in a day in two 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.440
 they send but now it has become so 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.170
 email is all email they 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.080
 send you a receipt but 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.730
 a printout how big what how much 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.450
 will cost specifically 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.390
 and this already plus usually includes everything 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.940
 basic basic materials for work 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.480
 let's say there is some kind of putty that's all 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.370
 already included and 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.269
 let's say here it is day x they 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.220
 come to you and start repairing later 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.959
 they are weaning but starting there 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.880
 everything is laid out here as if 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.280
 London 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.590
 what was to install the dishwasher 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.390
 typewriter a couple of things to do which 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.420
 started just cocktail hands are no longer 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.150
 got to do it yourself in the house yes need 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.460
 it was done here they came means 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.160
 inspected all this already after i 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:34.230
 agreed signed a contract with this 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.390
 companies came inspected all wrote 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.790
 yourself there on a piece of paper well, or how they are there 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.010
 I didn’t watch what was needed 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.410
 and drove to the store somewhere through 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.849
 getting forty minutes later somewhere they 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.999
 are back 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.669
 already with the necessary materials 1 and 2 a 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:53.429
 these stores they are very conveniently open 6 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.669
 in the morning and until 10 in the evening these are the shops 

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:59.789
 like fum type or pug 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.979
 musy I'm accurate mark this is pronounced he 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.369
 I still do not know for this 13 years as 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.440
 pronounced store name news 

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:10.890
 Well, something like this 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.790
 and they are all with the material and have come all 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:17.010
 done all done 1 2 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.720
 write a check or there through a credit 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.510
 card or cash 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.530
 money took everything ready everyone thanks 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.750
 all bye 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.000
 but this is if some kind of nervous work 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.800
 if it's a lot of things there is rubbish of course 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.260
 remove them is not very much needed and 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.360
 so they didn't even drive they just in 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.060
 my dumpsters then all left 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.030
 but I did not mind as it were, if it 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.650
 there was some big work let's say 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.020
 finish the second floor there at the house well 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.470
 of course they would have driven a large container 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.470
 the trash can do everything so then here 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.360
 my parents used to be in the apartment 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:02.250
 did repairs but just the same rubbish 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.210
 Garbage collection is already exported themselves they 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:09.870
 the crew is clean in the stairwell here in 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:13.140
 they also supported this field themselves 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.050
 as far as i remember they laid there 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.690
 special floor mats to and and 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.000
 something hung on the walls so as not to be shorter 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.500
 dirty and do not spoil do not scratch and 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.750
 don't beat the walls of the floor 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.470
 Well, yes the ceiling there in my case is not 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.870
 it came to everything in general to you then when everything 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:35.340
 it's over they took it all off 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:39.270
 all cleaned and all clean all cultures 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.610
 nickname curled up and gone so here is the camera 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.910
 red light therefore no risk 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:50.280
 meaning 140 dollars is what 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:55.110
 spend more useful than 30 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:59.540
 seconds earlier to drive on so that's it 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:02.580
 probably in general, that is all that is usually 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.070
 shorter customer pays and get full 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:08.340
 I think you can probably think of a package of services 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.140
 you can agree and say let's say 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.880
 that I myself can take out the monsoon somehow 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.160
 I will not know cheaper but usually 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.530
 as far as I know no one does 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.050
 clown so went somehow funny here 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.820
 across the street I did not know it was visible in the camera 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.100
 he danced something powerful there 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:27.630
 headphones in the ears I do not know in general here 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:30.680
 everything is done and repair usually hopefully 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:34.610
 I forgot nothing I wanted to say 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.610
 all the best gentlemen
