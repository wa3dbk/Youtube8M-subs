00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.330
 the wk has started and the group of course that the netherlands wins 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.810
 But yes how can we make sure the protocol is fair 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:19.759
 year 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.569
 color of the netherlands in spain 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.569
 and if the Netherlands has to play football then all supporters dress up with the 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.349
 craziest attributes 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.900
 orange clothing wigs everything is taken out of the closet 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.540
 the supporters from other countries encourage their team in a different way 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.700
 for example, by not using files on hard on a vuvuzela 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.250
 stay 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.420
 the South African tourist office even gave up waiting and a choreography 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.980
 to come up with a special one and now 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.740
 the diski dance 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
 these dances are popular throughout the internet 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.600
 after that I just agreed here, he is just like an expert 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 and he can tell more about the disco dance 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.990
 Are you curious where you are 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.630
 whether or not 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.630
 I have not heard analysts about critical condition 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 what is evil 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.710
 the diski dance styles and for wantonness 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.369
 if comes out they have ticked specially for without following for the world cup 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.700
 and it's actually a kind of playing football on music 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.020
 but without the ball 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.049
 and that for the roads and traffic of ing 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.049
 at this time they had some of the indices 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.170
 made danceable and they also gave it names 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.490
 the law book the couple is very well known 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.350
 That is where the discussion lies between the feet 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.180
 they might be supposedly 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.760
 held high 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.240
 and you have the jungle 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.050
 the european football lies 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.600
 but they step over it 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.000
 and finally 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.460
 you have and 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.900
 another friend suggests hollow leather is catching the ball 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.690
 the foot 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.329
 the straight line 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.809
 you make a heel 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:12.449
 from toulon wolfs 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.669
 and 4 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.749
 the mohmand tea is movement in many families and that is actually the ball 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.119
 to receive 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.709
 walk backwards with the ball 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.769
 throw it up again from a brand 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.219
 and from the foot 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:31.450
 a paid that we have that he comes the africa where exactly and south africa 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.219
 so wherever a say 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.689
 everything taking place came as far as the ball was concerned and actually 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.280
 completely immersed 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.310
 we don't have all this to make the party even bigger 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.970
 temporary also healthy 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.689
 a woman who always works in south africa who is used to moving 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.469
 because of this performance is also a major achievement, we can make it that 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.039
 do and will apply for it 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.779
 finally finally 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.549
 almost certain that everyone can do it at first you have no real ball 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.949
 so and that can not go wrong and says exactly what you need in the song 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.439
 do so then you can also follow so if you find a little let's find out 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.369
 then but I can do with you and the one who dances completely crazy also a nice one 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.809
 this i'm ready let's go on strike okay 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.159
 stieg 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.289
 2 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.909
 let alone continue with this time that I can not quite 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:59.659
 clearly 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.849
 I go again that the captain I heard is a nice pot 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.229
 we work it 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.259
 we have 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:10.999
 lots of fun 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.029
 we were 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:13.819
 further
