00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.640 
these nice little home buttons that I'm
actually<00:00:37.730> gonna<00:00:37.940> add<00:00:38.150> on<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.629> my<00:00:38.659> galaxy<00:00:39.110> s4<00:00:39.470> so

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
actually gonna add on to my galaxy s4 so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.750 
actually gonna add on to my galaxy s4 so
basically<00:00:40.100> I<00:00:40.129> guess<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:40.460> could<00:00:40.519> match

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
basically I guess you could match

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.850 
basically I guess you could match
whatever<00:00:40.970> case<00:00:41.269> color<00:00:41.480> you<00:00:41.600> got<00:00:41.720> so<00:00:41.989> once<00:00:42.769> i

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
whatever case color you got so once i

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.759 
whatever case color you got so once i
get<00:00:43.010> mines<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.460> i'll<00:00:43.640> probably<00:00:43.850> go<00:00:44.180> with<00:00:44.360> the

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
get mines on i'll probably go with the

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.380 
get mines on i'll probably go with the
white<00:00:45.769> or<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.010> black<00:00:46.159> whichever<00:00:46.850> looks<00:00:47.120> more

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
white or the black whichever looks more

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.869 
white or the black whichever looks more
appealing<00:00:47.449> with<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:47.989> case<00:00:48.140> that<00:00:48.260> i<00:00:48.320> got<00:00:48.470> and

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
appealing with the case that i got and

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.399 
appealing with the case that i got and
to<00:00:49.879> see<00:00:50.089> that<00:00:50.269> this<00:00:50.390> case<00:00:50.629> comes<00:00:50.839> in<00:00:50.960> about<00:00:51.049> i

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
to see that this case comes in about i

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.289 
to see that this case comes in about i
think<00:00:51.530> five<00:00:51.830> different<00:00:52.159> colors<00:00:52.280> we<00:00:53.119> have

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
think five different colors we have

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.840 
think five different colors we have
about<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:53.900> Dante<00:00:54.830> red<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:55.580> have<00:00:55.729> the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
about the Dante red you have the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.789 
about the Dante red you have the
Infinity<00:00:56.360> white<00:00:56.540> you<00:00:57.049> have<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.290> red<00:00:57.559> time

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
Infinity white you have the red time

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.030 
Infinity white you have the red time
yellow<00:00:58.549> we<00:00:59.239> have<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.479> middle<00:00:59.839> slate<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:00.500> the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
yellow we have the middle slate and the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.770 
yellow we have the middle slate and the
color<00:01:01.250> I<00:01:01.369> own<00:01:01.580> other<00:01:01.850> color<00:01:02.150> I<00:01:02.269> have<00:01:02.479> run<00:01:02.629> it

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
color I own other color I have run it

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.170 
color I own other color I have run it
with<00:01:02.869> the<00:01:03.049> satin<00:01:03.439> silver<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.129> these<00:01:05.000> are<00:01:05.150> two

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
with the satin silver so these are two

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.789 
with the satin silver so these are two
cause<00:01:05.449> I<00:01:05.540> get<00:01:05.750> now<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.960> thing<00:01:06.500> about<00:01:06.680> this

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
cause I get now the thing about this

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.740 
cause I get now the thing about this
case<00:01:07.009> it's<00:01:07.189> a<00:01:07.250> two-part<00:01:07.729> case<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.240> it's<00:01:08.360> very

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
case it's a two-part case and it's very

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.090 
case it's a two-part case and it's very
thin<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:09.200> is<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.560> reason<00:01:09.830> why<00:01:10.009> I

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
thin this is the reason why I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.580 
thin this is the reason why I
specifically<00:01:10.670> chose<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:11.330> case<00:01:11.630> over<00:01:12.470> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
specifically chose this case over the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.410 
specifically chose this case over the
seidio<00:01:12.950> active<00:01:13.009> X<00:01:13.460> which<00:01:13.610> i<00:01:13.700> usually<00:01:14.150> get<00:01:14.270> when

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
seidio active X which i usually get when

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.950 
seidio active X which i usually get when
i<00:01:14.479> get<00:01:14.630> my<00:01:14.659> Galaxy<00:01:15.110> devices<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:17.600> negative

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
i get my Galaxy devices and the negative

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.780 
i get my Galaxy devices and the negative
side<00:01:18.110> about<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.470> has<00:01:18.619> virtually<00:01:19.220> no<00:01:19.280> lip<00:01:19.549> so

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
side about it has virtually no lip so

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.030 
side about it has virtually no lip so
once<00:01:20.479> I<00:01:20.570> put<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:20.840> facedown<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:21.500> lip<00:01:21.680> is<00:01:21.829> very

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
once I put this facedown the lip is very

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.180 
once I put this facedown the lip is very
thin<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:23.060> about<00:01:23.210> 400<00:01:24.080> honey<00:01:24.260> uneven

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
thin so in about 400 honey uneven

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.980 
thin so in about 400 honey uneven
surface<00:01:25.700> like<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:26.000> know<00:01:26.120> such<00:01:26.300> as<00:01:26.420> gravel<00:01:26.810> I

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
surface like you know such as gravel I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.330 
surface like you know such as gravel I
think<00:01:27.380> I'll<00:01:27.470> be<00:01:27.560> screwed<00:01:27.830> but<00:01:28.040> for<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.220> most

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
think I'll be screwed but for the most

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.980 
think I'll be screwed but for the most
part<00:01:28.430> of<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.700> falls<00:01:28.850> on<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:29.000> flat<00:01:29.180> surface<00:01:29.210> I'd

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
part of it falls on a flat surface I'd

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.350 
part of it falls on a flat surface I'd
be<00:01:30.170> cool<00:01:30.380> now<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.460> two-piece<00:01:31.850> case<00:01:32.090> right

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
be cool now it's a two-piece case right

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.490 
be cool now it's a two-piece case right
here<00:01:32.390> you<00:01:32.600> know<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.750> got<00:01:32.960> your<00:01:33.050> soft<00:01:33.290> touch

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
here you know you got your soft touch

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.160 
here you know you got your soft touch
rubberized<00:01:33.979> back<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:35.210> have<00:01:35.360> your<00:01:35.659> what

rubberized back and you have your what

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.600 
rubberized back and you have your what
appears<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.560> be<00:01:36.590> metallic<00:01:37.100> was<00:01:37.250> actually

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
appears to be metallic was actually

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.820 
appears to be metallic was actually
pretty<00:01:37.760> much<00:01:38.060> plastic<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.650> looks<00:01:39.770> very

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
pretty much plastic but it looks very

what the lips look like so you can see

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.540 
what the lips look like so you can see
how<00:05:20.140> thick<00:05:20.530> that<00:05:20.560> litter<00:05:20.920> is<00:05:21.040> that<00:05:21.220> but<00:05:21.460> the

note to see you at the next case it kind

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.230 
note to see you at the next case it kind
of<00:05:23.380> wraps<00:05:23.620> around<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.250> it's<00:05:24.700> much<00:05:24.850> more<00:05:25.030> thick

of wraps around and it's much more thick
you<00:05:25.330> look<00:05:25.450> at<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.570> top<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.870> phone<00:05:25.990> right

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
you look at the top of the phone right

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.570 
you look at the top of the phone right
there<00:05:26.230> you<00:05:26.470> see<00:05:26.620> how<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:26.800> note<00:05:27.100> to<00:05:27.310> kind<00:05:27.550> of

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
there you see how the note to kind of

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.670 
there you see how the note to kind of
wraps<00:05:27.790> around<00:05:27.940> so<00:05:28.660> if<00:05:28.750> i<00:05:28.810> do<00:05:28.870> hit<00:05:29.110> uneven<00:05:29.560> serve

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
wraps around so if i do hit uneven serve

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.170 
wraps around so if i do hit uneven serve
this<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:30.010> more<00:05:30.190> likely<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.520> protect<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.000> phone

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
this is more likely to protect the phone

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.640 
this is more likely to protect the phone
from<00:05:31.360> hitting<00:05:31.510> a<00:05:31.630> flat<00:05:31.840> surface<00:05:32.050> but<00:05:32.410> since

a 4.5 it meets my needs as post when I

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.420 
a 4.5 it meets my needs as post when I
have<00:06:07.630> cases<00:06:07.960> like<00:06:08.080> these<00:06:08.200> soft<00:06:08.710> touch<00:06:08.920> and<00:06:09.250> the

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
have cases like these soft touch and the

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.640 
have cases like these soft touch and the
hard<00:06:09.640> exoskeleton<00:06:09.970> shell<00:06:10.570> on<00:06:10.720> the<00:06:10.810> bed<00:06:10.990> but<00:06:11.560> in

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
hard exoskeleton shell on the bed but in

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.830 
hard exoskeleton shell on the bed but in
this<00:06:11.710> case<00:06:11.920> it<00:06:12.640> has<00:06:12.790> a<00:06:12.820> soft<00:06:13.150> touch<00:06:13.270> all<00:06:13.540> around

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
this case it has a soft touch all around

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.020 
this case it has a soft touch all around
and<00:06:14.140> a<00:06:14.290> little<00:06:14.560> hard<00:06:14.950> plastic<00:06:15.490> you<00:06:15.700> know<00:06:15.820> I'm

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
and a little hard plastic you know I'm

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.820 
and a little hard plastic you know I'm
not<00:06:16.150> gonna<00:06:16.270> say<00:06:16.420> exoskeleton<00:06:17.110> but<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.680> nice

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
not gonna say exoskeleton but the nice

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.500 
not gonna say exoskeleton but the nice
little<00:06:18.100> plastic<00:06:18.370> shell<00:06:18.580> on<00:06:18.700> the<00:06:18.730> size<00:06:18.940> as<00:06:19.180> a

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
little plastic shell on the size as a

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.810 
little plastic shell on the size as a
band<00:06:19.840> which<00:06:20.410> keeps<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.890> thing<00:06:21.310> nice<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:21.520> neat

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
band which keeps the thing nice and neat

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.150 
band which keeps the thing nice and neat
and<00:06:22.000> also<00:06:22.450> I<00:06:22.480> think<00:06:22.990> it<00:06:23.200> expunged<00:06:23.620> ously<00:06:23.860> the

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
and also I think it expunged ously the

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.270 
and also I think it expunged ously the
the<00:06:24.670> problem<00:06:25.000> when<00:06:25.540> you<00:06:25.660> have<00:06:25.690> TPU<00:06:26.620> cases<00:06:26.890> over

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
the problem when you have TPU cases over

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.340 
the problem when you have TPU cases over
time<00:06:27.520> they<00:06:28.030> start<00:06:28.300> to<00:06:28.390> expand<00:06:28.900> out<00:06:29.020> like<00:06:29.170> this

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
time they start to expand out like this

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.840 
time they start to expand out like this
see<00:06:29.890> this<00:06:29.980> right<00:06:30.130> here<00:06:30.190> and<00:06:30.430> they<00:06:30.490> start<00:06:30.730> to

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
see this right here and they start to

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.750 
see this right here and they start to
kind<00:06:31.330> of<00:06:31.420> get<00:06:31.510> this<00:06:31.660> nasty<00:06:31.870> little<00:06:32.050> edge<00:06:32.760> so

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
kind of get this nasty little edge so

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.130 
kind of get this nasty little edge so
after<00:06:34.090> a<00:06:34.120> while<00:06:34.150> in<00:06:34.300> this<00:06:34.390> case<00:06:34.570> we<00:06:34.810> know<00:06:34.930> goes

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
after a while in this case we know goes

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.480 
after a while in this case we know goes
through<00:06:35.350> time<00:06:35.590> and<00:06:35.800> it<00:06:35.890> starts<00:06:36.100> getting<00:06:36.220> weary

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
through time and it starts getting weary

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.280 
through time and it starts getting weary
on<00:06:36.790> it<00:06:36.910> the<00:06:37.330> edges<00:06:37.630> will<00:06:37.720> start<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:37.990> plot<00:06:38.170> like

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
on it the edges will start the plot like

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.390 
on it the edges will start the plot like
that<00:06:38.440> and<00:06:38.590> start<00:06:38.830> to<00:06:38.890> become<00:06:38.980> more<00:06:39.280> and<00:06:39.340> more

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
that and start to become more and more

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.250 
that and start to become more and more
