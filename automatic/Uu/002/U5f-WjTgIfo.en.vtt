00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
of my curves I can finish up on down can

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.949 
of my curves I can finish up on down can
a<00:04:08.609> bit<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.880> slipstreaming<00:04:09.239> behind<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.630> work

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
a bit of slipstreaming behind and work

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.900 
a bit of slipstreaming behind and work
back<00:04:10.139> out<00:04:10.290> he's<00:04:10.950> defending<00:04:11.519> on<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.669> inside
