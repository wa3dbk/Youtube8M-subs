00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.490
 who first had the question of the moment the champion standard or ii additionally 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.899
 our bullring, which at 25 in the Principality young people from Liège 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.360
 takes a big step forward anyway Friday night and have never been 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.210
 as well placed but watch out for the last straight manu of war 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.669
 and if this time 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.189
 standard champion a whole city a whole region has been waiting for that for 25 years 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.369
 allow children to expand 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.779
 his last title 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.980
 the roads the time is called reactions van der spuy cnt ahmad darrad 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.430
 decoder of course 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.510
 in 2008 the iconic guardian and you 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.430
 or in any case 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.600
 the next success 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.150
 of course it remains yes match mathematically nothing is done but 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.540
 mentally the standard hit haiti 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.240
 aubry is required 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 3 the first half we played against the champion 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.310
 if you do not see how he can however always later 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.870
 with a lot of strength 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.420
 with maturities 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
 I think it's also a team that deserves to win 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 it is obvious 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.590
 problem this ivory side after a match 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.320
 almost perfect 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.970
 a constant physical pressure a concentration and efficiency 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.600
 copy there is no one to doubt this standard afp ap via the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.650
 champion's assets 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.810
 but beware the blow of disappointment fans of the most standard 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.420
 possible 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.270
 in 25 years 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.310
 the small plus that fades three times in second place 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.060
 for two years in three times too much regret despite the beginning of 2009 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.060
 the Liege finishes far to thirteen points in two years is a jack-of-all 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.460
 naming four names five months of winter takes care of him some scenes 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.689
 himself 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.830
 the standard tilts 2 to 1 at the astrid park 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.180
 four days from the end 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.600
 all scoring history scored top scorer in the league 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.170
 but the standard must once again admit defeat a few minutes 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.170
 after polka dot this given moment 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.190
 identical scenario in 2006 sakineh this dress crucified 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.150
 at the astrid park 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
 the standard dropped 2 to 0 in April 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.369
 5 point championship chf 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.479
 we can also evoke the missed penalty two camps did not stop offering the stands 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:12.459
 in 2005 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.129
 what is more the league standard champions 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.900
 all six finals all lost in 25 years the report is always the same 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.339
 the people of Liège 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.209
 again floundered in the final stretch 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.420
 how to prevent the story from repeating itself how not to fall into the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.349
 trap of pressure this is the last challenge that awaits the standard on their 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.469
 goal 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.829
 the pressures for a positive pressure peach like me or like any 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.329
 which game we want to win and we know we bring who we should win 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.210
 of course 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.740
 r that pressure to win a match but not a pressure 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.740
 additional on the first laces some member states 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.379
 and especially when we know that players are aware of the historical page 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.169
 for the club maybe they're in the process of writing gaulle 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.670
 maybe because for that as well as the other teams 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.450
 they are quiet who is critical of the sahel while making the request for 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.429
 funding not awareness 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:56.749
 it's June 24 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.449
 we have to defend it with families 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:59.499
 during the last title 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.399
 sandra champion for them it's on this time
