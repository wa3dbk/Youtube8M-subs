00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.220
 for kids here panda that 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.919
 they commented and I extract a video 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.139
 explanatory informative how you want 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.760
 call it is a guide a little explaining 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.500
 things and we passed on information that I 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.240
 I know that many do not know I have not seen 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.139
 no video yet on youtube and negril and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.240
 sign of nothing 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.980
 explaining it so good I wanted to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.560
 do it to wait a bit 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.410
 the next thing that is the levels in the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.789
 zombies nobody understands how it works 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.800
 not at the beginning but I like it 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.880
 investigate to mediate things and in the end yes 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.769
 I get it 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.470
 to start many you will have this level 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.390
 what my friends have are the bears 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.910
 that only play multicolored that is a 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.430
 bone zero level completely zero 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.920
 from zero and then for example then if you 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.100
 has a bar that is the first level 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.680
 of that prestige and let's say prestige 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.450
 let's call it that way it's worth the first thing 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.610
 that bone the seconds to the bones 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.650
 crossed where is how you can see 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.660
 obviously at the beginning if you play a 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.430
 game in zombies you will pass the level 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.260
 from this prestige to this because it is super 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.370
 easy because there is little experience like 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.860
 the first levels of a child now 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.159
 you're not going to see many people who 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.439
 have 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.270
 a malar bone in the second prestige 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.700
 which are the two bones crossed there already 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.399
 there are people with a level with a bar 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.799
 with three bars that is the progress in 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.399
 that prestige there are five levels five 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.350
 bars there is one here are three 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.509
 there were two here and here three already in the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.819
 next level next prestige where it goes 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.920
 going up like this tsonga prestige there are series 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.899
 different prestige and each prestige 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.729
 It has five levels and you will ask me 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.250
 what are the prestige as the 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.069
 first it is this that is a bone only the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.239
 second are those two good crusaders the 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:45.280
 third is this the skull the fourth is 

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:47.170
 the skull with a knife behind it 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.000
 it's my level right now that I'm good at 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.500
 I play a lot but now because I do not 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.849
 I'm no more level than I should have 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.310
 more level but I do not have it for some 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:56.289
 right now I explain it and then the others 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.009
 levels will again be the 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:05.520
 markers I'm going to all but they're good 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.520
 two level knives 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:17.270
 has less level than me above all 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.220
 here is my level this one is also of the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.560
 maximum level the maximum prestige that is 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.270
 a skull with two shotguns where 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.770
 It's a camera with a knife 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.330
 skull with two knives a gravity 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.220
 with a shotgun and a skull with two 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.220
 with two shotguns that from the end already 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.140
 It is the ultimate prestige of zombies but 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.739
 the prestige is not fixed because how 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.480
 explain then that for example has the 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.220
 maximum prestige level 4 that's why it has 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.450
 the blue eyes the blue eyes what 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.080
 indicates if you are about to upload the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.730
 level if you have level 4 of bragado 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.550
 shotguns or skulls or skull side 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.170
 with bone whatever you are if 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.250
 since 4 you do not have blue eyes but 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.350
 as you are about to raise level 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.260
 know level 5 that you have 5 bars 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.690
 in that in that as you see this has five 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.730
 parts and is with blue eyes 75 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.650
 bars you'll have blue eyes 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.780
 and that explained to level up I do not know 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.489
 tries to kill neither of nor by anything 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.950
 style returned for example had in a 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.290
 moment I had eight thousand casualties now I have 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.970
 eleven thousand twelve thousand and had another friend who 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.140
 he had two thousand casualties and he had the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.540
 gazules and I do not why because the level 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.010
 zombies or not to kill the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.810
 rounds that arrive a lot of people believe 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.790
 that each bar is a round and when 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.280
 mercier's raisins from a certain number of 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.950
 round they give you a new thing and they make themselves 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.110
 for mental brides that are not then 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.170
 as you can see theme 13 thousand casualties but 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.000
 there are people for example who have 5 very 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.310
 lowers less and has my level you put a 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.660
 little weird that and to raise level what 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.269
 ago is and he led to a game of 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.540
 zombies at the end of the game of some 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.870
 way has some some I do not know I do not know one 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.299
 whatever formula that tells you everything 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.549
 that is low bullets fired the time that 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.190
 you have died, resuscitation is the 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.959
 granada to the shots the head of death is 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.080
 chopped up this whole project what counts 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.570
 all 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.160
 and it's middle zone if that mean is around 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.230
 above normal that the game have 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.740
 some one thing that is normal what 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.510
 happens is that you add points is for 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.950
 underneath it takes away points for example 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.470
 to record some videos that you are going to see 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.850
 those days of days and such what you have to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.430
 do is put a game of the normal 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.620
 thing and to leave me that when leaving me as it arrives 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.460
 a round one or two or three took me away 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.410
 points and there 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.600
 there have been moments that I have come down from having 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.490
 the skull with blue eyes to this 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.260
 severity for example worked at level 5 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.760
 the water and that's why with three yes 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.560
 you want to raise the level and that is to go up in 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.420
 the very fast what I advise you is 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.370
 do lots of games with high rounds 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.340
 many casualties and that is very consistent 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.230
 I will not do a round game 31 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.880
 the next get to round 3 what 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.220
 it's said here something happens and it's going to 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.500
 remove points because if you already do 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.660
 very badly removes points and the easiest 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.620
 to level up is to play mode 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.720
 pain 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.240
 the public games that is like a 4 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.400
 against 4 is a move that is here there 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.110
 some video explaining what is but the 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.490
 best level to upload me for now 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.320
 I'm going up normal I'm recording 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.660
 videos and when I get what I want and for 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.330
 if it only goes up because obviously 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.010
 I have a certain level in zombies so 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.210
 for the fourth prestige let's say I 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.250
 there are three more that I will upload quite 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.660
 fast so I've seen myself by 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.240
 example of this past of the skull 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.100
 with blue eyes level 5 directly to 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.950
 is without going down the bar one or two 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.040
 neither three nor four so I do not know too 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.420
 that will be my double brand since we are 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:34.810
 you fell winner of my list and 5,000 of 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:37.980
 world despondent and 249 times I'm lousy 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:43.670
 animations I have 102 101 are not bad 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:46.110
 downed gained 230 shots the head 5000 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.280
 deaths 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.850
 well just chopped also 14,432 a 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.660
 cojon and gave me advantages of up to more than 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:02.430
 165 open doors 124 impacts one 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:05.580
 how many 84 thousand of 2000 of the 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.440
 world and miles traveled 263 10,000 of 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.490
 world and that's all for now I hope that 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.880
 you liked the video you hope that 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.140
 has helped to understand the system 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.940
 prestige level or whatever you want 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.560
 call it from the zombies and we will not 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.480
 part is this explanation even I think 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.180
 which is the correct one I'm 95 to have 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.650
 sure and we hope that's the way things are 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.140
 and given the video thank you very much kids 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.140
 to see it and that's it until later
