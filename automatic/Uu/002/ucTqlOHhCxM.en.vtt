position it's the governor out position

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.940 
position it's the governor out position
is<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.180> one<00:01:37.330> we<00:01:37.480> want<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.810> introduce<00:01:38.050> air<00:01:38.590> into

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
is the one we want to introduce air into

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.690 
is the one we want to introduce air into
normally<00:01:39.760> fluid<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:40.330> coming<00:01:40.570> out<00:01:40.870> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
normally fluid is coming out that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.120 
normally fluid is coming out that
passageway<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.150> by<00:01:43.840> introducing<00:01:44.320> air<00:01:44.740> going

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
passageway and by introducing air going

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.070 
passageway and by introducing air going
in<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.400> opposite<00:01:45.730> direction<00:01:45.790> it<00:01:46.360> will<00:01:46.810> cause

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
in the opposite direction it will cause

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.610 
in the opposite direction it will cause
the<00:01:47.380> valves<00:01:47.800> to<00:01:48.010> dither<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:49.440> governor<00:01:50.440> and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
the valves to dither in the governor and

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.550 
the valves to dither in the governor and
by<00:01:50.650> hearing<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:52.030> terrible<00:01:53.020> noise<00:01:53.230> you'll

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
valves are nice and free so let's

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.710 
valves are nice and free so let's
introduce<00:01:58.330> some<00:01:58.660> air<00:01:59.080> into<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.070> out<00:02:00.720> governor

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
introduce some air into the out governor

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.770 
introduce some air into the out governor
out<00:02:01.869> passage<00:02:07.350> okay<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:09.520> obnoxious<00:02:10.240> sound<00:02:10.479> is

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
out passage okay that obnoxious sound is

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.330 
out passage okay that obnoxious sound is
letting<00:02:11.080> me<00:02:11.110> know<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.440> those<00:02:11.740> valves<00:02:12.220> are

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
letting me know that those valves are
