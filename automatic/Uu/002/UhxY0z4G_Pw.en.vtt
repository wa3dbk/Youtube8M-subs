00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
original mounting bracket which I just

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.920 
original mounting bracket which I just
created<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.940> bracket<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.390> weld<00:00:54.570> onto<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.979 
frame and this thing is as solid as a
rock<00:00:59.329> it's<00:01:00.329> actually<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.899> bit

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
concerned that it might not be but it's

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.780 
concerned that it might not be but it's
a<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.049> strong<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> I've<00:01:05.640> also

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
this bike I said it'd take a bit of time

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.440 
to do this I want my not the fastest at
working<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.610> these<00:01:38.729> things<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:40.159> certainly

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
working on these things but certainly

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.050 
working on these things but certainly
getting<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> point<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:42.960> where<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:44.060> I'm

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
getting to the point now where it's I'm

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.149 
getting to the point now where it's I'm
absolutely<00:01:45.869> loving<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> way<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.710> back<00:01:46.890> tire

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
absolutely loving the way that back tire

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.090 
absolutely loving the way that back tire
is<00:01:47.189> sticking<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.939> far<00:01:48.180> behind<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.950> back<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
is sticking so far behind the back of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160 
is sticking so far behind the back of
the<00:01:50.159> tail<00:01:50.310> piece<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> overall

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the tail piece so this is the overall

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340 
the tail piece so this is the overall
shape<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:53.720> next<00:01:54.720> step<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.170> actually

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
shape now a next step is to actually

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.230 
shape now a next step is to actually
take<00:01:56.040> measurements<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.610> get<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.000> machine

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
take measurements and get to the machine

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.340 
take measurements and get to the machine
shop<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.810> sleeves<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.799> spindles<00:01:59.130> and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
shop for sleeves and spindles and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.020 
shop for sleeves and spindles and
hopefully<00:02:01.460> then<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.850> case<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
hopefully then it's just a case of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.080 
hopefully then it's just a case of
engine<00:02:03.270> rebuilt<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.990> paint<00:02:04.549> he<00:02:05.549> says<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.969> if

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
engine rebuilt and paint he says as if

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.250 
engine rebuilt and paint he says as if
that's<00:02:06.270> nothing<00:02:06.619> okay<00:02:07.619> thank<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.950> very<00:02:08.069> much
