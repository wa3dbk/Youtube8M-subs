about<00:00:17.119> it<00:00:17.270> all<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.630> damn<00:00:17.810> time<00:00:18.250> they<00:00:19.250> smart

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
about it all the damn time they smart

about it all the damn time they smart
constrain<00:00:20.150> all<00:00:20.330> their<00:00:20.600> props<00:00:20.869> which<00:00:21.109> takes<00:00:21.350> up

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
constrain all their props which takes up

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.800 
constrain all their props which takes up
all<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.100> constraints<00:00:22.970> of<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.240> server<00:00:23.480> and

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
all of the constraints of the server and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.349 
all of the constraints of the server and
no<00:00:23.960> one<00:00:24.080> can<00:00:24.230> spawn<00:00:24.500> anything<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.670> basically

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
no one can spawn anything so basically

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.240 
no one can spawn anything so basically
the<00:00:26.600> first<00:00:26.750> thing<00:00:26.900> in<00:00:27.320> this<00:00:27.590> part<00:00:27.830> I<00:00:27.980> want<00:00:28.189> to

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
the first thing in this part I want to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.160 
the first thing in this part I want to
show<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:29.359> difference<00:00:29.689> between<00:00:29.750> normal

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
show you the difference between normal

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.650 
show you the difference between normal
parenting<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:30.980> wired<00:00:31.250> parenting<00:00:31.849> when<00:00:32.570> a

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
parenting and wired parenting when a

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.250 
parenting and wired parenting when a
normal<00:00:33.019> parent<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:34.930> physics<00:00:35.930> holes<00:00:36.110> are

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
normal parent the physics holes are

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.380 
normal parent the physics holes are
removed<00:00:36.680> therefore<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:37.550> can't<00:00:37.760> run<00:00:37.910> any<00:00:38.059> Lua

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
removed therefore you can't run any Lua

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.090 
removed therefore you can't run any Lua
traces<00:00:38.930> which<00:00:39.140> means<00:00:39.380> you<00:00:39.530> can't<00:00:39.770> color

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
traces which means you can't color

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.790 
traces which means you can't color
remove<00:00:40.700> unparent<00:00:41.329> or<00:00:41.480> anything<00:00:41.719> when<00:00:42.710> you

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
remove unparent or anything when you

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.580 
remove unparent or anything when you
parents<00:00:43.129> you<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.250> wire<00:00:43.520> chip<00:00:43.960> all<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.200> physics

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
parents you a wire chip all the physics

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.970 
parents you a wire chip all the physics
hull<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.430> props<00:00:46.730> fall<00:00:47.090> to<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.420> floor

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
hull of the props fall to the floor

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.799 
hull of the props fall to the floor
so<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.309> can<00:00:49.489> still<00:00:49.700> manipulate<00:00:50.000> them<00:00:50.480> but

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
so you can still manipulate them but

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.290 
so you can still manipulate them but
they're<00:00:50.960> as<00:00:51.110> if<00:00:51.320> there<00:00:51.649> are<00:00:51.680> just<00:00:52.300> frozen

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
they're as if there are just frozen

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.000 
they're as if there are just frozen
props<00:00:53.660> on<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:53.930> floor<00:00:54.170> after<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.649> while<00:00:54.829> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
props on the floor after a while the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.850 
props on the floor after a while the
props<00:00:55.250> go<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.610> sleep<00:00:56.030> which<00:00:56.719> is<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.960> means<00:00:57.680> I

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
props go to sleep which is a means I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.610 
props go to sleep which is a means I
just<00:00:58.039> don't<00:00:58.219> interact<00:00:58.489> with<00:00:58.760> anything<00:00:59.620> so

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
just don't interact with anything so

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.520 
just don't interact with anything so
first<00:01:01.039> I'll<00:01:01.219> parent<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.570> babies<00:01:03.020> to<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.289> baby

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
first I'll parent the babies to the baby

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.280 
first I'll parent the babies to the baby
prop<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:07.010> then<00:01:07.159> after<00:01:07.460> duping<00:01:08.049> now<00:01:09.049> let's

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
prop and then after duping now let's

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.060 
prop and then after duping now let's
show<00:01:09.439> you<00:01:09.500> what<00:01:09.680> happens

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.770 

so<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.700> got<00:01:14.940> him<00:01:15.090> gonna<00:01:15.270> say<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.540> want<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so you got him gonna say you want to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.650 
so you got him gonna say you want to
remove<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.410> oh<00:01:17.810> no<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.020> can't<00:01:19.230> do<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
remove them oh no you can't do that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.790 
remove them oh no you can't do that
okay<00:01:21.660> you<00:01:21.870> want<00:01:22.050> unparent<00:01:22.560> them<00:01:24.200> no<00:01:25.200> can't<00:01:25.710> do

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
okay you want unparent them no can't do

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.660 
okay you want unparent them no can't do
that<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> basically<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.340> useless

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that so basically you this is useless

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
that so basically you this is useless
you<00:01:29.820> cannot<00:01:30.240> adjust<00:01:30.630> these<00:01:30.810> props<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.290> any<00:01:31.440> way

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
you cannot adjust these props in any way

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.330 
you cannot adjust these props in any way
it's<00:01:32.250> permanent<00:01:32.730> unless<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> spawn<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
it's permanent unless you spawn of the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
it's permanent unless you spawn of the
constraints<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.330> let's<00:01:36.750> do<00:01:36.870> it<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.320> wired

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
constraints so let's do it to the wired

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:49.840 
constraints so let's do it to the wired
ship<00:01:37.980> here<00:01:42.890> okay<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.250> we'll<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.550> a<00:01:44.580> bit<00:01:44.820> oh

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.240 

look<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:50.940> that<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.390> remove<00:01:51.660> them<00:01:52.250> what

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
look at that you can remove them what

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.910 
look at that you can remove them what
else<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.640> cannot<00:01:53.990> gonna<00:01:54.990> parent<00:01:55.440> them<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.710> well

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
else we cannot gonna parent them as well

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.130 
else we cannot gonna parent them as well
so<00:01:57.920> that's<00:01:58.920> why<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.100> never<00:01:59.430> parent<00:01:59.910> to<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.360> prop

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
so that's why you never parent to a prop

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.250 
so that's why you never parent to a prop
because<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.070> dumb<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.820> you're<00:02:03.690> dumb<00:02:03.990> for

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
because it's dumb and you're dumb for

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.910 
because it's dumb and you're dumb for
doing<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.650> I'm<00:02:04.770> sorry<00:02:06.350> alright<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.650> part

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
doing it I'm sorry alright this is part

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.620 
doing it I'm sorry alright this is part
2<00:02:08.130> let's<00:02:08.550> say<00:02:08.700> you're<00:02:08.880> getting<00:02:09.060> along<00:02:09.390> you're

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
2 let's say you're getting along you're

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.540 
2 let's say you're getting along you're
building<00:02:09.990> your<00:02:10.110> vehicle<00:02:10.530> here<00:02:10.770> all<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.400> you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
building your vehicle here all right you

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.100 
building your vehicle here all right you
got<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.270> you're<00:02:12.360> weary<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> server

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
got this and you're weary of a server

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.780 
got this and you're weary of a server
crash<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.800> want<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> save<00:02:14.250> as<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.550> only

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
crash and you want to save as you only

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.090 
crash and you want to save as you only
as<00:02:14.850> your<00:02:15.000> work<00:02:15.240> okay<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.650> most<00:02:16.740> annoying

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
as your work okay so the most annoying

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.530 
as your work okay so the most annoying
thing<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.700> why<00:02:17.850> people<00:02:18.060> don't<00:02:18.209> like<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
thing is why people don't like the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.330 
thing is why people don't like the
parents<00:02:18.989> because<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.470> takes<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.739> long<00:02:19.890> time<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
parents because it takes a long time to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.340 
parents because it takes a long time to
do<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.550> well<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.690> true<00:02:21.959> if<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.320> a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
do it well that is true if you have a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.110 
do it well that is true if you have a
lot<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.560> prosper<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> thing<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.910> only

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
lot of prosper the thing is you only

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.170 
lot of prosper the thing is you only
have<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.810> once<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.550> let's<00:02:26.670> say<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:26.910> want

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
have to do it once so let's say I want

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.690 
have to do it once so let's say I want
to<00:02:27.209> save<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:29.100> I'll<00:02:29.190> go<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.489> wire

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
to save this here so I'll go to the wire

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.509 
to save this here so I'll go to the wire
chip<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.209> doesn't<00:02:30.420> really<00:02:30.510> matter<00:02:31.280> don't<00:02:32.280> use

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
chip it doesn't really matter don't use

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.390 
chip it doesn't really matter don't use
an<00:02:32.640> expression<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:35.010> easiest

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
an expression this is the easiest

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.100 
an expression this is the easiest
because<00:02:35.519> it's<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.970> easiest<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.510> nudge<00:02:36.750> around

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
because it's the easiest to nudge around

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.930 
because it's the easiest to nudge around
and<00:02:37.320> move<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.220> I'll<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.400> put<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.610> over

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
and move so I'll just put that over

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:50.190 
and move so I'll just put that over
there<00:02:40.130> denying<00:02:41.130> our<00:02:41.340> parents<00:02:43.010> my<00:02:44.010> car<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.519> it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.400 

fucking<00:02:50.860> physics<00:02:54.750> okay<00:02:55.750> let's<00:02:56.080> just<00:02:56.200> say<00:02:56.380> you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
fucking physics okay let's just say you

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.070 
fucking physics okay let's just say you
have<00:02:57.120> no<00:02:58.120> eyesight<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.690> you're<00:02:58.810> completely

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
have no eyesight and you're completely

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.760 
have no eyesight and you're completely
blind<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:01.540> parent<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.050> but<00:03:02.350> before<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
blind and you parent it but before you

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.809 
blind and you parent it but before you
save<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.190> want<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.490> know<00:03:03.580> if<00:03:03.670> you've

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
save it you want to know if you've

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.300 
save it you want to know if you've
missed<00:03:04.090> any<00:03:04.270> props<00:03:04.630> well<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:05.860> said<00:03:05.920> this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
missed any props well like I said this

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.280 
missed any props well like I said this
is<00:03:06.490> a<00:03:06.520> good<00:03:06.760> parent<00:03:07.150> prop<00:03:07.390> because<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:08.170> can

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
is a good parent prop because you can

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.910 
is a good parent prop because you can
use<00:03:08.440> easy<00:03:08.709> precision<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:11.170> can<00:03:11.230> nudge<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.709> into

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
use easy precision you can nudge it into

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.890 
use easy precision you can nudge it into
the<00:03:12.160> air<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:13.090> find<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.450> props<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.780> you

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
the air to find the props that you

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.520 
the air to find the props that you
haven't<00:03:14.320> got<00:03:15.810> then<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:16.900> select<00:03:17.080> them<00:03:17.440> with

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
haven't got then you select them with

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.020 
haven't got then you select them with
parent<00:03:19.500> then<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.620> move<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.370> parent<00:03:21.910> ship

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
parent then you move the parent ship

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.800 
parent then you move the parent ship
back<00:03:22.300> down

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.780 

and<00:03:27.290> then<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:28.250> can<00:03:28.400> save<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:30.160> do<00:03:31.160> whatever<00:03:31.580> the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
and then you can save it do whatever the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.600 
and then you can save it do whatever the
hell<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:32.060> want<00:03:32.270> with<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.450> now<00:03:32.810> let's<00:03:33.140> say

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
hell you want with it now let's say

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.280 
hell you want with it now let's say
every<00:03:34.610> time<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:34.910> spawn<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.780> don't<00:03:36.020> spawn

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
every time you spawn it you don't spawn

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.780 
every time you spawn it you don't spawn
it<00:03:36.410> without<00:03:36.620> constraints<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.400> spawn<00:03:37.640> it

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
it without constraints you spawn it

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.130 
it without constraints you spawn it
parented<00:03:38.150> like<00:03:38.300> this<00:03:38.510> let's<00:03:38.750> say<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:38.900> want<00:03:39.110> to

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
parented like this let's say you want to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.949 
parented like this let's say you want to
add<00:03:39.200> on<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.740> right<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.180> lot<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.569> time

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
add on to it right so a lot of time

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.010 
add on to it right so a lot of time
building<00:03:42.350> on<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.740> adding<00:03:43.220> all<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.459> shit<00:03:44.020> and

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
building on it adding all this shit and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.420 
building on it adding all this shit and
like<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.200> said<00:03:45.319> you<00:03:45.650> only<00:03:45.770> have<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.010> parent<00:03:46.340> it

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
like I said you only have to parent it

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.880 
like I said you only have to parent it
once<00:03:46.730> every<00:03:47.600> once<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.050> while<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.680> want<00:03:48.830> to

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
once every once in a while you want to

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.100 
once every once in a while you want to
take<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.160> props<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.550> made<00:03:49.870> parenting<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.989> the

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
take the props you made parenting to the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.420 
take the props you made parenting to the
chip<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:51.520> then<00:03:52.520> save<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:55.280> then

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
chip and then save it and then

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.790 
chip and then save it and then
eventually<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:57.110> get<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.380> your<00:03:57.440> finished

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
eventually you get to your finished

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.259 
eventually you get to your finished
product<00:03:58.220> which<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.640> body<00:03:58.880> it's<00:03:59.120> not

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
product which is the body it's not

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.120 
product which is the body it's not
functioning<00:03:59.900> it's<00:04:00.080> just<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.440> model<00:04:00.890> which

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
functioning it's just a model which

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.250 
functioning it's just a model which
means<00:04:01.370> all<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.760> props<00:04:02.030> are<00:04:02.180> parented<00:04:02.750> there's

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
means all the props are parented there's

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.220 
means all the props are parented there's
no<00:04:03.410> physics<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.750> all<00:04:05.750> right<00:04:05.900> now<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.050> got

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
no physics to it all right now you got

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.350 
no physics to it all right now you got
this<00:04:06.470> let's<00:04:06.769> say<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.040> don't<00:04:07.370> like<00:04:07.640> where<00:04:08.330> this

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
this let's say you don't like where this

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.720 
this let's say you don't like where this
prop<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.780> placed<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.769> want<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.040> move<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.370> well

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
prop is placed you want to move it well

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.300 
prop is placed you want to move it well
its<00:04:10.880> parent<00:04:11.209> is<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.510> can't<00:04:11.750> do<00:04:11.900> that<00:04:12.080> right<00:04:12.310> so

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
its parent is you can't do that right so

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.790 
its parent is you can't do that right so
that<00:04:13.459> means<00:04:13.610> you<00:04:13.910> got<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.090> unparent<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.870> so

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
that means you got to unparent it so

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.289 
that means you got to unparent it so
what<00:04:15.920> we<00:04:16.010> do<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.340> we'll<00:04:16.519> remove<00:04:16.850> it<00:04:17.060> on<00:04:17.209> the

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
what we do is we'll remove it on the

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.030 
what we do is we'll remove it on the
other<00:04:17.419> side<00:04:17.540> because<00:04:18.470> you've<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.680> mirrored

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
other side because you've you mirrored

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.530 
other side because you've you mirrored
it<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.519> can't<00:04:19.760> mirror<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.150> parent<00:04:20.450> to

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
it and you can't mirror a parent to

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.680 
it and you can't mirror a parent to
problem<00:04:21.460> and<00:04:22.460> we<00:04:22.550> can<00:04:22.669> unparent<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.300> first

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
problem and we can unparent it first

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.150 
problem and we can unparent it first
thing<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.050> want<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.290> do<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.889> this<00:04:25.040> is

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
thing you want to do and this is

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.680 
thing you want to do and this is
important<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:25.880> want<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.120> make<00:04:26.270> sure<00:04:26.300> it's

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
important you want to make sure it's

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.930 
important you want to make sure it's
frozen<00:04:27.050> or<00:04:27.500> else<00:04:28.280> when<00:04:28.430> you're<00:04:28.490> on<00:04:28.580> parent

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
frozen or else when you're on parent

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.129 
frozen or else when you're on parent
it's<00:04:29.180> gonna<00:04:29.300> fall<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.870> floor

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
it's gonna fall to the floor

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.360 
it's gonna fall to the floor
then<00:04:31.100> you<00:04:31.190> go<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.340> wire<00:04:31.669> sound<00:04:32.180> emitter<00:04:33.370> and

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
then you go to wire sound emitter and

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.520 
then you go to wire sound emitter and
you<00:04:34.460> press<00:04:34.669> R<00:04:34.970> on<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.270> prop<00:04:35.540> now<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.380> son

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
you press R on the prop now it son

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.159 
you press R on the prop now it son
parented<00:04:37.120> let's<00:04:38.120> say<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.330> want<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.660> put<00:04:39.080> it

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
parented let's say you want to put it

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.920 
parented let's say you want to put it
wherever<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.500> hell<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.770> want<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.780> then

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
wherever the hell you want and then

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.650 
wherever the hell you want and then
you'll<00:04:42.110> mirror<00:04:42.410> it<00:04:42.650> back<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:45.020> hell<00:04:45.229> it<00:04:45.380> is<00:04:45.560> and

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
you'll mirror it back the hell it is and

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.570 
you'll mirror it back the hell it is and
then<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:47.780> parent<00:04:48.169> it<00:04:48.320> back<00:04:49.039> again<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.520> your

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
then you parent it back again to your

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.110 
then you parent it back again to your
prop

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
prop

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.460 
prop
and<00:04:51.600> then<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.810> save<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:53.780> now<00:04:54.780> let's<00:04:55.230> say

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
and then you save it now let's say

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.879 
and then you save it now let's say
you've<00:04:55.980> gotten<00:04:56.220> along<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:56.820> chassis<00:04:57.090> right

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
you've gotten along to the chassis right

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.590 
you've gotten along to the chassis right
let's<00:04:58.889> say<00:04:59.070> this<00:04:59.340> here<00:04:59.699> is<00:04:59.820> your<00:04:59.940> chassis<00:05:00.210> all

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
let's say this here is your chassis all

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.230 
let's say this here is your chassis all
your<00:05:00.810> shits<00:05:01.199> attached<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:02.060> well<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.120> know

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
your shits attached to it well I know

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.850 
your shits attached to it well I know
it's<00:05:03.419> inside<00:05:03.720> your<00:05:03.870> car<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.199> can't<00:05:04.410> get<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.830> it

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
it's inside your car you can't get to it

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.610 
it's inside your car you can't get to it
remember<00:05:05.820> what<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.180> saw<00:05:06.389> I<00:05:06.419> said<00:05:06.900> about<00:05:07.320> the

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
remember what I saw I said about the

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.700 
remember what I saw I said about the
nudging<00:05:08.660> so<00:05:09.660> your<00:05:09.810> whole<00:05:09.960> chassis<00:05:10.199> is<00:05:10.500> under

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
nudging so your whole chassis is under

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.580 
nudging so your whole chassis is under
there<00:05:11.540> well<00:05:12.540> obviously<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.990> didn't<00:05:13.169> parents<00:05:13.500> it

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
there well obviously I didn't parents it

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
there well obviously I didn't parents it
to<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:14.180> because<00:05:15.180> this<00:05:15.300> was<00:05:15.479> an<00:05:15.570> example

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
to that because this was an example

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
let's say you're uh this is you chassis

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.060 
let's say you're uh this is you chassis
is<00:05:20.130> under<00:05:20.340> there

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
is under there

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
mean you can work on your chassis you

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.700 
mean you can work on your chassis you
can<00:05:27.680> spam<00:05:28.680> your<00:05:28.860> wheels<00:05:29.070> all<00:05:29.280> over<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:30.710> all

testing it and you just want to drive it

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.580 
testing it and you just want to drive it
around<00:05:38.389> now<00:05:39.389> the<00:05:39.450> thing<00:05:39.780> is<00:05:39.930> when<00:05:40.139> you<00:05:40.200> parent

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
around now the thing is when you parent

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.050 
around now the thing is when you parent
stuff<00:05:40.830> if<00:05:41.070> you<00:05:41.190> don't<00:05:41.220> right<00:05:41.610> click<00:05:41.880> no

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
ground the physics old will collide with

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.240 
ground the physics old will collide with
each<00:05:46.050> other<00:05:46.289> and<00:05:46.620> they<00:05:47.190> won't<00:05:47.430> go<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:48.030> sleep<00:05:49.250> so

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
each other and they won't go to sleep so

quite all you click your entire

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.700 
quite all you click your entire
contraption<00:05:59.660> all<00:06:00.660> right<00:06:00.900> now<00:06:01.320> let's<00:06:01.530> say<00:06:01.650> you

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
contraption all right now let's say you

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.850 
contraption all right now let's say you
don't<00:06:01.889> want<00:06:02.039> the<00:06:02.280> wheels<00:06:02.720> to<00:06:03.720> I'm<00:06:04.410> sorry<00:06:04.770> you

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
don't want the wheels to I'm sorry you

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.440 
don't want the wheels to I'm sorry you
want<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.220> wheels<00:06:05.400> to<00:06:05.580> collide<00:06:05.880> with<00:06:05.910> things

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
want the wheels to collide with things

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.550 
want the wheels to collide with things
so<00:06:06.780> you<00:06:06.900> just<00:06:07.050> unselect<00:06:07.770> them<00:06:08.930> so<00:06:09.930> you<00:06:09.990> can<00:06:10.200> run

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
so you just unselect them so you can run

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.790 
so you just unselect them so you can run
over<00:06:10.680> many<00:06:10.979> black<00:06:11.220> people<00:06:12.349> and<00:06:13.349> then<00:06:13.500> you<00:06:13.620> got

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
over many black people and then you got

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.310 
over many black people and then you got
it<00:06:13.919> like<00:06:14.010> that<00:06:14.070> right<00:06:14.580> now<00:06:15.210> when<00:06:15.870> you<00:06:15.960> unfreeze

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
it like that right now when you unfreeze

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.469 
it like that right now when you unfreeze
it<00:06:16.380> well<00:06:17.280> your<00:06:17.400> physics<00:06:17.789> all<00:06:17.940> will<00:06:18.090> fall<00:06:18.240> to

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
it well your physics all will fall to

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.210 
it well your physics all will fall to
the<00:06:18.599> ground<00:06:18.630> but<00:06:19.139> they<00:06:19.440> won't<00:06:19.650> collide<00:06:19.979> with

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
the ground but they won't collide with

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.550 
the ground but they won't collide with
anything<00:06:20.570> and<00:06:21.570> now<00:06:21.720> your<00:06:21.900> car<00:06:22.050> is<00:06:22.169> complete

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
anything and now your car is complete

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.990 
anything and now your car is complete
and<00:06:24.169> that<00:06:25.169> should<00:06:25.410> conclude<00:06:25.650> it<00:06:26.039> if<00:06:26.760> you<00:06:26.880> have

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
and that should conclude it if you have

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.310 
and that should conclude it if you have
any<00:06:27.150> questions<00:06:27.570> just<00:06:27.720> ask<00:06:28.200> me<00:06:28.650> in<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:28.889> comment
