talk about bioidentical hormones well

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.370 
talk about bioidentical hormones well
well<00:01:47.610> what's<00:01:47.880> interesting<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.350> only

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
well what's interesting is I not only

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.100 
well what's interesting is I not only
took<00:01:49.799> these<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.880> bioidentical<00:01:51.689> hormones

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
took these and the bioidentical hormones

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.850 
took these and the bioidentical hormones
but<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.490> helped<00:01:53.820> me<00:01:54.060> nutritionally<00:01:55.020> also<00:01:55.470> so

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
but you helped me nutritionally also so

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.249 
but you helped me nutritionally also so
he's<00:01:56.219> very<00:01:56.430> important<00:01:56.820> yes<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.719> did<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
he's very important yes so I I did a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.060 
he's very important yes so I I did a
full<00:01:58.740> global<00:01:59.549> approach<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> things<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
full global approach to things and I

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.910 
full global approach to things and I
would<00:02:02.310> say<00:02:02.579> within<00:02:03.560> probably<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.649> two

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
would say within probably about two

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.869 
would say within probably about two
weeks<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.460> hot<00:02:05.610> flashes<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.479> disappear<00:02:07.879> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
weeks the hot flashes just disappear the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.790 
weeks the hot flashes just disappear the
benefits<00:02:09.330> sleeping<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.080> could<00:02:10.259> finally<00:02:10.500> sleep

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
benefits sleeping I could finally sleep

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.860 
benefits sleeping I could finally sleep
with<00:02:11.160> there

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870

just to sleep at night so things were

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.339 
just to sleep at night so things were
just<00:02:16.010> piling<00:02:16.580> up<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.540> way<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.720> was<00:02:17.900> able<00:02:17.959> to

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
biomechanical hormones I've been doing

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.050 
biomechanical hormones I've been doing
it<00:02:31.970> for<00:02:32.209> three<00:02:32.420> years<00:02:32.659> now<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.730> mean<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.819> make

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.580 
age well as your opinion in my opinion
yes<00:02:46.760> because<00:02:47.299> once<00:02:47.750> we<00:02:47.930> start<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.290> replenish

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
yes because once we start to replenish

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.819 
yes because once we start to replenish
the<00:02:48.829> hormones<00:02:49.220> as<00:02:49.549> we<00:02:49.819> age<00:02:50.000> our<00:02:50.560> homes<00:02:51.560> start

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
the hormones as we age our homes start

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.349 
the hormones as we age our homes start
to<00:02:51.920> decline<00:02:52.099> with<00:02:52.459> age<00:02:52.700> but<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.030> don't<00:02:53.209> have

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
to decline with age but you don't have

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.849 
to decline with age but you don't have
to<00:02:53.510> necessarily<00:02:53.660> age<00:02:54.230> because<00:02:54.620> your<00:02:54.739> hormones

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
to necessarily age because your hormones

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.809 
to necessarily age because your hormones
decline<00:02:55.400> if<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:55.910> are<00:02:56.690> able<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.430> balance<00:02:58.430> back

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
decline if you are able to balance back

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.430 
decline if you are able to balance back
the<00:02:59.000> hormones<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.599> think<00:02:59.870> that<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.079> can<00:03:00.200> slow

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
the hormones I think that you can slow

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.960 
the hormones I think that you can slow
down<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.769> aging<00:03:01.040> process<00:03:01.190> but<00:03:01.609> you<00:03:01.700> can<00:03:01.730> also

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
down the aging process but you can also

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.559 
down the aging process but you can also
have<00:03:02.329> a<00:03:02.569> lot<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:03.019> other<00:03:03.200> health<00:03:03.290> benefits<00:03:03.799> and

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
have a lot of other health benefits and

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.170 
have a lot of other health benefits and
skin<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:05.810> most<00:03:06.379> muscle<00:03:06.920> tone<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.489> texture<00:03:07.849> is

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
skin and most muscle tone and texture is

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.880 
skin and most muscle tone and texture is
one<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.690> benefits<00:03:09.079> of<00:03:09.230> biomechanical

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
one of the benefits of biomechanical

they<00:03:39.169> just<00:03:39.379> don't<00:03:39.650> seem<00:03:39.919> to<00:03:40.069> have<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.780> get<00:03:41.780> up

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
they just don't seem to have that get up

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.210 
they just don't seem to have that get up
and<00:03:42.139> go<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.440> these<00:03:42.709> two<00:03:42.889> have<00:03:43.010> when<00:03:43.129> they

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
and go that these two have when they

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.900 
and go that these two have when they
were<00:03:43.280> younger

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
were younger

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.400 
were younger
okay<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.389> once<00:03:44.569> we<00:03:44.690> get<00:03:44.810> them<00:03:44.930> started<00:03:44.959> and

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
okay and once we get them started and

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.409 
okay and once we get them started and
not<00:03:45.829> everybody<00:03:46.370> everybody's<00:03:47.090> going<00:03:47.329> to

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
not everybody everybody's going to

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.449 
not everybody everybody's going to
respond<00:03:47.870> immediately<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.980> these<00:03:49.190> things

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
respond immediately to these things

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.039 
respond immediately to these things
because<00:03:49.760> some<00:03:49.910> people<00:03:50.180> have<00:03:50.209> had<00:03:50.480> more<00:03:50.690> damage

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
because some people have had more damage

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.890 
because some people have had more damage
than<00:03:51.169> others<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:51.889> not<00:03:52.760> everyone<00:03:53.299> is<00:03:53.449> typical

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
than others so not everyone is typical

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.390 
than others so not everyone is typical
just<00:03:54.260> like<00:03:54.379> Jennifer<00:03:54.769> is<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.010> in<00:03:55.129> two<00:03:55.250> weeks

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
just like Jennifer is that in two weeks

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.920 
just like Jennifer is that in two weeks
but<00:03:55.849> do<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.000> hear<00:03:56.180> miracle<00:03:56.510> stories<00:03:56.780> like

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
but do you hear miracle stories like

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.270 
but do you hear miracle stories like
here<00:03:57.079> I<00:03:57.109> make<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.560> stuff<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.010> they<00:03:58.069> feel

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
here I make the stuff and they feel

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.069 
here I make the stuff and they feel
great<00:03:58.489> sometimes<00:03:58.699> it<00:03:59.030> happens<00:03:59.389> overnight<00:03:59.690> and

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
great sometimes it happens overnight and

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.020 
great sometimes it happens overnight and
sometimes<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.560> takes<00:04:00.769> 3<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.220> 6<00:04:01.609> months<00:04:01.940> because

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
sometimes it takes 3 to 6 months because

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.759 
sometimes it takes 3 to 6 months because
we<00:04:02.209> have<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.690> approach<00:04:03.260> it<00:04:03.319> on<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.590> global

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
we have to approach it on a global

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.710 
we have to approach it on a global
perspective<00:04:04.160> we<00:04:04.669> have<00:04:04.849> to<00:04:04.879> look<00:04:05.060> at<00:04:05.569> their

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
perspective we have to look at their

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.180 
perspective we have to look at their
nutrition<00:04:06.199> their<00:04:06.349> supplementation<00:04:07.069> their

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
nutrition their supplementation their

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.830 
nutrition their supplementation their
activity<00:04:07.609> and<00:04:07.760> we<00:04:08.150> need<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.419> balance<00:04:08.720> out

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
activity and we need to balance out

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.330 
activity and we need to balance out
their<00:04:09.049> hormones<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.709> edge<00:04:09.889> is<00:04:10.069> more<00:04:10.250> of

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
their hormones so the edge is more of

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.860 
their hormones so the edge is more of
kind<00:04:10.489> of<00:04:10.609> like<00:04:10.730> what<00:04:10.849> an<00:04:11.359> edge<00:04:11.540> in<00:04:11.690> life

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
kind of like what an edge in life

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.229 
kind of like what an edge in life
imagine<00:04:12.560> life<00:04:12.709> well<00:04:12.949> they<00:04:13.220> recapture<00:04:14.030> some<00:04:14.209> of
