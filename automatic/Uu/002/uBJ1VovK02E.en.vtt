00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.600
 Two schemes were attached to this one and this one 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 That is, I have 2 2 options I chose with 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.960
 red poppies 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.610

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.570
 I only had a set of gamma threads 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:50.340 --> 00:01:01.859
 there are no complaints 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:08.760
 this part is completely on the chest 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:11.400
 I embroidered here that is not received 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.820
 I like the result I'm sorry 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:20.210
 that now the lighting is very bad but 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.210
 I'll try to show you 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.630
 it turned out quite well to me 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.600
 I like it, of course I will try to take it off 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.770
 licet this red green all 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.950
 it looks much brighter very very 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.799
 bright red very beautiful bright 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:02.110
 poppies of course with such artificial 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:06.319
 Illumination of this beauty is not seen 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:10.250
 let me remind you that this is already finished ready 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:12.849
 the product is such a vyshivanka here 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.989
 such here is such a insert goes 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:21.560
 canvas here here on the shoulders here 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.819
 here and on the sleeves left me saying 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.420
 just a little bit left 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.709
 but since I have this embroidered embroidering well 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:35.120
 all very, very rarely I had 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.690
 a lot of work to do later 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.010
 holidays 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:47.889
 so this result is very long 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.170
 time lapse here here 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:54.130
 start off 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:59.540
 most likely until the end of the project I am not above 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:04.069
 I don't have time because now I have a project 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:09.859
 from on embroidery signs I started it not 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:12.829
 from the 15th of the 20th so someone with 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:16.840
 girls advised that the number 20 need 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:21.560
 start all your new business all projects 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:26.630
 to the growing moon a very good day and i 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:32.470
 Begin your project on the 20th of the following 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:37.030
 Iâ€™m already going to make a video about the results 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.950
 jaw embroidery signs do not know 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.640
 will it 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.130
 before the end of the project in march ending csp 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.960
 I donâ€™t know whether to call or report 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.230
 maybe i am already living and and continue 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:57.010
 embroider in the spring so maybe it's already 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.360
 and my last report this winter 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.620
 I am very pleased with the result again 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:08.480
 I will say that of course this one here is the outline 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:12.020
 embroidery is not just well, I have prilovchilis 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:19.519
 so I'll show it to you 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:24.560
 very so very large holes outline 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:28.490
 very very canvas very loose and embroider 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.120
 I'm on the hoop but that's how I am 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:37.550
 I support the fabric and in two punctures because 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.230
 so firstly the process goes faster and 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.850
 very convenient as it is not 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.840
 starched at all 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.930
 the canvas and the crosses are exactly the same 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.630
 even better when I embroider in this way 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.850
 because on starched in two 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.669
 holes then there are two punctures not 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:01.280
 it turns out it is so soft 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:04.010
 so here on the hoop a little bit to not 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.800
 strong stretch was slack canvas 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:16.550
 and two punctures higher without problems 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:18.710
 very fast since i was embroidering in 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.660
 basically well, here it is, I dropped it in the fall 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.010
 yes this one is a piece 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.890
 and here is what I have here an awl in principle 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.990
 this month 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.890
 in the morning before work literally 15 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:38.540
 minutes sometimes they embroidered every day 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:41.530
 since i get up very much frame 6 can by 6 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.350
 get up 5 and here 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:53.570
 I can raise 15-20 by myself 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:59.440
 allow so who will buy in 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:02.410
 such preparations prepare for that 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.720
 may have a little bit 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.650
 Get a handle on this embroidery on such 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.220
 here is kombi 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.830
 well, at first I was right here 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.480
 this piece is somehow complicated and then 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.200
 got used to nothing 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:24.290
 and in principle already the crosses have gone more 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:30.370
 straight here so it will be visible to me 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:34.760
 little curves here already in general 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:37.300
 Enough is enough to go. 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.300
 crosses 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:51.530
 thank you for watching the video to the end 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:55.280
 stayed with me who was interested 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:58.260
 I wish you every success 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.430
 good mood see you soon 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.430
 bye Bye
