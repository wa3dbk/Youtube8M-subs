00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
2011 today on bill beings trumpet talk I

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.629 
2011 today on bill beings trumpet talk I
thought<00:00:07.830> it'd<00:00:07.919> be<00:00:07.950> helpful<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.309> talk<00:00:08.519> about

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
thought it'd be helpful to talk about

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.549 
thought it'd be helpful to talk about
alternate<00:00:09.210> fingering<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.809> order<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.170> develop

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
alternate fingering in order to develop

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.249 
alternate fingering in order to develop
the<00:00:11.280> independence<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> third<00:00:12.389> finger<00:00:12.780> and

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
the independence of the third finger and

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.289 
the independence of the third finger and
this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.070> not<00:00:14.219> original

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
this is not original

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.540 
this is not original
it's<00:00:15.780> from<00:00:16.440> Claude<00:00:16.680> Gordon<00:00:17.039> when<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.279> study

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
it's from Claude Gordon when I study

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.760 
it's from Claude Gordon when I study
with<00:00:17.699> Claude<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.900> know<00:00:18.960> Claude<00:00:19.380> started

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
with Claude and I know Claude started

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.859 
with Claude and I know Claude started
with<00:00:19.859> her<00:00:19.980> bonel<00:00:20.250> Clark<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.240> perhaps<00:00:21.570> he<00:00:21.779> got

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
with her bonel Clark so perhaps he got

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.390 
with her bonel Clark so perhaps he got
it<00:00:22.080> from<00:00:22.170> her<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.350> uh<00:00:22.500> Clark<00:00:22.830> I'm<00:00:23.039> not<00:00:23.189> sure

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
it from her but uh Clark I'm not sure

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880 
it from her but uh Clark I'm not sure
about<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.170> did<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.350> me<00:00:25.619> was

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
about that but what it did for me was

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.800 
about that but what it did for me was
help<00:00:26.310> develop<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> independence<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
help develop the independence of the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.800 
help develop the independence of the
third<00:00:28.380> finger<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.570> while<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.599> haven't

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
third finger and while I haven't

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.450 
third finger and while I haven't
practiced<00:00:31.050> these<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.679> quite<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.920> few<00:00:32.189> years

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
practiced these for quite a few years

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.000 
practiced these for quite a few years
I'm<00:00:32.730> hoping<00:00:33.030> that'll<00:00:33.360> come<00:00:33.540> back<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.960> me<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.550> I

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
I'm hoping that'll come back to me and I

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.549 
I'm hoping that'll come back to me and I
should<00:00:38.010> add<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:39.110> another<00:00:40.110> thing<00:00:40.290> Claude

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
should add that another thing Claude

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.319 
should add that another thing Claude
would<00:00:40.950> say<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> lift<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.670> fingers<00:00:41.969> high<00:00:42.149> and

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
would say is lift your fingers high and

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.420 
would say is lift your fingers high and
strike<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.600> valves<00:00:42.989> hard<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:44.100> when<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> first

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
strike your valves hard and when I first

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.240 
strike your valves hard and when I first
heard<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> thought<00:00:45.570> well<00:00:46.039> how<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
heard that that I thought well how can I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.600 
heard that that I thought well how can I
do<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.610> play<00:00:47.850> fast<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
do that and play fast so what I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.910 
do that and play fast so what I
discovered<00:00:57.239> was<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.230> faster<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.739> go

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
discovered was that the faster you go

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.940 
discovered was that the faster you go
the<00:00:58.949> closer<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> valves<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.449> fingers<00:01:06.950> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the closer to the valves the fingers so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620 
the closer to the valves the fingers so
as<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:08.490> fast<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.970> fingers<00:01:09.240> stay<00:01:09.390> closer

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
as you go fast the fingers stay closer

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.940 
as you go fast the fingers stay closer
to<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> valves<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.799> habit

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to the valves but you get in the habit

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.500 
to the valves but you get in the habit
of<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.400> banging<00:01:11.610> down<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> valves<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
of really banging down the valves for a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
of really banging down the valves for a
cleaner<00:01:12.810> sound<00:01:13.189> which<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.850> helpful

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
cleaner sound which it's helpful

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.520 
cleaner sound which it's helpful
especially<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.630> younger<00:01:15.900> players<00:01:16.229> who<00:01:16.409> have

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
especially for younger players who have

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.960 
especially for younger players who have
a<00:01:16.560> tendency<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.009> kind<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.340> mush<00:01:17.549> down<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
a tendency to kind of mush down the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.570 
a tendency to kind of mush down the
vowels<00:01:18.330> while<00:01:19.290> getting<00:01:19.530> under<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> subject

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
for today the alternate fingerings for

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.410 
for today the alternate fingerings for
the<00:01:22.799> developing<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> third<00:01:23.490> finger

and one and three four G and you keep
the<00:02:48.670> first<00:02:48.849> valve<00:02:49.090> down<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.480> whole<00:02:49.629> time<00:02:49.870> on

that<00:02:50.170> study<00:02:50.470> they're<00:02:51.220> really<00:02:51.610> good<00:02:51.970> exercises

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
that study they're really good exercises

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.580 
that study they're really good exercises
and<00:02:54.510> some<00:02:55.510> other<00:02:55.660> time<00:02:55.900> perhaps<00:02:55.930> I'll<00:02:56.440> talk

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
and some other time perhaps I'll talk

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.339 
and some other time perhaps I'll talk
about<00:02:56.620> alternate<00:02:57.549> fingerings<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.349> normal

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
about alternate fingerings on normal

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.039 
about alternate fingerings on normal
regular<00:02:59.680> notes<00:02:59.890> like<00:03:00.069> e-flat<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:00.900> using<00:03:01.900> two

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
regular notes like e-flat so using two

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.449 
regular notes like e-flat so using two
and<00:03:02.230> three<00:03:02.379> instead<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.680> two<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.980> might<00:03:03.340> have

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
and three instead of two I might have

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.650 
and three instead of two I might have
talked<00:03:03.760> about<00:03:03.879> that<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:04.209> one<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.359> my<00:03:04.569> other

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
talked about that on one of my other

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.180 
talked about that on one of my other
trumpet<00:03:05.079> talks<00:03:05.400> but<00:03:06.400> for<00:03:06.970> now<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.620> for<00:03:08.920> today

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
trumpet talks but for now and for today

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.400 
trumpet talks but for now and for today
perhaps<00:03:10.180> that's<00:03:10.480> enough<00:03:10.810> information

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
perhaps that's enough information

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.410 
perhaps that's enough information
that'll<00:03:12.099> keep<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.430> busy<00:03:12.549> for<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.940> while<00:03:13.150> I'm

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
that'll keep you busy for a while I'm

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:28.080 
that'll keep you busy for a while I'm
sure<00:03:13.690> if<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.019> haven't<00:03:14.170> done<00:03:14.319> these<00:03:14.440> before

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.479 

and<00:03:28.599> I<00:03:29.470> think<00:03:29.680> those<00:03:29.890> are<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.069> ones<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.400> I've

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
and I think those are the ones that I've

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.119 
and I think those are the ones that I've
used<00:03:30.519> primarily<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.800> maybe<00:03:32.800> I'll<00:03:32.920> have<00:03:32.950> to

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
used primarily and maybe I'll have to

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.619 
used primarily and maybe I'll have to
start<00:03:33.340> practicing<00:03:33.489> they'll<00:03:33.970> speak<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:34.569> I

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
start practicing they'll speak it so I

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.600 
start practicing they'll speak it so I
can<00:03:34.810> play<00:03:35.019> them<00:03:35.170> better<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.650> faster<00:03:35.800> but<00:03:36.489> in

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
can play them better and faster but in

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.920 
can play them better and faster but in
the<00:03:36.670> meantime<00:03:36.849> you<00:03:37.239> get<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.480> work<00:03:37.629> on<00:03:37.780> those

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
the meantime you get to work on those

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.960 
the meantime you get to work on those
and<00:03:38.170> see<00:03:38.290> if<00:03:38.379> that<00:03:38.530> doesn't<00:03:38.709> help<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.099> okay<00:03:39.940> I

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
and see if that doesn't help you okay I

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.690 
and see if that doesn't help you okay I
