00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
way we learn technical football skills

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.040 
way we learn technical football skills
very<00:00:32.250> difficult<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:32.910> an<00:00:33.059> a4<00:00:33.600> sheet<00:00:33.630> or<00:00:34.020> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
very difficult from an a4 sheet or a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.350 
very difficult from an a4 sheet or a
book<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.920> even<00:00:35.250> quite<00:00:35.760> difficult<00:00:35.940> from<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
book and even quite difficult from a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.380 
book and even quite difficult from a
video<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.989> i<00:00:37.020> came<00:00:37.440> across<00:00:38.239> motion<00:00:39.239> capture

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
video so i came across motion capture

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.750 
video so i came across motion capture
technology<00:00:39.890> where<00:00:40.890> i<00:00:40.920> thought<00:00:41.219> well<00:00:41.399> that's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
technology where i thought well that's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 
technology where i thought well that's
great<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.300> i<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.870> capture<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.710> human

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
great because i can capture the human

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.610 
great because i can capture the human
movements<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.690> then<00:00:45.690> put<00:00:46.320> them<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
movements and then put them in a

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.380 
movements and then put them in a
software<00:00:46.980> program<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.760> their<00:00:47.910> computer

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
software program and on their computer

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
software program and on their computer
they<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.930> learn<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> technical<00:00:50.250> skills

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
they can learn all the technical skills

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.610

notice<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:39.139> think<00:01:40.219> learning<00:01:41.219> this<00:01:41.369> way<00:01:41.639> it's

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
notice I think learning this way it's

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.899 
notice I think learning this way it's
it's<00:01:42.599> it's<00:01:42.869> fun<00:01:43.139> and<00:01:43.499> at<00:01:43.919> the<00:01:44.039> same<00:01:44.249> time<00:01:44.310> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it's it's fun and at the same time it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.269 
it's it's fun and at the same time it
encourages<00:01:45.599> you<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.079> go<00:01:46.529> outside<00:01:46.739> and<00:01:47.099> learn

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:47.279 
encourages you to go outside and learn

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:48.859 
encourages you to go outside and learn
the<00:01:47.489> skill<00:01:47.700> because<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.149> looks<00:01:48.329> attractive

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the skill because it looks attractive

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.599 
the skill because it looks attractive
yeah<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:50.039> nice<00:01:50.249> and<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:52.200> think<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.739> goes<00:01:53.399> very

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
yeah it's nice and I think it goes very
