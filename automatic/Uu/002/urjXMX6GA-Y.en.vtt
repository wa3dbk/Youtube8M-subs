multi-generational issue you know
something<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.109> we<00:01:18.229> might<00:01:18.439> be<00:01:18.619> able<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.920> just

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
something that we might be able to just

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.669 
something that we might be able to just
go<00:01:19.429> in<00:01:19.609> blast<00:01:20.509> with<00:01:20.749> a<00:01:20.780> bunch<00:01:21.020> of<00:01:21.079> bombs<00:01:21.350> and

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
go in blast with a bunch of bombs and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.879 
go in blast with a bunch of bombs and
eradicate<00:01:22.549> Isis<00:01:23.270> from<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:24.109> area<00:01:24.469> it's<00:01:24.649> not

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:24.889 
eradicate Isis from the area it's not

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:26.260 
eradicate Isis from the area it's not
gonna<00:01:25.069> be<00:01:25.189> like<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.459> so<00:01:25.639> I<00:01:25.670> think<00:01:25.789> that<00:01:26.030> this

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
gonna be like that so I think that this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.599 
gonna be like that so I think that this
is<00:01:26.479> Ana<00:01:26.689> strategy<00:01:27.139> from<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:28.130> Iranian

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
is Ana strategy from the Iranian

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.469 
is Ana strategy from the Iranian
government<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.149> Iran<00:01:29.509> an<00:01:29.659> establishment<00:01:30.289> to

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
government and Iran an establishment to

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.899 
government and Iran an establishment to
deter<00:01:32.479> any<00:01:33.009> possible<00:01:34.009> interest<00:01:34.310> from<00:01:34.549> younger

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
deter any possible interest from younger

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.859 
deter any possible interest from younger
generations<00:01:35.509> to<00:01:36.429> join<00:01:37.429> Isis<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.509> other<00:01:38.659> way

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
generations to join Isis the other way

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.719 
generations to join Isis the other way
that<00:01:39.139> I<00:01:39.409> think<00:01:39.679> about<00:01:39.799> this<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.670> is

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
that I think about this is that this is

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.580 
that I think about this is that this is
obvious<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.779> influence<00:01:42.469> of<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.740> West

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
obvious the influence of the West

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.859 
obvious the influence of the West
infiltrating<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.279> the<00:01:46.549> Muslim<00:01:46.969> world<00:01:47.209> to

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
infiltrating the the Muslim world to

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.870 
infiltrating the the Muslim world to
create<00:01:48.079> opinions<00:01:48.679> about<00:01:48.859> something<00:01:49.279> that<00:01:49.609> is

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
create opinions about something that is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.819 
create opinions about something that is
being<00:01:50.209> judged<00:01:50.509> within<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.229> culture<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:51.770> the

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
being judged within that culture and the

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.199 
being judged within that culture and the
Muslims<00:01:52.279> right<00:01:52.459> is<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.670> first<00:01:52.700> time<00:01:53.060> that

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
Muslims right is the first time that

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.749 
Muslims right is the first time that
Muslims<00:01:53.929> are<00:01:54.079> judging<00:01:54.649> other<00:01:54.979> Muslims

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
Muslims are judging other Muslims

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.080 
Muslims are judging other Muslims
without<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.810> West<00:01:57.049> saying<00:01:57.289> oh<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:58.009> is<00:01:58.189> well

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
without the West saying oh this is well

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.489 
without the West saying oh this is well
I<00:01:59.119> mean<00:01:59.270> we<00:01:59.389> did<00:01:59.539> kind<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.779> start<00:01:59.899> it<00:02:00.079> in<00:02:00.169> a<00:02:00.289> whim

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
insight because I'm I'm stumped

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.479 
insight because I'm I'm stumped
I<00:03:45.840> think<00:03:46.080> all<00:03:46.290> these<00:03:46.500> things<00:03:46.560> they<00:03:47.040> need<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.280> be

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
I think all these things they need to be

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.630 
I think all these things they need to be
looked<00:03:48.060> at<00:03:48.180> very<00:03:48.239> carefully<00:03:48.660> because<00:03:49.640> there

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
looked at very carefully because there

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.910 
looked at very carefully because there
are<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:51.090> lot<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.540> influences<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:52.380> might<00:03:52.769> be

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
are a lot of influences that might be

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.680 
are a lot of influences that might be
playing<00:03:53.160> underneath<00:03:53.700> all<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.299> these<00:03:54.450> events

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
playing underneath all of these events

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.110 
playing underneath all of these events
these<00:03:55.530> very<00:03:56.070> easily<00:03:56.160> can<00:03:56.670> be<00:03:56.790> turned<00:03:57.060> into

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
these very easily can be turned into

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.120 
these very easily can be turned into
propaganda<00:03:57.420> we've<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.380> reported<00:03:58.799> not<00:03:58.950> long

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
propaganda we've you reported not long

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.770 
propaganda we've you reported not long
ago<00:03:59.280> about<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.760> propaganda<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.480> u.s.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
ago about the propaganda that the u.s.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.680 
ago about the propaganda that the u.s.
dropped<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.410> an<00:04:02.100> Iraqi<00:04:02.489> city<00:04:02.850> with<00:04:03.510> these

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
dropped on an Iraqi city with these

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.850 
dropped on an Iraqi city with these
depictions<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.380> Isis<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:05.070> caricature<00:04:06.000> that

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
depictions of Isis in caricature that

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.080 
depictions of Isis in caricature that
amount<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:07.920> propaganda<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.580> think<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:08.910> is

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
amount to propaganda so I think this is

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.460 
amount to propaganda so I think this is
a<00:04:09.120> little<00:04:09.480> bit<00:04:09.600> of<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.810> going<00:04:10.080> on<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.410> think

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
a little bit of that going on I think

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.340 
a little bit of that going on I think
there<00:04:10.739> is<00:04:10.769> some<00:04:11.370> Western<00:04:12.180> interests<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:13.200> are

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
there is some Western interests that are

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.680 
there is some Western interests that are
they're<00:04:13.739> trying<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.310> confuse<00:04:14.580> public<00:04:15.269> opinion

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
they're trying to confuse public opinion

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.409 
they're trying to confuse public opinion
they<00:04:16.140> create<00:04:16.590> these<00:04:16.769> events<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.419> cartoons

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
they create these events and cartoons

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.550 
they create these events and cartoons
are<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> great<00:04:18.989> way<00:04:19.169> because<00:04:19.470> they're

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
are a great way because they're

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.560 
are a great way because they're
universal<00:04:20.160> they<00:04:20.250> can<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.519> reach<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.090> read<00:04:21.299> in

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
universal they can be reach and read in

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.270 
universal they can be reach and read in
any<00:04:21.870> language<00:04:22.140> so<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.800> think<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:23.099> is

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
any language so I think this is

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.250 
any language so I think this is
something<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:24.090> needs<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.360> be<00:04:24.419> taken

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
something that needs to be taken

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.750 
something that needs to be taken
seriously

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
seriously

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.750 
seriously
in<00:04:26.850> terms<00:04:27.150> of<00:04:27.680> being<00:04:28.680> critical<00:04:29.220> about<00:04:29.400> who<00:04:29.610> is

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
in terms of being critical about who is

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.730 
in terms of being critical about who is
putting<00:04:29.970> this<00:04:30.120> up<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.600> why<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.020> need<00:04:31.290> to

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
putting this up and why is it need to

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.970 
putting this up and why is it need to
put<00:04:32.010> more<00:04:32.300> Isis<00:04:33.530> advertising<00:04:34.530> yeah<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.830> know

denier<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:00.510> also<00:05:00.720> at<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:00.930> same<00:05:01.080> time<00:05:01.140> I

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
denier and so also at the same time I

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.590 
denier and so also at the same time I
would<00:05:02.130> think<00:05:02.700> that<00:05:02.910> it's<00:05:03.060> safe<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.480> assume

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
would think that it's safe to assume

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.510 
would think that it's safe to assume
that<00:05:04.200> these<00:05:04.470> were<00:05:04.590> probably<00:05:04.770> Iranian

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
that these were probably Iranian

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.460 
that these were probably Iranian

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
on there I'm not sure but it's like

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.620 
on there I'm not sure but it's like
maybe<00:05:10.290> waiting<00:05:10.770> both<00:05:11.130> as<00:05:11.340> a<00:05:11.370> threat<00:05:11.790> Isis<00:05:12.450> -

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630
