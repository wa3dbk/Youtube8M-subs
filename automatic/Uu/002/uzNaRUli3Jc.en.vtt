00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
think that the law is can't have a blade

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.000 
think that the law is can't have a blade
of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.430> either<00:00:59.609> six-inch<00:01:00.239> blade<00:01:01.010> you

of the it's either six-inch blade you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
of the it's either six-inch blade you
can't<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> knife<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.730> either<00:01:02.910> a

I<00:02:31.230> got<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.220> didn't<00:02:33.060> expect<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> be

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
I got it and I didn't expect it to be

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.720 
I got it and I didn't expect it to be
heavy<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.410> didn't<00:02:34.680> expect<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.250> as<00:02:35.459> heavy

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
heavy I didn't expect it to be as heavy

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.670 
heavy I didn't expect it to be as heavy
as<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.360> mean<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:37.260> called<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.500> heavy

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
as it is I mean it's called the heavy

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.580 
as it is I mean it's called the heavy
weight<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.220> guess<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:39.769> kind<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.950> your<00:02:41.220> warned

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.560 
weight so I guess a kind of your warned
it's<00:02:43.590> heavy<00:02:43.769> though<00:02:44.040> I've<00:02:44.610> been<00:02:44.640> flipping<00:02:45.450> it

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570
