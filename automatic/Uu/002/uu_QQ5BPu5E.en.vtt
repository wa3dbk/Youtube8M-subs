00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:10.910
 official channel on yutube everything all ru 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:14.759
 on YouTube we solve the 35th task 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.070
 write all three-digit numbers in the record 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.560
 which includes only numbers 0 2 and 5 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.699
 let me write a bass example first 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.160
 for example 225 is a three-digit number 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:33.110
 a record which includes only numbers 2 and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.239
 5 and 0 and there should be only three digits 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 three digits as you guess 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.450
 a three-digit number cannot begin with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.739
 zero of you will be for example 025 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.890
 it will not be a three-digit number 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.270
 because it starts with 0 this is not a discharge 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.510
 considered so we will only 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.760
 two-digit number so that their numbers 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.129
 0 2 and 5 make exactly three digits 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.280
 numbers number must start either 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:04.650
 two or five or 225 or 525 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.659
 for example or 552 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.960
 It began to build or whether you are from 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.020
 fives from scratch does not start it 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.820
 such a first first nuance let's 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.520
 let's try to make up all the numbers 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.159
 which consist of three digits 0 2 and 5 and 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:28.430
 three digits well let's think for example 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.430
 200 202 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:48.140
 205 220 225 250 252 255 missed another 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.320
 222 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:02:04.009
 let's carefully 202 then 200 200 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:06.899
 200 2 205 220 222 225 250 252 255 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:12.560
 well, everything can be moreover 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.560
 500 502 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:21.299
 505 525 522 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:33.810
 525 550 552 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:36.609
 and 555 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.959
 let's check ourselves should we 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.530
 left in the right column is the same 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:49.230
 the amount everything will turn out two three 4 5 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:51.579
 6 7 8 9 and here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.329
 equally get everything right 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:58.540
 do what I wrote it now 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.419
 in general, all the numbers that are three-digit 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.180
 consist of numbers from numbers apologize 0 2 and 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.469
 5 let's now choose from them only 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.639
 even ones 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:11.650
 under the letter and that I just wrote out everything 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:15.189
 numbers that could be compiled 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.540
 and now under the letter a is divided into two of 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.379
 all of these numbers that we can 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.329
 write down 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.259
 we leave only those that are even 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.989
 let's watch 200 even 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:28.620
 202 even I'll write to the bar 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.810
 so because the line is uncomfortable for me 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:37.750
 further 205 odd because 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:44.579
 ends five 220 fits 222 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:50.949
 fit 225 not fit 250 fit 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:53.949
 225 fits 255 doesn't fit from 2 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:59.709
 column here, too, which is suitable 500 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:04:07.949
 fit 502 fit 505 won't fit 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:14.859
 ends on the top five 520 522 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:17.799
 525 does not fit 550 fit and 555 to 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:22.750
 Unfortunately, it does not fit here honestly 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.260
 under the letter a and I wrote 225 it is not for us 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.260
 fits 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:38.380
 ended at 250 then it was 252 needed 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:45.250
 I was writing to apologize and so 200 202 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:53.480
 220 222 250 252 500 502 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:56.990
 520 522 550 552 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.840
 also fit two three 4 5 six times 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.150
 two three 4 5 six we are from each column 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.670
 6 taken along the three numbers thrown 3 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:11.750
 thrown out 205 thrown out 225 and 255 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:14.900
 505 525i 555 thrown out they are odd it 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.880
 under the letter and what we needed 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.880
 write now under the letter b will write 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:39.290
 those numbers under the letter b are divisible by 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:41.419
 5 and so on 5 divides 200 205 220 225 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.640
 I remind you that 5 is divisible by numbers which 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.110
 ends with either 0 or 5 te 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:56.450
 which end in a deuce we are not 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:59.150
 suitable and so 200 205 220 225 250 255 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.290
 this is from the first column of 6 6 numbers 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.110
 it turned out numbers 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:07.250
 numbers i'm sorry numbers from the second column 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:24.230
 suitable 500 502 not suitable 505 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:25.730
 fits 520 525 550 and 555 under the letter b 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.090
 we wrote out these numbers which 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:32.720
 ends with either 5 or zero 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.340
 so do not divide by 5 and in the first 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.120
 case you wrote him those purely which 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.760
 ends in either a deuce or a 0 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.540
 that is, on an even on an even number 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.130
 end that is the extreme figure 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.240
 even or zero db2 five, we would not 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.160
 fit and this is under the letter a and this is under 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.710
 letter b 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.440
 Now, this problem seems to be not difficult but 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.580
 made us get confused a little bit yes with 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.949
 you was Andrei Andreevich 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.990
 I decide for you to channel all everything ru 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:02.990
 all fives and bye
