00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hi guys, how are you? How are you? 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.490
 can realize continues with the middle voice 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.730
 weird 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.070
 I finally excuse and nowadays more 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.170
 a non-book indication video for 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.369
 Who does not know it's 20 I'll tell you 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.350
 things done to eth in things I read 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.170
 news posts by corby thing i 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.590
 I found it cool out there. 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.750
 finally share everything brushes the two 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.039
 first links are from the guardian 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.019
 the first of them talking about a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.020
 campaign in independent bookstores 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.719
 London are doing to encourage the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.910
 consumption of books in those places to which 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 she does not die and they continue to live like 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.300
 stores is very interesting I think I 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.270
 was also think people in our 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.090
 our own cities 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.270
 I have a great tendency to buy 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.520
 on the internet for the price but I like it 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.640
 too much to attend the bookstore environment 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.820
 and it's a bit of a bloody nerve because you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.430
 space and consume less there and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.220
 that all maintenance costs 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.350
 Anyway, I do not even think about thinking enough about it. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 So he'll be down there and the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.890
 second link of the guardian is about 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.650
 changes 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.380
 so when you change what you do 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:27.060
 with your staff 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.210
 I think it's cool, so it's going to be in 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.380
 down and shortly after you have a 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.329
 Wolves blog that is the writer in the hand 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.210
 company blog of the letters in which he 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.799
 will also talk a little bit about how 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.170
 he had to discard his 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.970
 library a few times when you moved 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:51.390
 of the country and a possible technique that 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.299
 uses to categorize your book goes 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.890
 continue on your shelf or not in the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.259
 Fun little I do not know if someday 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.990
 I'm going to adopt here but it's at least 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.990
 fun and worth it if he also 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.310
 company website has a text from carola 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.380
 Saavedra let her talk a little 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.410
 about writing a book about her that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.900
 called inventory of things absent and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.610
 made me quite comfortable 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.019
 the book then we will be down 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.180
 another blog post 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.790
 no one left me at the island's will 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.819
 I wanted to know that 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.560
 author and after a while without tiring 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.720
 from when I see if I were a god 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.950
 even believing cleisson that is the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.180
 washington 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.329
 I think it's enough bastian and anyway it's 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.750
 the French comedian I let him in 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.450
 low because it has many different pictures of 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.400
 comic pages are beautiful and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.440
 also the author that I intend to read 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.030
 quite the other link that I'm going to leave 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.980
 under a book that's coming 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.260
 here in Brazil and it must be very legal that 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.780
 It's coming is a translation of alice in the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.739
 Wonderland with illustrations from 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.739
 Something like that, let's go. 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.319
 hit will be on bass joe koehler 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.150
 and she's a really cool plastic artist I 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.700
 I already saw this edition in English I almost 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.470
 she bought it once she was traveling 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.660
 but who had already bought type 30 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:21.109
 books and extra weight but there is 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.940
 very beautiful illustrations of her and her 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.250
 including the barbarian vanessa in 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.769
 It was also cool so I did not see the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:33.260
 globe in person but at last 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.970
 Maybe I'll have this book on 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.489
 my bookshelf along with my other books 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.250
 editions no longer even if I do not like it so much 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.729
 so I do not think it's bad but it's not the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.709
 my favorite alice story but 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:48.079
 for some reason they have released issues 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.479
 very beautiful, I never resist 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.229
 buys which shipments from the list by 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.720
 first time 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.680
 Look, I wanted to point out three things, too. 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.989
 on Youtube 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.810
 one of them is a channel that many of you 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.430
 must have seen but it is a channel called 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.319
 art side 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.440
 The game is part of it. 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.959
 presenter of the programs but the 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.900
 intention is that they visit artists from 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:17.180
 various areas and these crimes 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:19.549
 speak a task related to art 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.230
 for you to also share the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.230
 results you got 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:27.470
 and it gives a contextualized in it 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.600
 relating to other art forms 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.670
 so it's really cool so I'm today 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.380
 finding the Indians really fun 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.580
 who has not done any use 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.250
 wants to leave but has found it quite legal and a

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.440

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.810
 floor on which it indicates fiction book 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.800
 for those who want to start reading 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.570
 to see nÃ© 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.280
 it unites a division by 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.430
 subcategories and indicates books and is 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.640
 sensational and 20 will be down there and 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.280

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.460
 a channel called ronit made with godparents 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.070
 of this English table but she also does 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.480
 some divisions within comics 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:23.480

 good staff were these indications of this 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.820
 instead of fear a few service then 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.910
 a lot of this kind for him to stay 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.050
 for now and that's what I hope the 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.050
 Saber system to
