hi guys its ratchet five and today we
are<00:00:02.550> going<00:00:02.850> into<00:00:03.030> crystal<00:00:03.419> flight<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.840> do<00:00:03.929> not

am going to show you the fastest method
to<00:00:10.260> do<00:00:10.349> crystal<00:00:10.710> flight<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.010> it's<00:00:11.099> kind<00:00:11.280> of

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
to do crystal flight and it's kind of

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.930 
to do crystal flight and it's kind of
risky<00:00:11.639> actually<00:00:12.059> um<00:00:16.160> this<00:00:17.160> plane<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.880> plane

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
risky actually um this plane this plane

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.210 
risky actually um this plane this plane
ok<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.900> actually<00:00:19.199> quite<00:00:19.529> difficult<00:00:19.740> left<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
ok is actually quite difficult left the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.950 
ok is actually quite difficult left the
do<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.609> actually<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.060> few<00:00:21.359> tries<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
do you actually have a few tries to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.410 
do you actually have a few tries to
actually<00:00:22.289> perfect<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.210> doesn't<00:00:24.210> matter<00:00:24.330> we'll

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
actually perfect it doesn't matter we'll

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.240 
actually perfect it doesn't matter we'll
miss<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.750> plane<00:00:25.400> go<00:00:26.400> back<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> later<00:00:26.990> and

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
miss one plane go back for a later and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.540 
miss one plane go back for a later and
as<00:00:29.250> I've<00:00:29.609> spoken<00:00:29.849> about<00:00:30.750> before<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.619> crystal

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
as I've spoken about before this crystal

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.910 
as I've spoken about before this crystal
flight<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.910> actually<00:00:33.750> age<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.440> Remax<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
flight is actually age the Remax of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
flight is actually age the Remax of

if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> know<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> mean<00:00:54.860> no<00:00:55.860> actually<00:00:56.219> some

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
if you know what I mean no actually some

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.340 
if you know what I mean no actually some
people<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.329> Stone<00:00:57.570> Hill<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.109> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
people really like Stone Hill but I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.200 
people really like Stone Hill but I
actually<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.760> much<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.180> mean

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
actually do not like it that much I mean

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.170 
actually do not like it that much I mean
if<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.710> mp3<00:01:02.100> player<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.850> do

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
if I have it on my mp3 player which I do

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
if I have it on my mp3 player which I do
and<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.960> wouldn't<00:01:04.379> choose<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> listen<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and I wouldn't choose a listen to that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
and I wouldn't choose a listen to that
track<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.390> not<00:01:06.810> one

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
track because it's just not not one

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.240 
track because it's just not not one
don't<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:07.860> favorite<00:01:08.189> no<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:09.470> knew<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.680> no

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
don't know my favorite no way knew it no

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.899 
don't know my favorite no way knew it no
and<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.990> are<00:01:13.200> always<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.619> sure<00:01:13.920> part<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and that's are always very sure part and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
and that's are always very sure part and
I<00:01:15.750> think<00:01:15.780> there's<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> best<00:01:16.350> way<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.560> do

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
I think there's the best way to do

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.350 
I think there's the best way to do
Crysta<00:01:17.520> flight<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.290> those

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
Crysta flight but you have to get those

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.910 
Crysta flight but you have to get those
flames<00:01:21.409> which<00:01:22.409> will<00:01:22.590> help

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
flames which will help

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.160 
flames which will help
one<00:01:24.920> there<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.460> one<00:01:26.090> there<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.780> we<00:01:27.020> actually

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
one there and one there and we actually

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.900 
one there and one there and we actually
get<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.470> lab<00:01:28.190> engineer<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:31.160> we<00:01:31.400> had<00:01:31.550> a<00:01:31.580> lot<00:01:31.880> of

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
get to lab engineer and we had a lot of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.280 
get to lab engineer and we had a lot of
time<00:01:32.090> left<00:01:32.360> over<00:01:35.020> again

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
time left over again

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.000 
time left over again
No<00:01:37.130> 111<00:01:37.880> that's<00:01:38.240> pretty<00:01:38.450> quick<00:01:38.510> um<00:01:39.440> anyway<00:01:39.980> we

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
No 111 that's pretty quick um anyway we

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.770 
No 111 that's pretty quick um anyway we
are<00:01:40.340> going<00:01:40.610> out<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.850> crystal<00:01:41.120> flight<00:01:41.300> now<00:01:41.420> that

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
are going out of crystal flight now that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.690 
are going out of crystal flight now that
was<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:41.960> very<00:01:42.020> short<00:01:42.290> part<00:01:42.560> as<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.310> call<00:01:43.490> flight

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
was a very short part as I call flight

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700 
was a very short part as I call flight
one<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.330> just<00:01:44.600> said<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> million<00:01:45.170> million

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
one and I just said a million million

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.790 
one and I just said a million million
seconds<00:01:46.670> ago<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:47.240> mean<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.720> million<00:01:48.020> times<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.560> few

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
seconds ago I mean a million times a few

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.930 
seconds ago I mean a million times a few
seconds<00:01:49.130> ago<00:01:49.930> anyway<00:01:50.930> we<00:01:51.500> will<00:01:53.170> go<00:01:54.170> into

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
seconds ago anyway we will go into

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.609 
seconds ago anyway we will go into
