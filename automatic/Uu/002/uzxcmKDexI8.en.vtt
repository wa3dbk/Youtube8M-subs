so<00:00:19.950> the<00:00:20.100> first<00:00:20.340> thing<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.670> understand<00:00:21.120> is<00:00:21.360> what

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
so the first thing to understand is what

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.530 
so the first thing to understand is what
is<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> card<00:00:22.380> spread<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.950> current<00:00:23.790> spread<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.270> an

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
is a card spread a current spread is an

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.769 
is a card spread a current spread is an
even<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.700> nice<00:00:26.700> way<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.290> the<00:00:29.250> cards

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
even and nice way to show the cards

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.610 
even and nice way to show the cards
could<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.020> be<00:00:31.110> a<00:00:31.140> display<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:33.020> magic<00:00:34.020> in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
could just be a display but in magic in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.760 
could just be a display but in magic in
magic<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.280> uh<00:00:35.309> use<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.660> usually<00:00:37.199> show<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
magic you uh use it to usually show that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.369 
magic you uh use it to usually show that
the<00:00:37.860> cards<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.250> normal<00:00:38.640> or<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.150> us<00:00:39.379> someone

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the cards are normal or have us someone

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.299 
the cards are normal or have us someone
pick<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> card<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:42.140> its<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.830> the<00:00:44.010> basic

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
pick a card on its that's the basic

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.930 
pick a card on its that's the basic
premise<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> card<00:00:45.600> spread<00:00:46.290> is<00:00:46.470> now

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
premise of what a card spread is now

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.710 
premise of what a card spread is now
here<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> tutorial

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.190 

alright<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:54.620> first<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.190> grip<00:00:55.900> so<00:00:56.900> you<00:00:56.990> take

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
alright so first the grip so you take

alright so first the grip so you take
your<00:00:57.380> thumb<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:57.980> have<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.580> on<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:58.880> edge<00:00:59.450> of

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
your thumb and have it on the edge of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.660 
your thumb and have it on the edge of
the<00:00:59.810> deck<00:00:59.990> that's<00:01:00.200> closest<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.460> back

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
the deck that's closest to you the back

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.060 
the deck that's closest to you the back

middle finger and put it on the engines

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.280 
middle finger and put it on the engines
farthest<00:01:09.710> away<00:01:09.800> from<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.340> front<00:01:10.580> edge

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
farthest away from you the front edge

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.290 
farthest away from you the front edge
they<00:01:12.290> just<00:01:12.740> which<00:01:13.250> leaves<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:13.790> in<00:01:13.880> this<00:01:14.000> grip

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
so place over there so you can do a

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.930 
so place over there so you can do a
spread<00:01:31.540> now<00:01:32.540> that's<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.869> grip<00:01:33.229> here's<00:01:34.130> how

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
spread now that's the grip here's how

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.690 
spread now that's the grip here's how
you<00:01:35.000> do<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> spread

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.569 

alright<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:40.899> to<00:01:40.960> do<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.289> spread<00:01:41.590> once<00:01:42.460> you

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
alright so to do the spread once you

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.230 
alright so to do the spread once you
have<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.880> grip<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.899> place<00:01:44.229> your<00:01:45.189> hand<00:01:45.490> on<00:01:45.700> the

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.510 
table and just drag while you're
applying<00:01:49.420> even<00:01:49.840> pressure<00:01:50.340> throughout<00:01:51.340> the

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
applying even pressure throughout the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.359 
applying even pressure throughout the
entire<00:01:51.729> spread<00:01:52.090> they<00:01:52.390> just<00:01:52.570> stop<00:01:52.899> and<00:01:53.369> that's

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
entire spread they just stop and that's

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.109 
entire spread they just stop and that's
pretty<00:01:54.579> much<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.789> there<00:01:55.090> isn't<00:01:55.329> much<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.689> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
pretty much it there isn't much to it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.419 
pretty much it there isn't much to it
just<00:01:58.119> apply<00:01:58.539> even<00:01:58.929> pressure<00:01:59.369> it<00:02:00.369> takes

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
just apply even pressure it takes

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:07.070 
just apply even pressure it takes
practice<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.829> it<00:02:02.979> even<00:02:03.189> every<00:02:03.610> time<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.199 

new<00:02:08.080> occurrence<00:02:08.380> help<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.819> better<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.149> have

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
new occurrence help it's better to have

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.250 
new occurrence help it's better to have
newer<00:02:10.420> cards<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:12.239> felt<00:02:13.239> works<00:02:13.750> too<00:02:13.959> can't<00:02:14.170> do

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
newer cards and felt works too can't do

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.220 
newer cards and felt works too can't do
it<00:02:14.380> on<00:02:14.440> wood<00:02:14.620> table<00:02:15.540> usually<00:02:16.540> will<00:02:16.690> turn<00:02:17.140> over

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
it on wood table usually will turn over

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.660 
it on wood table usually will turn over
you<00:02:17.470> can<00:02:17.709> that's<00:02:18.220> next<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:21.310> harder

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
you can that's next but you it's harder

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.690 
you can that's next but you it's harder
to<00:02:21.700> do<00:02:21.970> on<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> wood<00:02:22.299> table<00:02:22.480> felt<00:02:23.079> or<00:02:23.700> some

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
fabric fabric the carpet works it's

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.479 
fabric fabric the carpet works it's
pretty<00:02:29.140> much<00:02:29.230> all<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:29.680> even<00:02:29.950> pressure<00:02:30.160> all

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
pretty much all just even pressure all

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.759 
pretty much all just even pressure all
the<00:02:30.880> way<00:02:30.940> through<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.269> deck<00:02:31.470> all<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.680> way

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
the way through the deck all the way

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.339 
the way through the deck all the way
through<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:32.980> spread<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.959> that's<00:02:34.959> pretty

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
through the spread and that's pretty

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.430 
through the spread and that's pretty
much<00:02:35.470> it

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.060 

all<00:02:40.400> right<00:02:40.610> now<00:02:40.850> for<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.840> turnover<00:02:42.320> once<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
all right now for the turnover once the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.730 
all right now for the turnover once the
other<00:02:43.190> spread<00:02:43.490> all<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.360> do<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.780> pick<00:02:45.260> up<00:02:45.470> one

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
other spread all you do is pick up one

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.530 
other spread all you do is pick up one
edge<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.040> cards<00:02:46.370> make<00:02:47.000> sure<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.270> place
