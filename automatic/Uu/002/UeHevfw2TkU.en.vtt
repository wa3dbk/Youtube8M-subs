00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:12.889
 hi everyone today i will continue the topic of 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:14.219
 survival bracelets weaving today 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:21.210
 we take 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:22.670
 the fixer itself is doing just such a loop on 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 other end 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:31.980
 retainer we so here we can now 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:40.920
 I will show here so we postpone our extinction 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:46.730
 hand right now, I will show here our vymeryat 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.079
 arm and here on such but it is more 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.500
 do more carefully because how would I 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.170
 do this show you weaving 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:01.550
 that's about the length 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.549
 then we push it in from the loop 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:11.430
 beautiful and over here in this mount and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:15.890
 still we need to do a reverse braid 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.890
 I'll show you how to do it. 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.390
 weaving which way we will weave 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.390
 called stitch 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.240
 Now I have this a little bit 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:47.380
 so the second side here we turned 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:47.380
 thread and also do the second side 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.230
 paracord ends gelatin pay because 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.700
 what they bloom that's how i did 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.700
 here they are beautiful 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:20.209
 it turns out that it will be like this 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:31.060
 the core is now this is the core 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:38.750
 and here are two threads that we will already 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:44.349
 weave so left thread to the left 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.349
 thread and thrust here under the cores and 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:53.750
 now and so what was visible left 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:01.150
 side throwing pushes under 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.150
 core and lay it on the right thread 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:10.400
 right marry skip here and so 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:16.930
 just show it to be more 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:19.930
 just a long lace and pull 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.930
 delaying 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:31.550
 it is desirable to do it here well it will be better 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.750
 you can see it from the second 3 times this 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.750
 just starting node 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.170
 then just as the very right side 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:49.760
 skip under the core and lie on 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:55.730
 top left thread and push on 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.180
 Tomorrow we delay a little bit now 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.180
 a little bit 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:09.590
 it is desirable to tighten the words well 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:15.110
 take the left side built the same way 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:18.380
 just about the heart of the bracelet itself 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.050
 right and right in the grass end in 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:31.070
 noose 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:35.710
 left we get here now 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.910
 a pattern appears but a pattern 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.980
 unforgettable to tighten 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.240
 and here press down as myself 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:51.310
 the bracelet must be hard 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.310
 feast further slips 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.780
 all-all you can see everything is clear now we 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:11.350
 we take the left side about sable and winter 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:22.800
 we lay down here and there 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:26.430
 images weave now I will be so 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.430
 the main alternate 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.340
 threads 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:37.020
 left and right right left think 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.020
 understandable principle 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.740
 and 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:52.440
 and so here we get here we have 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:57.150
 already got this knitted bracelet and so 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:06.390
 we do here now 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:08.180
 so we fold the whole knit to the end to the 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.130
 this edge 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.640
 It turns out if you want to use 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.370
 it's just another weave 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.370
 here goes on one weave two with 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:24.030
 half three meters if you want 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:27.660
 Now I will show here such a plan 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:33.750
 thickness you see how to distinguish this 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:39.290
 plan a bracelet on this tibet 6 meters y 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:42.150
 I have the same principle here . 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:46.100
 as we weave only now 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:50.010
 I'll lock my bracelet for a second 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.610
 only we get to this 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.370
 half 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:58.260
 and come back the same way back 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:07:00.030
 it turns out got to this country but 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.460
 but come back this double weave 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:07.950
 It turns out here you will have 6 meters 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:14.730
 niki well and it will be thicker like that 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:16.920
 thank you for watching me
