00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
much of it in the frame so

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.220 
much of it in the frame so
I've<00:00:11.120> been<00:00:11.270> the<00:00:11.360> head<00:00:11.480> to<00:00:11.690> the<00:00:11.810> production

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
I've been the head to the production

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.170 
I've been the head to the production
versions<00:00:12.590> for<00:00:12.710> a<00:00:12.770> tactile<00:00:13.580> sensor<00:00:14.000> on<00:00:14.090> the

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
versions for a tactile sensor on the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.010 
versions for a tactile sensor on the
tough<00:00:14.710> sensitive<00:00:16.330> yeah<00:00:17.330> he's<00:00:17.690> got<00:00:17.900> two

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
tough sensitive yeah he's got two

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.050 
tough sensitive yeah he's got two
infrared<00:00:18.470> receiver<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:19.400> emitters<00:00:19.730> he<00:00:19.849> could

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
infrared receiver and emitters he could

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.429 
infrared receiver and emitters he could
control<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.480> gear<00:00:20.779> recorders<00:00:21.260> your

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
control the gear recorders your

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.150 
control the gear recorders your
television<00:00:21.890> etc<00:00:22.040> he's<00:00:23.029> got<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:23.210> camera<00:00:23.570> here

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
television etc he's got a camera here

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.410 
television etc he's got a camera here
our<00:00:25.160> production<00:00:25.580> versions<00:00:25.910> got<00:00:26.060> a<00:00:26.090> second

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
our production versions got a second

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.660 
our production versions got a second
camera<00:00:26.599> it's<00:00:27.470> been<00:00:27.650> four<00:00:27.890> microphones<00:00:28.279> in<00:00:28.640> the

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
camera it's been four microphones in the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.300 
camera it's been four microphones in the
head<00:00:28.880> as<00:00:29.539> well<00:00:29.570> as<00:00:29.750> two<00:00:30.050> speakers<00:00:30.470> in<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.740> ears

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
head as well as two speakers in the ears

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.930 
head as well as two speakers in the ears
strangely<00:00:32.620> Aires<00:00:33.620> got<00:00:33.800> two<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:34.280> NARS

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
strangely Aires got two so NARS

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.229 
strangely Aires got two so NARS
on<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.570> chest<00:00:35.809> he's<00:00:36.020> got<00:00:36.370> an<00:00:37.370> inertial<00:00:37.850> sensor

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
on the chest he's got an inertial sensor

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.020 
on the chest he's got an inertial sensor
comprised<00:00:38.690> of<00:00:38.840> accelerometer<00:00:39.769> gyro<00:00:40.760> meters

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
comprised of accelerometer gyro meters

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.660 
comprised of accelerometer gyro meters
in<00:00:41.960> almost<00:00:42.230> joints<00:00:42.710> he's<00:00:42.830> got<00:00:43.040> sensors<00:00:45.670> and

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
in almost joints he's got sensors and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.369 
in almost joints he's got sensors and
he's<00:00:47.030> got<00:00:47.210> a<00:00:47.239> cover<00:00:47.449> little<00:00:47.780> bump<00:00:47.989> burns<00:00:48.199> down

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
he's got a cover little bump burns down

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.400 
he's got a cover little bump burns down
and<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.159> core<00:00:49.339> sensitive<00:00:49.790> resistors

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.500 

yeah<00:00:57.310> interestingly<00:00:57.640> there's<00:00:58.120> communication

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
yeah interestingly there's communication

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.770 
yeah interestingly there's communication
which<00:00:58.870> goes<00:00:59.080> down<00:00:59.290> from<00:00:59.680> the<00:01:00.420> head<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.750> the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
which goes down from the head to the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.060 
which goes down from the head to the
body<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.890> in<00:01:03.010> theory<00:01:03.310> you<00:01:03.460> can<00:01:04.770> just<00:01:05.770> take<00:01:05.920> off

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
body so in theory you can just take off

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.820 
body so in theory you can just take off
there<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.720> send<00:01:07.720> USB<00:01:08.170> straight<00:01:08.470> down<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.770> the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
there and send USB straight down to the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:31.780 
there and send USB straight down to the
body<00:01:08.980> it's<00:01:09.820> seen<00:01:10.120> as<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.300> device<00:01:11.190> versus

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.080 

try<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.630> visit<00:01:32.900> hops<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.890> pass<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.310> question

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.500 

bishop<00:01:38.090> he<00:01:38.990> reacts

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
bishop he reacts

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.560 
bishop he reacts
keeping<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.690> center-of-mass<00:01:42.080> still<00:01:43.570> that's

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
keeping the center-of-mass still that's

00:01:44.570 --> 00:02:00.250 
keeping the center-of-mass still that's
big

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:03:06.559 

I<00:02:01.930> know

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.410 

that<00:03:07.569> was<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.690> predefined<00:03:08.260> sequence<00:03:09.420> anything

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
that was a predefined sequence anything

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.770 
that was a predefined sequence anything
that's<00:03:10.629> defined<00:03:11.110> with<00:03:11.640> control<00:03:12.780> realized

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
that's defined with control realized

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.400 
that's defined with control realized
that<00:03:14.019> place<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.040> Cuba

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.610 

actually<00:03:18.410> that<00:03:18.500> was<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:20.200> little<00:03:21.200> things<00:03:21.530> you

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
actually that was a little things you

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.060 
actually that was a little things you
were<00:03:21.680> talking<00:03:22.070> about<00:03:22.130> yesterday<00:03:22.520> it's<00:03:22.970> a
