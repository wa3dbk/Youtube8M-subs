inspired by something that you've
recently<00:03:02.019> where<00:03:02.320> under<00:03:02.530> heard<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.880> space<00:03:03.880> a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
recently where under heard of space a

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.850 
recently where under heard of space a
series<00:03:04.269> often<00:03:04.690> because<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.380> know<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.739> never

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
series often because you know you never

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.979 
series often because you know you never
know<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.160> could<00:03:06.250> end<00:03:06.370> up<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.610> be<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> big<00:03:06.940> hit<00:03:07.120> so

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
know it could end up to be a big hit so

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.720 
know it could end up to be a big hit so
that's<00:03:08.200> really<00:03:08.320> all<00:03:08.470> we<00:03:08.590> can<00:03:08.890> say<00:03:09.100> because<00:03:09.489> we

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
that's really all we can say because we

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.640 
that's really all we can say because we
don't<00:03:09.910> have<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.090> specific<00:03:10.360> way<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.290> come<00:03:11.590> up

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
don't have a specific way to come up

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.620 
don't have a specific way to come up
with<00:03:11.739> series<00:03:12.160> however<00:03:12.820> if<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.239> really<00:03:13.450> think

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
with series however if you really think

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.720 
with series however if you really think
about<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:14.049> tips<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.650> we<00:03:14.799> gave<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.160> maybe

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
about the tips that we gave you maybe

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.160 
about the tips that we gave you maybe
just<00:03:16.090> maybe<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.510> can<00:03:16.690> come<00:03:16.750> up<00:03:16.900> with<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.049> great

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
just maybe you can come up with a great

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.320 
just maybe you can come up with a great
Series<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.680> remember<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.880> might<00:03:19.030> want<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
Series to remember you might want the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.150
