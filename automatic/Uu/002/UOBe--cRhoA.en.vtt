00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.050
 hello passion friends mobile and power pda 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.180
 today in our applications segment 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.610
 let's analyze this initial screen 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.800
 which, as you can see, is very different from 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.930
 what we normally have this 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.570
 application is called timer and it's going to 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.280
 allow to change the whole appearance of 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.650
 our main phone screen 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.630
 as you see these are our desks 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.830
 main ones and if we want to access 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.380
 all applications 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.510
 we can do it here they will appear in shape 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.180
 of list but we can customize it 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.400
 also if we go where it is beats in the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.410
 corner we can explore new topics 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.990
 to apply to our device 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.420
 a very simple way for example let's 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.940
 to apply this topic you just have to 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.250
 select it press the popcorn and 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.229
 wait for it to download and once 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.450
 the final discharge is going to apply the 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.030
 theme and all of our initial screen goes 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.649
 to be replaced and well how can you 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.560
 appreciate now the initial screen 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.090
 changed completely to how he was and from 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.290
 here we keep some accesses 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.540
 direct to our applications 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.160
 favorites and of course also the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.380
 access to all applications that 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.700
 we have installed we can also go to 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.189
 categories 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.899
 now the most used or recent ones 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.210
 of action and these categories that 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.860
 they create automatically we can also go 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.200
 to the other tab that are favorites 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.820
 where we can manage them for 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.219
 select what applications we want 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.500
 come out here if we are going to explore more 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.509
 issues we're going to see there's an infinity 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.759
 of topics from which you can choose 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.460
 the one you like best to personalize your 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.039
 device in a very easy and very 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.439
 Fast certainly is an application that you 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.420
 Help customize without complicating 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.970
 too much the task we're going to select 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.189
 some other topic and we're going to apply it 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.610
 again we wait for it to download and 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.740
 the entire process is completed 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.260
 and ready as you see in just a few seconds 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.240
 We could change the whole appearance of 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.130
 this device with a simple 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.260
 application since now the desktop 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.390
 shows a slightly cleaner environment and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.000
 also shows us a small bar with 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 the weather and some other options 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.240
 We can also customize the way in 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.370
 that this climate is shown to us if we leave 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.890
 held over it and we go to the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.990
 launcher settings here 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.880
 we can select if we want in 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.530
 degrees celsius or degrees fahrenheit 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.090
 we can also customize what 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.890
 applications we want to be opened by 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.920
 defect for example when we open the 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.080
 phone messages internet camera and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.000
 others if we select our account 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.250
 we can also make you show us 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.410
 How many emails have we not read? 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.489
 also add news channels to 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.340
 to be shown on our screen 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.170
 initial and define some gestures that 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.450
 can perform while we are in the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.520
 launcher how to slide two fingers towards 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.290
 down two fingers up and some 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.959
 other timer is one of the applications 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.480
 which is most popular when it comes to 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.830
 customize your device 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.930
 mainly because of the ease with 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.230
 which we can do if you want to show off 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.629

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.450
