00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
comes with two cases so let's start with

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.820 
comes with two cases so let's start with
that<00:01:14.780> these<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:15.990> two<00:01:16.140> cases<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.619> comes

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that these are the two cases it comes

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
that these are the two cases it comes
when<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.130> much<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.580> marware<00:01:18.060> cases

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600

I<00:02:54.940> always<00:02:55.660> think<00:02:55.960> that<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.800> negative<00:02:57.100> but<00:02:57.640> it

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
I always think that is a negative but it

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.540 
I always think that is a negative but it
seems<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.020> be<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.290> norm<00:02:59.320> with<00:03:00.130> most<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.460> these

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
listened to them yet but two reasons you

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.850 
listened to them yet but two reasons you
can<00:03:58.540> see<00:03:58.690> they<00:03:58.810> do<00:03:58.870> just<00:03:59.230> what<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.470> ihome

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
can see they do just what the ihome

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.190 
can see they do just what the ihome
speakers<00:04:00.250> do<00:04:00.460> but<00:04:01.360> as<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:01.750> can<00:04:01.810> see<00:04:01.990> over<00:04:02.110> the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
speakers do but as you can see over the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.320

what I do it retracts back into the

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.520 
what I do it retracts back into the
speaker<00:04:15.100> and<00:04:15.870> does<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.049> same<00:04:17.080> thing<00:04:17.440> that

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
speaker and does the same thing that

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.400 
speaker and does the same thing that
separates<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.630> that's<00:04:19.630> it<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.930> other<00:04:20.049> thing

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
separates and that's it the other thing

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
and in the mesh case which i think this

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.950 
and in the mesh case which i think this
case<00:05:59.110> barony<00:05:59.530> IM<00:05:59.740> capsules<00:06:00.280> bjs<00:06:01.060> because<00:06:01.780> it's

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
case barony IM capsules bjs because it's

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.330 
case barony IM capsules bjs because it's
a<00:06:02.050> little<00:06:02.260> bit<00:06:02.380> bigger<00:06:02.590> and<00:06:02.830> it<00:06:02.950> holds<00:06:03.100> it<00:06:03.280> a

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
a little bit bigger and it holds it a

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.540 
a little bit bigger and it holds it a
lot<00:06:03.460> better<00:06:03.730> and<00:06:04.600> that's<00:06:04.780> it<00:06:05.190> 2995<00:06:06.190> i<00:06:06.250> think

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
lot better and that's it 2995 i think

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.890 
lot better and that's it 2995 i think
this<00:06:06.640> is<00:06:06.760> a<00:06:06.790> real<00:06:06.940> winner<00:06:07.150> i<00:06:07.240> think<00:06:07.570> this<00:06:07.690> is<00:06:07.750> a

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
this is a real winner i think this is a
