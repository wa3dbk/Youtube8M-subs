with<00:02:27.140> Kickstarter's<00:02:27.829> you<00:02:28.279> set<00:02:28.519> this

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
with Kickstarter's you set this

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.489 
with Kickstarter's you set this
astronomical<00:02:29.269> number<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.079> if<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.260> don't

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:30.499 
astronomical number and if you don't

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:32.000 
astronomical number and if you don't
reach<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.859> you<00:02:30.889> get<00:02:31.189> none<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.609> them<00:02:31.760> on

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010

it<00:03:36.900> seems<00:03:36.959> like<00:03:37.889> a<00:03:37.919> logical<00:03:38.220> move<00:03:38.730> for<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
it seems like a logical move for the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.580 
it seems like a logical move for the
network<00:03:39.449> I'm<00:03:39.690> assuming<00:03:40.139> their<00:03:40.260> ratings

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
network I'm assuming their ratings

weren't<00:03:40.829> doing<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.250> well<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.849> that<00:03:42.000> most

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
weren't doing that well and that most

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.879 
weren't doing that well and that most
gamers<00:03:42.449> probably<00:03:42.989> absorbed<00:03:43.290> most<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.739> their

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
for example so I can't say that I blame
