00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.400
 The video is going to be a good video. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.790
 fast 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.389
 I just came here to show you guys 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.240
 here are the gold camouflages I already 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.890
 I got it with my special weapons 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.350
 which in case is the provo the child here naify 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.970
 the police that the f1 can see here in 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.630
 ground here I already got 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.280
 I already have all the gold on the floor 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.770
 the knife in my hand I the next one 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.050
 the one who is still missing alice 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.040
 no one makes three or four 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.829
 camouflage for me to leave her gold 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.950
 It's ok too, but I think today is already 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.289
 I can let her talk in gold. 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.539
 and consequently is opening the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.170
 hence the music as they make diamond of the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.850
 our special weapons class 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 I'll get the kick for you guys and go here. 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.150
 look you see the details must code 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.010
 show and here we come here in the sun no 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.950
 I can see it and it's really cool, I'm 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.869
 seeing where he holds it there for 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.840
 inside it had a fiber texture of 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.119
 carbon a small drop in fps now 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 through 40 species there because I 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.770
 I'm using I use to record the weak 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.960
 is the history is a bit lighter 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.119
 I just do not like to record the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.020
 story I prefer to record as confreres and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.939
 cause one wants a very big fall 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.549
 gps when you are recording by flex 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.700
 I turn off the cracker will climb higher or 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.020
 less than 1 75 species 80 fps running the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.270
 Sir, you see cynthia. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.880
 I also recently disabled it here. 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.979
 I'm running the whole game at maximum 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.290
 in full hd 1080p 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.030
 only with one deactivated verse that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.130
 v5 also causes a very big drop 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.070
 of fps because it is just your fps in the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.500
 hertz of the monitor and how monitors are 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.710
 60 Hz then named the fps stand 60 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.869
 Hertz that I called fred out more 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.760
 15 to 20 is party then and now on average 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.379
 40 30 and a few fps 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.980
 so that's why I decided to let him see 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.800
 five days 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.730
 given that this is getting a bit better 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.799
 here is more gameplay just like you 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.140
 You can see here it looks very beautiful 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:31.470
 that child with camouflage gold the cosmo 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.220
 Woke up too and it was very cool. 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.349
 Well, well, let's just say it's just you. 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.160
 may also notice the next 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.190
 has 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.519
 just above the trigger there a small 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.430
 texture 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.849
 already in the consoles it is not possible to see see 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.099
 this texture and the NCEA also there to 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.200
 You see her handle well. 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:57.060
 Worked well, well, pretty well. 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.209
 Knife graph also then 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.709
 people live today, that's just me 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.900
 I said at the beginning, it 's a good video for you. 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.400
 I'm going to put here was going to be a good video. 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.980
 I enjoy 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.069
 I find it funny the people upset me 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.239
 can take with the next disc of the afesp 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.980
 store does nothing 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.440
 If I took the knife, I had to 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.510
 stab and broke me shield 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.250
 I already saw something like this but then 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.139
 continuing today's video on goal 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.750
 ending here is going to be a video 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.450
 very short still can not 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.419

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.819
