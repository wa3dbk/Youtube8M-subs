delve<00:00:17.550> into<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> complex<00:00:18.240> mechanic<00:00:18.810> called

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
delve into the complex mechanic called

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.920 
delve into the complex mechanic called

rioters in play to judge how good it is

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.229 
rioters in play to judge how good it is
look<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> lands<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.850> play<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
look at the lands you have in play and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.500 
look at the lands you have in play and
ask<00:00:45.539> yourself<00:00:45.960> whether<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.410> subtypes<00:00:46.829> plains

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
ask yourself whether the subtypes plains

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.950 
ask yourself whether the subtypes plains
island<00:00:48.510> swamp<00:00:49.460> mountain<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.670> forest<00:00:51.360> appear

island swamp mountain and forest appear
within<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.320> group<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:53.730> number<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.059> times

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
within that group the number of times

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.049 
within that group the number of times
you<00:00:54.329> say<00:00:54.539> yes<00:00:54.780> topping<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.680> five<00:00:56.059> tells

you say yes topping out at five tells

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.330 
you say yes topping out at five tells
you<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.360> its<00:00:57.480> power<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.870> toughness<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.410> in

you play an island later on the rioters

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.080 
you play an island later on the rioters
will<00:01:06.299> become<00:01:06.600> 33<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:08.430> doesn't<00:01:08.760> matter<00:01:08.850> how

rewards diversity something to keep in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
rewards diversity something to keep in
mind<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> domain<00:01:18.390> checks<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> type<00:01:19.140> line

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
mind is that domain checks the type line

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.010 
mind is that domain checks the type line

my co-writers is 55 since each domain
ability<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.490> different<00:01:41.909> let's<00:01:42.420> look<00:01:42.570> at

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
ability is different let's look at

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.810 
ability is different let's look at
another<00:01:42.780> card<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.920> next<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> called

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
another card this next one is called

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.810 
another card this next one is called
exploding<00:01:45.390> borders<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.290> sorcery<00:01:46.820> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
exploding borders and it's a sorcery it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
exploding borders and it's a sorcery it
has<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> more<00:01:48.360> complex<00:01:48.750> domain<00:01:48.960> ability<00:01:49.530> but

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
has a more complex domain ability but

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.319 
has a more complex domain ability but
it's<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> demain<00:01:50.490> ability<00:01:50.909> all<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> same<00:01:53.329> to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
it's a demain ability all the same to
