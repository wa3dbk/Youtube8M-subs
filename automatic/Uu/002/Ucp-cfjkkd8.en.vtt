this tutorial is a small pixel type fun
like<00:01:04.369> this<00:01:04.519> one<00:01:04.729> which<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:05.089> visitor<00:01:05.540> then

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
like this one which is a visitor then

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.749 
like this one which is a visitor then
I'll<00:01:06.440> leave<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.619> link<00:01:06.830> in<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.040> description<00:01:07.130> and

I'll leave a link in the description and
where<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:08.090> get<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:08.390> um<00:01:09.320> I<00:01:10.220> just<00:01:10.820> think<00:01:11.000> it's

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
where to get this um I just think it's

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.840 
where to get this um I just think it's
better<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.990> easier<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.680> use<00:01:13.009> a<00:01:13.159> pixel<00:01:13.640> type

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
better and easier to use a pixel type

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.700 
better and easier to use a pixel type
from<00:01:15.759> so<00:01:16.759> open<00:01:17.060> up<00:01:17.149> game<00:01:17.420> create<00:01:18.229> an<00:01:18.320> image<00:01:18.530> go

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
from so open up game create an image go

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.930 
from so open up game create an image go
to<00:01:18.740> file<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:19.220> new<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:21.700> first<00:01:22.700> thing<00:01:22.880> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
as I mentioned I'm going to use their

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.080 
as I mentioned I'm going to use their
100<00:01:45.210> by<00:01:45.870> 10<00:01:46.170> pixels<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:47.550> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.850> because

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
100 by 10 pixels and this is because

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.610 
100 by 10 pixels and this is because
it's<00:01:48.210> gonna<00:01:48.330> be<00:01:48.510> pretty<00:01:48.690> smart<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.170> only<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
it's gonna be pretty smart is only a

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's gonna be pretty smart is only a
small<00:01:49.800> text<00:01:50.430> image<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.510> I'm<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.810> fill

our<00:03:32.000> text

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
our text

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.290 
our text
I<00:03:32.750> think<00:03:33.020> that's<00:03:33.170> select<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.220> grow<00:03:34.550> and<00:03:35.120> grow

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
I think that's select and grow and grow

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.050 
I think that's select and grow and grow
by<00:03:35.540> one<00:03:35.600> pixel<00:03:36.140> then<00:03:36.800> create<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.130> new<00:03:37.340> lamp

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
by one pixel then create a new lamp

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.610 
by one pixel then create a new lamp
make<00:03:38.300> sure<00:03:38.480> your<00:03:38.600> short<00:03:38.810> spines<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.200> enjoy<00:03:39.500> it

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
make sure your short spines to enjoy it

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.440 
make sure your short spines to enjoy it
underneath<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.160> background<00:03:40.520> layer<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:41.000> then

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
underneath the background layer and then

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.020 
underneath the background layer and then
we're<00:03:41.600> going<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.780> do<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.370> black<00:03:43.370> border

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
we're going to do a black border

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.640 
we're going to do a black border
so<00:03:44.330> then<00:03:44.480> feeling<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.840> outline<00:03:45.260> with<00:03:45.440> black

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
so then feeling the outline with black

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.070 
so then feeling the outline with black
then<00:03:46.310> got<00:03:46.520> select<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.210> none<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:47.600> this<00:03:47.900> is

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
then got select and none and this is

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.140 
then got select and none and this is
what<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.320> looks<00:03:48.470> like<00:03:48.560> then<00:03:49.460> we're<00:03:49.700> gonna<00:03:49.850> zoom

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
what it looks like then we're gonna zoom

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.040 
what it looks like then we're gonna zoom
it<00:03:50.420> in<00:03:50.450> so<00:03:51.170> go<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.410> view<00:03:51.830> zoom<00:03:52.490> and<00:03:53.150> I'm<00:03:53.780> gonna

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
it in so go to view zoom and I'm gonna

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.550 
it in so go to view zoom and I'm gonna
zoom<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.410> by<00:03:54.640> 1600<00:03:55.750> then<00:03:56.750> me<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.140> dialogues

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
zoom in by 1600 then me the dialogues

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.760 
zoom in by 1600 then me the dialogues
out<00:03:57.740> of<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.890> way<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:58.100> you<00:03:58.370> can<00:03:58.640> see<00:03:59.060> better

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.000 

okay<00:04:05.400> can<00:04:06.300> resize<00:04:06.690> them<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:06.990> you<00:04:07.110> need

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
okay can resize them if you need

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.550 
okay can resize them if you need
and<00:04:09.849> then<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.420> now<00:04:10.959> we're<00:04:11.110> going<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.260> use<00:04:11.409> the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
and then and now we're going to use the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.190 
and then and now we're going to use the
pocket<00:04:11.709> filter<00:04:12.129> and<00:04:12.849> then<00:04:13.090> make<00:04:13.629> a<00:04:13.810> foreground

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
pocket filter and then make a foreground

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.470 
pocket filter and then make a foreground
color<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:15.030> secondly<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.180> want<00:04:16.359> to

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.450 

and<00:04:19.990> we'll<00:04:20.200> need<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.560> do<00:04:20.800> cut<00:04:21.100> this<00:04:21.250> background

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
and we'll need to do cut this background

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.590 
and we'll need to do cut this background
wire<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:23.260> then<00:04:23.500> we're<00:04:23.680> just<00:04:23.710> gonna

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
wire and then we're just gonna

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.900 
wire and then we're just gonna
filling

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
filling

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.850

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
filled it in as well as because we

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.790 
filled it in as well as because we
didn't<00:04:51.550> measure<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:51.850> two<00:04:52.120> layers<00:04:52.360> together

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.150 

and<00:04:55.220> then<00:04:55.490> fill<00:04:55.789> in<00:04:55.970> all<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.419> letters<00:04:57.160> and

and then fill in all the letters and
keep<00:04:58.520> repeating<00:04:58.879> this<00:04:59.300> until<00:04:59.810> you've<00:05:00.139> got<00:05:00.289> all

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
keep repeating this until you've got all

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.369 
keep repeating this until you've got all
the<00:05:00.680> colors<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.669> would<00:05:02.120> like<00:05:02.360> making<00:05:03.169> sure

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
the colors you would like making sure

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.790 
the colors you would like making sure
they<00:05:03.530> duplicate<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.550> layer<00:05:04.810> each<00:05:05.810> time<00:05:06.199> in

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
they duplicate the layer each time in

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:15.610 
they duplicate the layer each time in
the<00:05:06.919> second

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.620 

okay<00:05:16.340> so<00:05:16.400> after<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:17.120> you<00:05:17.210> should<00:05:17.240> have<00:05:17.600> a

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
okay so after that you should have a

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.330 
okay so after that you should have a
lifestyle<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.380> was<00:05:18.440> something<00:05:18.950> like<00:05:19.160> this

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
lifestyle that was something like this

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.100 
lifestyle that was something like this
with<00:05:19.850> always<00:05:20.120> depended<00:05:20.810> on<00:05:20.900> how<00:05:21.080> many

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
with always depended on how many

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.470 
with always depended on how many
collisions<00:05:21.530> then<00:05:22.430> we're<00:05:22.610> gonna<00:05:22.730> look<00:05:22.970> at<00:05:23.240> and

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
collisions then we're gonna look at and

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.850 
collisions then we're gonna look at and
what<00:05:23.780> we've<00:05:23.930> done<00:05:24.110> so<00:05:24.350> good<00:05:24.530> about<00:05:24.620> two
