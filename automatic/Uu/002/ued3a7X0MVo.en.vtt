I<00:01:32.670> wouldn't<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.450> mess<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I wouldn't really mess with it if you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.590 
I wouldn't really mess with it if you
really<00:01:35.220> want<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.210> best<00:01:36.360> performance

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
really want to get the best performance

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.950 
really want to get the best performance
you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.200> try<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.250> try<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.840> best

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you can try that and try to get the best

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.230 
you can try that and try to get the best
performance<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:43.759> let's<00:01:44.759> close

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
performance out of it and let's close

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.600 
performance out of it and let's close
this<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.689> let's<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.500> look<00:01:46.619> at<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.009> settings

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
this up let's go look at the settings

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.660 
this up let's go look at the settings
here<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.680> is

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
here this one is

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.590 
here this one is
it's<00:01:52.670> i<00:01:52.939> 9100<00:01:53.600> DX<00:01:54.320> LP<00:01:55.130> seven<00:01:55.700> that's<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.240> modem

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
it's i 9100 DX LP seven that's the modem

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.800 
it's i 9100 DX LP seven that's the modem
the<00:01:56.930> baseband<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.180> can<00:01:59.329> see<00:01:59.509> it's<00:01:59.600> for

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the baseband and you can see it's for

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.090 
the baseband and you can see it's for
not<00:01:59.960> zero<00:02:00.229> dot<00:02:00.439> three<00:02:01.039> um<00:02:02.350> very<00:02:03.350> very<00:02:03.740> good<00:02:03.890> rom

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
not zero dot three um very very good rom

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.160 
not zero dot three um very very good rom
I<00:02:04.130> think<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.820> first<00:02:05.000> round<00:02:05.450> first

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
I think this is the first round first

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.320 
I think this is the first round first
ICS<00:02:06.770> rom<00:02:06.860> for<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:07.399> i<00:02:07.430> 9100<00:02:08.269> with<00:02:09.099> overclocking

so<00:02:11.330> that's<00:02:11.599> kind<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:12.050> cool<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.980> let's

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
so that's kind of cool and let's

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.430 
so that's kind of cool and let's
actually<00:02:13.940> do<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:15.170> test<00:02:15.560> room<00:02:15.830> real<00:02:16.280> quick

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
actually do this test room real quick

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.199 
actually do this test room real quick
benchmarks<00:02:18.440> aren't<00:02:18.830> everything<00:02:19.190> but<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.970> does

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
benchmarks aren't everything but it does

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.780

tell you certain things I was getting

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.270 
tell you certain things I was getting
about<00:02:23.530> 3,800<00:02:24.530> 3,900<00:02:24.769> on<00:02:26.049> stock<00:02:27.049> 1.2<00:02:27.980> gigahertz

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
about 3,800 3,900 on stock 1.2 gigahertz

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.110 
about 3,800 3,900 on stock 1.2 gigahertz
and<00:02:29.890> for<00:02:30.890> some<00:02:31.010> reason<00:02:31.040> when<00:02:31.489> i<00:02:31.519> overclock<00:02:32.090> it

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
and for some reason when i overclock it

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.360 
and for some reason when i overclock it
i<00:02:32.450> get<00:02:32.660> lower<00:02:32.900> speeds<00:02:33.319> but<00:02:33.530> here<00:02:33.920> we'll<00:02:34.100> find

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
i get lower speeds but here we'll find

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.870 
i get lower speeds but here we'll find
out<00:02:35.019> how<00:02:36.019> fast<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.470> can<00:02:36.590> go<00:02:36.739> on<00:02:36.769> 1.4<00:02:37.519> gigahertz

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
out how fast it can go on 1.4 gigahertz

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.020 
out how fast it can go on 1.4 gigahertz
lulz<00:02:38.870> active<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.890> for<00:02:40.640> those<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.790> you

lulz active and for those of you
wondering<00:02:41.209> if<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.930> will<00:02:42.049> burn<00:02:42.349> out<00:02:42.500> your<00:02:42.530> phone

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
wondering if it will burn out your phone

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.460 
wondering if it will burn out your phone
if<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.250> overclock<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:44.660> actually<00:02:44.840> doesn't

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
if you overclock it it actually doesn't

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.280 
if you overclock it it actually doesn't
over<00:02:45.799> um<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.819> doesn't<00:02:47.030> burn<00:02:47.420> out<00:02:47.630> your<00:02:47.660> CPU

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
over um it doesn't burn out your CPU

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.130 
over um it doesn't burn out your CPU
because<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.830> use<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.250> governor<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.140> only

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
because you use a governor and the only

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.289 
because you use a governor and the only
depending<00:02:52.099> on<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.280> governor<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.790> use<00:02:53.000> just

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
depending on the governor you use just

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.820 
depending on the governor you use just
always<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.750> don't<00:02:53.930> use<00:02:54.080> performance<00:02:54.650> it's

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
always you don't use performance it's

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.280 
always you don't use performance it's
going<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.099> only<00:02:55.250> ramp<00:02:55.579> up<00:02:55.930> when<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.049> use

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
going to only ramp up when you use

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.280 
going to only ramp up when you use
graphic<00:02:57.799> intensive<00:02:58.100> or<00:02:58.640> CPU<00:02:59.030> intensive<00:02:59.290> apps

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
graphic intensive or CPU intensive apps

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.580 
graphic intensive or CPU intensive apps
so<00:03:01.010> that's<00:03:01.609> not<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.910> big<00:03:02.090> deal<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.630> even<00:03:03.290> if<00:03:03.410> you

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
so that's not a big deal and even if you

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.039 
so that's not a big deal and even if you
have<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.070> on<00:03:04.220> fully<00:03:04.549> performance<00:03:05.390> for<00:03:05.840> like

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
have it on fully performance for like

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.830 
have it on fully performance for like
you<00:03:06.590> know<00:03:06.620> years<00:03:07.400> these<00:03:07.730> these<00:03:08.390> chips<00:03:08.690> are

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
you know years these these chips are

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.979 
you know years these these chips are
made<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.440> stand<00:03:10.329> you<00:03:11.329> know<00:03:11.420> those<00:03:11.720> high

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
made to stand you know those high

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.590 
made to stand you know those high
temperatures<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:13.190> I've<00:03:13.760> never<00:03:14.090> actually<00:03:14.390> seen

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
temperatures so I've never actually seen

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.920 
temperatures so I've never actually seen
a<00:03:14.870> phone<00:03:15.640> burnout<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.540> know<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.690> have<00:03:17.900> a

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
a phone burnout and you know I have a

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.870 
a phone burnout and you know I have a
bunch<00:03:18.319> of<00:03:18.470> phones<00:03:18.739> I've<00:03:19.040> been<00:03:19.190> doing<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.459> for

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
bunch of phones I've been doing this for

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.330 
bunch of phones I've been doing this for
almost<00:03:20.120> two<00:03:20.989> years<00:03:21.230> now<00:03:21.380> on<00:03:21.680> android<00:03:21.980> phones

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
almost two years now on android phones

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.180 
almost two years now on android phones
and<00:03:22.639> they're<00:03:23.299> pretty<00:03:23.739> pretty<00:03:24.739> good<00:03:24.950> about<00:03:25.040> it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
and they're pretty pretty good about it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.340 
and they're pretty pretty good about it
but<00:03:25.880> just<00:03:26.239> don't<00:03:26.389> put<00:03:26.510> it<00:03:26.690> on<00:03:26.750> performance<00:03:27.319> and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
but just don't put it on performance and

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.629 
but just don't put it on performance and
you'll<00:03:27.889> be<00:03:28.190> fine<00:03:28.720> lolz<00:03:29.720> active<00:03:30.200> interactive<00:03:31.040> x

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
you'll be fine lolz active interactive x

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.030 
you'll be fine lolz active interactive x
those<00:03:32.389> are<00:03:32.540> my<00:03:32.569> favorites<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.290> also<00:03:33.680> weekly

governors<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:35.389> all<00:03:35.510> depends<00:03:36.019> on<00:03:36.310> which<00:03:37.310> kernel

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
governors it all depends on which kernel

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.949 
governors it all depends on which kernel
of<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.450> developer<00:03:39.100> installed<00:03:40.100> so<00:03:40.760> i<00:03:40.790> got<00:03:40.970> 2991

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
of the developer installed so i got 2991

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.020 
of the developer installed so i got 2991
i'm<00:03:42.350> not<00:03:42.620> sure<00:03:42.920> why<00:03:43.069> I'm<00:03:43.130> getting<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:43.609> score

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
like before which is cool and you know

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.520 
like before which is cool and you know
what<00:04:16.190> maybe<00:04:16.609> I'm<00:04:16.760> getting<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.090> messed<00:04:17.299> up<00:04:17.530> i

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
what maybe I'm getting it messed up i

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.970 
what maybe I'm getting it messed up i
had<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:18.980> rom<00:04:19.400> on<00:04:19.579> my<00:04:19.790> other<00:04:20.170> galaxy<00:04:21.170> s2<00:04:21.320> AT&amp;T

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
had a rom on my other galaxy s2 AT&amp;T

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.820 
had a rom on my other galaxy s2 AT&amp;T
version<00:04:22.190> so<00:04:23.180> that's<00:04:23.390> messing<00:04:24.020> me<00:04:24.140> up<00:04:24.200> so

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
version so that's messing me up so

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.710 
version so that's messing me up so
everything's<00:04:25.280> pretty<00:04:25.610> straight<00:04:26.000> forward<00:04:26.030> on

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
everything's pretty straight forward on

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.080 
everything's pretty straight forward on
the<00:04:26.990> new<00:04:27.140> version<00:04:27.520> does<00:04:28.520> come<00:04:28.850> with

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
the new version does come with

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.570 
the new version does come with
overclocking<00:04:29.630> which<00:04:30.170> is<00:04:30.380> good<00:04:30.680> but<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.400> haven't

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
overclocking which is good but I haven't
