telling London to get into bed so you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.100 
telling London to get into bed so you
see<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.829> looked<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.480> when<00:02:15.480> someone

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
see what it looked like when someone

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.220 
see what it looked like when someone
lays<00:02:16.260> down<00:02:16.439> the<00:02:16.620> bed<00:02:16.799> but<00:02:17.760> he<00:02:18.450> was<00:02:18.659> crouching

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
lays down the bed but he was crouching

you go to lay in a bed I'm not sure if

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.789 
you go to lay in a bed I'm not sure if
it<00:02:38.670> works<00:02:38.849> on<00:02:39.030> single-player<00:02:39.569> I'm<00:02:40.409> gonna<00:02:40.620> get

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
it works on single-player I'm gonna get

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.979 
it works on single-player I'm gonna get
to<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> point<00:02:41.159> now<00:02:41.370> I'm<00:02:42.209> sorry<00:02:42.540> for<00:02:42.780> stalling

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.020 
sure what to call it but it says illegal
stance<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.900> I'm<00:03:01.680> pretty<00:03:01.919> sure<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.909> already

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
stance and I'm pretty sure you already

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.240 
stance and I'm pretty sure you already
saw<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.389> yeah<00:03:04.379> yeah<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.579> saw<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:07.069> don't<00:03:08.069> know

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
saw it yeah yeah you saw I don't know

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.770 
saw it yeah yeah you saw I don't know
why<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.609> does<00:03:09.769> but<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:11.280> does<00:03:12.439> um<00:03:14.510> yeah<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.659> was

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
why it does but it does um yeah it was

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.640 
why it does but it does um yeah it was
messed<00:03:17.269> anyway<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.299> think<00:03:18.659> he<00:03:18.989> should<00:03:19.199> make<00:03:19.470> it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
messed anyway I think he should make it

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.990 
messed anyway I think he should make it
so<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.799> can<00:03:19.949> change<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:20.280> colour<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.699> beds

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
so you can change the colour of the beds

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.159 
so you can change the colour of the beds
that'd<00:03:21.569> be<00:03:21.690> epic<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:24.750> would<00:03:24.930> use

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
that'd be epic like the you would use

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.199 
that'd be epic like the you would use
because<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.190> yeah<00:03:26.699> that's<00:03:26.879> what<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.060> looks

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
because the yeah that's what it looks

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.369 
because the yeah that's what it looks
like<00:03:27.329> when<00:03:27.510> you're<00:03:28.069> falling<00:03:29.069> asleep<00:03:29.310> um<00:03:30.379> but

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
like when you're falling asleep um but

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.539 
like when you're falling asleep um but
he<00:03:31.530> really<00:03:31.739> should<00:03:31.889> make<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.099> second<00:03:32.370> change

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
he really should make a second change

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.800 
he really should make a second change
the<00:03:32.639> colour<00:03:32.819> for<00:03:32.909> the<00:03:33.000> bed<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.389> only<00:03:33.540> makes

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
the colour for the bed it only makes

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.530 
the colour for the bed it only makes
sense<00:03:34.250> instead<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.430> using<00:03:35.579> three<00:03:35.970> pieces<00:03:36.389> of

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
sense instead of using three pieces of

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.770 
sense instead of using three pieces of
white<00:03:36.720> wall<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.260> would<00:03:37.379> use<00:03:38.000> maybe<00:03:39.000> two<00:03:39.419> red

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
white wall you would use maybe two red

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.949 
white wall you would use maybe two red
going<00:03:40.530> across<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:41.099> then<00:03:41.280> one<00:03:41.609> white<00:03:42.540> one<00:03:42.720> as

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
going across and then one white one as

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.170 
going across and then one white one as
the<00:03:43.139> pillow<00:03:43.349> or<00:03:43.560> something<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.400> yeah<00:03:44.549> here's

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
the pillow or something but yeah here's

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.439 
the pillow or something but yeah here's
a<00:03:45.239> glitch<00:03:45.479> coming<00:03:45.930> up<00:03:46.019> right<00:03:46.169> here<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:48.180> was

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
a glitch coming up right here this was

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.899 
a glitch coming up right here this was
the<00:03:49.109> first<00:03:49.409> video<00:03:49.949> we<00:03:50.129> attempted<00:03:50.609> but<00:03:50.729> there

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
the first video we attempted but there

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.670 
the first video we attempted but there
was<00:03:51.030> more<00:03:51.659> than<00:03:51.979> too<00:03:52.979> much<00:03:53.159> echo<00:03:54.290> uh-huh<00:03:55.319> as

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
was more than too much echo uh-huh as

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.319 
was more than too much echo uh-huh as
