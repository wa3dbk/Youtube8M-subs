00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 pay hi everyone I'm going to you 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.740
 present today the my scooter that 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.460
 I received today of course it's a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.940
 euro car and tidy 50 cc who made up 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.740
 up to 45 km good hour now on 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.920
 can go up to +1 even widely 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.240
 finally I think so I'll get it to you 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.160
 present now 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.130
 so here we already have the wheels that are 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.769
 fine not very high savoie there we went 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.829
 the turn signals there is another test 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.010
 that's the left and that's the right 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:41.190
 this is the stuffing and she will miss 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.360
 in Walloon will say yes oval and who 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.370
 would not hurt for a little lighthouse 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.550
 so here we go directly to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.020
 the dashboard that I like pretty 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.899
 especially because I find it 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.550
 pretty beautiful aesthetic all we want 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.219
 here's all the criteria that can 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.730
 to say then there already is to the gauge to 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.430
 essence the milestones with the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.119
 mileage with the masters and the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.760
 kilometers 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.439
 here in black there is the flashers so 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.619
 written in the places of left on the other hand 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.420
 not in warning sorry the pronunciation 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.990
 there we have the low beam we have 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.150
 the winged 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.970
 the retro too voice too 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.940
 there we have the horn I would have it started 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.610
 after you worry there we have them 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.260
 flashing with to stop on 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.130
 press the little button that 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.590
 middle there we have for example normal 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.290
 and full headlights normal and full 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.840
 highlight 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.910
 there we have the throttle grip for 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.910
 accelerate of course we have the brake 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.170
 before if I'm wrong it's all 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.990
 opposite of a bike and the brake that 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:07.070
 go backwards and that's it 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.550
 has for then there is the the fana he is 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.370
 extinguished after in the middle he is he is 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.000
 turned on but he's not seeing we're going to say 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.680
 it's just for the day is at the bottom 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.040
 enough when you're in the middle of the night 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.680
 makes a pure to light up to avoid 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.930
 to have olive accidents and everything 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.239
 and everything here so I'll put time 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.260
 and is one to turn it on after then 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.260
 there in art 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.650
 the glove box will say that open there 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.670
 we have for the keys so here I think that 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.120
 this is to start it 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.320
 there it is to extinguish against push 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.720
 I do not really know what that means 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.730
 sorry and there it is to block the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.470
 handlebar that's how you see you want 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.600
 not move it 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.990
 here we can not then there is the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.290
 saddle excuse me the scene 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.530
 that's what state is crazy enough can say 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.820
 that like that then the muffler 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.040
 we will say that it is quite aesthetic 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.570
 also it's not like scooters or 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.960
 what some are folded on 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.290
 themselves or I do not know what then so 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.550
 the brakes yes then will move it forward 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.620
 says what is the rear brake that's at 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.120
 drum like on all the others 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.780
 scooters I believe I'm not sure 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.780
 thank you for confirming it to me so that's 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.960
 the essence have that can contain that of 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.800
 unleaded 95 or 98 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.140
 here I go you will see it all at 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.459
 the hour here is flashing right 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.459
 shouted time left 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.830
 the rear light when you brake who 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.420
 lights up and that's it so I'll get it to you 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.360
 want to start without necessarily doing 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.610
 noise for what there is my parents who 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.640
 sleep so I'm incapacitated 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.190
 to do it or have trouble talking about 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.930
 well sorry then wait i'm going 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.930
 try because it's hard enough 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.359
 and here it is, it's good there it is 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.580
 alight 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.989
 so let's start with the horn 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.880
 does it make noise too the engine 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.220
 so we'll just take care of 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.210
 headlights and turn signals here you are 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.320
 will make another video to make you 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.970
 see with the camera gopro that's who 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.490
 still costs quite expensive so I 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.220
 think it's not going to be right now 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.620
 So here we go to see Roman 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.780
 cons but small end already that it makes a 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.300
 small brightness 20 levels when we 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.830
 is already in the night even the day for 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.810
 enlighten well to be seen by the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:57.840

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:01.880

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.690

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.800

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.000

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:15.320
 the screen so look in there and that's 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.910

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.320
 races and everything and everything we can 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.860
 put there like that there is a bag that we 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.080
 can put and it serves us that serves us 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.169

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.770
 of light and linfort cut so for 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.360
 a little strong like that to the val it's already 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.450
 quite well especially in the middle of the night so 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.970
 it should go normally I you 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.550
 will say that very quickly 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.380
 here I am off and that's it 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.360
 now the flashers we're going 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.070
 start with the blinker on the right and 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.190
 after the flashing left then and 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.290
 so flashing right 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.740
 sorry I did not turn off that otherwise 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:28.470
 it is consumed light and 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:34.670
 turn indicators so they light up at 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:41.370
 the front and back and as far left 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:43.230
 we see it sorry there and so here it is 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.880
 if we brake at the same time, that's when 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.710
 even better red also to the goods are going 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.220
 to savor and to extinguish 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.770
 we press this little button so it 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.280
 yeah and that removes that and so that in 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.650
 may for example customers for example 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.360
 the right even holds the left it's going to be 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.900
 same is true it puts us small 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.580
 and less to kehl so here it is 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.030
 same for the lights I believe this 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.040
 to be brand 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:13.890
 ok yes here is a small a small 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.270
 light blue blue sky hair what who 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.080
 light up when we're in 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.700
 full far laughing 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.470
 is it the ceilings and that's it 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.300
 so the acceleration handle is good 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:31.080
 oh yes I am happy we have our 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:38.220

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:39.810

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.540
 open then the kof which is yes enough 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.600

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.930
 since when I passed my exam for 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.150
 the bsr or permit to m as you want 

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.800
