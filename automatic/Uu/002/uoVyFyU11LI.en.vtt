and this is important right over here
then<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.149> double-click<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.110> analog<00:01:46.710> card

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
then you double-click the analog card

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.399 
then you double-click the analog card
under<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.470> new<00:01:50.009> window<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.700> properties

under this new window the properties
click<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.710> outputs<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.060> could<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.509> for

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
click the outputs so you could see for

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.200 
click the outputs so you could see for
the<00:01:54.930> individual<00:01:55.740> channel<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the individual channel you have the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.719 
the individual channel you have the
selection<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> voltage<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:58.979> current<00:01:59.219> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
selection for the voltage or current and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.609 
selection for the voltage or current and
again<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> voltage<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.439> have<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
again on the voltage you have a

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.249 
again on the voltage you have a
different<00:02:02.100> selection<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.930> example

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
different selection so for this example

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.059

on<00:02:57.909> the<00:02:58.150> subnet<00:02:58.689> north<00:02:59.079> network<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.489> heat<00:03:00.909> mu

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
on the subnet north network so heat mu

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.539 
on the subnet north network so heat mu
on<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.290> right<00:03:02.530> side<00:03:02.859> and<00:03:05.219> that<00:03:06.219> will

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
on the right side and that will

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.259 
on the right side and that will
basically<00:03:07.260> establish<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.500> network<00:03:09.370> with<00:03:10.120> the

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
basically establish a network with the

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.839 
basically establish a network with the
profinet<00:03:10.870> device<00:03:11.349> so<00:03:11.680> now<00:03:11.859> it<00:03:12.040> says<00:03:12.069> network

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
profinet device so now it says network

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:13.520 
profinet device so now it says network

you<00:05:16.310> could<00:05:16.639> change<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.419> from<00:05:18.259> 4<00:05:19.069> to<00:05:19.250> 20<00:05:19.699> milli

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
you could change it from 4 to 20 milli

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.600 
you could change it from 4 to 20 milli
amperes<00:05:20.389> or<00:05:20.690> plus<00:05:20.960> minus<00:05:21.409> 20<00:05:21.680> milli<00:05:22.159> amperes

so for this example let's give it 4 to

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.810 
so for this example let's give it 4 to
20<00:05:25.789> milli<00:05:25.969> amperes

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820
