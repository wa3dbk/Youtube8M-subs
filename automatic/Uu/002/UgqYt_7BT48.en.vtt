00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.409
 area that we want to record from our 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.280
 good screen to record the whole mom 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.670
 you click on an aerial corner is here 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.640

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.450
 its opposite corner that is this one here 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.430
 ready good here where I made microphone I know 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.860
 what to do with microphone mark the option 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.630
 as well as being me but if not 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.909
 they want to record with microphone they mark them 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.490
 here for example if they want to do with what 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.700
 they do not mark them but like the microphone 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.500
 the brand 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.110
 good here in general volume is for 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.090
 record the system audio for example 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.820
 that is playing music because it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.070
 listen in the good video 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.689
 here the wmv format that comes by 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.659
 defect here in these three points here 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.030
 we click and here is to know where 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.380
 they want to save the video to see me in the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.479
 desk and accept good here where 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.310
 says stop after is to know 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.619
 whenever as you want it to last 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.869
 his good video recommended that we 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.060
 mark that option because you never know 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.790
 how long to last with video 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.269
 well here where it says start after 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.739
 they mark it so that the program knows 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.590
 how long will you wait to start 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.989
 to record there they put five seconds 10 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.700
 seconds the time they want good 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.980
 here is also the brand in minimize 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.019
 to start so that when it starts to 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.690
 record the program automatically 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.250
 minimize good here is also the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.030
 mark in captures the cursor so that 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.030
 capture the cursor 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.709
 good to follow the mouse do not mark it 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.410
 I recommend it because I love the sea 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.150
 did nothing I recorded the mouse did not 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.340
 I left the whole screen only 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.650
 recorded the movements of the mouse like this 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.170
 that does not brand it up to the mark for 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.140
 buy the windows and these two also 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.870

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:10.260
