00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.280 
something on everything we put them up
on<00:02:32.460> immediately<00:02:33.460> it<00:02:33.820> wasn't<00:02:34.480> like<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.840> struggle

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
on immediately it wasn't like a struggle

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.530 
on immediately it wasn't like a struggle
with<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.500> placement<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.520> don't<00:02:36.580> know<00:02:36.850> if<00:02:37.210> I

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
with the placement and I don't know if I

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.880 
with the placement and I don't know if I
don't<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:38.350> we<00:02:38.410> could<00:02:38.500> have<00:02:38.650> gotten<00:02:38.770> lucky

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
don't think we could have gotten lucky

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.740 
don't think we could have gotten lucky
that<00:02:39.190> many<00:02:39.430> times<00:02:39.730> but<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.330> don't<00:02:40.510> know<00:02:40.570> if<00:02:40.660> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
that many times but I don't know if the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.080 
that many times but I don't know if the
off-axis<00:02:41.140> response<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:42.130> just<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.490> neutral

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
off-axis response is just that neutral

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.660 
off-axis response is just that neutral
or<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:44.410> exactly<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.220> making<00:02:45.550> this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
or what exactly is making this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.790 
or what exactly is making this
microphone<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.360> easy<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.840> position<00:02:46.990> but<00:02:47.560> I

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
microphone so easy to position but I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800 
microphone so easy to position but I
mean<00:02:48.310> I've<00:02:48.820> been<00:02:49.090> wrestling<00:02:49.660> with<00:02:49.780> that

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
mean I've been wrestling with that

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.340 
mean I've been wrestling with that
Steinway<00:02:50.380> B<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:51.190> years<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.390> still<00:02:52.990> it's<00:02:53.140> rare

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
Steinway B for years and still it's rare

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.600 
Steinway B for years and still it's rare
for<00:02:53.500> me<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.620> take<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> brand-new<00:02:54.370> pair<00:02:54.550> of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
for me to take a brand-new pair of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.340 
for me to take a brand-new pair of
microphones<00:02:54.760> I'm<00:02:55.120> unfamiliar<00:02:55.510> with<00:02:55.600> put<00:02:56.170> them

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
microphones I'm unfamiliar with put them

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.770 
microphones I'm unfamiliar with put them
up<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.100> first<00:02:57.430> position<00:02:57.940> run<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.420> get<00:02:58.750> a

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
up in the first position run I get a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.050 
up in the first position run I get a
great<00:02:59.050> sound<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.560> mean<00:02:59.710> we<00:03:00.280> didn't<00:03:00.760> even<00:03:00.790> move

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
great sound I mean we didn't even move

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.790 
great sound I mean we didn't even move
them<00:03:01.210> at<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.480> point<00:03:01.750> we<00:03:02.140> just<00:03:02.320> went<00:03:02.440> with<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
them at that point we just went with the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.470 
them at that point we just went with the
first<00:03:03.190> positioning<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:04.000> we<00:03:04.120> put<00:03:04.300> them<00:03:04.390> up

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
first positioning that we put them up

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.260 
first positioning that we put them up
with<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:05.350> think<00:03:05.800> I<00:03:06.130> love<00:03:06.610> what<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:06.970> said<00:03:07.210> about

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
with I think I love what you said about

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.730 
with I think I love what you said about
them<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.440> it's<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:08.770> nice<00:03:09.270> blend<00:03:10.270> between

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
them that it's this nice blend between

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.440 
them that it's this nice blend between
large<00:03:11.740> and<00:03:11.950> small<00:03:12.040> diaphragm<00:03:12.640> microphone

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
large and small diaphragm microphone

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.930 
large and small diaphragm microphone
that<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.080> get<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.350> attack<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.640> sort<00:03:15.910> of

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
that you get the attack and the sort of

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.070 
that you get the attack and the sort of
sort<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.480> initial<00:03:17.280> speed<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:19.600> small

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
sort of the initial speed of a small

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.730 
sort of the initial speed of a small
diaphragm

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
diaphragm

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.230 
diaphragm
but<00:03:21.400> what's<00:03:21.550> sort<00:03:21.670> of<00:03:21.730> like<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.000> back<00:03:22.210> end

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
but what's sort of like the back end

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.590 
but what's sort of like the back end
musicality<00:03:23.080> of<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.950> large<00:03:24.190> diaphragm<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.940> really

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
musicality of a large diaphragm I really

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.870 
musicality of a large diaphragm I really
experienced<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.380> on<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.800> piano<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.430> felt

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
experienced that on the piano I felt

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.520 
experienced that on the piano I felt
like<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.060> soft<00:03:28.300> hammers<00:03:28.840> really<00:03:29.350> were

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
like the soft hammers really were

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.860 
like the soft hammers really were
captured<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.520> sort<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:30.940> immediacy<00:03:31.720> of

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
captured and sort of that immediacy of

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.290 
captured and sort of that immediacy of
the<00:03:31.959> hammer<00:03:32.230> attack<00:03:32.410> was<00:03:32.860> there<00:03:33.239> even<00:03:34.239> though

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
the hammer attack was there even though

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.030 
the hammer attack was there even though
it<00:03:34.360> was<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.540> soft<00:03:34.840> camera<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.350> captured<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
it was a soft camera it captured the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.860 
it was a soft camera it captured the
attack<00:03:37.050> but<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.080> back<00:03:38.350> end<00:03:38.730> wasn't<00:03:39.870> so

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
attack but the back end wasn't so

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.770 
attack but the back end wasn't so
overdone<00:03:41.800> with<00:03:41.860> overtones<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.510> was<00:03:43.600> like

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
overdone with overtones that it was like

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.680 
overdone with overtones that it was like
difficult<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.920> manage<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.880> lot<00:03:46.330> of<00:03:46.450> times

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
difficult to manage a lot of times

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.590 
difficult to manage a lot of times
that's<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.890> problem<00:03:48.340> of<00:03:48.730> small<00:03:48.940> diaphragms

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
that's the problem of small diaphragms

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.360 
that's the problem of small diaphragms
on<00:03:49.840> acoustic<00:03:50.200> instruments<00:03:50.560> they<00:03:50.920> can<00:03:51.100> sound

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
on acoustic instruments they can sound

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.210 
on acoustic instruments they can sound
thin<00:03:51.760> but<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.660> one<00:03:52.840> had<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.020> attack<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.770> a

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
thin but this one had the attack of a

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.370 
thin but this one had the attack of a
small<00:03:54.520> diaphragm<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.030> way<00:03:55.209> with<00:03:56.170> that

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
small diaphragm in a way with that

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.800 
small diaphragm in a way with that
musicality<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.280> warmth<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.209> smoothness

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
musicality that warmth that smoothness

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.280 
musicality that warmth that smoothness
of<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.680> large<00:03:59.890> diaphragm<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.430> mean<00:04:00.550> I<00:04:00.700> mean<00:04:01.390> it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
of a large diaphragm I mean I mean it

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.410 
of a large diaphragm I mean I mean it
was<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:03.489> was<00:04:03.610> a<00:04:03.640> breath<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.030> fresh<00:04:04.090> air<00:04:04.360> and

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
was it was a breath of fresh air and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:15.170 
was it was a breath of fresh air and
it's<00:04:04.720> great<00:04:04.989> Mike

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.640 

there<00:04:16.180> were<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.419> first<00:04:16.480> things<00:04:16.870> traps<00:04:17.230> and<00:04:17.530> I

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
there were the first things traps and I

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.740 
there were the first things traps and I
did<00:04:17.889> with<00:04:18.100> them<00:04:18.340> was<00:04:18.579> through<00:04:19.419> them<00:04:19.630> through

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
did with them was through them through

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.650 
did with them was through them through
you<00:04:19.930> know<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.320> preamp<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.180> try<00:04:22.180> for<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.510> variety

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
you know to preamp and try for a variety

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.430 
you know to preamp and try for a variety
of<00:04:22.990> different<00:04:23.139> flavors<00:04:23.440> we<00:04:24.010> tried<00:04:24.280> full-blown

you<00:04:29.919> know<00:04:30.010> pulling<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.520> back<00:04:30.700> on<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.180> input

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
you know pulling it back on the input

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.170 
you know pulling it back on the input
and<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.320> definitely<00:04:33.070> came<00:04:33.520> through<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:34.000> all

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.610 
and it definitely came through on all
three<00:04:34.419> settings<00:04:34.810> that<00:04:34.960> we<00:04:35.080> tried<00:04:35.290> for<00:04:35.320> that

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
three settings that we tried for that

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.030 
three settings that we tried for that
yeah<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:37.630> resonator<00:04:38.139> you<00:04:38.500> know<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.620> mean<00:04:38.889> it

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
yeah the resonator you know I mean it

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.980 
yeah the resonator you know I mean it
took<00:04:39.250> just<00:04:39.490> as<00:04:39.700> easy<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.180> resonator<00:04:40.630> as<00:04:40.840> it

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
took just as easy to the resonator as it

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.750 
took just as easy to the resonator as it
did<00:04:41.140> to<00:04:41.410> anything<00:04:41.950> else<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.340> we<00:04:42.430> tried<00:04:42.640> or

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
did to anything else that we tried or

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.100 
did to anything else that we tried or
not<00:04:42.880> we<00:04:43.060> tried<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.419> on<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.690> know<00:04:43.810> bright

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
not we tried it on you know bright

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.050 
not we tried it on you know bright
guitars<00:04:44.500> picked<00:04:44.919> near<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.220> bridge<00:04:45.430> finger

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
guitars picked near the bridge finger

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.920 
guitars picked near the bridge finger
style<00:04:46.360> guitar<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.800> resonator<00:04:48.450> just<00:04:49.450> regular

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
style guitar the resonator just regular

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.990 
style guitar the resonator just regular
strung<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.500> guitar<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.250> performed

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
strung the guitar and it performed

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.730 
strung the guitar and it performed
equally<00:04:52.419> well<00:04:52.450> on<00:04:52.630> all<00:04:53.169> those<00:04:53.320> different

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
equally well on all those different

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.830 
equally well on all those different
kinds<00:04:53.919> doing<00:04:54.640> well<00:04:54.790> on<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:54.940> resonator<00:04:55.390> almost

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840

system<00:04:56.200> okay<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:58.090> was<00:04:58.180> can<00:04:58.330> be<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.630> little<00:04:58.870> a

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
system okay that was can be a little a

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:17.580 
system okay that was can be a little a
little<00:04:59.680> wonky<00:04:59.830> yeah

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.310 

yeah<00:05:18.520> I<00:05:18.550> was<00:05:18.700> thinking<00:05:19.030> about<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:20.080> large

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
yeah I was thinking about the the large

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.960 
yeah I was thinking about the the large
diaphragm<00:05:20.620> small<00:05:21.130> diaphragm<00:05:21.340> comparison

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970

video<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.330> we<00:05:22.450> did<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:22.900> when<00:05:23.320> I<00:05:23.350> was<00:05:23.560> hearing

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
video that we did and when I was hearing

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.150 
video that we did and when I was hearing
this<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.550> was<00:05:24.990> it<00:05:25.990> did<00:05:26.230> really<00:05:26.560> sound<00:05:26.889> like<00:05:26.980> it

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
this it was it did really sound like it

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.370 
this it was it did really sound like it
you<00:05:27.430> combined<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.540> recordings<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.200> this

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
you combined the recordings of this

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.960 
you combined the recordings of this
small<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:29.770> large<00:05:29.980> doctor<00:05:30.310> I'm<00:05:30.430> like<00:05:30.580> senthil

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
small and large doctor I'm like senthil

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.590 
small and large doctor I'm like senthil
won<00:05:31.590> best<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.740> both<00:05:32.860> worlds<00:05:33.250> yeah<00:05:33.970> that's<00:05:34.360> what

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
won best of both worlds yeah that's what

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.900 
won best of both worlds yeah that's what
girls<00:05:34.840> are<00:05:34.930> supposed<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.620> like<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:36.040> compromise

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
girls are supposed to like a compromise

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.970 
girls are supposed to like a compromise
because<00:05:37.540> usually<00:05:37.840> when<00:05:38.200> you<00:05:38.290> select<00:05:38.740> one<00:05:38.950> or

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
because usually when you select one or

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.290 
because usually when you select one or
the<00:05:39.130> other<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:39.580> feel<00:05:39.970> like<00:05:40.120> you're

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
the other you feel like you're

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.970 
the other you feel like you're
compromise<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:40.990> then<00:05:41.050> you're<00:05:41.200> fighting<00:05:41.710> with

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
compromise and then you're fighting with

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.610 
compromise and then you're fighting with
the<00:05:42.130> preamp<00:05:42.520> selection<00:05:43.180> to<00:05:43.300> try<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:43.750> you<00:05:44.500> know

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
the preamp selection to try and you know

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.159 
the preamp selection to try and you know
solve<00:05:44.980> the<00:05:45.820> compromise<00:05:46.330> that<00:05:46.660> you<00:05:46.690> made<00:05:46.960> I

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
solve the compromise that you made I

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.409 
solve the compromise that you made I
mean<00:05:47.290> they<00:05:47.380> they<00:05:47.889> really<00:05:48.040> tend<00:05:48.940> to<00:05:49.030> be<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.150> blend

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
mean they they really tend to be a blend

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.090 
mean they they really tend to be a blend
of<00:05:49.540> the<00:05:49.660> two<00:05:49.690> and<00:05:50.139> in<00:05:50.290> a<00:05:50.380> way<00:05:50.530> that<00:05:50.740> all<00:05:50.860> the

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
of the two and in a way that all the

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.210 
of the two and in a way that all the
musical<00:05:51.460> sources<00:05:51.790> we<00:05:51.940> put<00:05:52.180> them<00:05:52.300> on<00:05:53.220> combining

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
musical sources we put them on combining

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.090 
musical sources we put them on combining
the<00:05:54.310> best<00:05:54.520> of<00:05:54.700> small<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.150> large<00:05:55.270> diaphragm

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
the best of small and large diaphragm

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.520 
the best of small and large diaphragm
characteristics<00:05:57.690> you<00:05:58.690> know<00:05:58.810> without

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
characteristics you know without

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.710 
characteristics you know without
compromise<00:06:00.190> it<00:06:00.430> was<00:06:00.520> really<00:06:00.880> really

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
compromise it was really really

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:09.350 
compromise it was really really
something

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360
