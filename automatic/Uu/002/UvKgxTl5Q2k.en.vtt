00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.390
 replicas generally of those that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 can be found in any store or 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.899
 in any but do not be stupid if 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.300
 you are really weapons the code is usually 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.190
 use firearms or even this 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 same technique perfectly you want 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.180
 any 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.370
 in the real guns you do not see 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 flash but in the cinema what is sought 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.160
 It's a stylistic reality where you see 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.160
 beautiful 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:02.650
 this do this we need first ones 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:05.050
 elements glasses we drag the video to 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.760
 work field we duplicate it we put 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.460
 the first layer in the add option 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.380
 we reduce the opacity of this to 0% 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.450
 we synchronize the time bar with the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:24.610
 shot we drag the flash to the field 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:30.190
 work we put it in front of the weapon what 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:39.460
 we scale we put the flash musel in the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:41.380
 add option now we use the key 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.030
 position friends to adjust the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.030
 flash in the back of the frame 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.130
 we activate the camps in two amount of 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.289
 the duplicate layer 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.030
 we put the first 100% on 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.450
 next to 50 and the next to 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.450
 brain 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.069
 finally we make some masks in the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:12.459
 areas in which the nursing plan 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:25.599
 the environment we increase the pen of the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:27.670
 we reuse masks we add the audio 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.310
 we already have our effect of 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.989
 shot that good and this is all for today 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.450
