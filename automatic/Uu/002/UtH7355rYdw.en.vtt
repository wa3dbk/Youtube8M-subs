00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.820 

I<00:00:03.670> think<00:00:04.670> it's<00:00:04.850> a<00:00:06.549> portly<00:00:07.549> maturity<00:00:08.149> thing<00:00:08.299> and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:08.830 
I think it's a portly maturity thing and

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.680 
I think it's a portly maturity thing and
portly<00:00:09.830> a<00:00:09.860> characteristic<00:00:10.730> of<00:00:10.850> an<00:00:11.270> industry

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
portly a characteristic of an industry

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.540 
portly a characteristic of an industry
because<00:00:12.320> the<00:00:12.440> transport<00:00:12.860> system<00:00:12.980> I<00:00:13.280> think<00:00:13.460> is

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
because the transport system I think is

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.269 
because the transport system I think is
a<00:00:13.700> an<00:00:13.880> interesting<00:00:14.240> mix<00:00:14.660> of<00:00:15.099> society<00:00:16.099> driven

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
a an interesting mix of society driven

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.970 
a an interesting mix of society driven
services<00:00:16.880> and<00:00:17.290> commercial<00:00:18.290> driven<00:00:18.560> services

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
services and commercial driven services

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.920 
services and commercial driven services
so<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:19.849> society<00:00:20.149> and<00:00:20.450> again<00:00:20.660> have<00:00:20.840> an

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
so the society and again have an

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.810 
so the society and again have an
interest<00:00:21.230> of<00:00:21.410> all<00:00:22.040> those<00:00:22.279> that<00:00:22.489> we<00:00:22.610> talked

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
interest of all those that we talked

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.280 
interest of all those that we talked
about<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.210> sustainability<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:24.169> efficiency

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
about the sustainability and efficiency

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.380 
about the sustainability and efficiency
and<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:24.860> safety<00:00:25.189> because<00:00:25.849> that<00:00:26.029> will<00:00:26.180> save

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
and the safety because that will save

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.900 
and the safety because that will save
lives<00:00:26.419> it<00:00:27.110> will<00:00:27.320> have<00:00:27.559> less<00:00:28.160> emissions<00:00:28.579> and<00:00:28.820> so

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
lives it will have less emissions and so

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.659 
lives it will have less emissions and so
forth<00:00:29.119> but<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:30.500> only<00:00:30.770> tool<00:00:30.950> that<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.250> society

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
forth but the only tool that the society

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.280 
forth but the only tool that the society
of<00:00:31.730> had<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.029> either<00:00:32.360> to<00:00:32.689> have<00:00:32.899> regulatory

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
of had is either to have regulatory

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.620 
of had is either to have regulatory
initiatives<00:00:33.649> and<00:00:34.610> playing<00:00:34.880> with<00:00:35.090> regulation

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
initiatives and playing with regulation

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.630 
initiatives and playing with regulation
takes<00:00:35.900> time<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.650> transport<00:00:37.100> system<00:00:37.220> is<00:00:37.490> also

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
takes time the transport system is also

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.010 
takes time the transport system is also
complex<00:00:38.000> when<00:00:38.240> it<00:00:38.360> comes<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.720> number<00:00:38.990> of

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
complex when it comes to a number of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.390 
complex when it comes to a number of
actors<00:00:39.740> with<00:00:40.270> different<00:00:41.270> interests<00:00:42.370> so<00:00:43.370> a

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
actors with different interests so a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.540 
actors with different interests so a
regulatory<00:00:44.000> initiative<00:00:44.630> is<00:00:45.220> mostly<00:00:46.220> have<00:00:46.460> an

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
regulatory initiative is mostly have an

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.930 
regulatory initiative is mostly have an
impact<00:00:47.210> on<00:00:47.390> may<00:00:47.780> many<00:00:48.260> existing<00:00:49.010> players<00:00:49.460> and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
impact on may many existing players and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.930 
impact on may many existing players and
their<00:00:50.360> existing<00:00:51.290> business<00:00:51.579> so<00:00:52.579> there<00:00:52.730> may<00:00:52.910> be

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
their existing business so there may be

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.870 
their existing business so there may be
an<00:00:53.210> conflict<00:00:54.110> of<00:00:54.350> interest<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:54.950> speed<00:00:55.579> up<00:00:55.730> a

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
an conflict of interest to speed up a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.310 
an conflict of interest to speed up a
regulation<00:00:56.329> or<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.720> try<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:56.930> slow<00:00:57.170> down

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
regulation or to try to slow down

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.560 
regulation or to try to slow down
regulation<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.610> I<00:00:58.640> think<00:00:58.700> that's<00:00:58.970> one<00:00:59.150> one

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
regulation so I think that's one one

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.229 
regulation so I think that's one one
component<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:01.250> other<00:01:01.370> one<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.940> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
component the other one is the the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.719 
component the other one is the the
automotive<00:01:02.570> industry<00:01:02.810> and<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:04.220> very<00:01:04.430> long

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
automotive industry and the very long

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.550 
automotive industry and the very long
planning<00:01:05.269> cycles<00:01:05.780> for<00:01:06.020> new<00:01:06.200> vehicle

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
planning cycles for new vehicle

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.770 
planning cycles for new vehicle
development<00:01:07.009> and<00:01:07.970> of<00:01:08.180> course<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.540> automotive

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
development and of course the automotive

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.810 
development and of course the automotive
industry<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.409> very<00:01:09.620> cost<00:01:09.860> sensitive<00:01:09.890> as<00:01:10.760> you

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
industry is very cost sensitive as you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.390 
industry is very cost sensitive as you
know<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.510> new<00:01:11.750> car<00:01:11.990> sales<00:01:12.400> have

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
know the the new car sales have

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.740 
know the the new car sales have
challenges<00:01:14.060> when<00:01:14.300> it<00:01:14.390> comes<00:01:14.630> to

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
challenges when it comes to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.890 
challenges when it comes to
profitability<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.700> then<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:17.630> are<00:01:17.720> very

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
profitability and then you are very

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.100 
profitability and then you are very
cautious<00:01:18.290> on<00:01:18.440> on<00:01:18.680> what<00:01:18.860> sort<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:20.110> capability

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
cautious on on what sort of capability

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.080 
cautious on on what sort of capability
and<00:01:21.229> technology<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:22.100> build<00:01:22.280> in<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.940> need

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
and technology you build in and you need

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.920 
and technology you build in and you need
to<00:01:23.299> have<00:01:23.450> very<00:01:24.430> long<00:01:25.430> foresight<00:01:26.000> in<00:01:26.270> planning

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
to have very long foresight in planning

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.620 
to have very long foresight in planning
the<00:01:27.049> new<00:01:27.200> car<00:01:27.409> models<00:01:27.880> now<00:01:28.880> that<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.210> coming<00:01:29.420> to

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the new car models now that is coming to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.680 
the new car models now that is coming to
a<00:01:30.020> solution<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.740> think<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.299> speed<00:01:32.299> at<00:01:32.570> which

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
a solution I think the speed at which

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.990 
a solution I think the speed at which
the<00:01:33.020> automotive<00:01:33.290> industry<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:33.950> taking<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the automotive industry is taking the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.640 
the automotive industry is taking the
whole<00:01:35.150> connectivity<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.110> connected<00:01:36.500> car

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
whole connectivity and the connected car

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.210 
whole connectivity and the connected car
service<00:01:37.100> is<00:01:37.510> providing<00:01:38.510> digital<00:01:39.440> lifestyle

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
service is providing digital lifestyle

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.390 
service is providing digital lifestyle
within<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.909> car<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:42.260> speed<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.799> change<00:01:42.979> is

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
within the car the speed of change is

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.430 
within the car the speed of change is
impressive<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.360> think<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.930> amount<00:01:45.290> of

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
impressive I think and the amount of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.990 
impressive I think and the amount of
money<00:01:45.650> that<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.950> automotive<00:01:46.250> industry<00:01:46.490> now

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
money that the automotive industry now

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.960 
money that the automotive industry now
put<00:01:47.240> into<00:01:47.540> innovation<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.890> also<00:01:49.189> impressive<00:01:49.760> I

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
put into innovation is also impressive I

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.330 
put into innovation is also impressive I
think<00:01:50.689> it's<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.080> country<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:51.650> changing

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
think it's a country that is changing

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.880 
think it's a country that is changing
quickly
