00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
see what the card was that I pulled out

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
see what the card was that I pulled out
book<00:00:48.090> I'm<00:00:48.570> sure<00:00:48.780> I'll<00:00:48.930> turn<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.290> then<00:00:49.920> they'll

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
book I'm sure I'll turn up then they'll

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.410 
book I'm sure I'll turn up then they'll
be<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.340> no<00:00:50.580> that's<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.059> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
be like no that's not it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
be like no that's not it
so<00:00:51.720> you<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.989> throw<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.380> way<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.400> just

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
so you just throw that way just so just

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
so you just throw that way just so just
give<00:00:53.790> it<00:00:53.880> to<00:00:53.940> them<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.630> then<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.989> let's<00:00:55.710> try

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
give it to them and then just let's try

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.600 
give it to them and then just let's try
this<00:00:55.950> that<00:00:57.500> then<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> say<00:00:58.830> that's<00:00:59.340> gotta<00:00:59.550> be

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
this that then you say that's gotta be

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.990 
this that then you say that's gotta be
it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
it
so<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:01.620> say<00:01:01.860> no<00:01:01.890> then

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so when they when they say no then

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.280 
so when they when they say no then
you're<00:01:02.880> just<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.239> confused<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:04.140> it
