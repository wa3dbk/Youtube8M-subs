the<00:04:47.900> subway<00:04:48.290> Mach<00:04:49.000> so<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.120> only<00:04:50.330> thing<00:04:50.510> I

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
the subway Mach so the only thing I

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.090 
the subway Mach so the only thing I
could<00:04:50.840> have<00:04:50.870> done<00:04:51.020> is<00:04:51.410> maybe<00:04:51.620> improve<00:04:51.980> the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
could have done is maybe improve the

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.880 
could have done is maybe improve the
side<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.340> little<00:04:52.520> bit<00:04:52.790> put<00:04:52.970> some<00:04:53.030> windows<00:04:53.510> in

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
side a little bit put some windows in

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.810 
side a little bit put some windows in
however<00:04:54.890> this<00:04:55.670> are<00:04:55.910> most<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.360> subways<00:04:56.930> are<00:04:56.960> in

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
however this are most of subways are in

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.480 
however this are most of subways are in
mini<00:04:58.820> malls<00:04:59.090> or<00:04:59.510> like<00:05:00.170> shopping<00:05:00.560> centers<00:05:00.980> so<00:05:01.460> I

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
mini malls or like shopping centers so I

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.340 
mini malls or like shopping centers so I
think<00:05:01.640> it<00:05:01.910> would<00:05:01.970> fit<00:05:02.210> right<00:05:02.480> in<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:02.870> one<00:05:03.260> of

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
think it would fit right in to one of

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.500 
think it would fit right in to one of
those<00:05:03.440> small<00:05:03.710> shopping<00:05:04.190> centers<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:04.790> then

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
those small shopping centers and then

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.020 
those small shopping centers and then
once<00:05:05.720> again<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:06.200> roof<00:05:06.440> is<00:05:06.710> you<00:05:07.670> know<00:05:07.790> one

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
once again the roof is you know one

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.030 
once again the roof is you know one
piece<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.660> put<00:05:08.930> this<00:05:09.080> in<00:05:09.290> the<00:05:09.380> back<00:05:09.590> there<00:05:10.010> to

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
piece I put this in the back there to

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.420 
piece I put this in the back there to
kind<00:05:10.640> of<00:05:10.700> hold<00:05:10.910> this<00:05:11.150> plate<00:05:11.630> together<00:05:12.430> but

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
kind of hold this plate together but

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.050 
kind of hold this plate together but
it's<00:05:13.580> mostly<00:05:13.970> it's<00:05:14.240> pretty<00:05:14.480> solid<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:16.060> of

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
it's mostly it's pretty solid and of

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.920 
it's mostly it's pretty solid and of
course<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.420> just<00:05:17.450> clips<00:05:17.780> right<00:05:17.990> back<00:05:18.170> on<00:05:19.930> so

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
course it just clips right back on so

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.020 
course it just clips right back on so
