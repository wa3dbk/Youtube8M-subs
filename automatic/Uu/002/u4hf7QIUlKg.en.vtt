part three of our five-part video series

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.280 
part three of our five-part video series
today<00:00:21.670> we're<00:00:21.910> going<00:00:22.029> to<00:00:22.119> talk<00:00:22.240> about<00:00:22.390> RAM<00:00:22.960> and

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
today we're going to talk about RAM and

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.589 
today we're going to talk about RAM and
what<00:00:23.619> exactly<00:00:24.189> it<00:00:24.730> is<00:00:24.760> and<00:00:25.090> what<00:00:25.180> it<00:00:25.270> does<00:00:25.390> for

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
what exactly it is and what it does for

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.890 
what exactly it is and what it does for
you

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
you

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.800 
you
right<00:00:26.439> Ram<00:00:26.740> is<00:00:27.009> stands<00:00:27.640> for<00:00:27.910> random<00:00:28.689> access

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
right Ram is stands for random access

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.740 
right Ram is stands for random access
memory<00:00:29.770> it's<00:00:30.340> not<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.730> same<00:00:30.939> as<00:00:31.210> your<00:00:31.480> hard

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
memory it's not the same as your hard

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.910 
memory it's not the same as your hard
drive<00:00:32.050> which<00:00:32.290> is<00:00:32.320> what<00:00:32.500> we<00:00:32.590> talked<00:00:32.830> about

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
drive which is what we talked about

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.630 
drive which is what we talked about
yesterday

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
yesterday

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.270 
yesterday
Ram<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.480> a<00:00:34.750> totally<00:00:35.260> different<00:00:35.290> kind<00:00:36.040> of

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
Ram is a totally different kind of

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.580 
Ram is a totally different kind of
memory<00:00:36.670> that<00:00:36.940> your<00:00:37.059> computer<00:00:37.480> needs<00:00:37.750> just<00:00:38.500> as

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
memory that your computer needs just as

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.509 
memory that your computer needs just as
much<00:00:38.769> as<00:00:38.920> your<00:00:39.010> hard<00:00:39.160> drive<00:00:39.340> but<00:00:39.460> for

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
much as your hard drive but for

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.210 
much as your hard drive but for
different<00:00:39.699> purposes<00:00:40.300> when<00:00:40.960> you<00:00:41.050> use<00:00:41.230> Ram<00:00:41.530> it's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
different purposes when you use Ram it's

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.729 
different purposes when you use Ram it's
actually<00:00:42.699> temporary<00:00:43.390> memory<00:00:43.660> your<00:00:44.320> computer

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
actually temporary memory your computer

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.380 
actually temporary memory your computer
will<00:00:44.860> store<00:00:45.100> things<00:00:45.370> there<00:00:45.610> for<00:00:45.910> a<00:00:45.940> short

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
will store things there for a short

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.990 
will store things there for a short
amount<00:00:46.660> of<00:00:46.720> time<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.800> needs<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.640> needs<00:00:48.880> to

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
amount of time and it needs it needs to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.459 
amount of time and it needs it needs to
be<00:00:49.090> able<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.360> do<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.660> so<00:00:49.870> it<00:00:49.989> can<00:00:50.110> get<00:00:50.230> access

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
be able to do that so it can get access

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.069 
be able to do that so it can get access
to<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.770> quickly<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:51.550> then<00:00:52.120> forget<00:00:52.750> about<00:00:52.780> it

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
to it quickly and then forget about it

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.810 
to it quickly and then forget about it
later<00:00:53.260> right<00:00:53.980> now<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.190> know<00:00:54.340> how<00:00:54.430> temporary

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
later right now you know how temporary

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.190 
later right now you know how temporary
ramp<00:00:55.149> can<00:00:55.300> be<00:00:55.360> if<00:00:55.570> you've<00:00:55.690> ever<00:00:55.840> been<00:00:55.989> using

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
ramp can be if you've ever been using

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.440 
ramp can be if you've ever been using
your<00:00:56.410> computer<00:00:56.860> in<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.100> thunderstorm<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:58.059> have

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
your computer in a thunderstorm and have

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.000 
your computer in a thunderstorm and have
the<00:00:58.510> power<00:00:58.690> go<00:00:58.930> out<00:00:59.079> all<00:00:59.290> that<00:00:59.559> stuff<00:00:59.800> you<00:00:59.950> were

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
the power go out all that stuff you were

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.709 
the power go out all that stuff you were
working<00:01:00.399> on<00:01:00.460> just<00:01:00.879> gets<00:01:01.059> completely<00:01:01.510> wiped

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
working on just gets completely wiped

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.260 
working on just gets completely wiped
out<00:01:01.899> it's<00:01:02.110> no<00:01:02.230> fun<00:01:02.469> at<00:01:02.590> all<00:01:02.710> now<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.820> reason<00:01:04.180> we

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
out it's no fun at all now the reason we

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.270 
out it's no fun at all now the reason we
use<00:01:04.449> RAM<00:01:04.809> as<00:01:05.140> opposed<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.740> say<00:01:05.890> writing

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
use RAM as opposed to say writing

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.490 
use RAM as opposed to say writing
everything<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.850> harddrive<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.350> that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
everything to the harddrive so that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.139 
everything to the harddrive so that
nothing<00:01:08.770> gets<00:01:08.890> lost<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.550> reason<00:01:09.759> we<00:01:09.850> use<00:01:09.880> RAM

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
nothing gets lost the reason we use RAM

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.180 
nothing gets lost the reason we use RAM
is<00:01:10.300> because<00:01:10.539> it's<00:01:10.690> so<00:01:10.810> fast

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
is because it's so fast

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.150 
is because it's so fast
the<00:01:12.580> problem<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.210> with<00:01:14.200> writing<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.920> hard

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
the problem is with writing to a hard

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.350 
the problem is with writing to a hard
drive<00:01:15.340> have<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:15.580> ever<00:01:15.700> used<00:01:15.910> your<00:01:15.970> computer

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
drive have you ever used your computer

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.270 
drive have you ever used your computer
you<00:01:16.450> have<00:01:16.539> a<00:01:16.570> bunch<00:01:16.750> of<00:01:16.840> files<00:01:17.020> open<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:17.740> you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
you have a bunch of files open and you

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.770 
you have a bunch of files open and you
know<00:01:18.369> what<00:01:18.490> happens<00:01:18.850> right<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.450> computer

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
know what happens right the computer

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.750 
know what happens right the computer
starts<00:01:20.020> slowing<00:01:20.290> down<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:21.100> notice<00:01:21.430> your<00:01:21.549> hard

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
starts slowing down you notice your hard

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.190 
starts slowing down you notice your hard
drive<00:01:21.939> activities<00:01:22.570> increase<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.140> that

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
drive activities increase and that

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.330 
drive activities increase and that
little<00:01:23.380> lights<00:01:23.590> just<00:01:23.830> blinking<00:01:24.189> like<00:01:24.310> crazy

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
little lights just blinking like crazy

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.490 
little lights just blinking like crazy
on<00:01:24.880> there<00:01:25.150> well<00:01:25.689> what<00:01:25.780> happened<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.320> ran

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
on there well what happened is you ran

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.350 
on there well what happened is you ran
out<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:26.770> RAM<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.400> computer<00:01:27.850> started<00:01:28.210> using

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
out of RAM the computer started using

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.100 
out of RAM the computer started using
the<00:01:28.570> hard<00:01:28.810> drive<00:01:29.080> as<00:01:29.700> RAM<00:01:30.700> because<00:01:31.240> otherwise

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
the hard drive as RAM because otherwise

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.510 
the hard drive as RAM because otherwise
it<00:01:32.320> would<00:01:32.380> crash<00:01:32.650> you<00:01:32.950> would<00:01:33.070> have<00:01:33.189> no<00:01:33.340> choice

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
it would crash you would have no choice

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.280 
it would crash you would have no choice
but<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.820> it<00:01:34.540> has<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.750> put<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.140> information

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
but to it has to put that information

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.980 
but to it has to put that information
someplace<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.909> is<00:01:37.060> why<00:01:37.240> more<00:01:37.540> Ram<00:01:37.780> is

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
someplace and this is why more Ram is

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.810 
someplace and this is why more Ram is
better<00:01:38.229> because<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:39.280> more<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.790> have

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
better because the more that you have

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.280 
better because the more that you have
the<00:01:40.060> more<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:40.330> fast<00:01:40.630> memory<00:01:41.020> have<00:01:41.170> the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
the more that fast memory have the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.770 
the more that fast memory have the
passenger<00:01:41.619> computer<00:01:42.040> runs<00:01:42.250> right<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:43.299> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
passenger computer runs right and the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.289 
passenger computer runs right and the
other<00:01:43.960> thing<00:01:44.200> about<00:01:44.229> RAM<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.250> well<00:01:46.119> since

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
other thing about RAM is that well since

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.249 
other thing about RAM is that well since
we're<00:01:46.450> going<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.630> show<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.840> here<00:01:47.140> on<00:01:47.229> a

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
we're going to show you here on a

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.050 
we're going to show you here on a
computer<00:01:47.680> how<00:01:47.829> it<00:01:47.890> works<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.549> where<00:01:48.700> where<00:01:48.970> it

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
computer how it works and where where it

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.700 
computer how it works and where where it
goes<00:01:49.210> into<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.600> computer<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:50.259> it's<00:01:50.560> also

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
goes into the computer it's it's also

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.929 
goes into the computer it's it's also
important<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.189> know<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.369> there's<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.610> lot<00:01:51.759> of

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
important to know that there's a lot of

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.200 
important to know that there's a lot of
different<00:01:52.240> types<00:01:53.280> every<00:01:54.280> computer<00:01:54.759> out<00:01:55.000> there

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
different types every computer out there

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.590 
different types every computer out there
almost<00:01:55.540> has<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.619> different<00:01:57.100> kind<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.729> RAM<00:01:58.030> there

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
almost has a different kind of RAM there

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.240 
almost has a different kind of RAM there
it<00:01:58.840> seems<00:01:59.049> like<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.320> goes<00:01:59.470> in<00:01:59.619> generations

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
it seems like it goes in generations

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.670 
it seems like it goes in generations
you'll<00:02:00.430> have<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.880> couple<00:02:01.509> years<00:02:01.780> or<00:02:02.110> maybe<00:02:02.350> even

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
you'll have a couple years or maybe even

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.870 
you'll have a couple years or maybe even
less<00:02:02.860> where<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.220> have<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.369> certain<00:02:03.670> type<00:02:03.850> of

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
less where you have a certain type of

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.310 
less where you have a certain type of
RAM<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.270> then<00:02:04.390> you'll<00:02:04.540> move<00:02:04.659> on<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.049> next

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
RAM and then you'll move on to the next

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.609 
RAM and then you'll move on to the next
one

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619

configurations for the ramp to some

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.930 
configurations for the ramp to some
computers<00:02:37.040> need<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.460> them<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:37.670> pairs

computers need to have them in pairs
some<00:02:38.540> types<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.870> RAM<00:02:39.050> can<00:02:39.230> be<00:02:39.350> sit<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:39.770> there<00:02:40.130> as

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
some types of RAM can be sit in there as

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.790 
some types of RAM can be sit in there as
a<00:02:40.280> single<00:02:40.640> stick<00:02:40.910> there's<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.690> ton<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.410> stuff

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
a single stick there's a ton of stuff

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.530 
a single stick there's a ton of stuff
that<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.640> can<00:02:43.670> run<00:02:43.940> into<00:02:44.090> when<00:02:44.300> you're<00:02:44.390> trying

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
that you can run into when you're trying

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.120 
that you can run into when you're trying
to<00:02:44.630> upgrade<00:02:44.780> RAM<00:02:45.410> it's<00:02:45.560> probably<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
to upgrade RAM it's probably one of the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.950 
to upgrade RAM it's probably one of the
actual<00:02:46.430> it's<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.000> actually<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.570> easiest

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
actual it's the actually the easiest

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.120 
actual it's the actually the easiest
thing<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.170> plug<00:02:48.410> into<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.710> board<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.070> the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
thing to plug into the board but the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.260 
thing to plug into the board but the
hardest<00:02:49.400> thing<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:49.670> make<00:02:49.820> sure<00:02:49.850> you<00:02:50.030> get<00:02:50.150> the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
hardest thing to make sure you get the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.750 
hardest thing to make sure you get the
right<00:02:50.420> pieces<00:02:50.660> for<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:51.860> definitely<00:02:52.550> do<00:02:52.640> that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
right pieces for so definitely do that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.820 
right pieces for so definitely do that
look<00:02:52.970> up<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.210> Gary's<00:02:53.510> talking<00:02:53.900> about<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.800> I

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
look up the Gary's talking about so I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.290 
look up the Gary's talking about so I
think<00:02:55.130> probably<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.610> next<00:02:55.820> step<00:02:55.970> here<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.210> to

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
think probably the next step here is to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.430 
think probably the next step here is to
go<00:02:56.480> ahead<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.720> take<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> look<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.170> see<00:02:57.290> what

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
go ahead and take a look and see what

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.620 
go ahead and take a look and see what
Ram<00:02:57.650> looks<00:02:57.890> like<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.340> how<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.820> how<00:02:59.210> to<00:02:59.270> plug<00:02:59.540> it

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
Ram looks like and how to how to plug it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.270 
Ram looks like and how to how to plug it
into<00:02:59.780> your<00:02:59.930> system<00:03:00.140> let's<00:03:00.800> look<00:03:00.920> at<00:03:01.010> some<00:03:01.160> RAM

looking<00:03:17.750> things<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.080> there<00:03:18.230> those<00:03:18.380> are

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
looking things on there those are

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.780 
looking things on there those are
although<00:03:18.770> this<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.100> where<00:03:19.220> all<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.400> memory<00:03:19.670> is

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
although this is where all the memory is

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.910 
although this is where all the memory is
is<00:03:19.940> right<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.240> here<00:03:20.450> that's<00:03:20.600> all<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.350> all<00:03:21.740> there

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
is right in here that's all it all there

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.260 
is right in here that's all it all there
is<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.370> let's<00:03:22.580> take<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.760> look<00:03:22.970> at<00:03:23.030> on<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
is to it let's take a look at on the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.560 
is to it let's take a look at on the
board<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:25.670> can<00:03:25.700> see<00:03:25.940> right<00:03:26.090> here<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.390> have<00:03:26.420> a

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
board you can see right here we have a

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.750 
board you can see right here we have a
piece<00:03:26.960> of<00:03:26.990> RAM<00:03:27.290> installed<00:03:27.740> right<00:03:28.340> here<00:03:28.610> in

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
piece of RAM installed right here in

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.390 
piece of RAM installed right here in
this<00:03:28.880> particular<00:03:29.060> slot<00:03:29.780> now<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.860> don't<00:03:31.160> know<00:03:31.310> if

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
this particular slot now I don't know if

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.440 
this particular slot now I don't know if
you<00:03:31.490> can<00:03:31.610> see<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:31.970> video<00:03:32.180> but<00:03:32.300> these

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
you can see it in the video but these

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.330 
you can see it in the video but these
slots<00:03:32.720> are<00:03:32.870> all<00:03:33.020> keyed<00:03:33.380> which<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.070> good

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
slots are all keyed which is good

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.580 
slots are all keyed which is good
because<00:03:34.700> if<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.090> run<00:03:35.270> into<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.510> problem<00:03:35.590> where

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
because if you run into a problem where

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.320 
because if you run into a problem where
you're<00:03:36.890> trying<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.160> put<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.790> wrong<00:03:38.000> kind<00:03:38.270> of

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
you're trying to put the wrong kind of

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.600 
you're trying to put the wrong kind of
RAM<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.810> just<00:03:38.990> it<00:03:39.170> simply<00:03:39.440> won't<00:03:39.560> fit<00:03:39.920> now

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
RAM and it just it simply won't fit now

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.760 
RAM and it just it simply won't fit now
Ram<00:03:41.000> is<00:03:41.150> like<00:03:41.600> we<00:03:41.780> have<00:03:41.900> indicated<00:03:42.650> before

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
Ram is like we have indicated before

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.570 
Ram is like we have indicated before
it's<00:03:42.980> really<00:03:43.070> easy<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.910> get<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.600> out<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:46.370> just

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
it's really easy to get it out it just

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.190 
it's really easy to get it out it just
pops<00:03:46.790> out<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.030> there's<00:03:47.810> generally<00:03:48.170> two

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
pops out you there's generally two

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.900 
pops out you there's generally two
little<00:03:48.530> flaps<00:03:48.620> on<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.070> side<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.640> pull<00:03:49.820> them

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
little flaps on the side you pull them

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.360 
little flaps on the side you pull them
back<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.720> flops<00:03:50.900> out<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.710> put<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:51.980> back<00:03:52.130> in

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
back and it flops out to put it back in

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.500 
back and it flops out to put it back in
we're<00:03:52.490> gonna<00:03:52.580> try<00:03:52.760> after<00:03:52.880> this<00:03:53.150> careful

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
we're gonna try after this careful

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.580 
we're gonna try after this careful
because<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.690> don't<00:03:53.810> want<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:53.990> snap<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.350> board

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
because I don't want to snap the board

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.540 
because I don't want to snap the board
here<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:57.080> just<00:03:57.290> even<00:03:57.560> pressure<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.280> both

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
here you just even pressure on both

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.020 
here you just even pressure on both
sides<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.770> the<00:04:00.770> little<00:04:01.340> tabs<00:04:01.550> will<00:04:01.760> snap<00:04:02.000> back

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
sides and the little tabs will snap back

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.410 
sides and the little tabs will snap back
up<00:04:02.480> obviously<00:04:03.380> if<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.800> have<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.100> yeah<00:04:04.400> yes<00:04:04.940> it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
up obviously if you have it yeah yes it

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.480 
up obviously if you have it yeah yes it
will<00:04:05.630> not<00:04:05.990> break<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.680> board<00:04:06.920> when<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.280> push

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
will not break the board when you push

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.860 
will not break the board when you push
it<00:04:07.610> right<00:04:08.180> yeah<00:04:08.360> we<00:04:08.480> don't<00:04:08.540> want<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.780> push

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
it right yeah we don't want to push

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.630 
it right yeah we don't want to push
through<00:04:09.020> hard<00:04:09.230> here<00:04:09.410> because<00:04:09.650> we<00:04:09.800> can't<00:04:09.980> for

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
through hard here because we can't for

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.890 
through hard here because we can't for
the<00:04:10.700> video<00:04:10.910> demonstration<00:04:11.510> otherwise<00:04:11.720> we

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
the video demonstration otherwise we

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.780 
the video demonstration otherwise we
could<00:04:12.050> damage<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.590> board<00:04:12.740> but<00:04:13.040> yeah<00:04:13.490> if<00:04:13.610> it's

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
could damage the board but yeah if it's

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.760 
could damage the board but yeah if it's
mounted<00:04:14.150> properly<00:04:14.360> you'll<00:04:15.110> have<00:04:15.260> no<00:04:15.410> problem

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
mounted properly you'll have no problem

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.229 
mounted properly you'll have no problem
just<00:04:15.830> press<00:04:16.250> on<00:04:16.400> either<00:04:16.609> side<00:04:16.910> with<00:04:17.090> your

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
just press on either side with your

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.660 
just press on either side with your
thumbs<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.690> it'll<00:04:18.530> snap<00:04:18.680> into<00:04:18.920> place<00:04:19.070> that's

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
thumbs and it'll snap into place that's

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.700 
thumbs and it'll snap into place that's
all<00:04:19.880> there<00:04:20.000> is<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.299> installing<00:04:20.690> ramp<00:04:21.320> but

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
all there is to installing ramp but

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.070 
all there is to installing ramp but
again<00:04:21.950> make<00:04:22.580> sure<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.120> when<00:04:23.300> you're<00:04:23.480> getting

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
again make sure that when you're getting

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.510 
again make sure that when you're getting
your<00:04:24.200> RAM<00:04:24.380> you're<00:04:24.680> making<00:04:25.070> sure<00:04:25.250> that<00:04:25.370> you

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
your RAM you're making sure that you

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.430 
your RAM you're making sure that you
have<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.760> right<00:04:25.910> speed<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.870> right<00:04:27.080> type

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
have the right speed the right type

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.670 
have the right speed the right type
there's<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:28.460> lot<00:04:28.760> of<00:04:28.910> factors<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.360> go<00:04:29.720> that<00:04:30.590> go

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
there's a lot of factors that go that go

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.650 
there's a lot of factors that go that go
into<00:04:30.890> your<00:04:30.980> decision<00:04:31.250> there<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:31.850> Gary<00:04:32.540> it

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
into your decision there so Gary it

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.760 
into your decision there so Gary it
indicated<00:04:33.080> there's<00:04:33.200> some<00:04:33.290> websites<00:04:33.620> out

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
indicated there's some websites out

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.280 
indicated there's some websites out
there<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:34.130> can<00:04:34.220> help<00:04:34.340> you<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:35.810> may<00:04:36.110> not<00:04:36.230> even

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
there that can help you it may not even

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.960 
there that can help you it may not even
be<00:04:36.560> a<00:04:36.590> bad<00:04:36.770> thing<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:37.010> take<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.490> into<00:04:37.640> a<00:04:37.669> local

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
be a bad thing to take it into a local

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.219 
be a bad thing to take it into a local
computer<00:04:38.120> store<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.660> have<00:04:38.750> them<00:04:38.780> point<00:04:39.169> you

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
computer store and have them point you

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.090 
computer store and have them point you
in<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.350> right<00:04:39.410> direction

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
in the right direction
