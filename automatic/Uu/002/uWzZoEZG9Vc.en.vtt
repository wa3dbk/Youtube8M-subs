00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
eights only gots five votes which isn't

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.209 
eights only gots five votes which isn't
surprising<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.560> guess<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.009> only<00:00:32.099> thing

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
surprising I guess the only thing

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.400 
surprising I guess the only thing
surprising<00:00:32.820> maybe<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.719> difference<00:00:34.170> in

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
surprising maybe is the difference in

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
surprising maybe is the difference in
between<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> boats<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.550> mean<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:35.850> far<00:00:36.000> as

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
between the boats but I mean as far as

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.150 
between the boats but I mean as far as
you<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> WrestleMania<00:00:37.620> related<00:00:37.920> video

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
you know the WrestleMania related video

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.540 
you know the WrestleMania related video
wedding<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.540> really<00:00:39.780> surprising<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.550> uh

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
wedding that was really surprising so uh

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.319 
wedding that was really surprising so uh
initially<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> video

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
initially I was going to do a video

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.180 
initially I was going to do a video
predicting<00:00:45.329> every<00:00:45.960> single<00:00:46.200> match<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
predicting every single match up on the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.760 
predicting every single match up on the
WrestleMania<00:00:47.520> card<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:49.170> video<00:00:49.379> but

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
WrestleMania card in just one video but

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.920 
WrestleMania card in just one video but
I<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> feeling<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.090> video<00:00:51.480> would<00:00:51.629> run

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
I have a feeling that video would run

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
I have a feeling that video would run
pretty<00:00:52.410> long<00:00:52.770> since<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.610> mean<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.090> don't

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
pretty long since I mean this we don't

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.270 
pretty long since I mean this we don't
it<00:00:54.360> soon<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> five<00:00:54.960> minutes<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.129> about

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
it soon is five minutes it's just about

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.189 
it soon is five minutes it's just about
one<00:00:56.610> match<00:00:56.820> me<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.629> talking<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:57.899> one

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
one match me just talking about one

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
one match me just talking about one
match<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.620> me<00:00:58.800> talking<00:00:59.219> about<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.579> don't<00:00:59.670> know

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
match so me talking about I don't know

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.939 
match so me talking about I don't know
how<00:00:59.969> many<00:01:00.000> matches<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:01.320> seven<00:01:01.739> eight

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
how many matches like seven eight

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.529 
how many matches like seven eight
matches<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.489> WrestleMania<00:01:02.820> car<00:01:03.120> dad<00:01:03.329> so

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
matches on WrestleMania car dad so

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
matches on WrestleMania car dad so
that's<00:01:03.690> gonna<00:01:03.840> take<00:01:04.049> wall<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.769> yeah<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> thought

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that's gonna take wall so yeah I thought

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
that's gonna take wall so yeah I thought
it'd<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.640> better<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.000> split<00:01:06.240> them<00:01:06.360> up<00:01:06.450> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it'd just be better to split them up in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
it'd just be better to split them up in
their<00:01:06.720> own<00:01:06.840> separate<00:01:07.229> matches<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.950> over<00:01:08.400> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
their own separate matches and over in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.219 
their own separate matches and over in
the<00:01:08.580> next<00:01:08.790> couple<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.210> weeks<00:01:09.510> I'll<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.900> putting

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the next couple of weeks I'll be putting

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.100 
the next couple of weeks I'll be putting
up<00:01:10.380> maybe<00:01:10.850> one<00:01:11.850> WrestleMania<00:01:12.570> prediction

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110

this matchup it doesn't necessarily mean

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200

of the finish of the matchup and that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.890 
of the finish of the matchup and that
was<00:02:43.819> like<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> double<00:02:44.330> power<00:02:44.510> bellman

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900

Rhodes<00:04:44.540> and<00:04:44.720> Damien<00:04:44.990> Sandow<00:04:45.560> had<00:04:45.830> one

attacking<00:04:46.730> championships<00:04:47.450> but<00:04:47.660> obviously

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
attacking championships but obviously

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.290

they<00:04:48.200> didn't<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.890> now<00:04:49.580> they're<00:04:49.850> no<00:04:50.090> longer

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.530 
they didn't and now they're no longer
team<00:04:50.690> so<00:04:50.990> that's<00:04:51.890> most<00:04:52.550> likely<00:04:52.670> not<00:04:52.970> gonna

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
team so that's most likely not gonna

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.530 
team so that's most likely not gonna
happen<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.350> we<00:04:55.100> might<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:55.880> see<00:04:56.090> gold<00:04:56.330> us

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540
