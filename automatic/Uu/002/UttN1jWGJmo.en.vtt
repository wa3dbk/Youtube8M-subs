00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Let's take a sequence and let's do the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.730
 next if you look to look at our 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.950
 model that part where the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.559
 footer that if this image 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 much glued here in fashion and layout is 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.769
 A little apart here then we go 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.809
 leave it alone 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.550
 Only when we put the table 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 here we put two cells to 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.359
 left where he got another right 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.050
 where the state or to see how the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.519
 right has no content, she did not even 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.570
 maximum right as if it were a cell 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.490
 only so much that you are not 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 able to visualize and that has two 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.690
 but there are two there as I click 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.430
 here or in my image that is inside 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.739
 the first cell is just click on it 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.149
 yesterday she selected I came here to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.809
 because it shows the code of a 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.760
 side and the other 's design is good 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.590
 know a little of the html with the arrival 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.989
 of a book so I know what it is that 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.329
 every cell every thousandth cell of nexus 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.390
 having a time or date of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.520
 itabela there then I have one closed it 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.780
 here and here I have second is for that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.210
 it has no content when it has no 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.750
 content and presents in this way that the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.700
 my first has 237 the latter has 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.659
 only 56 pixels that's why she's 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.970
 showing 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.799
 I'll put here a text with which it is only 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.869
 You see now it has begun to appear 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.430
 but I'll have to leave that text may 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.409
 stay to the side so we will not 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.439
 use a very used table technique 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.840
 that's called space we put a 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.390
 space here is an image that will stay 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.759
 transparent as a space not to leave 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.409
 She's flat again, so let me 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 to see which space would be more or 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.220
 less this distance than this 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.740
 distance is leaving my cell with 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.130
 as of wide I click it here 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.659
 I 'm seeing that she has 56 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.060
 width let me see that 60 in the beauty l 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.420
 so I'll create a spacing is with 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.729
 60 of wide that image in firework 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.189
 transparent to do that , I will not even go 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.920
 replace in place of this image I will come 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.750
 here a new workshop profile 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.080
 and I will give that dimension to him the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.030
 width 60 and in the height only one more being 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.900
 questioned 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.900
 OK 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.770
 ready that space alone the law of 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.190
 Nothing I came here will export it as 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:19.030
 a transparent gif is because a gif that 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.099
 he will have a quality one is of 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.200
 image and did not come here actually and 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.670
 file to be able to configure and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.950
 to view the image or to whom it is 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.050
 With him he is doing there and a half of profile 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.360
 or choose a gif because it has a 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.430
 quality lower then I will choose here 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.860
 for him the alpha transparency 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.410
 no it will not be visible there when 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.390
 I use quality here can be well 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.370
 small even if it 's black it will not stay 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.739
 invisible is good that does not take up space 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.690
 for us there will not export and 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.430
 bringing from my folder where I am 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.739
 working with the layout ne 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.319
 Actually, here is a file. 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.870
 work on my I put that site not 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.150
 images 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.780
 I'm going to name him that country. 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.430
 face ready I know the spacing that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.290
 I will use the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.870
 here you can only let image create 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.209
 This empathy clears reads and 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.579
 to save so I already have my space 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.799
 there I'll do it, I'll come here at 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.840
 Sunday and I'll have to update it one 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.520
 local directory it appears here for 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.270
 me 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.830
 there he space point Biffy Clyro safe 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.620
 and drag him over 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.750
 in the place of those wing there I do not want to have 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.700
 the text there so I want to have mine 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.700
 space Ação left to pay this here 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.730
 now she does not even lower it 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.670
 little bit that was a little bigger 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.100
 But she did not fit and did not go there. 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.320
 cdf 12 have save and publish to 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.240
 see me I'll see that now I have 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.050
 a slightly larger gap until then 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.270
 it is important to understand in using these 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.130
 spaces there are controlling and 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.870
 adjusting your site can be either a 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.270
 space at the top in the 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.550
 As I did then it's a good 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.270
 practice uses these 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.160
 spaces 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.750
 I'll put it in here, you do not have one. 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.400
 other content another text to people 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.340
 will continue and afterwards 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.750
 format using css this to us 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.750
 will do next class
