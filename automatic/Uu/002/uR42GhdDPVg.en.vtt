all<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.930> sockets<00:01:12.770> are<00:01:12.830> gonna<00:01:12.950> be<00:01:13.070> at<00:01:13.160> least

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
all the sockets are gonna be at least

six inches off the ground so my

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.880 
six inches off the ground so my
wonderful<00:01:15.560> wife<00:01:15.830> she<00:01:16.310> actually<00:01:17.710> uncurled<00:01:18.710> it

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.930 
and I saw and I thought it was a miracle
and<00:01:21.110> she<00:01:21.200> said<00:01:21.500> no<00:01:21.650> I<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.190> done<00:01:22.550> curled<00:01:22.790> it

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
and she said no I just done curled it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.570 
and she said no I just done curled it
and<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.500> was<00:01:24.590> pretty<00:01:24.740> exciting<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.400> now

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
and so that was pretty exciting so now

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.100 
and so that was pretty exciting so now
we<00:01:25.640> can<00:01:25.940> actually<00:01:26.120> have<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.570> on<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.720> counter

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
we can actually have it on the counter

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.530 
we can actually have it on the counter
plug<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:27.920> works<00:01:28.040> great<00:01:28.430> now<00:01:29.210> we

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
plug it in and it works great now we

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.570 
plug it in and it works great now we
have<00:01:29.930> found<00:01:30.110> recently<00:01:30.470> that<00:01:30.740> we<00:01:31.040> actually<00:01:31.430> use
