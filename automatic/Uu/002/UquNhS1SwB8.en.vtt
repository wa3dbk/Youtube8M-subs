figured<00:00:37.879> it<00:00:38.059> out<00:00:38.210> that<00:00:38.449> if<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:38.660> give<00:00:38.839> the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
figured it out that if you give the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.689 
figured it out that if you give the
football<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.350> Ray<00:00:39.440> Rice<00:00:39.650> good<00:00:40.010> things<00:00:40.280> happen

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.610 
out on the road against san diego when
you<00:00:44.210> plan<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.449> team<00:00:44.690> like<00:00:44.989> San<00:00:45.230> Diego<00:00:45.530> that's

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
you plan a team like San Diego that's

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.200 
you plan a team like San Diego that's
fighting<00:00:45.980> for<00:00:46.339> their<00:00:46.519> playoff<00:00:46.730> life<00:00:47.000> they're

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
fighting for their playoff life they're

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
fighting for their playoff life they're
going<00:00:47.330> to<00:00:47.390> be<00:00:47.480> scrappy<00:00:47.780> they're<00:00:47.989> going<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:48.170> be

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
going to be scrappy they're going to be

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.450 
going to be scrappy they're going to be
aggressive<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:48.860> think<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.309> way<00:00:49.430> you

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
aggressive I think the way you

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.189 
aggressive I think the way you
neutralize<00:00:50.000> that<00:00:50.030> aggressiveness<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.050> by

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
neutralize that aggressiveness is by

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.110 
neutralize that aggressiveness is by
running<00:00:51.589> right<00:00:51.829> at<00:00:51.860> it<00:00:52.220> rewrites<00:00:52.550> should<00:00:52.879> have

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
running right at it rewrites should have

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.119 
running right at it rewrites should have
some<00:00:53.300> success<00:00:53.480> running<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.350> football<00:00:54.500> but

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
some success running the football but

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.040 
some success running the football but
they<00:00:55.430> also<00:00:55.670> have<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.270> open<00:00:56.629> it<00:00:56.690> up<00:00:56.809> a<00:00:56.899> little

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
they also have to open it up a little

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.990 
they also have to open it up a little
bit<00:00:57.260> get<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.800> ball<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:58.070> Anquan<00:00:58.370> Boldin<00:00:58.460> those

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
bit get the ball to Anquan Boldin those

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.849 
bit get the ball to Anquan Boldin those
two<00:00:59.210> talented<00:00:59.629> tight<00:00:59.809> ends<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.199> pitta<00:01:00.770> and

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
two talented tight ends and pitta and

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.279 
two talented tight ends and pitta and
dixon<00:01:01.430> i<00:01:01.579> think<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:02.239> with<00:01:02.449> it<00:01:02.629> that's<00:01:03.109> what

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
dixon i think that with it that's what

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.510 
dixon i think that with it that's what
they're<00:01:03.410> going<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.590> do<00:01:03.770> early<00:01:04.220> on<00:01:04.250> the

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
they're going to do early on the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.590 
they're going to do early on the
ballgame<00:01:04.879> they<00:01:05.030> probably<00:01:05.180> going<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.449> work

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
ballgame they probably going to work

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.270 
ballgame they probably going to work
that<00:01:05.780> passing<00:01:06.229> game<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.740> set<00:01:06.979> up<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.160> run

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
that passing game to set up the run

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.469 
that passing game to set up the run
because<00:01:07.399> I<00:01:07.550> know<00:01:07.640> they<00:01:07.850> can<00:01:07.970> lean<00:01:08.180> on<00:01:08.210> that

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
because I know they can lean on that

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.180 
because I know they can lean on that
ground<00:01:08.630> game<00:01:08.899> when<00:01:09.080> they<00:01:09.170> need<00:01:09.410> to<00:01:09.440> but<00:01:10.039> that

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
ground game when they need to but that

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.460 
ground game when they need to but that
passing<00:01:10.610> game<00:01:10.729> has<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.180> come<00:01:11.330> alive<00:01:11.570> in<00:01:11.780> order

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
passing game has to come alive in order

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.410 
passing game has to come alive in order
to<00:01:12.619> back<00:01:12.890> up<00:01:13.130> that<00:01:13.160> defense<00:01:13.759> and<00:01:13.940> get<00:01:14.060> them<00:01:14.240> out

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
to back up that defense and get them out

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.510 
to back up that defense and get them out
of<00:01:14.450> those<00:01:14.600> seven<00:01:14.899> and<00:01:15.200> eight<00:01:15.710> man<00:01:15.950> fronts<00:01:16.399> and

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
of those seven and eight man fronts and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.460 
of those seven and eight man fronts and
it<00:01:16.640> was<00:01:16.729> aggressive<00:01:17.119> stunts<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.840> stop<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.289> run

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
it was aggressive stunts to stop the run

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.410 
it was aggressive stunts to stop the run
because<00:01:18.800> if<00:01:19.039> they<00:01:19.160> can't<00:01:19.399> throw<00:01:19.700> team's<00:01:20.179> gonna

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
because if they can't throw team's gonna

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.480 
because if they can't throw team's gonna
load<00:01:20.720> up<00:01:20.750> shut<00:01:21.350> down<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.530> run<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:21.800> foresees

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
load up shut down a run and foresees

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.270 
load up shut down a run and foresees
guys<00:01:22.670> into<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.940> backup<00:01:23.300> situations

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
guys into the backup situations

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
guys into the backup situations
defensively<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.550> think<00:01:25.910> they're<00:01:26.090> going<00:01:26.240> to

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
defensively I think they're going to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.059 
defensively I think they're going to
turn<00:01:26.450> up<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.720> pressure<00:01:26.840> on<00:01:27.170> Philip<00:01:27.649> Rivers<00:01:27.770> a

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
turn up the pressure on Philip Rivers a

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:29.859 
turn up the pressure on Philip Rivers a
whole<00:01:28.520> lot<00:01:28.819> the<00:01:28.849> one<00:01:29.000> thing<00:01:29.270> about<00:01:29.390> rivers<00:01:29.720> he

whole lot the one thing about rivers he

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.839 
whole lot the one thing about rivers he
can't<00:01:30.140> escape<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.649> pocket<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.490> Ravens

defense to put a lot of pressure on

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.440 
defense to put a lot of pressure on
those<00:02:25.280> safeties<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.819> step<00:02:26.030> up<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.239> make<00:02:26.390> plays

those safeties to step up and make plays

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.449 
those safeties to step up and make plays
they're<00:02:27.050> gonna<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.410> cut<00:02:27.680> down<00:02:27.950> their

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
they're gonna have to cut down their

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.190 
they're gonna have to cut down their
coverage<00:02:28.910> units<00:02:29.180> because<00:02:29.360> these<00:02:29.569> guys<00:02:29.870> are

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
coverage units because these guys are

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.929 
coverage units because these guys are
dangerous<00:02:30.769> after<00:02:31.159> the<00:02:31.400> catch<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:31.670> they<00:02:31.760> also

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
dangerous after the catch and they also

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.030 
dangerous after the catch and they also
have<00:02:32.299> good<00:02:32.870> enough<00:02:33.079> speed<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.379> get<00:02:33.650> vertical

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
have good enough speed to get vertical

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.470 
have good enough speed to get vertical
and<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.459> think<00:02:34.700> what<00:02:34.969> else<00:02:35.180> has

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
and I think what else has

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.210 
and I think what else has
to<00:02:35.629> happen<00:02:35.989> they<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.379> find<00:02:36.650> some<00:02:37.010> type<00:02:37.190> of

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
to happen they have to find some type of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.399 
to happen they have to find some type of
consistency<00:02:37.610> on<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.209> ground<00:02:38.420> Ryan<00:02:39.019> Matthews

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
consistency on the ground Ryan Matthews

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.600 
consistency on the ground Ryan Matthews
is<00:02:39.560> picking<00:02:39.799> up<00:02:39.920> as<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.190> late<00:02:40.250> they're<00:02:40.489> going

is picking up as of late they're going

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.430

this<00:03:43.730> game<00:03:43.880> I<00:03:43.910> think<00:03:44.209> their<00:03:44.359> defense<00:03:44.840> will

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079

this game I think their defense will
come<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.470> play<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.950> they<00:03:46.130> will<00:03:46.280> do<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> great

come to play and they will do a great

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.490

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060
