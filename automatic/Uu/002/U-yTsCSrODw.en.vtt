00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.960 

hello<00:00:01.530> today<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:01.860> want<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.159> show<00:00:02.340> you<00:00:02.399> something

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hello today I want to show you something

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.660 
hello today I want to show you something
really<00:00:03.389> interesting<00:00:03.890> which<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.310> power<00:00:05.490> of

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
really interesting which is the power of

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.930 
really interesting which is the power of
Linux<00:00:06.420> so<00:00:07.379> what<00:00:07.799> I'm<00:00:07.890> doing<00:00:07.919> right<00:00:08.160> now<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.639> I'm

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
Linux so what I'm doing right now is I'm

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.470 
Linux so what I'm doing right now is I'm
encoding<00:00:09.630> some<00:00:09.929> audio<00:00:10.320> files<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.580> as<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.330> can

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
encoding some audio files and as you can

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.169 
encoding some audio files and as you can
see<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.840> takes<00:00:13.019> all<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.380> my<00:00:13.620> CPU<00:00:14.340> resources<00:00:14.580> I

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
see it takes all of my CPU resources I

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.300 
see it takes all of my CPU resources I
have<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> quad<00:00:15.809> core<00:00:16.080> with<00:00:16.320> hyper-threading

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
have a quad core with hyper-threading

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.660 
have a quad core with hyper-threading
so<00:00:18.000> all<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.420> eight<00:00:19.039> virtual<00:00:20.039> cores<00:00:20.369> are

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
so all of eight virtual cores are

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.109 
so all of eight virtual cores are
completely<00:00:21.510> busy<00:00:21.900> at<00:00:22.109> 100%<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> system

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
completely busy at 100% and the system

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.870 
completely busy at 100% and the system
is<00:00:24.240> still<00:00:24.449> pretty<00:00:24.750> responsive<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.640> may<00:00:26.820> be

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
is still pretty responsive so you may be

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.870 
is still pretty responsive so you may be
thinking<00:00:27.119> oh<00:00:27.390> that's<00:00:27.599> cool<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.460> how<00:00:29.460> about<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
thinking oh that's cool but how about I

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.790 
thinking oh that's cool but how about I
whoops<00:00:34.940> if<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.450> play<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.960> game<00:00:36.989> at<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
whoops if I want to play a game at the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
whoops if I want to play a game at the
same<00:00:38.040> time<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:39.030> possible

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
same time is that really possible

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.630 
same time is that really possible
oh<00:00:41.360> looks<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:43.890> were<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> full

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
oh looks like it is so we were on a full

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.150 
oh looks like it is so we were on a full
game<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.420> called<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> Talos<00:00:46.770> principle<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
game here called the Talos principle and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.799 
game here called the Talos principle and
yeah<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.250> works<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:51.149> fine<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.840> run<00:00:52.829> around

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
yeah it works just fine I can run around

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.569 
yeah it works just fine I can run around
ok<00:00:54.809> whatever

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
ok whatever

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.779 
ok whatever
so<00:00:58.760> if<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.879> switch<00:01:00.000> out<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:01.399> let's<00:01:02.399> play<00:01:02.579> some

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
so if I switch out of it let's play some

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:13.100 
so if I switch out of it let's play some
music<00:01:09.200> silence<00:01:11.119> ok<00:01:12.119> let's<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.810> music

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
music silence ok let's see the music

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.920 
music silence ok let's see the music
plays<00:01:13.290> without<00:01:13.740> stuttering<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.820> any<00:01:15.119> kind

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
plays without stuttering of any kind

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.320 
plays without stuttering of any kind
I<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.710> works<00:01:16.979> flawlessly<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.850> let's<00:01:18.150> put

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
I just works flawlessly so let's put

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.870 
I just works flawlessly so let's put
some<00:01:18.360> more<00:01:18.659> load<00:01:18.930> onto<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.439> machine<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
some more load onto this machine as you

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
some more load onto this machine as you
saw<00:01:21.119> earlier<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.930> uh<00:01:25.009> this<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.520> 7<00:01:27.710> 220

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
saw earlier this is uh this is I 7 220

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.420 
saw earlier this is uh this is I 7 220
600<00:01:29.189> K<00:01:29.400> part<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.290> old<00:01:31.320> CPU

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
600 K part this is a really old CPU

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.569 
600 K part this is a really old CPU
it's<00:01:33.119> got<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.479> three<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:33.930> four<00:01:33.990> years<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.579> so

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
it's got like three or four years now so

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.890 
it's got like three or four years now so
it's<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:38.040> greatest<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.729> latest<00:01:38.900> so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it's not the greatest in latest so

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.679 
it's not the greatest in latest so
that's<00:01:40.079> running<00:01:40.290> Windows<00:01:40.619> 10<00:01:41.360> actually<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that's running Windows 10 actually you

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.929 
that's running Windows 10 actually you
know<00:01:42.810> what<00:01:42.960> spice<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.250> bit<00:01:44.520> let's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
know what spice it up a little bit let's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.510 
know what spice it up a little bit let's
run<00:01:45.180> another<00:01:45.390> version<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:46.049> Ubuntu<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
run another version of Ubuntu in in a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.539 
run another version of Ubuntu in in a
virtual<00:01:48.030> machine<00:01:48.380> let's<00:01:49.380> see<00:01:49.920> how<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> takes

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
virtual machine let's see how it takes

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.639 
virtual machine let's see how it takes
the<00:01:50.700> load<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:55.250> Windows<00:01:56.250> playing<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:57.649> let's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the load now Windows playing up let's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.389 
the load now Windows playing up let's
see<00:01:58.979> how<00:01:59.130> our<00:01:59.159> game<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.759> doing<00:02:01.280> oops<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.829> hard

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
see how our game is doing oops so hard

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.949 
see how our game is doing oops so hard
to<00:02:07.160> record<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.610> play<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.360> same<00:02:09.450> time

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
to record and play at the same time

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.890 
to record and play at the same time
unfortunately<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.709> can't<00:02:10.950> record

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.720 

like<00:02:14.900> screen<00:02:15.739> capture<00:02:16.250> software<00:02:16.489> because<00:02:18.730> it

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
like screen capture software because it

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.030 
like screen capture software because it
skips<00:02:20.090> frames<00:02:20.480> when<00:02:21.200> I'm<00:02:21.439> using<00:02:21.620> hundred

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
skips frames when I'm using hundred

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.509 
skips frames when I'm using hundred
percent<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.519> my<00:02:22.700> CPU<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:24.860> as<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.099> can<00:02:25.220> see<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
percent of my CPU but as you can see the

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.119 
percent of my CPU but as you can see the
game<00:02:25.670> still<00:02:25.939> runs<00:02:26.000> fine<00:02:26.659> confronts<00:02:27.439> fairly

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
game still runs fine confronts fairly

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:43.379 
game still runs fine confronts fairly
smoothly<00:02:29.049> you<00:02:30.049> can't<00:02:30.290> complain<00:02:30.620> too<00:02:30.680> much<00:02:35.349> I

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:48.990 

pin<00:02:44.389> my<00:02:44.420> shake<00:02:44.989> password<00:02:46.959> that's<00:02:47.959> not<00:02:48.440> correct

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
pin my shake password that's not correct

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.949 
pin my shake password that's not correct
I'm<00:02:50.000> sorry<00:02:50.269> about<00:02:50.359> that<00:02:50.480> oh<00:02:56.829> there<00:02:57.829> we<00:02:57.920> go<00:02:58.959> see

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
I'm sorry about that oh there we go see

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.679 
I'm sorry about that oh there we go see
our<00:03:00.139> wooden<00:03:00.680> two<00:03:00.859> instance<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.489> doing<00:03:01.790> oh<00:03:02.030> it

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
our wooden two instance is doing oh it

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:13.500 
our wooden two instance is doing oh it
has<00:03:02.900> booted<00:03:03.170> up<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:04.329> this<00:03:05.329> is<00:03:05.480> pretty<00:03:05.750> awesome

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.180 

it's<00:03:14.319> a<00:03:14.440> dime<00:03:14.800> so<00:03:15.220> as<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.580> see<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.799> point

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
it's a dime so as you can see the point

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.800 
it's a dime so as you can see the point
of<00:03:18.310> incidence<00:03:18.580> one<00:03:18.940> gets<00:03:19.239> one<00:03:19.540> virtual<00:03:20.049> CPU

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
of incidence one gets one virtual CPU
