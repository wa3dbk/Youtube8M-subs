to be worked so I'm gonna do it the most
common<00:00:11.460> one<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.410> don't<00:00:13.410> know<00:00:13.530> any<00:00:13.740> other<00:00:13.799> way<00:00:13.950> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
common one I don't know any other way to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.220 
common one I don't know any other way to
call<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.490> but<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:14.730> just<00:00:14.910> edge<00:00:15.089> beadwork<00:00:15.360> but

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
call it but it's just edge beadwork but

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.660 
call it but it's just edge beadwork but
typically<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.800> two<00:00:17.010> beads<00:00:17.220> down<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
typically you have two beads down and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.630 
typically you have two beads down and
one<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:19.109> one<00:00:19.289> I've<00:00:19.470> got<00:00:19.680> two<00:00:20.189> separate

the red up on top here it's a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.939 
the red up on top here it's a
transparent<00:00:24.660> red<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.439> matches<00:00:25.800> this

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
transparent red that matches this

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.050 
transparent red that matches this

I've<00:00:41.670> put<00:00:41.969> some<00:00:42.170> DiMeo<00:00:43.170> already<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.160> thread

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I've put some DiMeo already on thread

going<00:00:49.559> through<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.250> gives<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
going through there it gives you a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.979 
going through there it gives you a
little<00:00:50.910> bit<00:00:51.120> extra<00:00:51.329> strength

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
little bit extra strength

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.789 
little bit that knots gonna sit up
underneath<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.930> get<00:01:34.049> started<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
underneath there to get started you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.940 
underneath there to get started you
start<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.220> three<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:37.500> take<00:01:37.710> one

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
start with three and so you take one

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
start with three and so you take one
from<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> bottom<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:39.299> that's<00:01:39.479> gonna<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.750> on

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
from the bottom one that's gonna be on

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.440 
from the bottom one that's gonna be on
top<00:01:40.079> that's<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.619> our<00:01:40.710> red<00:01:40.890> bead<00:01:41.450> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
top that's going to be our red bead and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.399 
top that's going to be our red bead and
then<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> bottom<00:01:44.869> stitch<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> very

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
then one on the bottom stitch is a very

piece that you're doing but it's not
really<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.920> think<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.460> decorative<00:02:05.850> but

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
really I think it's just decorative but

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.770 
really I think it's just decorative but
you're<00:02:06.899> going<00:02:07.229> through<00:02:07.819> this<00:02:08.819> one<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.599> last

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
you're going through this one the last

you're going through this one the last
one<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.470> went

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
one here you went

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.020 
one here you went
through<00:02:11.100> your<00:02:11.220> cloth<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.790> then<00:02:11.910> you're

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
through your cloth and then you're

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.790 
through your cloth and then you're
coming<00:02:12.210> back<00:02:12.570> up<00:02:13.490> through<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.790> bead<00:02:15.270> and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
coming back up through that bead and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.110 
coming back up through that bead and
that's<00:02:16.800> what's<00:02:17.490> going<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> cause<00:02:17.940> that

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
that's what's going to cause that

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.060 
that's what's going to cause that
initial<00:02:18.540> set<00:02:18.780> that's<00:02:19.020> what<00:02:19.230> sets<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.710> one<00:02:19.920> up

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
initial set that's what sets this one up

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.920 
initial set that's what sets this one up
the<00:02:20.220> red<00:02:20.400> once<00:02:20.580> it's<00:02:20.790> up<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.210> that's<00:02:21.810> what

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the red once it's up and that's what

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.930 
the red once it's up and that's what
flattens<00:02:22.350> down<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.650> white<00:02:22.830> one<00:02:23.070> we're<00:02:23.850> gonna

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
flattens down the white one we're gonna

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.210 
flattens down the white one we're gonna
do<00:02:24.180> another<00:02:24.390> stitch<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:25.050> now<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.830> time<00:02:26.070> you

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
I'm gonna do that all the way down now

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.990 
I'm gonna do that all the way down now
there's<00:02:49.830> gonna<00:02:50.010> be<00:02:50.100> different<00:02:50.400> ways<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.850> can

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
there's gonna be different ways you can

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.370 
there's gonna be different ways you can
do<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.330> there's<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.720> lot<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.050> different

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
do this there's a lot of different

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.850 
do this there's a lot of different
styles<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.860> edge<00:02:53.040> work<00:02:54.440> but<00:02:55.440> all<00:02:55.650> things

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
styles of edge work but all things

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.490 
styles of edge work but all things
considered<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.840> very<00:02:58.080> simple<00:02:58.380> one

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
considered this is a very simple one

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.990 
considered this is a very simple one
most<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.920> time<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.489> kind<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.850> work

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
most of the time and this kind of work

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.660 
most of the time and this kind of work
you're<00:03:00.209> gonna<00:03:00.330> find<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.709> edge<00:03:01.860> work<00:03:02.190> most

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
you're gonna find the edge work most

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.170 
you're gonna find the edge work most
commonly<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.780> solid<00:03:03.930> white<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:05.180> that's

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
commonly is just solid white so that's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.640 
commonly is just solid white so that's
where<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.630> get<00:03:06.810> kind<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.110> creative<00:03:07.290> you

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
where you can get kind of creative you

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.530 
where you can get kind of creative you
have<00:03:07.770> different<00:03:08.070> color<00:03:08.250> combinations<00:03:08.940> I've

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
have different color combinations I've

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.240 
have different color combinations I've
seen<00:03:09.900> where<00:03:10.050> people<00:03:10.290> do<00:03:10.440> sections<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.070> one

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
seen where people do sections of one

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.910 
seen where people do sections of one
color<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:11.730> sections<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.330> another<00:03:12.920> there's

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
color and sections of another there's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.890 
color and sections of another there's
there's<00:03:14.250> really<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.850> lot<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.570> different

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
there's really a lot of different

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.360 
there's really a lot of different
possibilities<00:03:16.350> when<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.830> sit<00:03:16.980> down<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.280> look

that either

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.759 
that either
so<00:03:42.120> don't<00:03:42.299> tug<00:03:42.600> on<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.780> too<00:03:42.989> not<00:03:43.170> too<00:03:43.350> tight<00:03:43.590> you

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
so don't tug on it too not too tight you

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.780 
so don't tug on it too not too tight you
just<00:03:43.799> want<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.280> nice<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:45.350> even<00:03:46.580> spaced<00:03:47.580> the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
just want it nice and even spaced the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.670 
just want it nice and even spaced the
beads<00:03:48.030> out<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.110> they're<00:03:49.260> pretty<00:03:49.500> much

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
beads out so that they're pretty much

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.949 
beads out so that they're pretty much
gonna<00:03:50.580> have<00:03:50.820> just<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.150> little<00:03:51.299> bit<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.690> gap

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
gonna have just a little bit of a gap

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.289 
gonna have just a little bit of a gap
you<00:03:52.350> don't<00:03:52.590> want<00:03:52.890> well<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.760> guess<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.030> depends

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
you don't want well I guess it depends

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.759 
you don't want well I guess it depends
on<00:03:54.390> what<00:03:54.540> you're<00:03:54.690> looking<00:03:54.959> for<00:03:55.170> but<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.530> don't

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
on what you're looking for but you don't

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.920 
on what you're looking for but you don't
really<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.700> usually<00:03:56.880> want<00:03:57.209> these<00:03:57.360> beads<00:03:57.690> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
really you usually want these beads the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.600 
really you usually want these beads the
red<00:03:58.080> ones<00:03:58.290> sitting<00:03:58.530> up<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.890> top<00:03:59.100> of<00:03:59.130> these<00:03:59.370> two

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
red ones sitting up on top of these two

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.840 
red ones sitting up on top of these two
as<00:03:59.820> opposed<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.269> sitting<00:04:00.630> in<00:04:00.750> between<00:04:00.870> them<00:04:01.320> so

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
as opposed to sitting in between them so

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.039 
as opposed to sitting in between them so
that's<00:04:02.850> just<00:04:03.090> kind<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.420> how<00:04:03.540> you're<00:04:03.690> gonna<00:04:03.780> do

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
that's just kind of how you're gonna do

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.340 
that's just kind of how you're gonna do
your<00:04:04.200> spacing<00:04:04.769> now<00:04:05.720> you're<00:04:06.720> gonna<00:04:06.870> beat<00:04:07.079> along

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
your spacing now you're gonna beat along

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.650 
your spacing now you're gonna beat along
and<00:04:07.620> you're<00:04:07.709> gonna<00:04:07.860> go<00:04:08.130> until<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.299> get<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.630> a

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
and you're gonna go until you get to a

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.520 
and you're gonna go until you get to a
point<00:04:09.870> where<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.739> have<00:04:11.690> finished<00:04:12.690> what

of the piece either way you need to you

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.280 
of the piece either way you need to you
need<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.650> tie<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:34.950> off<00:04:35.750> just<00:04:36.750> like<00:04:36.870> you've<00:04:37.050> been

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
need to tie it off just like you've been

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.380 
need to tie it off just like you've been
doing<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.800> take<00:04:38.040> one<00:04:38.250> red<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.610> one<00:04:38.790> white<00:04:38.820> and

you're gonna go into this just like you
have<00:04:43.050> been<00:04:43.290> now<00:04:43.970> instead<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.060> coming<00:04:45.390> up

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
been we're gonna come to the back side

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.980 
been we're gonna come to the back side
of<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.950> we're<00:04:50.040> gonna<00:04:50.160> tie<00:04:50.430> this<00:04:50.490> off

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
of this and we're gonna tie this off

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.930 
of this and we're gonna tie this off
this<00:04:51.990> is<00:04:52.200> a<00:04:52.230> real<00:04:52.470> simple<00:04:52.830> process<00:04:52.980> I<00:04:53.640> just

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
this is a real simple process I just

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.150 
this is a real simple process I just
like<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.540> take<00:04:56.240> one<00:04:57.240> or<00:04:57.390> two<00:04:57.540> little<00:04:58.160> loops

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
like to take one or two little loops

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.680 
like to take one or two little loops
here<00:05:00.320> just<00:05:01.320> enough<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:02.240> you're<00:05:03.240> giving<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.630> a

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
here just enough that you're giving it a

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.890 
here just enough that you're giving it a
little<00:05:03.900> bit<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.850> something<00:05:05.850> to<00:05:05.910> hold<00:05:06.060> on<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.330> on

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
little bit of something to hold on to on

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.850 
little bit of something to hold on to on
this<00:05:07.170> last<00:05:07.680> one<00:05:08.960> we're<00:05:09.960> gonna<00:05:10.080> come<00:05:10.380> up<00:05:10.560> and

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
this last one we're gonna come up and

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.980 
this last one we're gonna come up and
this<00:05:11.040> is<00:05:11.190> what's<00:05:11.370> gonna<00:05:11.520> be<00:05:12.180> our<00:05:12.210> knot<00:05:12.570> here

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
this is what's gonna be our knot here

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.950 
this is what's gonna be our knot here
just<00:05:13.890> a<00:05:14.010> simple<00:05:14.340> overhand<00:05:14.610> knot<00:05:14.880> I'm<00:05:15.330> gonna<00:05:15.540> go

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
just a simple overhand knot I'm gonna go

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.080 
just a simple overhand knot I'm gonna go
through<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.320> loops<00:05:16.830> here<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:19.730> it'll<00:05:20.730> kind<00:05:20.940> of

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
through the loops here and it'll kind of

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.690 
through the loops here and it'll kind of
cinch<00:05:21.330> up<00:05:21.510> on<00:05:21.690> itself<00:05:22.190> and<00:05:23.190> just<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.520> make<00:05:23.669> sure

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
cinch up on itself and just to make sure

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.310 
cinch up on itself and just to make sure
it<00:05:24.000> doesn't<00:05:24.180> come<00:05:24.360> out<00:05:24.540> or<00:05:24.930> have<00:05:25.110> any<00:05:25.290> problems

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
it doesn't come out or have any problems

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.980 
it doesn't come out or have any problems
I<00:05:26.010> usually<00:05:26.490> in<00:05:26.610> projects<00:05:27.600> that<00:05:27.720> involve

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
I usually in projects that involve

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.180 
I usually in projects that involve
ribbon<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.669> usually<00:05:29.669> just<00:05:29.850> run<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.919> needle

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
ribbon I usually just run the needle

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.000 
ribbon I usually just run the needle
down<00:05:32.340> a<00:05:32.400> little<00:05:32.730> bit<00:05:32.940> inside<00:05:33.390> then<00:05:33.890> pull<00:05:34.890> it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
down a little bit inside then pull it

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.460 
down a little bit inside then pull it
