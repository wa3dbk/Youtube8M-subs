well I think that while being a
Mandalorian<00:00:36.310> I<00:00:36.840> think<00:00:37.840> there's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
Mandalorian I think there's

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.500

at all worried about the superficial she

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.800 
at all worried about the superficial she
is<00:01:16.920> she's<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.950> badass<00:01:18.159> um<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:19.510> don't<00:01:19.600> know<00:01:19.690> if<00:01:19.780> I

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
is she's a badass um I don't know if I

is she's a badass um I don't know if I
can<00:01:19.930> say<00:01:20.020> that<00:01:20.170> but<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.500> just<00:01:20.680> did<00:01:21.690> but<00:01:22.690> I<00:01:22.930> think

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
can say that but I just did but I think

what<00:01:23.200> makes<00:01:23.380> her<00:01:23.560> even<00:01:23.800> more<00:01:24.159> special<00:01:24.729> is<00:01:24.909> that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
what makes her even more special is that

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.990 
what makes her even more special is that
she's<00:01:25.390> an<00:01:25.510> artist<00:01:25.930> you<00:01:26.170> know<00:01:26.290> she<00:01:26.440> she<00:01:27.000> she's

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
blowing things up she's getting the job

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.990 
blowing things up she's getting the job
done<00:01:29.680> but<00:01:29.770> she's<00:01:29.950> doing<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.250> with<00:01:30.400> with<00:01:30.700> with

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
done but she's doing it with with with

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.060 
done but she's doing it with with with
Flair<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.570> panache<00:01:31.870> and<00:01:32.170> she's<00:01:32.290> making<00:01:32.620> these

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
Flair and panache and she's making these

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
Flair and panache and she's making these
explosions<00:01:33.729> but<00:01:33.970> she's<00:01:34.120> making<00:01:34.270> them<00:01:34.510> look

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710

beautiful<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.890> so<00:01:36.190> I<00:01:36.430> think<00:01:36.700> that's<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.060> lovely

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
beautiful and so I think that's a lovely

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.110 
beautiful and so I think that's a lovely
dichotomy<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:39.490> know<00:01:39.520> she's<00:01:40.090> a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.670 
dichotomy and and and you know she's a
graffiti<00:01:40.330> artist<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:41.110> I<00:01:41.229> think<00:01:41.409> that's<00:01:41.560> so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
graffiti artist and I think that's so

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.950 
graffiti artist and I think that's so
fitting<00:01:42.070> because<00:01:42.190> hello<00:01:42.790> we're<00:01:43.030> rebels<00:01:43.479> we're

fitting because hello we're rebels we're

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.030 
fitting because hello we're rebels we're
anti-establishment

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
anti-establishment

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.980 
anti-establishment
what's<00:01:45.430> more<00:01:45.549> anti-establishment<00:01:45.970> than<00:01:46.659> do

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
what's more anti-establishment than do

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.080 
what's more anti-establishment than do
like<00:01:47.140> tagging<00:01:47.560> things<00:01:47.770> like<00:01:48.010> graffiti<00:01:48.159> art<00:01:48.549> so

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
like tagging things like graffiti art so

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.490 
like tagging things like graffiti art so

and I think it's cool like whenever the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.250 
and I think it's cool like whenever the
the<00:01:54.480> ghost<00:01:54.690> crew<00:01:55.050> attacked<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.220> empire

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
the ghost crew attacked the empire

rancor 88 he says how would you describe
your<00:03:24.450> characters<00:03:25.080> feelings<00:03:25.739> toward<00:03:26.160> Ezra

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
your characters feelings toward Ezra

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.970 
your characters feelings toward Ezra
haha<00:03:27.810> good<00:03:28.709> question

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
haha good question

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.560 
haha good question
so<00:03:31.980> Ezra<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.610> Sabine<00:03:32.850> are<00:03:33.000> obviously<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.420> two

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
so Ezra and Sabine are obviously the two

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.190 
so Ezra and Sabine are obviously the two
youngest<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.650> on<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.160> crew

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
youngest on this on the crew

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.860 
youngest on this on the crew
I<00:03:37.230> think<00:03:38.100> Ezra<00:03:38.700> thinks<00:03:39.239> he's<00:03:39.420> gonna<00:03:39.570> have<00:03:39.840> a

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
I think Ezra thinks he's gonna have a

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.479 
I think Ezra thinks he's gonna have a
lot<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.110> luck<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.560> Sabine<00:03:40.920> because<00:03:41.310> he's

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
lot of luck with Sabine because he's

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.640 
lot of luck with Sabine because he's
like<00:03:41.700> he's<00:03:41.970> got<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> lot<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.510> confidence<00:03:43.110> he's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
like he's got a lot of confidence he's

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.920 
like he's got a lot of confidence he's
very<00:03:43.800> cocky<00:03:44.370> he's<00:03:45.090> been<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.390> his<00:03:45.420> own<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:45.870> a

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
very cocky he's been on his own for a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.420 
very cocky he's been on his own for a
long<00:03:46.140> time<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:46.650> he<00:03:46.769> thinks<00:03:46.980> he's<00:03:47.070> got<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.340> all

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
long time so he thinks he's got it all

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.039 
long time so he thinks he's got it all
figured<00:03:47.670> out

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
figured out

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.949 
figured out
Sabine<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:49.890> would<00:03:50.040> say<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.519> least<00:03:50.959> readily

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
Sabine I would say is the least readily

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.800 
Sabine I would say is the least readily
