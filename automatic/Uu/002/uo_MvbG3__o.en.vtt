00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
well they actually do not convert but

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.810 
well they actually do not convert but
they<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.979> transform<00:01:41.490> because<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> have

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
they do like transform because you have

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.679 
they do like transform because you have
to<00:01:41.880> take<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.150> apart<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.390> put<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.600> back

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
to take it apart and put it back

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.660 
to take it apart and put it back
together<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.710> vehicle<00:01:44.159> mode<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.579> i'm

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
together in the vehicle mode so i'm

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.929 
together in the vehicle mode so i'm

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that's actually like the coolest part of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.889 
that's actually like the coolest part of
them<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.820> i<00:01:50.850> forgot<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.119> show<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.509> earlier

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and you can see right here it's kind of

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.190 
and you can see right here it's kind of
complicated<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> literally<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
complicated like you literally have to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.630 
complicated like you literally have to
take<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> whole<00:01:55.619> thing<00:01:55.920> apart<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> get

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
take the whole thing apart just to get

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120 
take the whole thing apart just to get
it<00:01:56.729> back<00:01:56.850> into<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> beast<00:01:57.420> mode<00:01:57.979> alright<00:01:58.979> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
it back into the beast mode alright so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.580 
it back into the beast mode alright so
here's<00:01:59.340> his<00:01:59.520> beast<00:01:59.790> mode<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.899> kind<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
here's his beast mode and it's kind of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.980 
here's his beast mode and it's kind of
cool<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.189> guess<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> mean<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.960> know

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
cool I guess but I mean it's you know

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.690 
cool I guess but I mean it's you know
what<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.380> would<00:02:04.469> expect<00:02:04.799> from<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.100> crayon<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
what you would expect from a crayon and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.190 
what you would expect from a crayon and
it's<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.360> kind<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.630> cool<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.079> look

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
it's it's kind of cool like if you look

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.510 
it's it's kind of cool like if you look
in<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> picture<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.920> kind<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.160> looks<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
in the picture it kind of looks like a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.400 
in the picture it kind of looks like a
scorpion<00:02:08.789> obviously<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.959> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.229> also

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
scorpion obviously but it kind of also

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.300 
scorpion obviously but it kind of also
just<00:02:10.739> looks<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:10.920> him<00:02:11.099> looking<00:02:11.489> down<00:02:11.670> or<00:02:11.730> so

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
just looks like him looking down or so

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.180 
just looks like him looking down or so
thing<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:13.260> yeah<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.500> then<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.770> falls<00:02:15.010> off

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
thing and yeah and then that falls off

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.160 
thing and yeah and then that falls off
but<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:16.000> weird<00:02:16.330> because<00:02:16.510> they<00:02:16.720> show<00:02:16.930> this

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
but it's weird because they show this

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.960 
but it's weird because they show this
thing<00:02:17.470> I'm<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:18.040> quite<00:02:18.280> sure<00:02:18.310> what<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.670> piece

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
thing I'm not quite sure what that piece

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.490 
thing I'm not quite sure what that piece
is<00:02:19.030> supposed<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.690> be<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.050> then<00:02:20.200> they<00:02:20.319> show<00:02:20.470> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
is supposed to be but then they show a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.589 
is supposed to be but then they show a
claw<00:02:20.800> on<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.099> side<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:22.030> they<00:02:22.150> clearly<00:02:22.360> show

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
claw on this side and they clearly show

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.750 
claw on this side and they clearly show
on<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:22.989> front<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.440> beast<00:02:24.160> mode<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.520> he<00:02:24.640> has

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
on the front and beast mode that he has

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.089 
on the front and beast mode that he has
two<00:02:24.940> claws<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.140> guess<00:02:26.560> that's<00:02:26.709> some<00:02:26.920> kind<00:02:27.010> of

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
two claws so I guess that's some kind of

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.309 
two claws so I guess that's some kind of
mistake<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:27.670> their<00:02:27.880> behalf<00:02:28.090> but<00:02:28.420> yeah<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.110> made

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
mistake on their behalf but yeah I made

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.540 
mistake on their behalf but yeah I made
them<00:02:29.410> with<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.560> two<00:02:29.769> claws<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.340> don't<00:02:30.489> have

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
them with the two claws but I don't have

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.430 
them with the two claws but I don't have
that<00:02:30.610> extra<00:02:30.970> piece<00:02:31.209> but<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.019> can<00:02:32.170> see<00:02:32.349> is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
that extra piece but you can see is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.839 
that extra piece but you can see is
actually<00:02:32.590> kind<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:32.980> cool<00:02:33.160> but<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.459> definitely

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
actually kind of cool but I definitely

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.630 
actually kind of cool but I definitely
prefer<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.510> robot<00:02:34.810> mode<00:02:35.220> alright<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.400> here's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
prefer the robot mode alright so here's

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.699

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
sunstorm and all his disappointing glory

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.410 
sunstorm and all his disappointing glory
I<00:02:38.920> don't<00:02:39.160> know<00:02:39.220> what<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.489> is<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.970> mean

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
I don't know what this is I mean

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
I don't know what this is I mean
obviously<00:02:40.810> it's<00:02:40.959> some<00:02:41.080> kind<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.410> a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
obviously it's some kind of like a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.990 
obviously it's some kind of like a
seeker<00:02:41.860> jet<00:02:42.069> or<00:02:42.250> something<00:02:42.489> like<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:42.610> and

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
seeker jet or something like that and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.080 
seeker jet or something like that and
you<00:02:43.599> can<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.900> see<00:02:44.080> right<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> front<00:02:45.090> that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
you can just see right on the front that

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.180 
you can just see right on the front that
it<00:02:46.930> actually<00:02:47.170> doesn't<00:02:47.470> even<00:02:47.650> look<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:47.830> cool

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
it actually doesn't even look that cool

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.190 
it actually doesn't even look that cool
in<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.700> picture<00:02:49.000> but<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:49.989> see<00:02:50.170> right

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
in the picture but you can see right

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.620 
in the picture but you can see right
here<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.489> somewhat<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.090> cool<00:02:52.390> kind

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
here that it's somewhat of a cool kind

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.870 
here that it's somewhat of a cool kind
of<00:02:52.720> jet<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:52.900> guess<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.470> then<00:02:53.650> he<00:02:54.370> looks<00:02:54.549> really

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
of jet I guess and then he looks really

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.979 
of jet I guess and then he looks really
really<00:02:55.209> funny<00:02:55.420> when<00:02:55.569> you<00:02:55.660> turn<00:02:55.810> him<00:02:55.900> upside

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
really funny when you turn him upside

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.539 
really funny when you turn him upside
down<00:02:56.350> like<00:02:56.470> he's<00:02:56.620> got<00:02:56.769> this<00:02:56.890> weird<00:02:57.130> hat<00:02:57.340> or

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
down like he's got this weird hat or

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.640 
down like he's got this weird hat or
something<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:58.360> yeah<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.720> Sun<00:02:59.049> storms<00:02:59.410> other
