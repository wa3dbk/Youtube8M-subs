this level yeah so as you can see
motivate<00:00:46.050> coins<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> first<00:00:47.219> time

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
motivate coins this is the first time

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.950

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you actually see them all to think coin

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.479 
you actually see them all to think coin
in<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> level<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.890> other<00:00:50.160> than<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
in a level not other than the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.200 
in a level not other than the
orientation<00:00:51.829> because<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> previous<00:00:53.789> part

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
orientation because in the previous part

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.849 
orientation because in the previous part

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
defeat to complete that level and that's

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.570 
defeat to complete that level and that's
where<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> monsters<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.609> coins
