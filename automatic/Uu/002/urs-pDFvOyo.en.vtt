00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello my name is Julia and today I 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.220
 for you I shoot 1 for the history of my channel 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.960
 so a girl named she suggested not 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.049
 make a joint video I was not like 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.560
 against but did not know what we are about 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.020
 then we chose those who or is he 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.600
 more in beauty I hope you for 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.150
 this is forgive me this is my first experience 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.099
 in general is so let's start and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 after watching my video go to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.830
 yana's channel and look and and the link will be 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.820
 in the description and so the first category is 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.399
 makeup 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.899
 rouge or bronzer I will choose to blush and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.960
 although not that week, I basically do not 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.940
 I use but blush somehow more with me 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.079
 attract the next just anally 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.700
 basis or concealer I will choose concealer 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.250
 lip gloss or lipstick that's all 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.350
 hard question because ideally 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.300
 first put lipstick on top cover 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.309
 her lips gloss is the best option 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.440
 and it seems to me it turns out very beautiful 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.600
 sponge here for example now I did by 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.110
 I donâ€™t know such a principle 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.880
 to you, but to me, yes, I choose two things at once 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.670
 brushes or sponges 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.210
 I like brushing 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.619
 more conveniently put out the eyeliners 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.020
 question but if you read for example 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.600
 use mascara but don't let eyes 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.689
 eyeliner or vice versa bring eyes but 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.610
 while not painted with ink then I will choose 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.210
 mascara because it's better to have mascara night without 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.220
 liner 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.189
 further crumbly or compressed 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.740
 shadows pressed round colored 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.329
 shadows i will choose natural because 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.200
 it seems that such a shadow on the eyes 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.829
 look better 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.000
 the next category of questions is nails 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.790
 essence or golden rose 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.310
 I will choose the essence because from this brand 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.530
 I have some varnishes from golden 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.259
 rose I have no varnish 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.840
 so I just have nothing to compare so 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.140
 what is the essence of long or short nails i 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.939
 for long nails and now i have them 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.070
 I try to reflect because the winter is not enough 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.189
 vitamins and nails grow poorly break 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.960
 right now I do hard work 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.590
 to make them normal because 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.600
 summer length michael from 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.429
 I like it in the winter somehow not very 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.890
 where for now my efforts to grow 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.870
 normal nail length is successful so 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.849
 which is long acrylic nails or 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.830
 natural nails but certainly better 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.560
 natural because acrylic are you still 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.480
 and spoils your own but if you 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.150
 and so they are not ice at all and not at all 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.790
 grow then well then acrylic it is just 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.830
 good output light and dark colors of lacquer 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.690
 I will choose light but they should be 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.910
 so bright saturated next 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.099
 categories are tel toilet water or 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.190
 Perfume, I'll clean the toilet water 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.079
 body butter or cream choose cream 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.910
 because body oil but elsa y 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:48.120
 I don't really have body oils 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.799
 but there so that soap or shower gel 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.819
 looking for what to use for example 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.590
 here is my face it is soap and the body itself 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.540
 already shower gel 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.390
 but since you are a category of the body, then it must be 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.819
 shower gel deprived of dolce milk 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.560
 I will choose Lash because from dolce milk 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.049
 I have only one product total for 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.000
 souls who gave me my friend, he 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.350
 I basically like it but I have an atlas 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.170
 much more things 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.569
 Ilash is more expensive but I think its products 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.780
 quality is not I follow the category there is fashion 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.120
 jeans leggings of course jeans in general 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.099
 All my pants are in the wardrobe. 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.780
 long or short arm jeans 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.940
 Basically, I'm fine with that 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.130
 of just watching the weather that is 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.440
 Well, in winter it is of course long and in general 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.470
 jackets and so on in the summer this is a t-shirt 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.209
 so how about a weird skirt or 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.340
 the dress is really not that wrong then I am not 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.480
 I love but maybe I'm better 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.819
 will dress 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.340
 but you are still our things very rarely 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.120
 so out there somewhere abroad just 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.540
 on the sea 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.519
 ballet shoes or heels ballet shoes because 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.540
 heels it seems to me at my age it 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.370
 not very appropriate 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.590
 zara or bershka cinder or new yorker i 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.349
 for new yorker but actually my one of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.940
 most favorite stores because 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.250
 sexually cool little things 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.709
 I have a lot of stuff here and 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.209
 Why dm too, but in general they 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.040
 I like collections less in 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.950
 categories are hair long or 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.760
 short i can't long now 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.770
 say i have long hair but 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.930
 here they are the length I want to grow them yet 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.250
 dyed unpainted hair on these 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.010
 I have no definite answer 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.840
 because if i dyed my hair then 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.270
 that is, as if the tips as if 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.090
 that's why there is such an answer 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.400
 fifty fifty that is half 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.430
 length of hair is colored 2 no therefore not 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.650
 know what to choose or or spray i don't 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.640
 I understand this question that is what can 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.830
 do with hair or with gel or spray 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.020
 so well you world just spray well 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.970
 just a word more like a bow or 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.490
 hairpins actually i don't use either 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.320
 Nevertheless in an ordinary life, I go all the time 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.320
 thats just plain loose 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.790
 hair see kelly gum like i already 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.790
 said that in principle, always my hair 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.280
 in free flight yes if it can 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.710
 render but will choose the gum because they 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.340
 more convenient further such questions are the sun or 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.300
 rain of course the sun winter or summer 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.340
 how can you ask such a summer 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.590
 spring and autumn exist for me 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.470
 only two important seasons this summer 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.180
 my favorite and winter is not very favorite as 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.120
 would spring and autumn for me what is 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.830
 the passages are completely unimportant and but if 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.340
 choose from this then all the same spring you 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.020
 or chocolate of course cinnamon on it 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.580
