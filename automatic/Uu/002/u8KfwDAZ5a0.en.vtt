that to store it or carry it so that is

that to store it or carry it so that is
a<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.689> bit<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.899> hit<00:02:07.020> against<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.469> but

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
a little bit of a hit against it but

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.990 
a little bit of a hit against it but
this<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:08.250> too<00:02:08.399> heavy<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.849> be

I<00:02:10.670> think<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.450> more<00:02:11.569> around<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.990> house<00:02:12.140> or

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
I think this is more around the house or

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.780 
I think this is more around the house or
a<00:02:12.410> permanent<00:02:12.740> location<00:02:12.980> sort<00:02:13.490> of<00:02:13.580> thing<00:02:13.700> I

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
a permanent location sort of thing I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.610 
a permanent location sort of thing I
hate<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.090> drag<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.450> thing<00:02:14.600> around<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.080> really

three-quarter pounds that's kind of

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.100 
three-quarter pounds that's kind of
heavy<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.670> trixin<00:02:23.120> around<00:02:23.360> with<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:24.050> I

heavy to be trixin around with but I

heavy to be trixin around with but I
didn't<00:02:24.440> find<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.709> be<00:02:24.770> quite<00:02:24.800> useful<00:02:25.069> for

did appreciate this made the job a lot

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.230 
did appreciate this made the job a lot
quicker<00:02:30.050> it's<00:02:30.650> probably<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.250> third<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.970> speed

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
quicker it's probably a third the speed

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.720 
quicker it's probably a third the speed
or<00:02:32.450> third<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:32.959> time-consuming<00:02:33.620> as<00:02:34.459> she's<00:02:34.700> in

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
or third is time-consuming as she's in

my<00:02:34.910> standard<00:02:35.209> shovel<00:02:35.570> I<00:02:35.690> thought<00:02:35.990> for<00:02:36.230> my<00:02:36.350> task

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
my standard shovel I thought for my task

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.020 
my standard shovel I thought for my task
for<00:02:37.040> planning<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.520> all<00:02:37.610> that

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
for planning and all that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.490 
for planning and all that
obviously<00:02:38.570> I'd<00:02:38.660> need<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.870> build<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.140> trench<00:02:39.380> or

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
obviously I'd need to build a trench or

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.110 
obviously I'd need to build a trench or
fighting<00:02:39.739> hold<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.190> thing<00:02:40.370> can<00:02:40.520> do<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:40.940> job

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
fighting hold this thing can do the job

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.290 
fighting hold this thing can do the job
also<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:43.280> adjustable<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.850> course<00:02:44.060> up<00:02:44.150> here

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
also it's adjustable of course up here

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.330 
also it's adjustable of course up here
top<00:02:44.450> I've<00:02:44.630> not<00:02:44.780> tightened<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.200> down<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:46.190> can

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
top I've not tightened it down you can

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.310 
top I've not tightened it down you can
store<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:47.420> if<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.750> want<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.020> though

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
store it like this if you want to though

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.570 
store it like this if you want to though
I<00:02:48.350> don't<00:02:48.470> think<00:02:48.769> that<00:02:48.890> saves<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.280> whole<00:02:49.430> lot

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
I don't think that saves you a whole lot

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.300 
I don't think that saves you a whole lot
of<00:02:49.610> room<00:02:49.850> overall<00:02:50.269> really<00:02:51.100> just<00:02:52.100> for<00:02:52.220> keeping

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
of room overall really just for keeping

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.740 
of room overall really just for keeping
out<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.519> guard<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.940> all<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.600> probably

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
out the guard and all this is probably

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.850 
out the guard and all this is probably
the<00:02:53.989> position<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.410> gonna<00:02:54.500> be<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.680> most

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
the position this gonna be the most

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.030 
the position this gonna be the most
useful<00:02:55.070> as<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.459> pic<00:02:55.640> or<00:02:56.060> code<00:02:56.450> or<00:02:56.480> rakeback

earth technically from the website you

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.320 
earth technically from the website you
can<00:03:00.230> bend<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.590> back<00:03:00.769> this<00:03:00.950> way<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.430> use<00:03:02.120> this

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
can bend it back this way and use this

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.150 
can bend it back this way and use this
as<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.540> shovel<00:03:02.989> in<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.170> pinch<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.590> don't<00:03:03.860> know<00:03:04.010> how

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
as a shovel in a pinch I don't know how

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.440 
as a shovel in a pinch I don't know how
good<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.459> shovel<00:03:04.670> that's<00:03:04.940> gonna<00:03:05.120> be<00:03:05.300> with

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
good of a shovel that's gonna be with

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.400 
good of a shovel that's gonna be with
that<00:03:05.510> area<00:03:06.110> it's<00:03:06.800> okay<00:03:07.070> in<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.220> pitch<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.519> guess

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
that area it's okay in a pitch I guess

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.840 
that area it's okay in a pitch I guess
that's<00:03:09.410> okay<00:03:09.530> but<00:03:09.890> again<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.400> think<00:03:10.550> this<00:03:10.790> is

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
that's okay but again I think this is
