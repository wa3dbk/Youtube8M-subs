so<00:00:01.319> in<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:01.620> video<00:00:01.770> I'm<00:00:02.190> going<00:00:02.520> to

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
so in this video I'm going to

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.610 
so in this video I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.330> make<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.870> portal<00:00:04.350> in

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
demonstrate how to make a portal in

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.629 
demonstrate how to make a portal in
Minecraft<00:00:05.629> without<00:00:06.629> mining<00:00:07.200> obsidian<00:00:07.680> rather

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
Minecraft without mining obsidian rather

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.060 
Minecraft without mining obsidian rather
by<00:00:08.910> casting<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.719> place<00:00:09.929> using<00:00:10.230> lava<00:00:10.800> and

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
by casting it in place using lava and

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.480 
by casting it in place using lava and
water<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.840> will<00:00:12.990> need<00:00:13.139> 14<00:00:13.889> lava

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
water to do this you will need 14 lava

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
water to do this you will need 14 lava
buckets<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.179> one<00:00:15.509> water<00:00:15.990> bucket<00:00:16.350> you'll<00:00:16.949> also

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
buckets and one water bucket you'll also

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.710 
buckets and one water bucket you'll also
need<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:18.119> pile<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> dirt<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.170> use<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:20.390> mold<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
need a pile of dirt to use as mold and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.820 
need a pile of dirt to use as mold and
as<00:00:21.869> scaffolding<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
as scaffolding so this is what the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.320 
as scaffolding so this is what the
portal<00:00:26.250> will<00:00:26.369> look<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.640> when<00:00:26.789> finished<00:00:27.150> it's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
portal will look like when finished it's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.109 
portal will look like when finished it's
currently<00:00:27.660> prototype<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.800> dirt<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> web

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
currently prototype with dirt on the web

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.200 
currently prototype with dirt on the web
and<00:00:30.300> clear<00:00:30.689> away<00:00:30.960> or<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> couple<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.910> bottom

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and clear away or a couple of the bottom

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.100 
and clear away or a couple of the bottom
layer<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.989> start<00:00:34.050> casting

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
layer so that you can start casting

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.479 
layer so that you can start casting
basically<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.950> make<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> mold

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
basically you just have to make a mold

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.729 
basically you just have to make a mold
free<00:00:39.059> each<00:00:40.070> block<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:42.840> put<00:00:43.079> dirt<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.410> four

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
free each block you put dirt on four

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.860 
free each block you put dirt on four
sides<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> put<00:00:44.600> lava<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
sides and then you put lava in the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.119 
sides and then you put lava in the
middle<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.460> then<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:48.289> put<00:00:49.289> water<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.920> such<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
middle and then you put water in such a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.180 
middle and then you put water in such a
place<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.879> will<00:00:51.000> flow<00:00:51.360> onto<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.870> lava

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
place that it will flow onto the lava

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.139 
place that it will flow onto the lava
but<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.309> wanna<00:00:53.489> put<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.670> directly<00:00:53.850> on

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
but you don't wanna put it directly on

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.600 
but you don't wanna put it directly on
top<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> lava<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.770> will<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.070> make<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
top of the lava or it will just make the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.680 
top of the lava or it will just make the
lava<00:00:56.789> disappear<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.270> want<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> set<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.660> off

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
lava disappear so you want to set it off

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.930 
lava disappear so you want to set it off
to<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> side<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.699> then<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> just

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
to the side like this and then you just

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.380 
to the side like this and then you just
immediately<00:01:01.010> pick<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.190> again<00:01:02.309> notice<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
immediately pick it up again notice the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
immediately pick it up again notice the
water<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.719> reduced<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> lava<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.189> what

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
water is reduced but the lava is what

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.940 
water is reduced but the lava is what
turns<00:01:05.880> into<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.240> cydia<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.799> our<00:01:07.920> first

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
turns into a cydia so we have our first

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.050 
turns into a cydia so we have our first
obsidian<00:01:08.460> block<00:01:08.610> there<00:01:08.960> go<00:01:09.960> ahead<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.060> make

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
obsidian block there go ahead and make

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.230 
obsidian block there go ahead and make
the<00:01:12.240> next<00:01:12.479> gold<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:13.280> fact<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.610> expedite<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the next gold in fact to expedite this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.670 
the next gold in fact to expedite this
process<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:16.020> several<00:01:16.259> blocks<00:01:16.500> at

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
process you can do several blocks at

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.609 
process you can do several blocks at
once<00:01:17.390> because<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.540> will<00:01:18.720> demonstrate<00:01:21.530> but<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
once because I will demonstrate but you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.859 
once because I will demonstrate but you
do<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> bucket<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.700> lava<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.210> each

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
do have to put a bucket of lava in each

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.310 
do have to put a bucket of lava in each
of<00:01:25.020> these<00:01:25.170> places<00:01:25.850> some<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.290> one<00:01:28.290> there

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
of these places some one there one there

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.819 
of these places some one there one there
and<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.340> there<00:01:29.900> notice<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.140> top<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.530> flat<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and one there notice the top is flat and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.840 
and one there notice the top is flat and
there's<00:01:32.159> no<00:01:32.250> flowing<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.740> then<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.700> can

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
there's no flowing going on then you can

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.840 
there's no flowing going on then you can
basically<00:01:36.030> put<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> water<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:38.670> edge<00:01:38.820> here

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
basically put the water on the edge here

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
basically put the water on the edge here
and<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.689> will<00:01:39.720> flow<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> those<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and it will flow on to all of those and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.950 
and it will flow on to all of those and
turn<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.310> into<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.520> city<00:01:41.759> all<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.899> to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
turn them all into a city all I want to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.929 
turn them all into a city all I want to
go<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.439> pick<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.740> back<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.729> try

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
go and then you pick it back up you try

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.950 
go and then you pick it back up you try
to<00:01:45.000> when<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.299> want<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.509> pick<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> water

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to when you want to pick up the water

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.240 
to when you want to pick up the water
kind<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.380> soon<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.619> possible<00:01:47.009> before

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
kind of as soon as possible before

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
kind of as soon as possible before
pushes<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.640> away<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.930> say<00:01:49.049> I've<00:01:49.140> made

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
pushes you away so you can say I've made

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.780 
pushes you away so you can say I've made
the<00:01:49.439> lowest<00:01:49.979> level<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:51.390> go<00:01:51.479> ahead<00:01:51.570> and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
the lowest level here I can go ahead and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.050 
the lowest level here I can go ahead and
clear<00:01:53.790> off<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.500> first<00:01:55.500> level<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.920> moon<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
clear off the first level of moon and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.290 
clear off the first level of moon and
then

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
then

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.800 
then
do<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.420> second<00:02:00.720> level<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> we're<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.690> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
do the second level so we're going to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:14.720 
do the second level so we're going to
want<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.140> something<00:02:04.440> like<00:02:05.510> this<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:13.730> pull

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
want to do something like this and pull

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.530 
want to do something like this and pull
on<00:02:14.760> similar<00:02:15.420> buckets<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.110> lava<00:02:16.410> here<00:02:20.480> here<00:02:21.480> we

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
on similar buckets of lava here here we

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.990 
on similar buckets of lava here here we
go<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:22.920> put<00:02:23.810> bucket<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.900> lava<00:02:25.790> bucket<00:02:26.790> of

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
go so we put bucket of lava bucket of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.520 
go so we put bucket of lava bucket of
water<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.720> side<00:02:27.930> pick<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.320> up<00:02:28.410> again

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
water on to the side pick it up again

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:39.199 
water on to the side pick it up again
and<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:29.490> have<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:37.760> guess<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.880> don't<00:02:39.060> actually

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
and we have I guess you don't actually

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.080 
and we have I guess you don't actually
have<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.739> remove<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.800> whole<00:02:41.100> bowl<00:02:41.340> for<00:02:41.880> every

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
have to remove the whole bowl for every

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.699 
have to remove the whole bowl for every
block<00:02:42.300> as<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.540> go<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.720> could<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.140> place<00:02:44.390> but

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
block as you go you could just place but

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.660 
block as you go you could just place but
I'm<00:02:46.709> taking<00:02:46.980> them<00:02:47.070> off<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.370> make<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> little

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
I'm taking them off to make it a little

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.120 
I'm taking them off to make it a little
easier<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.970> see<00:02:48.090> what's<00:02:48.330> going<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.920> the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
easier to see what's going on so the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:26.030 
easier to see what's going on so the
next<00:02:53.160> level<00:02:53.910> this

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.679 

and<00:03:26.909> remember<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.420> want<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.659> make<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.049> sides

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
and remember you want to make the sides

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.250 
and remember you want to make the sides
a<00:03:30.689> total<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.620> five<00:03:32.310> tall<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.390> bottom<00:03:34.170> and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
a total of five tall and the bottom and

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:45.020 
a total of five tall and the bottom and
top<00:03:34.409> a<00:03:34.469> total<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:35.010> four<00:03:35.219> wide<00:03:43.609> so<00:03:44.609> this<00:03:44.730> will<00:03:44.879> be

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
top a total of four wide so this will be

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.229 
top a total of four wide so this will be
the<00:03:46.340> this<00:03:47.340> will<00:03:47.519> be<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.760> middle<00:03:48.030> layer<00:03:48.209> I

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
the this will be the middle layer I

00:03:48.239 --> 00:04:35.860 
the this will be the middle layer I
think<00:04:33.409> so<00:04:34.409> you<00:04:34.560> can<00:04:34.740> see<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.099> portal<00:04:35.460> is

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
think so you can see the portal is

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.040 
think so you can see the portal is
roughly<00:04:36.870> half<00:04:37.199> complete<00:04:38.780> starting<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.870> take

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
roughly half complete starting to take

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.529 
roughly half complete starting to take
some<00:04:40.710> recognizable<00:04:41.070> shape<00:04:41.490> there<00:04:42.560> let's

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
some recognizable shape there let's

00:04:44.539 --> 00:05:29.450 
some recognizable shape there let's
build<00:04:45.539> this<00:04:45.810> guy

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.830 

so<00:05:30.460> now<00:05:30.580> we<00:05:30.640> just<00:05:30.910> need<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.090> top<00:05:31.420> bar<00:05:32.350> part<00:05:33.840> so

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
so now we just need the top bar part so

00:05:34.840 --> 00:06:21.920 
so now we just need the top bar part so
let's<00:06:19.410> so<00:06:20.410> you<00:06:20.500> can<00:06:20.680> see<00:06:20.830> you<00:06:20.950> the<00:06:21.130> last<00:06:21.340> four

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
let's so you can see you the last four

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.270 
let's so you can see you the last four
city<00:06:22.930> and<00:06:23.080> blocks<00:06:23.320> will<00:06:23.560> go<00:06:23.710> and<00:06:23.980> we<00:06:24.100> have

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
city and blocks will go and we have

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.120 
city and blocks will go and we have
exactly<00:06:24.669> four<00:06:25.000> buckets<00:06:25.600> of<00:06:25.750> lava<00:06:25.930> left<00:06:29.130> put

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
exactly four buckets of lava left put

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:46.220 
exactly four buckets of lava left put
them<00:06:30.280> all<00:06:30.430> in

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:07:13.860 

clear<00:06:47.230> away<00:06:47.410> all<00:06:51.840> of<00:06:52.840> the<00:06:53.140> extra<00:06:54.010> dirt<00:07:12.870> all

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
clear away all of the extra dirt all

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.080 
clear away all of the extra dirt all
right<00:07:14.050> we're<00:07:14.260> ready<00:07:14.290> to<00:07:14.620> light<00:07:14.800> it<00:07:14.950> head<00:07:15.940> out

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
right we're ready to light it head out

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.900 
right we're ready to light it head out
our<00:07:16.270> fire<00:07:16.720> maker<00:07:17.050> here<00:07:20.040> and<00:07:21.040> now<00:07:21.640> we<00:07:21.700> have<00:07:21.880> a

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:21.910 
our fire maker here and now we have a

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.500 
our fire maker here and now we have a
home<00:07:23.040> you<00:07:24.040> can<00:07:24.220> use<00:07:24.340> the<00:07:24.490> portal<00:07:24.790> to<00:07:24.970> explore

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.510 
home you can use the portal to explore

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.530 
home you can use the portal to explore
the<00:07:25.690> nether<00:07:25.840> where<00:07:26.290> I<00:07:26.320> hear<00:07:26.620> there's<00:07:26.860> a<00:07:26.980> lot<00:07:27.430> of

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
the nether where I hear there's a lot of

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.180 
the nether where I hear there's a lot of
so<00:07:28.540> once<00:07:28.930> you<00:07:29.080> have<00:07:29.380> access<00:07:29.710> to<00:07:29.740> that<00:07:29.920> you<00:07:30.040> can

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.190 
so once you have access to that you can

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.610 
so once you have access to that you can
make<00:07:30.310> kind<00:07:30.610> of<00:07:30.670> all<00:07:30.820> the<00:07:30.910> obsidian<00:07:31.270> you<00:07:31.360> want

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
make kind of all the obsidian you want

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.670 
make kind of all the obsidian you want
but<00:07:32.620> that's<00:07:33.130> how<00:07:33.310> you<00:07:33.370> make<00:07:33.580> it<00:07:34.530> with<00:07:35.530> no

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
but that's how you make it with no

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.820 
but that's how you make it with no
diamond<00:07:35.980> pick<00:07:36.160> there<00:07:36.610> you<00:07:36.700> go
