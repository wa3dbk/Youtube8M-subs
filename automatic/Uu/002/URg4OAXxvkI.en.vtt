00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.280
 hello friends let's do an experiment 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.900
 that we saw in particular 100,000 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.570
 subscribers in the channel of arrives videos 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.780
 and for this we need an orange or 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.980
 a lemon or both some balloons and a cutter 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.960
 wow what a knife cut too 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.690
 would serve let's go there is simply 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.840
 pop the balloons with the help of acid 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.270
 lemon tree that carries all the skins of 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.940
 the citrus fruits well there we have cut a 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.340
 little piece of orange peel and there what 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.199
 same with the good lemon acid 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.090
 lemon in or is not more or less this 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.489
 which is inside the shell part 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.039
 external good many of us know 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.250
 when we have a flame we squeeze 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:43.700
 that sets fire because it is 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.890
 fuel if it is flammable and that is neither 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.780
 more or less than the good lemon tree what 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.540
 same that sets fire is capable of 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.760
 deteriorate the rubber of the balloon there we have 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.770
 seen how it has exploded and good to do it 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.680
 explode is instantaneous practically 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.960
 with very little we get it to explode 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.550
 the balloon we are going to try to take a 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.009
 little bit more than good 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.979
 we will go to and squeezing or squeezing to 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.320
 take out all the lemon in what we can and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.229
 well then there the orange peel 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.910
 it's simply the citrus peel going 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.479
 exactly the same orange tangerine 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.280
 lemon baba exactly the same and good there 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.899
 we have very very little amount but 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.550
 enough to train a little 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:30.100
 the swab and the demented when touching the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.100
 balloon we will see how it explodes let's go there 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.219
 perfect and let's explode another this 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:39.320
 It lasts long because it is very well very 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.969
 powerful good I hope you like the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.189
