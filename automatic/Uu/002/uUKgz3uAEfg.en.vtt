00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
wonder what looks like visually so we

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
wonder what looks like visually so we
had<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> different<00:00:31.910> visual<00:00:32.910> ideas<00:00:33.510> that

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
it's entering this this new realm we're

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.250 
it's entering this this new realm we're
gonna<00:00:48.300> start<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> little<00:00:48.840> bit<00:00:48.960> we

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
gonna start with that a little bit we

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.080 
gonna start with that a little bit we
also<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.950> had<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.129> idea<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.760> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.969> like

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
also we had this idea of kind of like

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.720 
also we had this idea of kind of like
this<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.170> fire<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.890> existed<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.550> place

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
this this fire that existed in a place

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.310 
this this fire that existed in a place
where<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.390> there<00:00:54.539> couldn't<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.989> fire

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
where you know there couldn't be a fire

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010 
where you know there couldn't be a fire
and<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:56.969> morphed<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.420> from<00:00:57.809> there

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and so it kind of morphed in from there

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
and so it kind of morphed in from there
you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.100> tried<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.489> different<00:00:59.609> couple

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you know we tried it in different couple

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.729 
you know we tried it in different couple
areas<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:00.930> settled<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.379> kind<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
areas and we really settled on kind of a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.310 
areas and we really settled on kind of a
real<00:01:01.920> plane<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> parking<00:01:03.600> lot<00:01:03.660> background

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
real plane like a parking lot background

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230 
real plane like a parking lot background
we<00:01:04.860> felt<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.729> biggest

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
we felt like that was like the biggest

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
we felt like that was like the biggest
juxtaposition<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.439> here's<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.400> know

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
juxtaposition of like here's you know

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
juxtaposition of like here's you know
kind<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> natural<00:01:09.200> interacting<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
kind of the natural interacting with the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
kind of the natural interacting with the
supernatural<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.640> was<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> was

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
supernatural so there was it was

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.929 
supernatural so there was it was
actually<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> pretty<00:01:12.479> involved<00:01:13.229> process<00:01:13.939> rock

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
actually a pretty involved process rock

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.249 
actually a pretty involved process rock

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
designers he and I kind of headed up

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.030 
designers he and I kind of headed up
that<00:01:18.360> idea<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.869> alright<00:01:19.530> let's<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.799> figure

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that idea of alright let's just figure

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.499 
that idea of alright let's just figure
out<00:01:20.130> let's<00:01:20.340> build<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.670> box<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.270> quite

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
out let's build this box I'm not quite

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.630 
out let's build this box I'm not quite
sure<00:01:21.540> how<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> ended<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.770> being<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.189> part<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
sure how I ended up being a part of that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.800 
sure how I ended up being a part of that
because<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:25.140> designing<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> DVD<00:01:26.100> menus

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
because I was designing the DVD menus

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.660 
because I was designing the DVD menus
but<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.590> know<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> past<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
but I just know in the past that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.270 
but I just know in the past that
whenever<00:01:29.850> we've<00:01:30.090> done<00:01:30.530> album<00:01:31.530> covers<00:01:31.890> or

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
energy to it yeah we could computer

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.420 
energy to it yeah we could computer
generate<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.130> doesn't<00:01:53.310> make<00:01:53.399> sense

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
generate this but it doesn't make sense

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
generate this but it doesn't make sense
like<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.909> can't<00:01:54.090> can't<00:01:54.420> say<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:55.140> did

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
this isn't worth it sometimes like it's
