is I like to use c1 for an aperture
priority<00:01:02.550> mode<00:01:02.989> where<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
priority mode where don't really have to

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.109 
priority mode where don't really have to
think<00:01:04.830> about<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.280> much<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:06.030> gonna

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
get a narrow depth of field gonna let in

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.640 
get a narrow depth of field gonna let in
as<00:01:09.060> much<00:01:09.090> light<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.450> possible<00:01:09.570> by<00:01:10.320> putting<00:01:10.590> it

around right now that is oh is that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.060 
around right now that is oh is that
automatic<00:01:18.479> which<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.990> let's<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.860> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
automatic which I like let's see here so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.910 
automatic which I like let's see here so
the<00:01:21.060> automatic<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.170> between<00:01:22.320> 100

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the automatic I do want it between 100

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.160 
the automatic I do want it between 100
and<00:01:23.009> 1600<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> minimum<00:01:24.840> shutter

I shoot at five point six instead and
then<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.750> changed<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.410> different<00:02:46.620> mode<00:02:47.239> right
