 take the hometown of superman as far as 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.310
 I remember just adding anything here 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.000
 here you just have to watch everything 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.460

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.060
 hitting some characters 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:33.079
 very cool looks the same kombat 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.750
 that is, in principle, a look is real from 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:39.049
 Mortal Kombat 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:44.230

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.959
 there is done to use 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.810
 no blood but the quality of the special effects around 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.810
 m to blood other than anything but 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.150
 everything is different here with this super 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.500

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:46.900
 hell but as we see some blood they 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:55.780
 added such a gap textures 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:04:03.670
 Well, anyway, fun enough, let's we 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:06.790
 let's not start again on the choice of characters here 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:12.790
 batman take against the standard 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.409
 joker villain let's set easy 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.299
 what just watch powder spokes 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:22.210
 crepe connection tricks in general 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.520
 honestly the game is worth it worth it 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.770
 play she also has her story line 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.110
 as an immortal battalion that is cool 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.720
 student story of all the characters and 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.449
 in general, that is, the game is made of course 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.080
 pro wonderfully surprises me that warner 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.560
 base 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.139
 switched to games like mortal 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.389
 kombat fighting all the fights have even 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.409
 that is their secret power is connected by 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.539
 go hesitated 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:51.620
 make snotty cartoons but they are here 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.650
 made ours 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:03.350
 and bring down to the masterpieces they made now 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:05.840
 injustice masterpiece so it follows 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.940
 just try at least the whole and not 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.630
 run and up to the requirement basically you 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.169
 games such 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.419
 nothing so i take off for permission below 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.389
 shield without a shovel it because generally like 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.860
 to be honest with us for a resolution of 1920 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:24.699
 at 1080 I do not know why but here it gives 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.690
 real shorter than 60 fps 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.620
 it is known that already through fraps and 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.710
 it turns out when about psyche wheels fps 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.160
 unreal falls at what half 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.590
 exactly 30 run out the question again 60 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.289
 frames that is by the quality of yourself 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.800
 here's the way a and joker miss again 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.800

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.360
 come on, beat me . 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.669
 here I am his super 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.990
 generally masterpiece so i will do 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.010
 probably a video which is just outside 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.630
 special moves 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.450
