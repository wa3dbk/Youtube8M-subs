the<00:00:06.590> moon<00:00:06.830> maybe<00:00:07.250> our<00:00:07.550> nearest<00:00:07.820> neighbor<00:00:08.210> in

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
the moon maybe our nearest neighbor in

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.780 
the moon maybe our nearest neighbor in
space<00:00:08.590> but<00:00:09.590> there's<00:00:09.770> a<00:00:09.860> lot<00:00:10.130> we<00:00:10.370> still<00:00:10.400> don't

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
space but there's a lot we still don't

space but there's a lot we still don't
know<00:00:10.850> about<00:00:11.059> it<00:00:11.470> such<00:00:12.470> as<00:00:12.680> where<00:00:13.010> did<00:00:13.160> it<00:00:13.250> come

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
know about it such as where did it come

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.000 
know about it such as where did it come
from<00:00:13.870> one<00:00:14.870> theory<00:00:15.260> is<00:00:15.379> that<00:00:15.559> the<00:00:15.799> moon

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
from one theory is that the moon

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.160 
from one theory is that the moon
resulted<00:00:16.580> from<00:00:16.700> an<00:00:16.850> asteroid<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:17.720> size<00:00:17.750> of

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
resulted from an asteroid the size of

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.100 
resulted from an asteroid the size of
Mars<00:00:18.470> colliding<00:00:19.370> with<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.520> earth<00:00:20.110> flinging

Mars colliding with the earth flinging

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.030 
Mars colliding with the earth flinging
vaporized<00:00:21.680> rock<00:00:22.040> and<00:00:22.310> debris<00:00:22.790> into<00:00:23.300> space

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
vaporized rock and debris into space

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.500 
vaporized rock and debris into space
some<00:00:25.040> of<00:00:25.070> which<00:00:25.310> went<00:00:25.580> into<00:00:25.670> orbit<00:00:25.940> around<00:00:26.210> the

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
some of which went into orbit around the

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.100 
some of which went into orbit around the
earth<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:26.930> solidified<00:00:27.920> to<00:00:28.340> make<00:00:28.520> the<00:00:28.730> moon

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
earth and solidified to make the moon

after<00:00:30.110> the<00:00:30.380> Apollo<00:00:30.680> missions<00:00:31.070> people<00:00:31.610> for

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
after the Apollo missions people for

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.790 
after the Apollo missions people for
what<00:00:32.689> I<00:00:32.719> really<00:00:32.809> felt<00:00:33.260> they<00:00:33.350> knew<00:00:33.500> all<00:00:33.649> there

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
what I really felt they knew all there

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.229 
what I really felt they knew all there
was<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:34.160> know<00:00:34.399> about<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.760> moon<00:00:34.879> they<00:00:35.030> brought

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
was to know about the moon they brought

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.450 
was to know about the moon they brought
back<00:00:35.420> a<00:00:35.450> third<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:35.930> ton<00:00:36.110> of<00:00:36.140> moon<00:00:36.890> dust<00:00:36.920> and

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
back a third of a ton of moon dust and

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.700 
back a third of a ton of moon dust and
they<00:00:38.329> analyzed<00:00:38.749> it<00:00:38.929> and<00:00:39.109> they<00:00:39.170> come<00:00:39.440> up<00:00:39.559> with

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
they analyzed it and they come up with

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.009 
they analyzed it and they come up with
theories<00:00:40.129> of<00:00:40.370> how<00:00:40.789> the<00:00:40.850> moon<00:00:41.059> was<00:00:41.239> formed<00:00:41.420> it's

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
theories of how the moon was formed it's

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.630 
theories of how the moon was formed it's
only<00:00:42.140> quite<00:00:42.410> recently<00:00:42.829> in<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.100> last<00:00:43.129> decade

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
only quite recently in the last decade

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.459 
only quite recently in the last decade
that<00:00:43.670> people<00:00:44.120> have<00:00:44.210> suddenly<00:00:44.420> realized<00:00:45.050> all

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
that people have suddenly realized all

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.200 
that people have suddenly realized all
the<00:00:45.739> unanswered<00:00:46.010> questions<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:46.789> are<00:00:47.030> still

the unanswered questions that are still

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.880 
the unanswered questions that are still
out<00:00:47.329> there<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.749> the<00:00:47.839> really<00:00:48.050> big<00:00:48.230> one<00:00:48.409> is

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
out there and the really big one is

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.229 
out there and the really big one is
still<00:00:49.219> where<00:00:49.429> the<00:00:49.519> earth<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.879> moon<00:00:50.059> came

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
still where the earth of the moon came

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.229 
still where the earth of the moon came

of people this is a mission that's
really<00:01:36.140> done<00:01:36.320> by<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:36.830> small<00:01:37.280> group<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.909> people

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
really done by a small group of people

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.430 
really done by a small group of people
both<00:01:38.270> here<00:01:38.509> at<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.690> Rutherford<00:01:39.020> Laboratory

and<00:01:39.619> in<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:40.520> whole<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.820> ISA<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.659> we<00:01:41.750> just

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
and in the whole of ISA and we just

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.350 
and in the whole of ISA and we just
worked<00:01:42.259> like<00:01:42.409> crazy<00:01:42.590> for<00:01:43.069> two<00:01:43.399> years<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.850> got

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
worked like crazy for two years and got

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.790 
worked like crazy for two years and got
it<00:01:44.479> built<00:01:44.690> it's<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.140> new<00:01:45.259> way<00:01:45.409> of<00:01:45.440> doing<00:01:45.649> things

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
it built it's a new way of doing things

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.880 
it built it's a new way of doing things
and<00:01:46.280> much<00:01:46.789> more<00:01:46.970> efficient<00:01:47.390> we<00:01:47.509> think<00:01:47.890> the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
and much more efficient we think the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.770 
and much more efficient we think the
