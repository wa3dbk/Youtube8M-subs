Eve is a bit like a dummy late there you

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:29.660 
Eve is a bit like a dummy late there you
go<00:01:25.579> background<00:01:26.579> to<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.789> mass<00:01:28.039> I'll<00:01:29.039> put<00:01:29.310> stays

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
go background to the mass I'll put stays

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.169 
go background to the mass I'll put stays
on<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.469> that<00:01:31.469> for<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.069> up<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.909> six

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
on it that for me is up and that six

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.920 
on it that for me is up and that six
meters<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:34.310> just<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.490> stop<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.880> flopping<00:01:36.299> about

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
meters up just to stop it flopping about

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.240 
meters up just to stop it flopping about
it<00:01:38.920> gets<00:01:39.100> really<00:01:39.460> windy<00:01:39.610> it's<00:01:40.120> not<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.300> problem

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it gets really windy it's not a problem

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.420 
it gets really windy it's not a problem
because<00:01:42.250> it's<00:01:43.240> quick-release<00:01:43.660> clamps<00:01:44.430> on

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
because it's quick-release clamps on

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.960 
because it's quick-release clamps on
every<00:01:45.730> section

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
every section

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.560 
every section
so<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.690> that

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
so we see that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.030 
so we see that
so<00:01:51.200> menthol<00:01:51.590> X<00:01:51.710> was<00:01:52.010> so<00:01:52.190> on<00:01:52.370> so<00:01:52.790> chops<00:01:53.150> down<00:01:53.450> to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
so menthol X was so on so chops down to

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.990 
so menthol X was so on so chops down to
buy<00:01:56.050> 4/7<00:01:57.050> I<00:01:57.170> think<00:01:57.470> actually<00:01:57.700> in<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.790> matter
