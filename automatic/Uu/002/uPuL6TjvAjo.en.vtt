get I think it's like 12.5 or 11.5

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.370 
get I think it's like 12.5 or 11.5
because<00:04:42.040> 11<00:04:42.370> 11<00:04:42.730> assists<00:04:43.030> a<00:04:43.090> game<00:04:43.290> over<00:04:44.290> the

because 11 11 assists a game over the
length<00:04:44.500> of<00:04:44.620> an<00:04:44.740> entire<00:04:44.950> series<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.240> kind

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
length of an entire series so you kind

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.520 
length of an entire series so you kind
of<00:04:46.450> you<00:04:46.540> really<00:04:46.750> excellent<00:04:46.900> Lee<00:04:47.290> you're<00:04:47.380> not
