select the ones that you want to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.249 
select the ones that you want to
transfer<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.030> reason<00:01:54.299> why<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.689> would<00:01:55.079> say

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
transfer now the reason why I would say

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.920 
transfer now the reason why I would say
I<00:01:55.290> would<00:01:55.500> make<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> copy<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.460> because<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.719> want

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
I would make a copy is because you want

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.800 
I would make a copy is because you want
to<00:01:57.990> copy<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:59.000> from<00:02:00.000> your<00:02:00.180> internal<00:02:00.479> memory

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
to copy it from your internal memory

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.420 
to copy it from your internal memory
onto<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.170> SD<00:02:01.409> card<00:02:01.680> now<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> thing<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.130> like

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
onto your SD card now the thing is like

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.429 
onto your SD card now the thing is like
sometimes<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.180> gets<00:02:03.390> corrupted<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
sometimes like it gets corrupted if you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.980 
sometimes like it gets corrupted if you
move<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> directly<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.729> do<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> cut<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
move it directly if you do like a cut it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.229 
move it directly if you do like a cut it
you<00:02:07.500> move<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.770> directly<00:02:07.890> onto<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.580> sd<00:02:08.729> card<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
you move it directly onto your sd card I

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.820 
you move it directly onto your sd card I
think<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.690> thing<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.020> lot<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.319> times<00:02:10.560> your

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
think the thing is a lot of times your

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.260 
think the thing is a lot of times your
SD<00:02:11.129> card<00:02:11.340> gets<00:02:11.520> corrupted

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
SD card gets corrupted

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.630 
SD card gets corrupted
for<00:02:12.750> some<00:02:12.930> reason<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.770> pictures<00:02:14.220> are

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
for some reason and that pictures are

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.840 
for some reason and that pictures are
like<00:02:14.940> blank<00:02:15.480> where<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.140> video<00:02:16.380> won't<00:02:16.590> play<00:02:16.950> so

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
like blank where the video won't play so

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.040 
like blank where the video won't play so
you<00:02:17.880> want<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> make<00:02:18.300> sure<00:02:18.330> all<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.750> pictures

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
you want to make sure all the pictures

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.540 
you want to make sure all the pictures
everything's<00:02:19.440> are<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.740> there<00:02:19.920> first<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.400> know

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
everything's are in there first you know

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.130 
everything's are in there first you know
you<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.910> pretty<00:02:21.000> much<00:02:21.120> see<00:02:21.240> if<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> thumbnail

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
you can pretty much see if the thumbnail

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.960 
you can pretty much see if the thumbnail
there's<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> picture<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.860> thumbnail<00:02:23.250> then

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
there's a picture on the thumbnail then

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.760 
there's a picture on the thumbnail then
it's<00:02:24.120> pretty<00:02:24.300> much<00:02:24.420> good<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.660> go<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:25.020> if<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
it's pretty much good to go but if the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.680 
it's pretty much good to go but if the
thumbnail<00:02:26.130> progressive<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.210> music<00:02:27.480> file
