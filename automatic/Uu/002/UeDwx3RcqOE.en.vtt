00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.100
 Well 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.079
 hello everyone and welcome back on the channel well 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.390
 today as you know we talk about iphone 5 c 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.609
 and 5 s I did somersaults for 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.590
 bring you this video so fast 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.559
 I had to connect to connections 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.329
 even faster than the 10 megabits 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.550
 absolutely upload 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.949
 fast and make a very fast rendering 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.809
 so if you excuse me if you find any 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.309
 small video editing error 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.350
 I did all this in one speed 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.809
 absurd from 7 am I am working on 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.370
 tankan fears tirelessly and i'm 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.250
 really working for you though 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.570
 during the speech I will commit myself to some 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.690
 once you have some good with 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.300
 me because I'm talking without being 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.440
 read something i'm simply 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.880
 watching the news and explaining to you 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.830
 what they are saying in the keynote 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.450
 mainly ios 7 was talked about with 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.119
 all the news that this system 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.810
 operational has imported the new one 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.390
 interface 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.450
 the new radio itunes will be 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.880
 introduced in any iphone 4 all 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.000
 up and then with all the news that 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.590
 ios 7 brought and philly did 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.599
 this to prepare us for the real news 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.789
 that news would arrive unfortunately 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:37.550
 but they disappointed a little because of her 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.890
 we all knew the iphone 5 was 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.080
 presented and was the same shown in 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.550
 the same plastic noise that they don't 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.310
 they call it plastic but they do as they do 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.520
 samsung call it polycarbonate which it is 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.220
 mainly an iphone 5 with a cover 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.979
 in plastic and will be offered at a price 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.039
 of about 370 it is not known yet in Italy 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.849
 they only showed two contracts of 29 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.060
 euros per month 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:03.830
 so this will be the iPhone 5 c 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.869
 here you will see some screens that you 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.410
 they go on we will have the same chip too 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.709
 of the iPhone 5 of the iPhone 5 which will be one 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.720
 at 6 but will be redesigned we would have 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.640
 however the same chip put in place for 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.989
 this new generation we will have the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.190
 same 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.590
 eyesight a front camera from hd 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.470
 to do facetime and we'll also have 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.240
 facetime audio which is the possibility of 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.460
 call via facetime only via 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.830
 audio we will have lte 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.810
 also on this other smartphone that 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.000
 allows more than 100 megabits in download 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.120
 from what appears from the keynote maybe yes 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.220
 will reach 150 megabits per download 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.990
 we will have the 802.11 wifi abgne the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.060
 bluetooth 4.0 we will also have a cover 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.220
 shabby that apple introduced us to that 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.110
 unfortunately it will cost 29 euros 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.400
 it will be a terribly ugly cover 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.140
 unfortunately this cover will really be 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.240
 ugly because it looks a little like custody 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.740
 in my opinion meliconi but never mind 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.840
 are comments 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.819
 it will cost the beauty of $ 29 then 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.740
 an exaggerated stuff after having 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.290
 shown some video in which people 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.380
 he was holding the iPhone 5c and yes 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.630
 showed good thanks to the iphone 5 c no 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.000
 ok, closed parenthesis was shown 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.340
 the iphone 5 if even here one 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.890
 desperation as we already had 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.420
 We knew everything we already know all there 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.700
 I will be the black iPhone the white iPhone and 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.430
 the gold iPhone and the design will be the same 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.670
 of the iPhone 5 s of the iPhone 5 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.370
 if not for the button that will be the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.110
 home button completely according to them 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.870
 completely but it is mainly 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.580
 redesigned the home button and not me 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.230
 like because I liked provides for the 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.060
 home button that keys that 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.550
 that square label it showed 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.410
 on the key here there is no more in this one 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.300
 new version of the home button 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.480
 the main novelty, however, of the iPhone 5 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.819
 s in the iphone 5 cover indeed 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.500
 will have a new chip called 7 and is the 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:10.190
 first 64-bit chip on a smartphone 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.569
 therefore ios ios 7 will run on platform a 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.750
 64 bit 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.090
 the processor to not leave you too many 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.519
 specifications will have more than one billion 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.170
 transistor and will have a size of 102 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.110
 mm 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:28.840
 in the die the cpu performances 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.460
 should be more than 56 times more 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.700
 fast of the old woman of the old 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.920
 generation then apparently 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.810
 we should have a big increase 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.910
 in fact, there has also been in the video 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.660
 shown how this device does 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.490
 will involve with infinity blades etc. 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.220
 obviously you will see a lot of others here 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.660
 screen with other news and so on 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.090
 also talked about camera in this 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.120
 keynote and we will have practically one 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.760
 camera completely redesigned the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.160
 camera will have a brand new optics e 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.920
 the first will have excellent functions 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.260
 function that will be the main one in this 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.110
 device is that it will have a sensor more 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.450
 15 percent off will always have 6 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.610
 slow and will have an opening that can 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.100
 get up to 2.2 then for effects 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.990
 of depth of field who can who 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.970
 he knows of photography he knows what I am 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.200
 speaking 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.640
 the sector should also have one 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.840
 back interior lighting for 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.610
 allow to shoot also in 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.430
 I die a little and will have one 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.170
 burst mode which is printing between 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.560
 will make a lower quality photo but 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.030
 will allow you to take 10 photos per second 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.310
 but the most important news is the 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.580
 possibility to make snow motion movies 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.410
 at 120fps and you will say but it will be one 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.080
 360 p quality 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.670
 no the quality will be a little like 720p 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.560
 what every hour 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.430
 on the iPhone 4 sin that my videos 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.430
 I'm at 30 fps 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:00.470
 the staff also showed all of them 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.550
 photographs of our device 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.910
 device will also allow you to 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.170
 take photographs at 28 megapixels in 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.170
 panorama mode 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.060
 you will be asked why the home button 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.920
 It has been changed 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.710
 simple because in the home button there is a 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.240
 then fingerprint sensor 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.550
 we will be able to block our device 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.500
 no longer with the code but with the imprint 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.180
 digital and this year also convenient for 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.220
 example to make purchases on 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.570
 itunes where it will no longer be necessary to 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.810
 password but it will be enough to the imprint 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.810
 digital 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.090
