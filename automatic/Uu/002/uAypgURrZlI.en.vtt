00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.949
 everyone who wants to try the game back in July 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.949
 but we decided to meet ourselves and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.310
 introduce you to the Russian version 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.300

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.940
 america gringo yes yes geography play no 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.469
 really changed in the last part of all 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.170
 spun around mexican 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.480
 president and this time around 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.250
 our smaller slavic brothers 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.250
 orcs who at the time they were in as in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.399
 it is more decent to say about love 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.940
 somewhere 3 wide nuclear warheads 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.559
 returns that surfaced safely 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.559
 at the other end of the globe 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 mexican aborigines are going 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.600
 fasten what start stops 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.670
 then to greet neighbors 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.640
 the planet is exclusively a word which 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.939
 begins with the letter f and ends with 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.799
 and brief international advocates 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.820
 united states democracy 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.700
 you know what 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.799
 For some reason, offended and sent to Mexico 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.259
 ambulance brigade for which we and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.810
 play all soldiers good luck at once 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.490
 I warn you here on the break will not work 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.630
 Nothing should be seen 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 official trailer 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.280
 if there is no smack in our site and now 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.930
 imagine but the gastric one is yours 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.560
 such a hurricane that will sweep away with 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.210
 and when the partner is not so in the first place in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.049
 trailer used gameplay with 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.040
 playstation 3 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.190
 and there the game looks completely and 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.710
 I saw I know secondly for help 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.260
 the main character, you are given companions who 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.780
 only they can do without help 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.240
 courage to insist on chewing on one place 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.800
 snot and shifting from foot to foot and 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.649
 But if you give them an order by the way the order 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.360
 only 8 move to attack 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.370
 cover scout well all falconers 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.230
 the order can be given to the whole group 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.540
 each fighters separately 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.030
 you can map the route of the group on 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.120
 tactical map and you can give 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.660
 tips for fighters right on the battlefield 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.300
 in the morning, after all, her military whom you be 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.300
 mate snipers 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.550
 machine gunners sappers you decide on 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.690
 your own conscience remains and the choice of weapons 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.070
 but my advice to you 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.820
 use the option settings by 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.280
 default 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.560
 because computer unlike 1 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.850
 knows in advance what to switch with you 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.250
 that of course the technique is great 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.680
 assistant in the difficult task of reconnaissance in force 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.610
 will become an iron carriage strongly 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.100
 looking like a bleached moon rover on board 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.170
 lunar rover has weapons and video cameras 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.290
 moreover, the trunks can be changed directly along the way 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.390
 combat so that a gamer is required only 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.630
 press the r button and sit and 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.570
 there is a flying assistant but 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.100
 already unarmed but in all its glory 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.440
 broadcasts the location of opponents and 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.380
 great makes life easier 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.760
 weapons in the game in bulk from grenades but 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.020
 grenade launchers here are just not squally 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.670
 Fire not the hordes of foes there will be no 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.800
 typically a small bump on the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.610
 Covers the gun 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.920
 small such tank which at first 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.489
 we undermine from the grenade launcher and only then 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.469
 we are engaged in those who survived 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.569
 by the way live to stay pretty 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.969
 tricky for the next world can 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.650
 go from one bullet and not 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:04:00.750
 take on football because of the gameplay game 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.079
 gets a solid seven and a half points 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.389
 For graphics, another seven for sound 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.299
 eight and a half either sound a year like 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.209
 he worked perfectly 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.819
 8 for the design of a decent decent menu 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.579
 tactical map and seven for 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.979
 management according to our catchy 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.270
 the algorithm has a total score of seven 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.009
 a half point is not a masterpiece from lovers 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.470
 pregnant on on codes and firing due 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.240
 corner surely enjoy the rest 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.690
 let our reviews be waiting for the next one 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.690
 week she promises to be more productive
