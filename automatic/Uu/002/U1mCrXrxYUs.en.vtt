00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.030

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.620

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.070
 and no more than one music festival you have not 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.439
 lived instead of lying 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.599
 you can listen to incredible music like 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.699
 with julian casablancas and that one who played 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.619
 the one of escrow throw you a trip with 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.730
 flying lotus rapping with tyler the 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.800
 creator was listening led with him 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.630
 after dinner I different everything 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.850
 need we were looking for a man that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.400
 had to see how to celebrate with 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.199
 celebrate with a good time and we wanted 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.500
 be a ceremony around music 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.050
 what we were looking for was to celebrate music 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.210
 celebrate the people that really 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.879
 expands the music and who likes to know 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.870
 new musical trends of that is 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.870
 try to be a bit 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.449
 with touching thousands of people to 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.729
 exploitation expect to overcome what has been done 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.410
 a year ago and with this become one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.240
 music festivals more 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.240
 importance and greater call 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.940
 hunger no longer looks for that is wrong 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 all right 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.380
 better pictures like this one on which 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.380
 It has become fashionable 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.939
 and to apply it 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.820
 when the hand 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.640
 I do not know I like the sense of anonymity 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.140
 because of the fact that the music is good 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.360
 It changes every time it changes a lot then 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.399
 I like that they do not face a 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.289
 sound the difference is that this time it was 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.220
 the first time I play an event of 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.230
 this magnitude like projecting a little bit 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.060
 Fashion 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.060
 take more than it gives 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.500
 come to a music festival because it 's 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.179
 amazing it's amazing to come see things 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.920
 that you like or discover new things 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.920
