 so that you do not run out of follow her 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.440
 two tips if the enemies do not have any

 balls drop your ammo 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.270
 packages have a cooldown or you 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.279
 in a situation since then by adversaries 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.890
 printed ammunition just do not open 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.630
 can read about special ammunition one 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.429
 any weapon in your secondary 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.660
 Weapons slot is refilling 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.360
 as follows 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.100
 once the magazine special weapon one 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.870
 sniper rifle or rifle 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.550
 a fusion rifle completely empty 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.800
 shot that costs a special one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.540
 weapon with munitions regeneration 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.820
 these weapons for your magazines 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.820
 a little ball for ball on again 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.800
 to see bm example with the icebreaker 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.329
 is the magath team feeling 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.399
 piece by piece again as soon as the ammunition in 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.230
 icebreaker for charged is changing 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.760
 then again more expensive previous weapon too 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
 As you can see, she has returned 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.690
 Ammunition in this case, I can therefore in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.519
 batteries hurt my sniper rifle 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.170
 it with the ammunition regeneration of the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.030
 icebreaker must also combine 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.070
 quite practical compared to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.450
 maximum possible reserves ammunition is 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.100
 a little bit through the weapons change 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.909
 lost but the ammunition brings through 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.140
 first back to business 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.360
 Ammunition regeneration works 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.649
 currently with the sniper rifle 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.080
 icebreakers and the shotgun 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.310
 grieving corn crusher belongs to the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.840
 ammunition regeneration to 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.340
 basic equipment for lubrication 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.470
 she must first by upgrades 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.179
 unlock another tip as well 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.429
 works for primary ammunition and 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.920
 sometimes even heavy ammunition stops 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.899
 is this chips magazine euro heavy 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.300
 weapons special weapons and primary weapons 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.979
 completely empty then would have a little 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.009
 distance to the opponents and wait for one 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.009
 moment 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.979
 supplies and then if you had luck 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.439
 you destiny generously with munitions 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.299
 This is even one of the packages of an example 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.790
 dusk strike the fall of 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.860
 usually the ammunition rather limited 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.689
 this method is not reliable 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.700
 and I can only conclude urgently 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.950
 recommend for many cases always 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.430
 enough munitions packages to 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.810
 to have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.120
 I hope that these tips help you 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.620
 wish you a good hunt and say 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.620
 bye and maybach
