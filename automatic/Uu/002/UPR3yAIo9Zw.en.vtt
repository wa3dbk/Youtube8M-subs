00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.930
 show and preliminary good day 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.740
 gentlemen showing preliminary work 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:20.250
 this transformer 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:24.660
 like this formatter means he's here 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:34.739
 power control on input 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:40.100
 at the output of the starting capacitor 200 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:46.520
 Atlanta transformer we have from from wadded 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:51.860
 power 500 watt factory now here 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:57.590
 comet exit metro exit 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:04.340
 ammeter inlet voltmeter inlet 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.340
 and we still have forgotten here 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.930
 chastotnik straight frequency converter 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 turn on 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.950
 so look at the devices 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:44.580
 chastotnika turned on again 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:48.000
 the fact that chastotnik 150 cotton on 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.470
 dear money was not enough and it is therefore not 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.590
 pulls load transformations 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.550
 at the same time we are looking at the devices 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.550
 the lamp is on 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.599
 again hung on again turn on 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.760
 we can even play a little 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.760
 adjustment 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.890
 u workout a little corrected 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:02.880
 high does not turn off 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.860
 now we will turn it on and still 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.860
 adjusting play 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.420
 at the entrance we have 10 volts 2 amps on 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.040
 exit 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.040
 up to 200 volts 1 amp 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:48.959
 so far so here so long 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:56.189
 Well, tomorrow I have it today 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:59.069
 I will adjust the problem only with 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.980
 the frequency converter has changed 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:07.540
 maybe I can take time 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:12.549
 more powerful expensive and not very people 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:15.310
 for me dear all the best of luck 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:22.660
 all he was once again showing how it is 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:27.610
 It looks like a power regulator one on 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:30.460
 code on the primary here after the secondary 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.680
 there is another power regulator then 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.630
 Conder comes, then load 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.910
 goodbye 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.910
 until next time good luck to you than
