00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
on here and give you some too I just

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.390 
on here and give you some too I just
installing<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:16.140> voltmeter<00:02:17.140> I'll<00:02:18.010> help<00:02:18.190> me

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
installing this voltmeter I'll help me

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.350 
installing this voltmeter I'll help me
it's<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.420> low<00:02:19.750> voltage<00:02:19.959> DC<00:02:20.470> 12-volt<00:02:21.160> dimmer<00:02:21.640> so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
it's a low voltage DC 12-volt dimmer so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.710 
it's a low voltage DC 12-volt dimmer so
I<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.599> dim<00:02:22.900> these<00:02:23.110> incandescent<00:02:23.590> lights

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
I can dim these incandescent lights

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.580 
I can dim these incandescent lights
before<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.930> would<00:02:26.020> mean<00:02:26.200> I'm<00:02:26.319> just<00:02:26.440> going<00:02:26.560> to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
before it would mean I'm just going to

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.200 
before it would mean I'm just going to
put<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.770> diode<00:02:27.010> between<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.849> switches<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:28.480> that

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
put a diode between the switches so that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.350 
put a diode between the switches so that
so<00:02:30.330> get<00:02:30.570> out<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.870> switch<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> light<00:02:31.350> on<00:02:32.360> it's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
so get out and switch on a light on it's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:50.180 
so get out and switch on a light on it's
a<00:02:33.450> little<00:02:33.690> bugger<00:02:34.050> here<00:02:34.410> but<00:02:34.590> gotta<00:02:35.130> be<00:02:35.280> done

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.240 

they're<00:02:50.850> putting<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.210> this<00:02:51.360> funky<00:02:52.080> line<00:02:52.350> a

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.420 

glue<00:02:56.250> into<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.700> wall<00:02:57.830> sure<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.040> ear<00:02:59.220> bones

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
glue into the wall sure the ear bones

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.950 
glue into the wall sure the ear bones
are<00:02:59.670> out<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:04.940> okay<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.180> put<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.540> second

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
are out it's okay just put the second

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
are out it's okay just put the second
piece<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:08.040> lie<00:03:08.220> now<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:09.590> goes<00:03:10.590> all<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.800> way

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
piece of lie now in goes all the way

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.460 
piece of lie now in goes all the way
down<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.190> about<00:03:11.460> here<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.090> then<00:03:13.050> I've<00:03:13.170> stopped

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
down to about here and then I've stopped

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.350 
down to about here and then I've stopped
the<00:03:13.560> glue<00:03:13.740> there<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.520> once<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.820> glues<00:03:15.060> drive<00:03:15.330> I

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
the glue there so once the glues drive I

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.060 
the glue there so once the glues drive I
can<00:03:15.600> lift<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.900> back<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.530> put<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.770> bead<00:03:17.040> of

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
can lift that back and put a bead of

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.790 
can lift that back and put a bead of
silicon<00:03:17.580> on<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.270> back<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:19.590> water

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
silicon on the back of that so if water

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.340 
silicon on the back of that so if water
does<00:03:20.010> splash<00:03:20.370> up<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.670> go<00:03:20.790> up<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.900> can't<00:03:22.170> go<00:03:22.320> any

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
does splash up and go up it can't go any

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.520 
does splash up and go up it can't go any
further<00:03:22.650> past<00:03:22.950> there<00:03:24.140> but<00:03:25.140> we'll<00:03:25.290> do<00:03:25.410> that

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
further past there but we'll do that

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.480 
further past there but we'll do that
when<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:25.770> glue<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.280> dry<00:03:27.170> hello<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.370> the
