00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.289 

we<00:00:06.350> have<00:00:06.500> some<00:00:07.160> new<00:00:07.190> features<00:00:07.550> for<00:00:07.970> the<00:00:08.059> micro

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:08.299 
we have some new features for the micro

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.879 
we have some new features for the micro
copter<00:00:08.630> and<00:00:10.330> I'm<00:00:11.330> possible<00:00:11.900> to<00:00:12.379> stall

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
copter and I'm possible to stall

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.299 
copter and I'm possible to stall
positions<00:00:13.459> and<00:00:14.530> call<00:00:15.530> the<00:00:15.680> positions<00:00:16.070> by<00:00:16.250> the

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
positions and call the positions by the

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.450 
positions and call the positions by the
transmitter<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.440> I<00:00:18.440> can<00:00:18.619> fly<00:00:18.830> between<00:00:19.070> these

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
transmitter and I can fly between these

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.060 
transmitter and I can fly between these
different<00:00:19.900> positions<00:00:20.900> with<00:00:21.560> different

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
different positions with different

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.359 
different positions with different
speeds<00:00:22.400> this<00:00:23.269> could<00:00:23.480> be<00:00:23.509> used<00:00:23.839> for<00:00:24.070> for<00:00:25.070> making

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
speeds this could be used for for making

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.029 
speeds this could be used for for making
videos<00:00:25.759> where<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:26.539> have<00:00:26.689> to<00:00:26.929> repeat<00:00:27.349> the<00:00:27.800> same

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
videos where you have to repeat the same

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.530 
videos where you have to repeat the same
scene<00:00:28.839> again<00:00:29.839> and<00:00:30.050> again<00:00:31.029> okay<00:00:32.029> so<00:00:32.090> I'm<00:00:32.360> going

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
scene again and again okay so I'm going

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:52.630 
scene again and again okay so I'm going
to<00:00:32.599> show<00:00:32.840> this

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.720 

I<00:00:52.760> park<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:53.570> position<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:54.460> now<00:00:55.460> i'm<00:00:55.579> going

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
I park this position and now i'm going

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.210 
I park this position and now i'm going
to<00:00:55.820> store<00:00:56.180> this<00:00:56.360> position<00:00:56.809> i<00:00:57.050> have<00:00:57.920> a<00:00:57.950> menu

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
to store this position i have a menu

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.990 
to store this position i have a menu
item<00:00:59.170> it's<00:01:00.170> called<00:01:00.530> store<00:01:00.920> single<00:01:01.340> position<00:01:01.610> i

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
item it's called store single position i

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.329 
item it's called store single position i
have<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.390> attitude<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:03.260> end<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.010> direction

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
have the attitude that end the direction

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.230 
have the attitude that end the direction
and<00:01:04.840> some<00:01:05.840> other<00:01:05.990> parameters<00:01:06.760> so<00:01:07.760> i'm<00:01:08.000> storing

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
and some other parameters so i'm storing

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.340 
and some other parameters so i'm storing
it<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.900> position<00:01:09.380> number<00:01:09.410> one<00:01:10.990> now<00:01:11.990> i'm<00:01:12.110> flying

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
it to position number one now i'm flying

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.550 
it to position number one now i'm flying
to<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.530> second<00:01:13.040> position

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.399 

and<00:01:21.070> I'm<00:01:21.189> going<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.460> store<00:01:21.790> it<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.960> position

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
and I'm going to store it for position

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.380 
and I'm going to store it for position
number<00:01:23.500> two<00:01:26.220> after<00:01:27.220> that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.899 

I<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:31.200> call<00:01:31.530> these<00:01:31.740> positions<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.580> I'm<00:01:32.760> not

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
I can call these positions so I'm not

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.610 
I can call these positions so I'm not
now<00:01:33.120> i'm<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> fly<00:01:34.080> back<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
now i'm going to fly back to the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.360 
now i'm going to fly back to the
position<00:01:34.770> number<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:36.409> brand<00:01:37.409> new<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.130> i

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
position number one brand new is that i

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.320 
position number one brand new is that i
can<00:01:38.640> set<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.119> speed<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.979> potentiometer

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
can set the speed on this potentiometer

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.380 
can set the speed on this potentiometer
so<00:01:42.330> i'm<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.690> load<00:01:42.900> it<00:01:43.050> I<00:01:44.000> have<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.150> switch

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
so i'm going to load it I have to switch

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.170 
so i'm going to load it I have to switch
on<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.840> coming<00:01:46.260> home<00:01:46.410> feature<00:01:46.650> now<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:48.030> it's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
on the coming home feature now now it's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.859 
on the coming home feature now now it's
in<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.420> Waypoint<00:01:48.810> feature<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.650> now<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.940> can

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
in the Waypoint feature and now I can

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:02.950 
in the Waypoint feature and now I can
slowly<00:01:52.320> increase<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.369> speed

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.219 

so<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.560> can<00:02:03.860> do<00:02:04.010> very<00:02:04.640> slow<00:02:05.110> camera<00:02:06.110> movements

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
so I can do very slow camera movements

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.600 
so I can do very slow camera movements
I'm<00:02:09.229> trying<00:02:09.590> if<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.069> can<00:02:10.250> get<00:02:10.550> even<00:02:10.789> slower

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
I'm trying if I can get even slower

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:24.059 
I'm trying if I can get even slower
going<00:02:13.610> back<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.660> number<00:02:15.110> two

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.649 

have<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> very<00:02:24.969> slow<00:02:25.950> speed<00:02:26.950> now<00:02:27.219> I<00:02:27.659> can

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
have a very slow speed now I can

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.720 
have a very slow speed now I can
increase<00:02:29.109> the<00:02:29.139> speed<00:02:29.560> during<00:02:30.219> the<00:02:30.489> flight

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
increase the speed during the flight

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:42.880 
increase the speed during the flight
also<00:02:30.939> for<00:02:31.329> that<00:02:31.510> no<00:02:31.719> problem

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:51.790 

and<00:02:43.890> back<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.310> number<00:02:44.459> one

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.809 

going<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.610> increase<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:53.270> a<00:02:53.300> little<00:02:53.450> bit

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.099 

now<00:03:00.390> we<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.659> we<00:03:01.170> can<00:03:01.319> make<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.920> quite<00:03:02.549> fast

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
now we have we can make a quite fast

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:19.380 
now we have we can make a quite fast
flight

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.340 

of<00:03:19.900> course<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.290> can<00:03:20.470> store<00:03:20.770> more<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:22.350> two-way

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
of course I can store more of two-way

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:32.520 
of course I can store more of two-way
puns<00:03:24.240> maybe<00:03:25.240> I<00:03:25.330> can<00:03:25.660> store<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.140> third<00:03:26.709> one

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.610 

I<00:03:32.590> call<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.459> number<00:03:33.760> three

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
I call it number three

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.170 
I call it number three
I'm<00:03:36.159> going<00:03:36.580> back<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:37.530> number<00:03:38.530> one

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.760 

slow<00:03:42.810> speed

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:58.200 

of<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:48.250> new<00:03:48.400> too<00:03:48.580> slow

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.790 

I<00:03:58.300> can<00:03:59.020> select<00:03:59.200> if<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.100> go<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.370> point<00:04:01.330> number

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
I can select if I go to point number

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.440 
I can select if I go to point number
number<00:04:02.800> two<00:04:03.070> or<00:04:03.310> number<00:04:03.370> three<00:04:03.550> I<00:04:03.970> can<00:04:04.300> go

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
number two or number three I can go

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:24.180 
number two or number three I can go
directly<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.110> number<00:04:05.350> three<00:04:05.560> now

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:37.570 

ok

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.760 

that's<00:04:38.580> it
