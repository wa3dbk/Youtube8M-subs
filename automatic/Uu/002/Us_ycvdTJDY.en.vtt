00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.980 

okay<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:01.860> decided<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.550> make<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> video<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.480> me

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
okay I decided to make a video of me

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.990 
okay I decided to make a video of me
making<00:00:04.970> that's<00:00:05.970> like<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.210> Fender<00:00:06.779> preamp<00:00:08.000> it's

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
making that's like a Fender preamp it's

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.580 
making that's like a Fender preamp it's
just<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.210> 5<00:00:09.480> watt<00:00:09.719> power<00:00:10.290> amp<00:00:11.269> all<00:00:12.269> tube<00:00:13.429> and<00:00:14.429> I

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
just a 5 watt power amp all tube and I

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.429 
just a 5 watt power amp all tube and I
don't<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> shear<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.670> gotta<00:00:17.850> cut<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
don't have a shear so I gotta cut the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.269 
don't have a shear so I gotta cut the
case<00:00:19.439> or<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> chassis<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.439> saw<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.039> I

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
case or the chassis with a saw and I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.609 
case or the chassis with a saw and I
gotta<00:00:23.430> bend<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> vise<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> far<00:00:25.500> I've

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
gotta bend it on the vise so far I've

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.060 
gotta bend it on the vise so far I've
got<00:00:25.650> two<00:00:25.949> bins<00:00:26.189> done<00:00:27.769> turning<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:28.890> pretty

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
got two bins done turning out pretty

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.609 
got two bins done turning out pretty
good<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.310> far

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
good so far

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.700 
good so far
and<00:00:31.640> that's<00:00:32.640> about<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.380> well<00:00:34.380> there's<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
and that's about it well there's the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.790 
and that's about it well there's the
case<00:00:35.870> after<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> got<00:00:37.050> done<00:00:37.290> cutting<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.770> down

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
case after I got done cutting it down

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.490 
case after I got done cutting it down
bending<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.550> grinding<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.320> turned<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.410> pretty

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
bending it grinding it turned out pretty

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:52.130 
bending it grinding it turned out pretty
good<00:00:41.510> it's<00:00:42.510> pretty<00:00:42.719> smooth<00:00:49.910> anyways<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:52.110> know

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
good it's pretty smooth anyways you know

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
good it's pretty smooth anyways you know
on<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> next<00:00:52.739> step<00:00:52.949> okay<00:00:53.699> here's<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
on to the next step okay here's the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.900 
on to the next step okay here's the
chassis<00:00:54.660> after<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.340> got<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> holes<00:00:56.699> drilled

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
chassis after I got the holes drilled

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.520 
chassis after I got the holes drilled
out<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.539> everything

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830 

now<00:01:02.040> it's<00:01:02.220> time<00:01:02.400> to<00:01:02.580> paint<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.420> mount

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
now it's time to paint it and then mount

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.100 
now it's time to paint it and then mount
the<00:01:04.880> transformers<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.210> circuit<00:01:06.600> board<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the transformers and circuit board and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:16.190 
the transformers and circuit board and
pots<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.010> everything<00:01:08.040> else<00:01:14.420> okay<00:01:15.450> paying<00:01:16.050> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
pots and everything else okay paying the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:27.490 
pots and everything else okay paying the
case<00:01:17.120> I'll<00:01:18.120> let<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.390> sucka<00:01:18.600> dry

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.610 

everything<00:01:28.500> started<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:30.050> it's<00:01:31.050> time<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.410> check

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
everything started in it's time to check

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.290 
everything started in it's time to check
the<00:01:31.680> voltage<00:01:33.350> before<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.410> put<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> tubes<00:01:34.890> in

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
the voltage before you put the tubes in

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.370 
the voltage before you put the tubes in
show<00:01:36.300> your<00:01:36.450> voltage<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.810> right<00:01:39.200> here's<00:01:40.200> what

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
show your voltage is right here's what

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:53.060 
show your voltage is right here's what
it<00:01:40.440> looks<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:51.020> let's<00:01:52.020> check<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.560> voltage

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it looks like let's check the voltage

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.060 
it looks like let's check the voltage
okay<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> few<00:01:53.850> things<00:01:54.120> get<00:01:54.390> remember<00:01:54.980> you<00:01:55.980> know

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
okay a few things get remember you know

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.060 
okay a few things get remember you know
there's<00:01:56.220> extremely<00:01:57.030> high<00:01:57.150> voltage<00:01:57.510> in<00:01:57.690> here

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
there's extremely high voltage in here

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.740 
there's extremely high voltage in here
some<00:01:59.070> amps<00:02:00.060> go<00:02:00.540> five<00:02:00.870> six<00:02:01.320> hundred<00:02:01.440> volts<00:02:02.750> this

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
some amps go five six hundred volts this

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.500 
some amps go five six hundred volts this
one's<00:02:03.960> about<00:02:04.080> three<00:02:04.410> hundred<00:02:05.210> let's<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.390> we

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
one's about three hundred let's see we

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.600 
one's about three hundred let's see we
got<00:02:06.660> here

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
got here

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.750 
got here
turn<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> power<00:02:10.730> pilot<00:02:11.730> lights<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:13.580> check<00:02:14.580> out

turn the power pilot lights on check out
a<00:02:14.790> six<00:02:15.480> volt<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.920> our<00:02:17.040> heater<00:02:17.280> wires

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.130 

that's<00:02:26.319> prawn<00:02:26.560> do<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:26.800> see<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.190> might<00:02:27.340> help

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
that's prawn do you see that might help

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.550 
that's prawn do you see that might help
we've<00:02:29.140> got<00:02:29.290> seven<00:02:29.650> volts<00:02:31.170> about<00:02:32.170> three<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.530> a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
we've got seven volts about three and a

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.430 
we've got seven volts about three and a
half<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.769> ground<00:02:33.040> voltage<00:02:33.819> always<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.440> drop

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
half to ground voltage always a drop

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.720 
half to ground voltage always a drop
soon<00:02:35.739> as<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.890> put<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.129> tubes<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.580> and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
soon as you put the tubes in and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.199 
soon as you put the tubes in and
everything<00:02:39.870> green<00:02:40.870> or<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.879> six<00:02:42.879> volt

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
everything green or the six volt

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.420 
everything green or the six volt
here's<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.510> high<00:02:43.629> voltage<00:02:43.989> right<00:02:44.200> here<00:02:44.430> go

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
here's the high voltage right here go

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.140 
here's the high voltage right here go
through<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.700> diodes<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.330> rectifies<00:02:47.019> it<00:02:47.200> DC

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:01.710 

so<00:02:52.150> we've<00:02:52.299> got<00:02:53.580> 435<00:02:56.400> 208<00:02:57.400> mmm<00:02:58.410> 218<00:03:00.299> good

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
so we've got 435 208 mmm 218 good

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.000 
so we've got 435 208 mmm 218 good
check<00:03:02.319> our<00:03:02.470> B+<00:03:02.860> voltages<00:03:04.500> yeah<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:05.620> check<00:03:05.890> with

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
check our B+ voltages yeah we check with

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.440 
check our B+ voltages yeah we check with
the<00:03:06.130> tubes<00:03:06.370> out<00:03:06.519> first<00:03:06.849> case<00:03:07.239> there's

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
the tubes out first case there's

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.789 
the tubes out first case there's
something<00:03:07.690> wrong<00:03:12.959> let's<00:03:13.959> rectify<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:14.680> now

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
something wrong let's rectify it so now

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:30.599 
something wrong let's rectify it so now
we<00:03:14.829> got<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.069> go<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.250> DC<00:03:17.160> go<00:03:18.160> for<00:03:28.079> 303<00:03:29.430> now<00:03:30.430> if<00:03:30.489> you

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
we got to go to DC go for 303 now if you

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.410 
we got to go to DC go for 303 now if you
put<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.850> tubes<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.269> voltage<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.750> gonna<00:03:31.900> drop

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
put the tubes in voltage is gonna drop

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.680 
put the tubes in voltage is gonna drop
okay

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
okay

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.270 
okay
I've<00:03:35.079> checked<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> voltages<00:03:35.859> at<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.069> tubes

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
I've checked the voltages at the tubes

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.599 
I've checked the voltages at the tubes
and<00:03:36.549> everything's<00:03:36.880> fine<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:39.069> never<00:03:39.310> turned

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
and everything's fine you never turned
