00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.670
 what a wave people are welcome to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:14.429
 another video here on my channel and the day of 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.260
 today I have a book hall 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.930
 again this month I bought it in many 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.960
 books but I still want to teach them 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.730
 it's like a tradition I see that I want 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.890
 do with you notice that it helps 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.420
 make the insurgent review but I 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.340
 I prefer to wait to go see the movie 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.199
 and make a book to the movie for 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 be able to encompass both things and not 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.430
 make many videos about insurgent 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.520
 but I could not go see it I think 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.610
 that until next week and may 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.090
 see it so let's start normal person 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.980
 from benito taibo this book had many 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.680
 I want to read it I have seen many reviews 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.449
 from him I've seen a lot of benito taibo and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.039
 they say it's a very nice book 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.199
 so yes I think I 'm the only one 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.649
 missing in reading this looked much more 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.650
 great in videos and photos and it's a little thing 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.500
 It's a very nice thing 4 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.600
 but in carburizing it is a prequel to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.600
 divergent but it is the story of 4 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.120
 x4 that is, if you already read loyal and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.510
 everyone will know because I'm afraid to read 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.210
 this and feeling very sad address 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.930
 artistic study notebooks 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.090
 cinematographic of the cuec unam este me 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.640
 I bought it now that I went to the festival of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.190
 cinema in Guadalajara and it's a story 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.960
 little funny because it turns out that my 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.090
 boyfriend told me sad purchase because it 's from 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.920
 artistic direction because the two 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.500
 we stupidly think that direction 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.900
 artistic and barbarity direction of 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.479
 actors and it's something we do not know how to do 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.580
 So I said yes to them, I said 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.890
 artistic direction is not like address 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.110
 of art but I had already bought it and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.720
 Then I read the back and after that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.290
 I opened and said no if the over address of 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.119
 art then it is the wrong book 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.360
 but well, it's nice to know 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.570
 of art not that of art direction and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.060
 finally and that's why we broke from l'angel 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.970
 I did not buy this handler 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 they lent me renny the rain and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.880
 chats follow on twitter 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.020
 she told me she did not like that I 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.640
 Done or finished it 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.510
 and the truth is that I already started to read 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.910
 it's very little I'm not liking or 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.180
 be just what it is to read like that because 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.040
 here you know I have not finished me 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.410
 they're going to kill when the ten are still not 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.140
 I have finished dreams of gods and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.680
 monsters 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.330
 is that they operated on me I could not read and there 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.040
 it had become too heavy to read this 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.650
 real book had never happened to me 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.319
 it had never happened to me and it is terrible or 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.940
 I'm liking it but today the point 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.120
 that I started browsing this looks and 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.670
 read and it has not caught me much I do not mean 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.160
 little bit but 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.770
 I do not know I do not like it as it is 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.840
 written 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.200
 I thought I was going to like it because it deals 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.660
 of something interesting but I think I do not 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.320
 will like it and well that's all people 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.140
 I see them next Tuesday with my 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.900
 book the insurgent film and already the 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.900
 I love a lot is to see me from youtube
