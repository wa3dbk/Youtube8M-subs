so I'm gonna pop that in the pan now you
can<00:01:24.930> see<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> heat<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:26.220> straight<00:01:26.610> away

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
can see the heat is that straight away

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
can see the heat is that straight away
Susu<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.680> quick<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.760> use<00:01:29.910> them<00:01:30.060> rapeseed

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
Susu so so quick so we use them rapeseed

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.969 
Susu so so quick so we use them rapeseed
oil<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.050> just<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.410> give<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.830> bit

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
oil in this just to give it a little bit

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.920 
oil in this just to give it a little bit
of<00:01:32.040> nuttiness<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> fish<00:01:32.910> it<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.570> seems

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
flavor we've just got some water on the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
flavor we've just got some water on the
heat<00:01:37.350> at<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> moment<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:38.700> almost<00:01:38.970> coming<00:01:39.300> up

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
heat at the moment it's almost coming up

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.820 
heat at the moment it's almost coming up
to<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> ball<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.869> very<00:01:40.080> very<00:01:40.290> quick<00:01:40.530> again

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
to the ball it's very very quick again

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.890 
to the ball it's very very quick again
for<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> induction<00:01:41.759> we've<00:01:42.420> got<00:01:42.509> some<00:01:42.660> amazing

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
for the induction we've got some amazing

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.980 
for the induction we've got some amazing
