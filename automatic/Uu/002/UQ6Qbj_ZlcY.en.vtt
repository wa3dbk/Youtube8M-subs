00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 but they had not and this is a new video 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.770
 for your YouTube channel that is like 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.940
 do an origami boomerang like this 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.940
 the next video 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.000
 those who are harder we start we are 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.600
 with a leaf yes 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.390
 for the mass if in the whole leaf the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.760
 others in half and the lamas comes the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 militancy backwards and so on until 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.570
 this is well marked and we can 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.099
 cut and we will have something else or 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.700
 less and can use scissors to cut 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.700
 half 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.680
 This is not here, I have it folded 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.820
 we will be left if it is in the middle and so 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.210
 we will have a line here in the middle 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.190
 if it looks true that this way in the middle this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.680
 line here will be left then 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.180
 these these edges that are here towards 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.180
 half to the line 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.430
 we fold in half like this and then 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 we grab this comes this way corner with the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.000
 corner and bend 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.800
 so the rostrum then we do Sunday 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.660
 but back 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.670
 As I told you, you have to grab well to 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.000
 that this is not going to be towards a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.000
 side like this 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.479
 then we open 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.840
 that's what it is then we flipped it 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.840
 over here 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.009
 these puttings tracing here we are going to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.140
 put here this is what I do not know where to 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.140
 we put in this 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:46.030
 and with the other side we still mark well 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.410
 if I go a little fast because I'm just 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.410
 the time but they can return well 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.490
 and we opened 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.130
 we are next door where if they open it goes to 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.200
 to be kind like a diamond type 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.420
 we had to turn off the flash so that it 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.280
 I saw that this diamond 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.740
 well we doubled to say 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.660
 if this one does it hard so we mark it 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.830
 ok and we grabbed this tab here 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.870
 up and we put it here 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:24.270
 and I was with the other edge of the side where 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 they also call markets but so he goes to 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.400
 to be this we almost mark then this 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.470
 wolf piece that was a line here I do not know 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.600
 look good but if you see this piece of 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.440
 this line we are going to grab is written 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.690
 from here and we put it here 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.890
 and this is not going to stay like this anymore 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:48.120
 and then I'm afraid if we mark 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.490
 then we put is all this and so 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.480
 we are going to stay this you have tacos here 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.480
 yes sm 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.920
 and well then this 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.730
 already since we have all this so let's 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.190
 open this part down here like this 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.190
 so when we open 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.939
 so then is this part also that 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.250
 is up we put it here it's going 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:23.650
 to be this little bag here we are going to put 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.129
 this side that we open towards here 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.129
 Y 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.140
 ready that the nose is good 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.540
 and so now let's go we go with the wings the 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.959
 blood is this piece here we open it 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.819
 well I'm like this and can not open and 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.359
 we see it like this 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.280
 we doubled this this is the part of the 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.920
 part that we are seeing here where already 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.719
 we put all this part of down in what 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.530
 that we work with the highs we're going to 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:56.050
 put this at least like that and then fold it 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.720
 backwards 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:03.720
 yes good now we saw this part here 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.270
 we invite you if now you will not create 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.230
 a kind of little bag here is this 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.230
 We are going to put the corner 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.450
 This is going to be the first one that's the same 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.490
 is 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.230
 but this time it was from this state that if 

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:29.110
 it opens we are going to bend here 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:34.680
 and like that and then for the other side like 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.680
 now we open we put 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.639
 so an equal bag we go this 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.099
 here 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.419
 and this corner we put it here I hope 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.330
 than you who better than me because 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:53.409
 this video was like I've progressed 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.680
 but that's the way it is even if it was going to 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.669
 stay towards the antler 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.669
 now let's try 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.240
 throwing this part that is where it opens 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.160
 to be above and we grabbed it like this 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.160
 we will win like this 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.289
 it's like dancing in salt, yes, we're sorry 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.289
 straight 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.700
 Y 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.170
 very much 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.010

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.010
 A) Yes 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.880
 and as we say the top part yes 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.940
 and so 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:52.050
 and this was all from alain if they want the 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.050
