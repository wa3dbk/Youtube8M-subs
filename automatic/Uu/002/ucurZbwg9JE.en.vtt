00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.710
 Hello, how are you doing? 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:11.300
 this video for several reasons there are several 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.840
 People have asked me how 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.160
 makes the gluten as it is prepared and although 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.980
 I have a recipe that uses flour 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.710
 of gluten that only gluten that does not 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.809
 has starch sometimes it is very difficult 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.070
 get that is flour then I wanted to 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:33.070
 show you prepare this video for 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.230
 show them how you can prepare 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:42.109
 using white flour in which I have 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.989
 found that it works very well for 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:48.949
 make this recipe to prepare the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.550
 gluten that we can use in recipes 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.219
 than to replace the meat using 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.699
 the gluten in the brand of flour is 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.449
 select this flour can get it 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.449
 in 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.580
 in Hispanic countries of course and 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.060
 also in international markets 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.390
 or of Latin or Mexican meals 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.909
 etcetera there is another brand that is achieved 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.930
 also in the alde shop which is the 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.360
 mark that they handle and also that and 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.490
 I found it pretty good for the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.670
 preparation of gluten for its content 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.610
 of gluten what we are going to do to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.800
 prepare this gluten is simply 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.659
 remove the starch that contains this 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.000
 these flours to then preserve 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.020
 only the gluten that is the protein 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.090
 what we want to prepare our 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.860
 saucers that in another instance 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.860
 they would need to be prepared with meat 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.940
 then we will use 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.070
 the gluten that is a vegetable substitute 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:06.470
 pretty good that does not have cholesterol and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.750
 that makes us really good for the 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.190
 nutrition then when you go 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.920
 to prepare the gluten please prepare 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.170
 pretty flour at once because 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.840
 remember that you have to remove the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.730
 starch which means that we're going to 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.760
 get a little ball like this 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.850
 gluten size will see I will 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.450
 prepare this recipe I suppose that in 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.940
 ones in about two or three videos because 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.010
 I would like to show you step by step how 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.860
 carries out this matter and then 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.650
 you here at home 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.900
 just look for part of a new 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.100
 party so part 3 is missing 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.770
 come out at the end 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.590
 in the video how many parts we have but 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.070
 I will try to make it as illustrated 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.980
 possible and if you have questions 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.570
 just contact me visit the blog 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.910
 subscribe ask questions or send me 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.010
 an email and I will gladly 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.590
 to be here 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.030
 to be able to serve you if I can truthfully ok 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.370
 then I empty in the flour here 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.430
 in and now what I'm going to do that 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.950
 it is very simple very very very simple is 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.000
 just open the key and notice that 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.349
 I have my container with the flour that 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.660
 already empty here 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.160
 empty 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.370
 4.4 pounds that are two kilos of flour 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.370
 he goes inside of him 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.660
 of the kitchen sink in the kitchen 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.430
 then let's open the water tap 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.620
 cold and with cold water 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.230
 maybe a little warm too 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.719
 simply because you have been cold in 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.930
 the region where I live and the water is 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:00.719
 isolated but with cold water or I do the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.459
 time of the key is going to prepare a 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:08.819
 mass we are going to prepare it until it is 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.670
 well formed so you do not run 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.180
 stuck in the hand and it's going to happen 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.180
 so 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:24.220
 until it's going to be a sufficient kneading 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.060
 until when you hit the cookie 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.060
 come back 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.260
 I do not know how to explain it but I would like to see 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.900
 if I can show them later I'll 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.120
 to continue here kneading and I will continue 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.120
 adding water to 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:49.350
 that this can be well formed 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.610
 list the dough for gluten and since 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:57.050
 It is well kneaded that when hit 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.050
 return to your 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:04.720
 to its original position then we're going 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.400
 to leave submerged in water we're going to 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.170
 cover with water and let's leave 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.300
 soaking for at least 5 hours so 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.470
 minus 5 hours then this you can 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.750
 prepare it when getting up or let's say in the 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.180
 night and you can leave it all night and 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.890
 in the morning it continues 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.420
 with the process of preparing the 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:31.110
 gluten 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:34.020
 here I will go kneading this matter 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.980
 notice that you have to do it in here 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.960
 say that the container in which 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.970
 I am working is one of the 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.860
 larger containers that I have and without 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:49.770
 But still , a little bit of 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.820
 dump is spilled by the for the 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.040
 edges and well I do not want to have to 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.870
 clean up all this afterwards so it improves 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.120
 what I do in my preparation and it is 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.800
 important that you use a 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.870
 apron or something like that because suddenly 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:13.710
 that starch can jump and then they 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.690
 is going to dirty his clothes but then he is 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.850
 starch so it is washed though 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.870
 keep it in mind in case you bring 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:24.330
 nice clothes that should be sent to the 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:28.550
 dry cleaning or something so that then 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:31.940
 do not cause them more expense 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.520
 and then I'm still here and I think I 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.210
 water pass then I will put more 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:42.920
 flour so that this can be 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:45.920
 handle and that's it we're all going to knead 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:50.840
 Knead until well formed 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.690
 mass that does not stay stuck to my hand and 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.320
 Remember that when hitting it you must bounce 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:07:01.490
 he must return to his position 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:04.580
 original so I would not want to have them 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.680
 here observing how amazon until that 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.100
 point because we're going to be here several 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:14.420
 minutes and just if you have 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:16.790
 any question let me know I hope 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.910
 have explained clearly what is 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:22.610
 what are we doing and I'm going to prepare the 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.910
 next video with the next step already 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.500
 that we advance in this process ok that 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.710
 have a good day 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.710
 bye
