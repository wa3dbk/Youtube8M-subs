comes from our winter crops and in the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.889 
comes from our winter crops and in the
summer<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.159> can<00:01:25.399> wear<00:01:25.640> our<00:01:25.700> production<00:01:26.630> which

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
summer we can wear our production which

summer we can wear our production which
is<00:01:27.110> cotton<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:27.950> think<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:28.759> we<00:01:28.850> could<00:01:28.970> probably

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119

production we can feed more people with
what<00:02:01.880> we<00:02:02.000> turn<00:02:02.209> off<00:02:02.770> important<00:02:03.770> stuff<00:02:04.039> in<00:02:04.459> a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
what we turn off important stuff in a

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.969 
what we turn off important stuff in a
drawing<00:02:04.940> in<00:02:05.209> a<00:02:05.330> drawing<00:02:05.569> world<00:02:05.810> yeah<00:02:06.200> it's<00:02:06.770> a

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
drawing in a drawing world yeah it's a

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.620 
drawing in a drawing world yeah it's a
recharge<00:02:07.549> point<00:02:07.880> for<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.179> Great<00:02:08.330> Artesian

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
recharge point for the Great Artesian

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.809 
recharge point for the Great Artesian
basin<00:02:09.170> which<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:09.500> what<00:02:09.649> we<00:02:09.769> operate<00:02:10.280> what

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
basin which is what we operate what

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.810 
basin which is what we operate what
every<00:02:11.420> every<00:02:12.260> farmers<00:02:12.709> region<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.400> all<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
every every farmers region and all the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.840 
every every farmers region and all the
way<00:02:13.910> up<00:02:14.030> through<00:02:14.269> Queensland<00:02:14.930> operates<00:02:15.350> on

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
way up through Queensland operates on

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.920 
way up through Queensland operates on
why<00:02:16.850> would<00:02:16.910> they<00:02:17.120> want<00:02:17.299> to<00:02:17.359> gamble<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.750> that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
why would they want to gamble all that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.210 
why would they want to gamble all that
so<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.320> money<00:02:18.500> they're<00:02:18.739> going<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.950> get<00:02:19.040> out<00:02:19.190> of

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
so the money they're going to get out of

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.509 
so the money they're going to get out of
the<00:02:19.640> gas<00:02:20.170> well<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.320> was<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.440> Sunday<00:02:21.859> morning<00:02:22.070> I

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
the gas well it was a Sunday morning I

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.880 
the gas well it was a Sunday morning I
was<00:02:23.390> actually<00:02:23.480> sleeping<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.380> we<00:02:24.500> received

were<00:02:29.000> interested<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.600> having<00:02:29.810> exploration

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
were interested in having exploration

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.009 
were interested in having exploration
for<00:02:30.829> guests<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.310> our<00:02:31.549> property<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.120> was<00:02:32.660> really

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
for guests on our property I was really

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.599

shocked<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.590> tried<00:02:33.829> to<00:02:33.950> explain<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.370> her

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
shocked and I tried to explain to her

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.810 
shocked and I tried to explain to her
how<00:02:34.640> important<00:02:35.390> our<00:02:35.570> land<00:02:35.989> was<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.739> she

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
how important our land was and she

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.039 
how important our land was and she
actually<00:02:37.820> said<00:02:38.150> well<00:02:38.299> it's<00:02:38.420> fine<00:02:38.780> we'll<00:02:39.019> just

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
actually said well it's fine we'll just

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.300 
actually said well it's fine we'll just
put<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.410> somewhere<00:02:39.620> where<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:39.950> don't<00:02:39.980> care

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
put it somewhere where you don't care

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.150 
put it somewhere where you don't care
about<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.900> really<00:02:42.200> did<00:02:42.680> upset<00:02:42.920> me

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
about and that really did upset me

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.849 
about and that really did upset me
because<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.790> don't<00:02:44.090> know<00:02:44.150> any<00:02:44.480> farmer<00:02:44.989> in<00:02:45.620> this

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
because I don't know any farmer in this

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.830 
because I don't know any farmer in this
country<00:02:46.280> or<00:02:46.430> any<00:02:46.609> person<00:02:46.850> when<00:02:47.510> they<00:02:47.630> own<00:02:47.810> a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
piece of land in Australia that would

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.309 
piece of land in Australia that would
find<00:02:50.180> something<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.780> they<00:02:50.900> didn't<00:02:51.140> care

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
find something that they didn't care

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.710 
find something that they didn't care
about<00:02:51.519> we've<00:02:52.519> got<00:02:52.670> six<00:02:53.000> million<00:02:53.390> hectares

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
about we've got six million hectares

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.690 
about we've got six million hectares
that<00:02:54.049> they<00:02:54.230> want<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.890> potentially<00:02:55.190> develop

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
that they want to potentially develop

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.699 
that they want to potentially develop
into<00:02:56.120> an<00:02:56.209> industrialized<00:02:56.870> gas<00:02:57.109> field<00:02:57.350> to

the environment to make the gas flow

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.640 
the environment to make the gas flow
that<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.359> just<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.989> nature<00:03:03.019> of<00:03:03.410> their

just<00:03:07.579> can't

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
just can't

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.570 
just can't

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
seven and I'm concerned about a number

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.300 
seven and I'm concerned about a number
of<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.360> chemicals<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:16.930> are<00:03:17.140> used<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.740> coal

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
of the chemicals that are used in coal

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.700 
of the chemicals that are used in coal
seam<00:03:18.520> gas<00:03:18.550> mining<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.300> number<00:03:19.990> of<00:03:20.080> these<00:03:20.230> these

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
seam gas mining a number of these these

chemicals<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.400> known<00:03:21.580> carcinogens<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.690> just

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
chemicals and known carcinogens and just

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.960 
chemicals and known carcinogens and just
because<00:03:23.470> they<00:03:23.620> may<00:03:23.800> be<00:03:23.860> used<00:03:24.160> in<00:03:24.310> small

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
because they may be used in small

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.760 
because they may be used in small
quantities<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.840> know<00:03:25.960> we<00:03:26.110> don't<00:03:26.290> know<00:03:26.470> what

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
quantities you know we don't know what

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.460

the<00:03:26.890> long-term<00:03:27.070> health<00:03:27.340> impacts<00:03:27.970> are<00:03:28.470> the

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
the long-term health impacts are the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.160 
the long-term health impacts are the
really<00:03:29.830> difficult<00:03:30.160> part<00:03:30.670> about<00:03:30.820> this<00:03:31.300> is<00:03:31.570> that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
really difficult part about this is that

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.720 
really difficult part about this is that
