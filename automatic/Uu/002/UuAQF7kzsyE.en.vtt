00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
them in a deep container and then what I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.960 
them in a deep container and then what I
do<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.409> them<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.220> feed<00:01:47.460> them<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.820> my

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
do with them is I feed them to my

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.280

another<00:01:50.190> way<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.150> works<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> put

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
another way that really works is to put

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.250 
another way that really works is to put
down<00:01:52.500> wet<00:01:53.010> newspaper<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.690> can<00:01:54.870> see<00:01:55.080> this

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
down wet newspaper as you can see this

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.620 
down wet newspaper as you can see this
is<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.620> I've<00:01:55.800> done<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.850> makes<00:01:57.180> almost

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
is what I've done here it makes almost

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.140 
is what I've done here it makes almost
like<00:01:58.050> a<00:01:58.080> trap<00:01:58.470> for<00:01:58.800> them<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.220> don't<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.910> if<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
like a trap for them I don't know if you

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.820 
like a trap for them I don't know if you
can<00:02:00.300> see<00:02:00.510> this<00:02:00.660> but<00:02:00.870> there's<00:02:01.110> several<00:02:01.380> under

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
can see this but there's several under

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.280 
can see this but there's several under
there<00:02:01.980> right<00:02:02.220> now<00:02:02.520> later<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.720> will<00:02:03.780> pick<00:02:04.110> them

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
there right now later I will pick them

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.340 
there right now later I will pick them
up<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.710> put<00:02:04.950> them<00:02:04.980> into<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.700> nice<00:02:06.330> deep<00:02:06.780> bucket

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
up and put them into a nice deep bucket

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.639 
up and put them into a nice deep bucket
so<00:02:08.190> they<00:02:08.340> can't<00:02:08.610> crawl<00:02:08.970> out<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.479> again<00:02:10.380> give

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so they can't crawl out and again give

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.630 
so they can't crawl out and again give
them<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.040> my<00:02:11.220> chickens<00:02:12.830> another<00:02:13.830> trick<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.610> I

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
touching the stem this luxe can't go

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.790

through<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.240> wood<00:02:24.420> ash<00:02:24.630> because<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.530> rough

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
through the wood ash because it's rough

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.970 
through the wood ash because it's rough
and<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.459> tears<00:02:26.730> their<00:02:27.030> bodies<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:28.380> works<00:02:28.740> as

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
and it tears their bodies this works as

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.690 
and it tears their bodies this works as
long<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.090> dry<00:02:30.680> once<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.890> gets<00:02:32.100> wet<00:02:32.340> the
