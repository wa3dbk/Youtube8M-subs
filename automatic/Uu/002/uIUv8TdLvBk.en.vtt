 you are such a heavy rain today just 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 like a bucket pouring about 50 kilometers to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.630
 finish well a little less lubrication 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.450
 penetrates well always between 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.340
 chain vision competent mechanic lubrication 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.250
 less scattered around the neighborhood 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.210
 as they say great congratulations from 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.609
 today showed the option took into account all the tips 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.809
 he himself correctly distributed and he 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.059
 academic wins these 800 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.329
 meters become 800 meters of fame 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.879
 for him and how many attempts were there before 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 until he realized this race too 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.590
 can not be missed because here 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.700
 opportunities to change something general 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 classification 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.110
 until we see the most brutal compartment which 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.930
 arranges tinkov sax 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 were not going anywhere other giner 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.270
 compartments and creation without exception all 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.609
 experiencing problems but the port is hooked and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.170
 the easel caught up with more malware 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.670
 starts to get out gradually and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.740
 In principle, he is well aware that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.890
 alexander specialists not so not 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.710
 right was knowing perfectly 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.150
 alberto kontador that valverde could 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.250
 claim today to win the stage 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.970
 and on how to somehow make a difference 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.890
 in the overall standings of course the mountain 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.070
 too short to have it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.350
 changed so noticeably but in extreme 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.470
 as you climb a couple of top three positions 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.100
 why not try 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.100
 eggs rolled 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.100
 and he is unlikely to catch on this group but 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 one man Navarro 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.230
 and that no one is so scary for 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.040

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.860

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.170
 still turns on kontador went not 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.540

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.489
 does he cling to him and only him 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.239
 leonardo didn't go port cut off he 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.260
 is able to 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.819
 He is capable of me but as a sting for the visa 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.760
 alexander aviary 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.950
 need to be closer to 3 finally smile 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.420
 after cremation stress throughout 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.099
 hours where there is already the world championship 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:38.450
 and and the french miner triumphs 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:40.400
 kontador seeing psychological struggle with 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.739
 she doesnâ€™t even think 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.269
 special 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.769
 nervous here roll and nothing 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.359
 our model is also nothing in 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.519
 able to do not even fall 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.169
 top three at this stage of the floor 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.139
 for him because all the same at least 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:57.019
 points would have taken good and went up on 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:01.449
 market as they say but no it 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:03.730
 dissolve in this scatter us peloton 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:06.709
 leader of the general classification 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.329
 ready to go just were not he 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.310
 It goes like it is perfectly glued 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:15.739
 port is protected port rakes but 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.599
 Now he is not allowed to come on again 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.479
 add average speed over here 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:23.960
 despite the bad weather for 42 kilometers in 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.300
 an hour here is a collective congratulations from 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.820
 teams are already in full celebration 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.030
 while the group of favorites arrives here 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.820
 as we said another race more 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.289
 minutes there will be a break somewhere three, but it 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.669
 makes no difference since 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.020
 who today at the general 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:44.810
 classification was not noticeable port 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.419
 It looks very good while not looking 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.880
 semi broken state of the team 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.900
 loss of two riders including captain 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.650
 he resists very badly 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.479
 Valverde today does not really 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.330
 exhibits even he garden looks 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.240
 better port rolls on this more 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.889
 sloping plot kontador preparing 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.229
 cross the finish line somewhat 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.449
 I was not in front license had not 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.400
 get off the wheel not interestingly your 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.669
 god to the finish of the mountains he will 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.669
 show or not a contador today 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.520
 very talkative in this fight 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.639
 removed but were not as if wearing a mask 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.930
 Venetian will not understand what he is 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.419
 what he suggests he plans to port 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.550
 I like the fact that he is among the generals 3 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.099
 and that he is still at this stage 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.289
 rises but now the contador when 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.819
 once again added it turns out that they were 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.129
 all the same here are a few meters 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.129
 runs a little bit softer and
