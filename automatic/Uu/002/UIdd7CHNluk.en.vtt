00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
enough the new tarps were out and this

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.500 
enough the new tarps were out and this

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
woodland camo so I went with the larger

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.840 
woodland camo so I went with the larger
tarp<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> 11<00:01:15.720> by<00:01:15.840> 11<00:01:15.870> and<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.850> digital

tarp the 11 by 11 and got the digital
woodland<00:01:18.240> camo<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.100> out<00:01:20.220> here

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
woodland camo and I got that out here

woodland camo and I got that out here
right<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.390> figured<00:01:21.690> we'd<00:01:21.900> take<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> look

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
right now and I figured we'd take a look

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.790 
right now and I figured we'd take a look
at<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.040> first<00:01:23.100> time<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:25.500> reason<00:01:25.740> I

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
at it for the first time so the reason I

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.740 
at it for the first time so the reason I
like<00:01:26.010> these<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.480> it's<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
like these it's just it's a it's a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.170 
like these it's just it's a it's a
lightweight<00:01:27.990> sill<00:01:28.590> night<00:01:28.800> tarp<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.940> it's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
lightweight sill night tarp and it's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.750 
lightweight sill night tarp and it's
very<00:01:30.659> very<00:01:30.960> affordable<00:01:31.430> probably<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> most

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
very very affordable probably the most

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.540 
very very affordable probably the most
affordable<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.229> found<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
affordable one that I have found the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.430 
affordable one that I have found the
next<00:01:35.850> closest<00:01:36.360> would<00:01:36.540> probably<00:01:37.080> be<00:01:37.260> the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
next closest would probably be the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.570 
next closest would probably be the
equinox<00:01:37.980> tarps<00:01:38.840> which<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.550> can't<00:01:41.550> even

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
equinox tarps which I can't even

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.610 
equinox tarps which I can't even
remember<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.970> price<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.450> top<00:01:42.690> my<00:01:42.840> head<00:01:42.870> but<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
remember the price up top my head but I

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.240 
remember the price up top my head but I
know<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.190> was<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:45.140> 43<00:01:46.140> dollars<00:01:46.470> with

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
know this one was about 43 dollars with

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.040 
know this one was about 43 dollars with
shipping<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:48.300> I<00:01:48.390> don't<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> buyers

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
shipping and I don't have the buyers

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.720 
shipping and I don't have the buyers
club<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.070> would<00:01:50.160> probably<00:01:50.370> be<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> little

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
club so it would probably be a little

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.480 
club so it would probably be a little
bit<00:01:50.880> cheaper<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.570> had<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.590> don't

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
bit cheaper if I had that but I don't

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.130 
bit cheaper if I had that but I don't
order<00:01:53.730> enough<00:01:53.940> from<00:01:54.090> sportsmen<00:01:54.600> guide<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
order enough from sportsmen guide to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.790 
order enough from sportsmen guide to
justify<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.160> my<00:01:56.310> mind<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:57.330> let's<00:01:58.020> swing

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
justify that in my mind so let's swing

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.680 
justify that in my mind so let's swing
this<00:01:58.920> around<00:01:59.040> here<00:01:59.430> I've<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.970> got<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.360> set

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
this around here I've just got this set

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.690 
this around here I've just got this set
up<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.990> let's<00:02:01.050> get<00:02:01.260> a<00:02:01.320> good<00:02:01.680> idea<00:02:02.010> how<00:02:02.520> much

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
up and let's get a good idea how much

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.610 
up and let's get a good idea how much
coverage<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.450> has<00:02:03.660> ok<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.440> go<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
coverage this thing has ok here we go I

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.040 
coverage this thing has ok here we go I
got<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.190> set<00:02:05.550> up<00:02:05.580> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.940> backyard<00:02:06.480> here<00:02:06.870> as

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
got it set up in the backyard here as

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.690 
got it set up in the backyard here as
you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.410> see<00:02:07.620> it<00:02:07.710> blends<00:02:07.980> in<00:02:08.220> pretty<00:02:08.399> good

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you can see it blends in pretty good

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.699 
you can see it blends in pretty good
definitely<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.289> pattern<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:12.440> didn't<00:02:13.440> set

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
definitely like the pattern I didn't set

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.890 
definitely like the pattern I didn't set
this<00:02:13.890> up<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.310> know<00:02:14.430> as<00:02:14.580> securely<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.569> would

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
this up you know as securely as I would

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.290 
this up you know as securely as I would
if<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.530> was<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:16.860> out<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.640> woods<00:02:17.879> just

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
if I was actually out in the woods just

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.509 
if I was actually out in the woods just
for<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.660> sake<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.930> convenience<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:20.010> throwing

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
for the sake of convenience and throwing

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.640 
for the sake of convenience and throwing
it<00:02:20.640> up<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.879> get<00:02:21.000> an<00:02:21.090> idea<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> size<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:22.140> just

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
it up to get an idea of the size I just

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.800 
it up to get an idea of the size I just
used<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.099> cheap<00:02:23.760> nylon<00:02:24.180> cords<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.629> came

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
used the cheap nylon cords that came

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.270 
used the cheap nylon cords that came
with<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.349> just<00:02:25.530> kind<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.769> secured<00:02:26.190> it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
with it and just kind of secured it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.059 
with it and just kind of secured it
where<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.459> wanted<00:02:26.819> was<00:02:26.970> some<00:02:27.090> tarp<00:02:27.330> clips<00:02:28.069> that

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
where I wanted was some tarp clips that

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.880 
where I wanted was some tarp clips that
you<00:02:29.250> could<00:02:29.459> do<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> large<00:02:30.349> diamond<00:02:31.349> pattern

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
you could do a large diamond pattern

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.979 
you could do a large diamond pattern
with<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.790> wanted<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.540> reason<00:02:33.900> I

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
with this if you wanted but the reason I

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.710 
with this if you wanted but the reason I
went<00:02:34.200> with<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.739> larger<00:02:35.250> dimensions<00:02:35.849> is<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.690> I

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
went with the larger dimensions is so I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.289 
went with the larger dimensions is so I
could<00:02:36.989> set<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.349> up<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.160> rectangular<00:02:38.670> a-frame

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
could set it up in a rectangular a-frame

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.780 
could set it up in a rectangular a-frame
configuration<00:02:40.019> like<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.290> got<00:02:40.499> here<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.489> I'm
