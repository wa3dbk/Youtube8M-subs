00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 welcome to happy hour pure science 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:16.770
 and chips to consume of course with 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:19.050
 moderation or moderation creature 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.939
 obscure and your globine the question that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.760
 everyone obviously raises the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.949
 the worst is there stop elsewhere 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.930
 wikipedia tells us that there is some 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.390
 dracula thing for example inspired from a 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.710
 bram book store himself fired from 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.190
 two characters who really existed 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 a vladimir 2 alias dragon drac there is in 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.890
 makes a human and his son vladimir iii 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.120
 the impaler then the impaler for one 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.260
 be very clear it's a guy when the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.000
 hosts and not agree with him he 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.469
 was taking an Italian group points and then 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.020
 nose planted in history to make them 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.670
 change your mind at the show without fading 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.590
 family anyway at that time on 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.399
 state and bean cobain about a decidedly 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.480
 camera we all agree and 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.899
 a lot of movies bought on the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.550
 vampires 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.510
 I like that of coppola realized in 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.090
 1992 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:12.130
 any of them saves 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.810
 twilight no because already vampires 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.370
 to shine the day anyway this same step 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.770
 mega credible besides in but look 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.170
 the hero no but edward old chic at 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.280
 dessert completely poaching frankly 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.180
 charisma of an oyster and the too 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.100
 softly but finds them ugly 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.530
 he is too talkative so far he exists 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.210
 170 different vampire movies all 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.770
 drink blood and some can get 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.230
 turn into other animals such as 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.400
 the bat for example at the same 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.330
 time you think that bald man 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.810
 mouse is believable 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.810
 yeah 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.540
 ok leaving batman and let's go back to the movie 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.920
 of coppola I still wanted 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.420
 remember that there are certain passages of the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.619
 movie that are really nice where 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.330
 we see the vampire as a 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.500
 dominant creature that control 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.840
 the spirit of his victims in the unique 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.759
 goal for living just got 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.649
 of fresh human blood twice as much 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.000
 firstly the vampires the wood near 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.860
 of sound is dead he sees rather blood 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.270
 of cow or birds and especially the wood 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.340
 do not take so write too 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.380
 yes ok so to come science comes 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.000
 to vampire has a touch of sweats 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.100
 internal skeleton had four limbs 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.840
 to move the bristles of the breasts 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.670
 a pata giaume that is actually towards 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.300
 a hand and the elks arrived actually a 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.709
 vampire it's a bat lead or 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.239
 so I start again there is indeed 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.680
 three species of bats that are 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.940
 feed of blood elsewhere these 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.140
 creatures found in america 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.880
 chillou central arne make sure 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.500
 often enjoys the sleep of some 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.340
 mammals to approach them let's say 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.340
 more easily 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.340
 there are other blood drinkers 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.799
 the mosquito the leeches but is it 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.569
 that you know the brush empties this 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.519
 magnificent birds called finch with 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.930
 sharp life in the Galapagos Islands and 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.849
 when he has no more grain or when 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.950
 rather in times of crisis what good 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.870
 he will have fun seeing the blood of the poor 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.040
 Blur innocent a little younger 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.120
 and if we look a little closer 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.349
 nature includes many 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.180
 originalities about animals 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.470
 hematophagous or illustrate this idea in 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.909
 speaking of new bats she 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.200
 is the second most 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.819
 important in mammals 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.470
 after that of the rednesses 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.989
 bats are also able to 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.340
 perform an active flight while at 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.319
 other mammals such as 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.790
 flying squirrels for example well we 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.319
 is going to have a passive flight 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.049
 they can have different sizes 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.940
 then 3 cm holding in the palm of the 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.799
 hand up to 1.5 meter wingspan 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.359
 can find bats 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.129
 both in forests and in 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.200
 grasslands only in caves or even 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.090
 cities the diet is 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.560
 extremely diverse certain species 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.260
 are going to eat other insects 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.489
 other fruits of the flower nectar or 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.000
 still blood as we saw 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.560
 previously 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.239
 Besides, it's a shame if you 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.790
 look for a great anti-mosquito the 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.400
 bat 600 mhz or stickers 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.410
 ensuring stiffer sees 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.329
 maybe to pass a law a study 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.040
 published in his hate are 2011 has 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.329
 demonstrated that a disease that infects 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.250
 all the bats almost 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.590
 of North America had caused the loss 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.290
 do you care about 3.7 billion 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:12.209
 dollars per year of agricultural production 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.560
 en route and chips in terms of role 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.180
 ecological and bat will have 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.889
 an important role in reproduction 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.560
 certain plant species such 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.970
 than the cactus or the baobab with 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.049
 many threats weigh on the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.000
 bats around the world 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.470
 light pollution storage during 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.150
 hibernation or the use 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.770
 insecticides 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.590
 so absolutely all the bald 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.620
 mice are protected children and their 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.620
 goods 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:42.249
 these bats do not know each other 

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:44.679
 in the walls and still months in the 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.869
 coffee tables is not it since it is 

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:48.099
 well an echolocation system then the 

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:50.049
 roommate is what you have 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.179
 bat who will send via his 

00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:54.159
 screaming ultrasounds continuously his 

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:55.629
 waves to bounce off the obstacles and 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.309
 depending on the time of return from 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:00.689
 season of agron properties can appreciate 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:03.279
 the distance and thus avoid the obstacle 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:05.049
 in black jacket and dolphin ema la 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.639
 full concept of echolocation yes but 

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:08.849
 I smile still have a great power in 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.849
 square 

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:14.229
 yes robin do terrible vampire features 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:15.459
 also infrared vision 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.349
 in other words, a thermal sensor 

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:18.879
 allowing them to differentiate the hot 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.719
 of the cold and therefore to find more 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.719
 easily their victims 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.859
 when we talk about things smiles 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.599
 finally well we'll talk about 

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:31.039
 different sizes of different 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.169
 habitats of different diets 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.879
 food the theft assets to a system 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.889
 ultrasound or detection 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.579
 infrared is bat is suitable 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.019
 to his environment 

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:41.119
 I want to say the chance makes 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:43.369
 really good things ah chance 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:43.939
 often used far less often than 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:45.799
 does it anyway 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.049
 hello had to represent the player 

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:49.429
 admits chips elsewhere you say 

00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:50.539
 that chance makes them 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:52.309
 things but I'm not necessarily 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.439
 agree to this very strongly the lattois 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:56.059
 re took the cutest animal on 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:06:03.309
 earth for example a duck then neither 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:03.309
 tanks a unicorn a cat not resting 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:13.879
 let's see what evolution is at the doors 

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:16.219
 of flowers to the sailboats of the already who 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:18.529
 exists on earth it's gone for our 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:22.479
 great quiz of biodiversity which of 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:22.479
 these animals exist there already on earth 

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:29.079
 too much not a cat keeps of course that if 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.459
 it exists looking for a direct but 

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:32.449
 why yeah that's it rappe we can 

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:43.899
 see for the next episode 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:43.899
 Too easy the challenge 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:52.819
 to subscribe you facebook twitter all that 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.819
 it's very good for you
