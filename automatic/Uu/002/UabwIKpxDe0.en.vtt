the first which is the easiest is to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.600

to change his ways and then nothing

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.539 
to change his ways and then nothing
would<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.180> changed<00:01:34.130> instead<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.310> lecturing

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
would have changed instead of lecturing

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.480 
would have changed instead of lecturing
