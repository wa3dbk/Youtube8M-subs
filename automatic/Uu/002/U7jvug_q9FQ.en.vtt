00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:23.690
 In dmr would be done in front of the while prototype want to develop between the from concept design to mass production 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.090
 There is 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.420
 dmr stands for digital moka preview, so-called 3d model design 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:37.160
 It is a review 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:41.060
 Development costs were introduced at the actual machine stage for the purpose of reducing design rework 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.130
 The history of vps introduction is unexpectedly long 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:54.110
 In 2004, as a super concurrent activities since the start of the first time dmr 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:57.690
 It will be followed by the development innovation activities and the instruction to improve development efficiency 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:05.370
 It has led to an effort to improve accuracy 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:11.910
 First of all, we set an ideal to share our vision to realize this high precision 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:19.770
 It is a virtual measure and this dmr detects visual review problems 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:23.520
 In the actual machine measure what has been solved before the room Data such as the effect confirmation function verification of dmr 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.329
 It means that taking is substantial 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:33.280
 In other words, if dmr can do detection properly 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:36.729
 It will be to define that system it mustard a little while ago of the degree of completion of the prototype drawing is growing 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:42.790
 It occurred in the actual machine measure after dmr implementation 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:49.000
 If you analyze the problem of Ashida Sete both rivers with a decreasing trend 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:51.500
 In terms of the cause of occurrence, 60 to 70 percent of the sections after dmr indicated omission 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.590
 10% to 30% 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:04.090
 As the priority of measures here, it is not part of section indication after dmr 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.200
 Pointed out also analyzed for interference problems followed will be of eliminating a record detect leakage and 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.649
 Significantly improved 5 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.260
 It has become flat from the middle 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:20.890
 Sections of occurrence factor when viewed the No. dmr more and 80 percent 70 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:28.100
 When you look at the contents of the appreciation, static interference accounts for 90% and you are very shocked . 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:32.920
 Unlike the assembly problem that this static appreciation is a problem that can be resolved by almost model 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:37.209
 It is because it is a problem that can be prevented if you check it before issuing it 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:41.319
 Therefore , as the directionality of measures, intercept after dmr 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:46.400
 In other words, the part where design changes were made while making a trial 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:52.519
 Will be referred to either as this can check how without exception 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 Cherry blossoms measures are here in that design change extraction program 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:02.900
 vts dc manager Finetech original user tools then 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.790
 About assembly and check maximization that utilized animation of manufacturing 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.390
 I will explain 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.810
 First d psd 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.840
 c Describe the manager 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.000
 This is more than old and new vps data 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:22.750
 Executable program that extracts section information automatically 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.400
 As a result of the rmf p model, you can check the origin number of intercepts of less than 400 yen in about 30 minutes 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.680
 I made it 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.860
 Sections list in Shitaku stage to the conventional accuracy be combined over a dog or time 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:38.100
 bad 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:42.640
 Under these circumstances, we have realized that we can automatically produce results in just 30 minutes. 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:46.710
 This has significantly improved speed accuracy 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:52.320
 This is the user tool of the Finetech original 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:53.710
 Model the tool actually used in pursuit of reality and register the user 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.940
 Was 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:03.520
 Such as a driver and radio Penpurogu currently about 10 Category 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.460
 In addition, assembly with hand or finger is possible to be able to generally review 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.220
 I am 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:13.200
 vps can also do dynamic candidate verification in animation, so these parts 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.639
 It will be better if you maintain it firmly 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.229
 will be the accuracy of dmr is improved 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.280
 Then check maximize assembled to take advantage of the animation of Manufacturing 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.200
 is 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:32.300
 This disaster is a group collaboration d mar 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.689
 This is Ska to a group company is the finally so as not to come to in the animation 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:41.289
 It was included and prepared 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:46.870
 As you see, while playing the animation, our ska both evaluations are level matching 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:51.670
 It was used as a study and design of the feedback of the measures 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.139
 In this way, animation is becoming more casually available than in the past 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.219
 is 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:01.400
 The problem of the actual machine measure after five years 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:05.060
 We were able to reach 70% reduction 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:09.689
 You look in the classified it and 94% for appreciation 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:14.600
 Assemblability is reduced by 80% 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:19.689
 In addition, these prototype parts are damaged and simple costs such as dividends 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:23.639
 We can develop and propose about 30 million to 100 million yen 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:29.310
 Still challenges to the accuracy of simplicity there is 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:30.630
 As a new hitter, we will be able to respond more flexibly to the timing of section information extraction. 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.910
 I will 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:43.520
 We also create a check program with a limited number of parts 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:43.520
 In addition , we have a little futuristic dmr that incorporates the same elements.
