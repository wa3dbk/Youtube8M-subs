00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 thank you very much thanks to the vice for 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.960
 wait for another of the successes you have 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.660
 youtube here in Uruguay and more or less 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.910
 let's also talk about how we were the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.980
 experience a bit on youtube how it was 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.650
 that you started what it is a little 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.289
 your channel my channels with another friend that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.620
 it's called chau and we started a year ago and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.910
 two months 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.730
 and we started 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.200
 because we are say boring and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 We saw that here in Uruguay and in 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.700
 Argentina nobody was doing this kind of 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.290
 videos besides I am friend of gonza and he 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.960
 I saw him very alone on YouTube here 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.840
 uruguay because he was the only and good one 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.030
 channel started that's why we were going and we started 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.330
 doing sketch we made homemade bread 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.879
 which is an old video but just what 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.300
 we did and hit and it went viral and that we 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.480
 it helped stack and good that's why it came up two 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.059
 brozos that is called the canal 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.250
 and you had some kind of information or 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.960
 it was like what you were studying 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.870
 analyzing and now you are 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.130
 professionalizing how was the process and 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.250
 it was not all based on observation and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.920
 such ideas are coming up I am from the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.570
 border with brazil and boy looked 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.080
 Brazilian programs that made jokes to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.080
 people 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.040
 and good we got the idea and we started 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.040
 make jokes here too 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.390
 we told a bit how was the reception 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.720
 of family friends with respect 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.979
 to this facet because suddenly happened 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.930
 because that's what has also the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.540
 social networks or happens to be a complete 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.580
 unknown they did not always know you in your 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.690
 circle plus symptom to be a star 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.290
 of youtube social networks 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.440
 at the beginning it does not give me much ball but 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.020
 is up to my whole family of the videos 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.670
 and sometimes I congratulate some life not 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.530
 like but that's me and well I have the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.340
 principle our channel is called two 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.360
 unattainable 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.830
 and when we had 20 thousand subscribers 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.400
 We changed the name because it was very 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.710
 rude 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.990
 also because I have a little niece 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.680
 that is the daughter of my cousin who has seven 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.620
 years and asked if he went to school and 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.560
 she told her friends look at the five 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.850
 It was very rude and based on that 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.430
 there are other factors we change the name to 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.470
 two blogs because we call each other but between 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.080
 us because he's like my brother now 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.300
 and you work as they produce 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.530
 videos now how long does it take you in 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.710
 how much they do is like a job 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.680
 as in the case of gonzalo or is it more 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.760
 random and ccoo 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.620
 it's kind of a hobby but we're 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.900
 making transform into a type job 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.200
 is in process we are there now 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.629
 we dedicate ourselves fully and we continue like that 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.090
 upload videos every so often but it takes us 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.959
 more or less two days of recording or 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.389
 We were one day and if some parts are missing 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.150
 we recorded the next day and editing more or 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.760
 less and edited since he got home 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.430
 put him from 8 in the evening until 4 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.459
 tomorrow morning and the last 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.379
 retouching and such plus or minus 10 hours as 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.389
 maximum 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.069
 fabricio apart from youtube that 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.709
 it's practically the platform by 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.629
 which you broadcast your videos as 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.609
 social network user what is your 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.959
 relationship with them what are your 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.250
 communication channels where you 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.770
 you inform how used 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.230
 and I use facebook and twitter a lot too 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.330
 instagram and in our social networks 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.070
 basically what we do is communicate 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.720
 type tomorrow let's talk a video 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.800
 again we talk about the videos more than 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.280
 nothing 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.410
 and about our personal life 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.950
 so they keep as the theme of the 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.030
 personal life 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.920
 included in the clear videos and always 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.019
 there is a contact with the followers that 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.970
 more or less know our lives by 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.069
 above the first time you perform the 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.790
 social media day I am the first time you

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.140
