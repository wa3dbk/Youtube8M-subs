00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
pretty much like just like the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.600 
pretty much like just like the
atmosphere<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.619> general<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.070> our<00:00:32.219> team<00:00:32.430> has

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
atmosphere in general of our team has

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.790 
atmosphere in general of our team has
been<00:00:32.759> really<00:00:33.149> down<00:00:33.440> especially<00:00:34.440> not<00:00:34.590> even

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
been really down especially not even

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.290 
been really down especially not even
just<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.010> last<00:00:35.190> week<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.640> like<00:00:35.850> overall

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
just this last week just like overall

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.440 
just this last week just like overall
the<00:00:36.480> entire<00:00:36.750> split<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.800> think<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the entire split and I think what it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.930 
the entire split and I think what it
really<00:00:39.629> came<00:00:39.930> down<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.200> most<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.370> specific

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
really came down to most really specific

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.779 
really came down to most really specific
airs<00:00:42.329> or<00:00:42.719> strategy<00:00:43.559> basically<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.579> just

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
airs or strategy basically they just

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.090 
airs or strategy basically they just
wanted<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> more<00:00:45.390> than<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.750> did<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.770> really

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
wanted it more than we did and it really

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
wanted it more than we did and it really
showed<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> end<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.539> they<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:48.809> came

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
showed in the end and so they just came

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.299 
showed in the end and so they just came
out<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.410> top<00:00:50.420> now<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:52.379> guys<00:00:52.500> had<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.070> pretty

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
out on top now you guys had a pretty

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.819 
out on top now you guys had a pretty
good<00:00:53.550> lead<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.960> very<00:00:55.140> end<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.440> Game<00:00:55.620> one

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
good lead at the very end of Game one

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.470 
good lead at the very end of Game one
and<00:00:56.010> unfortunately<00:00:56.670> things<00:00:56.910> kind<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.239> flipped

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and unfortunately things kind of flipped

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.720 
and unfortunately things kind of flipped
at<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> very<00:00:57.870> last<00:00:57.989> second<00:00:58.579> what<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.670> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
at the very last second what do you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.270 
at the very last second what do you
think<00:00:59.850> really<00:01:00.539> cause<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.050> issue<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:02.160> know

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
think really cause that issue you know

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.109 
think really cause that issue you know
what<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.359> made<00:01:03.660> everything

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
what what was it that made everything

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.100 
what what was it that made everything
fall<00:01:06.119> apart<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.720> end<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.080> game

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
fall apart at the very end of that game

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
fall apart at the very end of that game
and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> team

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and then what was it like for the team

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.929 
and then what was it like for the team
of<00:01:09.150> following<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.720> um<00:01:10.710> pretty<00:01:11.490> much<00:01:11.729> our

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
of following that um pretty much our

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.300 
of following that um pretty much our
Baron<00:01:12.390> Bates<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.590> our<00:01:13.740> Baron<00:01:14.040> play<00:01:14.189> in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
out fought us at Baron and then we

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.840 
out fought us at Baron and then we
weren't<00:01:28.619> able<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> come<00:01:29.130> back<00:01:29.280> after<00:01:29.490> that

weren't able to come back after that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.760 
weren't able to come back after that
because<00:01:30.030> they<00:01:30.299> had<00:01:30.450> aurion<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.560> didn't

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
because they had aurion and we didn't

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.399 
because they had aurion and we didn't
have<00:01:31.829> any<00:01:32.009> really<00:01:32.310> hard<00:01:32.640> engage<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.930> or<00:01:34.320> he

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
have any really hard engage so if or he

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.600 
have any really hard engage so if or he
could<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.799> playback<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.490> like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
could just like playback and just like

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
could just like playback and just like
wait<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.180> her<00:01:36.270> ultimate<00:01:36.600> they'll<00:01:36.810> win<00:01:36.960> every

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
wait on her ultimate they'll win every

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.980 
wait on her ultimate they'll win every
fight<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.909> point<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.479> were<00:01:39.600> just

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
pretty much after our match against

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.309

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.999 
basically afraid one that we would have
been<00:03:51.489> completely<00:03:51.729> safe<00:03:52.269> but<00:03:52.599> after<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.229> it

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:54.009 
been completely safe but after that it

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.530 
been completely safe but after that it
took<00:03:54.159> a<00:03:54.220> really<00:03:54.400> hard<00:03:54.669> toll<00:03:54.849> in<00:03:54.970> our<00:03:55.090> team<00:03:55.269> and

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
Danny I mean shifter is a very emotional

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.849

going<00:04:03.219> to<00:04:03.340> relegations<00:04:03.879> again<00:04:04.209> was<00:04:04.419> just<00:04:04.449> like

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
going to relegations again was just like

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.679

our team I'm most like we probably not

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.209 
our team I'm most like we probably not
survive<00:05:14.750> we<00:05:15.110> probably<00:05:15.319> won't<00:05:15.650> be<00:05:15.830> playing<00:05:16.009> in

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219
