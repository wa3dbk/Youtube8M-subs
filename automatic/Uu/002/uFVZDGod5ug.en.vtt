today is the perfect energy everybody
knows<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.420> need<00:02:12.480> energy<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.860> stuff

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
knows I need energy and this stuff

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.130 
knows I need energy and this stuff
really<00:02:14.370> delivers<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.090> had<00:02:15.660> did<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> blog<00:02:16.080> post

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
wanted to say that perfect energy is is

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.540

need<00:02:45.000> some<00:02:45.180> energy<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:47.430> other<00:02:47.610> one<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.850> just

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
need some energy the other one I just

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.030 
need some energy the other one I just
this<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.600> new<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> got<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.230> try<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.769> called

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
this is new I got to try and it's called

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.440 
this is new I got to try and it's called
the<00:02:50.190> whole<00:02:50.519> Omega<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:53.000> whole<00:02:54.000> fish<00:02:54.239> oil

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.509 
the whole Omega and it's whole fish oil
now<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.230> all<00:02:55.410> know<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.709> need<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.100> fish<00:02:56.280> oil

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
now we all know we need to have fish oil

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.920 
now we all know we need to have fish oil
and<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.760> particularly<00:02:57.330> need<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.600> have<00:02:57.780> it

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
and I particularly need to have it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
and I particularly need to have it
because<00:02:58.080> III<00:02:58.620> think<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.250> helps<00:02:59.519> my

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
because III think that it helps my

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.430 
because III think that it helps my
joints<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.060> bit<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:01.019> think<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.319> also

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
joints a bit and I think it also

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.380 
joints a bit and I think it also
improves<00:03:01.769> my<00:03:02.010> memory<00:03:02.310> which<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.880> which<00:03:03.209> eyes

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
improves my memory which I which eyes

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.850 
improves my memory which I which eyes
tend<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.630> have<00:03:03.780> problems<00:03:04.230> with<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.530> always<00:03:04.739> say

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
because my memory is so bad but this one

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.180 
because my memory is so bad but this one
is<00:03:08.819> easy<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.209> swallow<00:03:09.510> easy<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.140> take<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.799> you
