00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
game and it was a pretty close game here

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.590 
game and it was a pretty close game here
for<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> while<00:00:37.579> but<00:00:38.579> these<00:00:38.790> wide<00:00:38.969> receivers<00:00:39.420> are

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
for a while but these wide receivers are

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.869 
for a while but these wide receivers are
really<00:00:39.899> good<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.320> really<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.280> Megatron

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
really good I really like that Megatron

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.500 
really good I really like that Megatron
he's<00:00:42.180> been<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.540> good<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.989> me

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.270 

I<00:00:46.629> wish<00:00:47.230> I<00:00:47.350> could<00:00:47.500> stop<00:00:47.679> the<00:00:47.890> run<00:00:48.039> like<00:00:48.250> that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
I wish I could stop the run like that

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.190 
I wish I could stop the run like that
every<00:00:48.730> time<00:00:48.760> that'd<00:00:49.149> be<00:00:49.300> really<00:00:49.449> nice

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.290 

goal-line<00:00:55.920> d<00:00:56.310> is<00:00:56.370> always<00:00:56.730> tough<00:00:56.970> because<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
goal-line d is always tough because a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
goal-line d is always tough because a
lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> people<00:00:57.630> play<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.200> little

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
lot of people play it a little

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
lot of people play it a little
differently<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.310> have<00:00:59.430> those<00:00:59.640> people<00:01:00.000> who

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
differently you have those people who

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.540 
differently you have those people who
randomly<00:01:00.540> just<00:01:00.840> throw<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.350> goal<00:01:02.040> line<00:01:02.220> fade

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
randomly just throw the goal line fade

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.610 
randomly just throw the goal line fade
immediately<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.930> soon<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.199> they<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.410> to<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
immediately as soon as they get to the

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.170 
immediately as soon as they get to the
10<00:01:04.830> yard<00:01:05.010> line<00:01:05.160> and<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.940> have<00:01:06.030> people

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
10 yard line and then you have people

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.550 
10 yard line and then you have people
that<00:01:06.480> try<00:01:06.660> to<00:01:06.720> run<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:06.990> straight<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.530> gut

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that try to run it straight up the gut

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.640 
that try to run it straight up the gut
so<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.480> kind<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.840> dictate<00:01:10.440> which

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so you have to kind of dictate which

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.500 
so you have to kind of dictate which
which<00:01:11.550> type<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.790> player<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.300> playing

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
it worked out in my favor Tybalt a CB

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.280 
it worked out in my favor Tybalt a CB
rod<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.890> he'll<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.330> do<00:02:47.330> what<00:02:47.480> he<00:02:47.630> does<00:02:47.690> best<00:02:47.840> at

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
rod and he'll do do what he does best at

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.740 
rod and he'll do do what he does best at
picking<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.710> off<00:02:48.830> there<00:02:49.150> could<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.210> went<00:02:50.360> 46

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
picking it off there could have went 46

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.090 
picking it off there could have went 46
error<00:02:50.960> probably<00:02:51.260> should<00:02:51.410> have<00:02:51.470> cut<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.650> inside

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.410 
error probably should have cut it inside
but<00:02:52.490> that<00:02:54.130> might<00:02:55.130> have<00:02:55.160> been<00:02:55.250> boosted<00:02:55.730> rod<00:02:55.910> one

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
but that might have been boosted rod one

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.310

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
gets past that first line it's one on

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.600 
gets past that first line it's one on
one<00:03:25.430> against<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.060> safety<00:03:30.070> this<00:03:31.070> game<00:03:31.310> turned

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
one against the safety this game turned

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.180 
one against the safety this game turned
from<00:03:31.910> really<00:03:32.270> close<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.960> a<00:03:33.290> blowout<00:03:33.650> pretty

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
from really close to a blowout pretty

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.050 
from really close to a blowout pretty
quick<00:03:34.490> so<00:03:34.960> games<00:03:35.960> can<00:03:36.200> do<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:37.030> saw<00:03:38.030> it

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
quick so games can do that saw it

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.610 
quick so games can do that saw it
happened<00:03:38.480> today<00:03:38.630> not<00:03:39.320> in<00:03:39.470> my<00:03:39.620> favor<00:03:39.890> so

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.759 

I<00:03:44.269> don't<00:03:45.269> know<00:03:45.390> why<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.569> guy<00:03:45.870> doesn't<00:03:46.739> just

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
I don't know why this guy doesn't just

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.100 
I don't know why this guy doesn't just
let<00:03:47.069> things<00:03:47.250> go<00:03:47.580> he<00:03:48.269> saw<00:03:48.510> what<00:03:48.690> happened<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
let things go he saw what happened the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.589 
let things go he saw what happened the
first<00:03:49.140> time<00:03:50.569> guess<00:03:51.569> he<00:03:51.690> didn't<00:03:51.959> learn<00:03:53.599> vilma

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
first time guess he didn't learn vilma

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.830 
first time guess he didn't learn vilma
two<00:03:54.989> turnovers<00:03:55.830> for<00:03:56.400> touchdowns<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.150> he

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
two turnovers for touchdowns and he

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.059 
two turnovers for touchdowns and he
still<00:03:58.140> wasn't<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.500> player<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.890> game<00:03:58.920> I

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
still wasn't the player of the game I

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.380 
still wasn't the player of the game I
don't<00:03:59.370> think<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.790> don't<00:04:00.030> see<00:04:00.150> how<00:04:00.209> it's

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
don't think I don't see how it's

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.119 
don't think I don't see how it's
possible<00:04:00.569> a<00:04:03.230> 96<00:04:04.230> speed<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:04.680> any<00:04:04.890> linebacker

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
possible a 96 speed on any linebacker

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:16.849 
possible a 96 speed on any linebacker
that's<00:04:05.700> just<00:04:05.909> insane

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.479 

what<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.549> we<00:04:17.669> have<00:04:17.849> here
