out<00:01:34.060> when<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.360> right<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.810> just<00:01:34.960> listen<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.440> my

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
out when it right and just listen to my

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.190 
out when it right and just listen to my
corners<00:01:35.890> such<00:01:36.130> as<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.369> can<00:01:36.660> actually<00:01:37.660> I<00:01:37.960> was

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
corners such as I can actually I was

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.770 
corners such as I can actually I was
planning<00:01:38.679> on<00:01:38.920> going<00:01:39.100> all<00:01:39.369> three<00:01:39.670> rounds<00:01:39.880> right

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
planning on going all three rounds right

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.330 
planning on going all three rounds right
I<00:01:41.289> didn't<00:01:41.710> think<00:01:41.740> they<00:01:41.920> were<00:01:42.009> going<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.190> call

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
I didn't think they were going to call

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.750 
I didn't think they were going to call
it<00:01:42.520> off

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
it off

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.730 
it off
and<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.090> that's<00:01:44.420> not<00:01:44.690> really<00:01:45.020> surprising<00:01:45.200> with

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
and so that's not really surprising with

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.010 
and so that's not really surprising with
Takeo<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:48.110> take<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.440> little<00:01:48.620> marker<00:01:50.020> I'm
