about<00:00:14.080> the<00:00:14.800> great<00:00:15.340> in<00:00:15.790> session<00:00:16.540> recording

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
about the great in session recording

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.440 
about the great in session recording
with<00:00:17.290> Stevie<00:00:17.920> Ray<00:00:18.010> Vaughan<00:00:18.220> and<00:00:18.430> Albert<00:00:19.180> King

with Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.600 
with Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King
and<00:00:19.660> that<00:00:19.750> got<00:00:19.869> me<00:00:19.900> thinking<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.560> how<00:00:20.680> if<00:00:21.520> you

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
and that got me thinking the how if you

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.760 
and that got me thinking the how if you
watch<00:00:21.820> that<00:00:21.849> video<00:00:22.390> and<00:00:22.990> if<00:00:23.110> you<00:00:23.200> listen<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.529> it

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
watch that video and if you listen to it

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.010 
watch that video and if you listen to it
closely<00:00:24.119> there<00:00:25.119> are<00:00:25.150> some<00:00:25.330> things<00:00:25.570> that<00:00:25.660> the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
closely there are some things that the

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.910 
closely there are some things that the
two<00:00:26.170> of<00:00:26.320> them<00:00:26.500> both<00:00:26.710> do<00:00:27.150> Stevie<00:00:28.150> Ray<00:00:28.330> Vaughn

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
two of them both do Stevie Ray Vaughn

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.439 
two of them both do Stevie Ray Vaughn
obviously<00:00:29.920> wasn't<00:00:30.100> you<00:00:30.250> know<00:00:30.340> a<00:00:30.550> huge<00:00:31.090> hugely

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
obviously wasn't you know a huge hugely

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.799 
obviously wasn't you know a huge hugely
influenced<00:00:31.990> by<00:00:32.080> Albert<00:00:32.379> King<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.300> I'm

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
influenced by Albert King and so I'm

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.689 
influenced by Albert King and so I'm
gonna<00:00:34.960> call<00:00:35.199> this<00:00:35.410> some<00:00:35.890> Albert<00:00:36.250> King<00:00:36.430> style

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
gonna call this some Albert King style

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.700 
gonna call this some Albert King style
looks<00:00:37.090> even<00:00:37.809> though<00:00:37.900> Stevie<00:00:38.260> was<00:00:38.410> doing<00:00:38.620> it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
looks even though Stevie was doing it

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.740 
looks even though Stevie was doing it
too<00:00:38.920> but<00:00:39.160> I<00:00:39.309> really<00:00:39.640> think<00:00:39.879> that<00:00:39.970> he<00:00:40.420> got<00:00:40.600> it

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
too but I really think that he got it

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.660 
too but I really think that he got it
got<00:00:41.199> it<00:00:41.230> from<00:00:41.379> Albert<00:00:41.650> King<00:00:41.860> and<00:00:42.160> there's<00:00:42.640> a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670
