we're<00:01:20.320> going<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.469> start<00:01:20.679> leveling<00:01:21.219> the<00:01:21.369> bricks

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
we're going to start leveling the bricks

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.850 
we're going to start leveling the bricks
basically<00:01:22.780> you're<00:01:22.960> going<00:01:23.049> to<00:01:23.109> use<00:01:23.350> four

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
basically you're going to use four

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.459 
basically you're going to use four
bricks<00:01:24.159> per<00:01:24.520> lay<00:01:24.759> per<00:01:25.179> level<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.750> we're<00:01:26.350> going

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
bricks per lay per level and we're going

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.980 
bricks per lay per level and we're going
to<00:01:26.530> do<00:01:26.649> eight<00:01:26.920> layers<00:01:27.219> of<00:01:27.429> bricks<00:01:27.939> so<00:01:28.719> this<00:01:28.869> is

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
to do eight layers of bricks so this is

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.870 
to do eight layers of bricks so this is
our<00:01:29.110> fourth<00:01:29.380> layer<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.740> bricks<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:30.189> basically

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
our fourth layer of bricks and basically

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.669 
our fourth layer of bricks and basically
all<00:01:31.060> we're<00:01:31.270> doing<00:01:31.569> is<00:01:31.659> we<00:01:31.899> are<00:01:32.049> just<00:01:32.350> stacking

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
all we're doing is we are just stacking

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.559 
all we're doing is we are just stacking
the<00:01:32.950> bricks<00:01:33.219> and<00:01:33.429> we<00:01:33.520> are<00:01:33.610> overlapping<00:01:34.179> each

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
the bricks and we are overlapping each

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:35.850 
the bricks and we are overlapping each
joint<00:01:35.020> as<00:01:35.229> we<00:01:35.469> go

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
joint as we go

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.419 
joint as we go
our<00:01:36.369> fifth<00:01:36.819> layer<00:01:37.799> we're<00:01:38.799> moving<00:01:39.100> on<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.280> our

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
our fifth layer we're moving on to our

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:48.029 
our fifth layer we're moving on to our
sixth<00:01:39.939> layer<00:01:45.929> on<00:01:46.929> our<00:01:46.990> seventh<00:01:47.560> layer<00:01:47.739> and

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.990 
stove and we're going to stop at eight
layers<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.929> like<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.229> said<00:01:56.289> 32<00:01:56.799> bricks<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.759> can

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
layers so like I said 32 bricks this can

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.300 
layers so like I said 32 bricks this can
be<00:01:58.119> done<00:01:58.299> with<00:01:58.509> a<00:01:58.539> minimum<00:01:58.989> of<00:01:59.140> 24<00:01:59.679> bricks<00:02:00.009> but

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
be done with a minimum of 24 bricks but

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.690 
be done with a minimum of 24 bricks but
I<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:00.610> went<00:02:00.759> ahead<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.030> used<00:02:01.270> 32<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.579> now

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
I just went ahead and used 32 so now

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.969 
I just went ahead and used 32 so now
you're<00:02:03.849> going<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.030> need<00:02:04.179> some<00:02:04.479> type<00:02:04.689> of<00:02:04.979> grille

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
you're going to need some type of grille

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.029 
you're going to need some type of grille
or<00:02:06.310> cover<00:02:06.789> or<00:02:07.090> plate<00:02:07.479> I<00:02:07.750> went<00:02:08.560> ahead<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.890> use

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
or cover or plate I went ahead and use

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.069 
or cover or plate I went ahead and use
the<00:02:09.250> side<00:02:09.489> burner<00:02:09.700> for<00:02:10.030> my<00:02:10.149> propane<00:02:10.630> grill<00:02:10.869> I

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
the side burner for my propane grill I

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.979 
the side burner for my propane grill I
never<00:02:11.530> use<00:02:11.829> it<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.549> this<00:02:13.329> should<00:02:13.540> work<00:02:13.569> nicely

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
never use it so this should work nicely

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.009 
never use it so this should work nicely
for<00:02:14.230> my<00:02:14.440> rocket<00:02:14.860> stove<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.510> there<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.660> is

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
for my rocket stove and there it is

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.430 
for my rocket stove and there it is
on<00:02:17.110> top<00:02:17.379> of<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> rocket<00:02:17.829> stove<00:02:19.049> ready<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.290> go

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
on top of the rocket stove ready to go

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.180 
on top of the rocket stove ready to go
so<00:02:20.769> I<00:02:20.829> can<00:02:20.889> put<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> pot<00:02:21.579> a<00:02:21.850> pan<00:02:23.190> cast-iron

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
so I can put a pot a pan cast-iron

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.220 
so I can put a pot a pan cast-iron
skillet<00:02:24.760> anything<00:02:25.269> on<00:02:25.389> it<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:25.870> ready<00:02:26.019> to

go and finally when you're not using the

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.800 
go and finally when you're not using the
stove<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.069> can<00:02:30.250> use<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.700> second<00:02:31.120> 12<00:02:31.359> by<00:02:31.540> 12

when I'm the stove is not in use I can
get<00:02:56.079> that<00:02:56.230> paver<00:02:56.500> stone<00:02:56.859> put<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.579> on<00:02:57.670> top<00:02:57.880> of

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
get that paver stone put it on top of

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.409 
get that paver stone put it on top of
here<00:02:58.180> cover<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.690> up<00:02:59.609> pretty<00:03:00.609> much<00:03:00.849> I<00:03:01.120> don't

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419 
here cover it up pretty much I don't

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.370 
here cover it up pretty much I don't
know<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.660> could<00:03:01.810> see<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.200> because<00:03:04.380> but

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
know if you could see that because but

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.229 
know if you could see that because but
pretty<00:03:05.560> much<00:03:05.620> there's<00:03:05.919> two<00:03:06.069> vents<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:07.030> is

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
pretty much there's two vents this is

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.420 
pretty much there's two vents this is
where<00:03:07.419> the<00:03:07.510> airflow<00:03:07.930> comes<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.680> then<00:03:09.250> this

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
where the airflow comes in and then this

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.729 
where the airflow comes in and then this
is<00:03:09.609> where<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.790> will<00:03:10.060> feed<00:03:10.269> your<00:03:10.419> fire<00:03:10.690> or<00:03:11.380> your

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
is where you will feed your fire or your

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.509 
is where you will feed your fire or your
twigs<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.700> sticks<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.329> stuff<00:03:13.480> like<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.900> and

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
twigs and sticks and stuff like that and

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.860 
twigs and sticks and stuff like that and
pretty<00:03:15.519> much<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.910> fire<00:03:16.090> will<00:03:16.239> be<00:03:16.329> up<00:03:16.450> here<00:03:16.480> on

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
pretty much the fire will be up here on

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.569 
pretty much the fire will be up here on
this<00:03:17.079> top<00:03:17.319> shelf<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:18.250> airflow

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
this top shelf and the airflow

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.420 
this top shelf and the airflow
underneath<00:03:18.849> it<00:03:19.299> will<00:03:19.840> cause<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.410> pretty<00:03:21.250> much

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
underneath it will cause the pretty much

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.580 
underneath it will cause the pretty much
the<00:03:21.459> rocket<00:03:21.940> stove<00:03:22.120> effect<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.750> then<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.410> is

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
the rocket stove effect and then this is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.300 
the rocket stove effect and then this is
where<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:23.799> do<00:03:24.040> all<00:03:24.070> your<00:03:24.190> cooking<00:03:24.699> on<00:03:25.410> so

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
where you do all your cooking on so

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.930 
where you do all your cooking on so
yeah<00:03:28.030> I'm<00:03:28.330> pretty<00:03:28.540> happy<00:03:28.660> with<00:03:29.940> relatively

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
yeah I'm pretty happy with relatively

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.960 
yeah I'm pretty happy with relatively
easy<00:03:31.180> project<00:03:31.750> pretty<00:03:32.440> much<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:33.040> got<00:03:33.819> my

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
easy project pretty much I got my

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.580 
easy project pretty much I got my
propane<00:03:34.450> grill<00:03:34.690> I'm<00:03:34.959> just<00:03:35.170> going<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.319> set<00:03:35.560> it

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
right behind my propane grill so it's

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.390 
right behind my propane grill so it's
out<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.390> sight<00:03:37.660> not<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:38.080> mind<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.370> ever
