just<00:00:17.070> did<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> little<00:00:17.400> bit<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.699> free<00:00:17.850> play<00:00:18.000> here

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
just did a little bit of free play here

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.769 
just did a little bit of free play here
just<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.750> show<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> basics<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:21.060> as<00:00:21.539> you

just to show you the basics so as you

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.320 
just to show you the basics so as you
can<00:00:21.930> see<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.519> flying<00:00:23.519> across<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> map<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
can see here flying across the map is a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.120 
can see here flying across the map is a
great<00:00:24.570> way<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.750> score<00:00:25.109> points<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:25.890> control

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
great way to score points to get control

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.570 
great way to score points to get control
of<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> ball<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.010> way<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.160> want<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
of the ball so the way you want to do is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
of the ball so the way you want to do is
you<00:00:29.670> want<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.880> tap<00:00:30.060> X<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.109> soon<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.470> tap

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you want to tap X and as soon as you tap

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.410 
you want to tap X and as soon as you tap
X<00:00:31.890> once<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> hold<00:00:32.790> down<00:00:32.969> your<00:00:33.000> boost

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
X once you want to hold down your boost

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.500 
X once you want to hold down your boost
and<00:00:33.660> point<00:00:34.200> your<00:00:34.320> nose<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.829> sky<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and point your nose to the sky so the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.690 
and point your nose to the sky so the
easiest<00:00:37.140> way<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.350> control<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.399> think

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
easiest way to control it is to think

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330 
easiest way to control it is to think
like<00:00:39.180> you're<00:00:39.390> flying<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.200> private<00:00:40.739> jet<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.190> know

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
like you're flying a private jet I know

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.040 
like you're flying a private jet I know
it<00:00:41.520> sounds<00:00:41.760> kind<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.000> weird<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it sounds kind of weird because it's a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.020 
it sounds kind of weird because it's a
car<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.250> basically<00:00:44.489> what<00:00:44.879> you're

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
car but that's basically what you're

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.250 
car but that's basically what you're
doing<00:00:45.059> you're<00:00:45.390> flying<00:00:45.629> through<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> air<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
doing you're flying through the air at a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
doing you're flying through the air at a
high<00:00:46.410> rate<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.620> speed<00:00:46.800> trying<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> hit<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
high rate of speed trying to hit the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
high rate of speed trying to hit the
ball<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> great<00:00:49.350> way<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
ball and this is a great way to get a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.350 
ball and this is a great way to get a
jump<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.250> opponents<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.180> lot<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
jump on your opponents because a lot of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.760 
jump on your opponents because a lot of
times<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.870> hit<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> ball<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> height

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
times you can hit the ball at a height

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.229 
times you can hit the ball at a height
that<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:53.070> wouldn't<00:00:53.340> be<00:00:53.399> able<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.820> normally

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
that they wouldn't be able to normally

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.150 
that they wouldn't be able to normally
so<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.020> know<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.350> trick<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.070> an

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
so if you know this trick you can get an

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.430 
so if you know this trick you can get an
advantage<00:00:56.489> plus<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.719> could<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> lot<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.260> fun

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
advantage plus it could be a lot of fun

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.250 
advantage plus it could be a lot of fun
just<00:00:58.469> flying<00:00:58.859> around<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.340> doing<00:00:59.520> tricks<00:01:00.260> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
just flying around and doing tricks you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.020 
just flying around and doing tricks you
know<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.800> anything<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.430> flip

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
know you can do anything you can flip

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
jump now I don't know if anybody else is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.910 
jump now I don't know if anybody else is
doing<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> love<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> wall

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
doing this but I love to go up a wall

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.219 
doing this but I love to go up a wall
get<00:01:14.310> halfway<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.850> jump<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.570> fly<00:01:15.780> across

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
get halfway up jump and just fly across

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.570 
get halfway up jump and just fly across
the<00:01:16.380> air<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.250> kind<00:01:20.490> of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the air just like this it can be kind of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
the air just like this it can be kind of
hard<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.820> control<00:01:21.180> sometimes<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> can

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
hard to control sometimes but if you can

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.200 
hard to control sometimes but if you can
get<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> down<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:24.000> way<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
get it down it's a really good way to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.490 
get it down it's a really good way to
hit<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.479> ball<00:01:24.570> when<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.049> bouncing<00:01:25.350> real

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
hit the ball when it's bouncing real

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.140 
hit the ball when it's bouncing real
high<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> center<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> map<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.970> can
