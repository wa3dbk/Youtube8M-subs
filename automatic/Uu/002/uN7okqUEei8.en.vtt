00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
flipped it over once you get a spatula

flipped it over once you get a spatula
and<00:04:18.880> stir<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.900> bottom<00:04:23.200> that<00:04:23.350> was<00:04:23.470> on

the but the part that was on the bottom
is<00:04:25.600> now<00:04:25.810> up<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.350> then<00:04:26.500> stir<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.300> doesn't

is now up and then stir so it doesn't

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.590 
is now up and then stir so it doesn't
get<00:04:28.720> like<00:04:29.040> mushy

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
get like mushy

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.670 
get like mushy
okay<00:04:31.600> so<00:04:31.660> now<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.960> put<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.139> back<00:04:32.260> into<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.500> pot

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
okay so now you put it back into the pot

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.469 
okay so now you put it back into the pot
for<00:04:32.950> about<00:04:33.100> five<00:04:33.610> more<00:04:33.820> minutes<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.360> then

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
for about five more minutes and then

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.170 
for about five more minutes and then
it's<00:04:34.660> done<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:36.430> this<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.729> what<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:36.910> should<00:04:37.090> look

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
it's done so this is what I should look

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.659 
it's done so this is what I should look
like<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:38.320> should<00:04:38.530> be<00:04:38.970> nice<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.360> fluffy<00:04:40.720> and

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
like it should be nice and fluffy and

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.800 
like it should be nice and fluffy and
when<00:04:42.669> you<00:04:42.789> put<00:04:43.000> in<00:04:43.090> your<00:04:43.180> hands

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
when you put in your hands

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.950 
when you put in your hands
it<00:04:44.770> should<00:04:44.919> just<00:04:45.130> stick<00:04:45.390> see<00:04:46.390> like<00:04:46.720> you<00:04:46.840> can

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
it should just stick see like you can

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.070 
it should just stick see like you can
pick<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.140> up<00:04:47.350> like<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.039> whole<00:04:48.310> bunch<00:04:48.840> like<00:04:49.840> that

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
pick it up like a whole bunch like that

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.969 
pick it up like a whole bunch like that
and<00:04:50.350> then<00:04:50.919> just<00:04:51.400> crumble<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:51.910> like<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.979> and

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
and then just crumble it like that and

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.340 
and then just crumble it like that and
I'll<00:04:54.520> stick<00:04:54.850> it'll<00:04:55.240> turn<00:04:55.360> into<00:04:55.600> a<00:04:55.630> ball<00:04:55.810> you

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
I'll stick it'll turn into a ball you

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.969 
I'll stick it'll turn into a ball you
can<00:04:56.470> even<00:04:56.650> play<00:04:56.860> small<00:04:57.130> toast<00:04:57.400> no<00:04:57.669> multi<00:04:58.000> quit

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
can even play small toast no multi quit

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.690 
can even play small toast no multi quit
so

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.940 

so<00:05:04.700> if<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.060> don't<00:05:05.260> you<00:05:06.260> don't<00:05:06.530> have<00:05:06.680> one<00:05:06.830> of

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
so if you don't you don't have one of

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.880 
so if you don't you don't have one of
these<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:08.150> cow<00:05:08.390> or<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.660> cow<00:05:08.960> that's<00:05:09.650> what<00:05:09.800> it's

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890

called

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
called

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.020 
called
it's<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.730> bamboo<00:05:11.210> basket<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:12.740> can<00:05:12.880> if<00:05:13.880> you're

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
it's a bamboo basket you can if you're

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.280 
it's a bamboo basket you can if you're
just<00:05:14.210> starting<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.660> eating<00:05:14.960> it<00:05:15.020> right<00:05:15.170> away

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
just starting and eating it right away

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.850 
just starting and eating it right away
you<00:05:15.440> can<00:05:15.560> put<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:15.800> on<00:05:15.920> a<00:05:15.950> bowl<00:05:16.190> or<00:05:17.090> interval<00:05:17.450> and

you can put it on a bowl or interval and
but<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:18.950> problem<00:05:19.400> with<00:05:19.520> this<00:05:19.670> is<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:21.020> bottom

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
but the problem with this is the bottom

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.100 
but the problem with this is the bottom
all<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:22.120> moisture<00:05:23.120> will<00:05:23.390> go<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.960> bottom

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
all the moisture will go to the bottom

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.760 
all the moisture will go to the bottom
and<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:25.520> top<00:05:25.550> will<00:05:26.120> get<00:05:26.360> hard<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.290> the<00:05:27.470> bottom

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
and the top will get hard and the bottom

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.680 
and the top will get hard and the bottom
will<00:05:27.890> get<00:05:28.010> like<00:05:28.400> soggy<00:05:28.760> and<00:05:29.180> it'll<00:05:29.360> just<00:05:29.510> stick

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
will get like soggy and it'll just stick

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.590 
will get like soggy and it'll just stick
to<00:05:29.870> your<00:05:29.900> hands<00:05:30.200> which<00:05:30.530> is<00:05:30.560> not<00:05:30.830> good<00:05:31.300> um

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
to your hands which is not good um

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
but you know you can use it like this

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.630 
but you know you can use it like this
I'd<00:05:35.750> be<00:05:35.870> eating<00:05:36.050> it<00:05:36.230> right<00:05:36.380> away<00:05:36.470> also<00:05:37.310> you

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
cheesecloth you can put it on the bottom

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.510 
cheesecloth you can put it on the bottom
but<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:52.010> ziplock<00:05:52.760> bag<00:05:53.200> kind<00:05:54.200> of<00:05:54.410> holds<00:05:55.070> in<00:05:55.220> the

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
but the ziplock bag kind of holds in the
