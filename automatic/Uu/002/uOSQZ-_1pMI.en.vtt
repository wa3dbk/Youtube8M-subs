00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
get a chance to play I think he didn't

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.010 
get a chance to play I think he didn't
play<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> singer'<00:00:31.289> hand<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:32.250> whole<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.850> whole

play a singer' hand the whole the whole
time<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.590> he<00:00:34.829> called<00:00:35.040> once<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.550> then

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
time I think he called once and then

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
time I think he called once and then
folded<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.450> was<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:37.290> didn't<00:00:37.500> play

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
folded so it was like we didn't play

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.250 
folded so it was like we didn't play
your<00:00:37.770> hand<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.250> obviously<00:00:38.940> like

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260

some<00:02:03.000> more<00:02:03.090> events<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.420> year<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:04.439> he's<00:02:04.860> going

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
some more events this year if he's going

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.940 
some more events this year if he's going
I<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.549> he<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:06.210> what<00:02:06.689> what<00:02:07.020> keeps<00:02:07.590> him<00:02:07.770> from

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I think he like what what keeps him from

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.979 
I think he like what what keeps him from
going<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.789> there<00:02:09.420> are<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> lot<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
going is that there are a lot of

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.690 
going is that there are a lot of
festivals<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.739> Germany<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.340> Austria<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
festivals in Germany and Austria and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.470 
festivals in Germany and Austria and
wherever

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
wherever

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.920 
wherever
and<00:02:12.720> he<00:02:13.080> really<00:02:13.319> enjoys<00:02:13.709> those<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.629> think

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and he really enjoys those so I think

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.869 
and he really enjoys those so I think
that's<00:02:16.470> why<00:02:16.590> he's<00:02:16.739> not<00:02:16.920> going<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.459> full<00:02:17.610> time

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
that's why he's not going the full time

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.699 
that's why he's not going the full time
and<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.209> think<00:02:18.269> he<00:02:18.450> won't<00:02:18.629> but<00:02:19.260> you're<00:02:19.410> gonna<00:02:19.530> go
