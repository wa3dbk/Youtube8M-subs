00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
show you guys how I did that I start out

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.479 
show you guys how I did that I start out
by<00:00:53.270> positioning<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.449> decoration<00:00:55.170> tabs<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
by positioning my decoration tabs on the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.500 
by positioning my decoration tabs on the
wall<00:00:57.020> exactly<00:00:58.020> where<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.230> want<00:00:58.530> them<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.510> I'm

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
wall exactly where I want them to go I'm

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.770 
wall exactly where I want them to go I'm
using<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.140> command<00:01:01.760> decorating<00:01:02.760> clips<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
using the command decorating clips and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.509 
using the command decorating clips and
these<00:01:04.439> are<00:01:04.589> great<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.339> don't

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
these are great because they don't

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.000 
these are great because they don't
damage<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.119> walls<00:01:06.360> while<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> decorate<00:01:07.380> this

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
damage the walls while you decorate this

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.770 
damage the walls while you decorate this
is<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.580> look<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:08.880> they're<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.630> a

after I finished sticking all my clips
onto<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.509> wall<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.170> put<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.979> lights<00:01:50.250> all

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:01.450 
onto the wall I just put the lights all
the<00:01:50.579> way<00:01:50.820> around<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.869> this

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.750 

and<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.750> light<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.260> just<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.740> little<00:02:05.100> too<00:02:05.550> long

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
and the light was just a little too long

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.700 
and the light was just a little too long
so<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.150> wrapped<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.720> around<00:02:06.780> itself<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
so I wrapped it around itself at the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.430 
so I wrapped it around itself at the
bottom<00:02:08.149> then<00:02:09.149> using<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> same<00:02:09.899> decoration

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
bottom then using the same decoration

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.060 
bottom then using the same decoration
clips

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
clips
