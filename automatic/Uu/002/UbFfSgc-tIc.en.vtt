obviously it's just an app and it's free

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.480 
obviously it's just an app and it's free
but<00:05:39.569> I<00:05:39.899> think<00:05:40.229> it's<00:05:40.349> pretty<00:05:40.529> good<00:05:40.619> so<00:05:40.889> I'm<00:05:41.129> just

00:05:46.609 --> 00:05:46.619 
here to you what the app says it is I

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:47.389
