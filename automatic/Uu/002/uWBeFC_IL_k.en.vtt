00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 very good to all and welcome to game 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.319
 6 what I'm going to tell you today about 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.150
 theory about five nights af fredys 3 that 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.309
 it's about the cheering masks 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.009
 unique that scott the creator of the saga 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.280
 he has left us on his website together with 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.740
 the number 3 in it 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.960
 as we can see in the image there is a 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.970
 box with animated masks and coss of 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.730
 which we can recognize the child 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.040
 of the balloons toivonen mangle toy girl 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.110
 and a seemingly coffee-colored mask 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.119
 with a hat which is believed to be 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.220
 the most expensive of all freddy because 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.380
 is the only character in the saga who uses 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.150
 hat besides freddy but it's little 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.309
 likely to be the since all the 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.010
 Masks in the box are animatronic 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.620
 new 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.050
 good as I said earlier in the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.030
 image we can see a number 3 which 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.949
 means that these masks are 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.720
 related to the third game of the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.970
 saga that is in development 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.250
 but now let's try to save the image 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.380
 in our computer we can give 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.990
 mind that the image is called waka 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.900
 news what in Spanish means that 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.450
 we can use 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.250
 this made many people think 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.560
 than the animatronics to which 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.390
 belonged these masks were going to be 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.820
 in the third game since the image 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.310
 together with the title could mean 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.009
 that those animatronics were going to be used 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.720
 well now let's look at the new video 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.000
 that scott has uploaded to his channel in 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.939
 youtube a teaser trailer of five knight 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.030
 sad fredys 3 look at the minute 0 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.070
 with 58 on the right side of the animatronic or 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.159
 that attacks us is the same box of the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.890
 image and it is in our office 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.630
 besides, it's not just in the video if we 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.789
 we put in the link that is in the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.950
 description will take us to the page of 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.109
 steam so that we vote green light for the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.030
 game and we can see images of what 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.979
 it must be the beta of the game and if we 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.259
 we fix in the first image also 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.420
 is the box with the masks what 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.189
 leads to that very likely 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.229
 we can use those masks in the game 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.530
 as in the second but with several 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.110
 masks instead of one 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.360
 this would considerably increase the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.459
 difficulty of the game since I guess 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.040
 there will be animatronics that will only leave you 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.750
 in peace if you wear a specific mask what 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.790
 which would make it much more 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.250
 difficult if you have more than one animatronic 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.430
 or in front of you or you may also 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.859
 use for another purpose who knows 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.989
 that has been this short video about me 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:28.750
 theory leaves your theory down in the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.239
 comments if you liked do not forget to leave 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.189
 tour and remember that it's free and if 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.069
 you want more videos so subscribe to 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:39.209
 my channel that I do not charge x for that has 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.209
 been everything to god
