well<00:00:32.880> David<00:00:33.059> what<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.750> seeing<00:00:33.989> today<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
well David what we are seeing today is

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.190 
well David what we are seeing today is
just<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.190> teaser<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.820> things<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.540> come<00:00:36.719> because

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
just a teaser of things to come because

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.260 
just a teaser of things to come because
the<00:00:37.500> new<00:00:37.620> horizon<00:00:38.100> spacecraft<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.969> still

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the new horizon spacecraft is still

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
the new horizon spacecraft is still
millions<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.840> kilometers<00:00:40.290> away<00:00:40.440> from<00:00:40.590> Pluto

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
millions of kilometers away from Pluto

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
millions of kilometers away from Pluto
so<00:00:41.489> we're<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.670> seeing<00:00:42.030> some<00:00:42.390> fuzzy<00:00:42.750> details

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
so we're just seeing some fuzzy details

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
so we're just seeing some fuzzy details
on<00:00:43.469> July<00:00:44.129> fourteenth<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> come<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
on July fourteenth it's going to come to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.779 
on July fourteenth it's going to come to
within<00:00:45.840> about<00:00:45.960> 10<00:00:46.469> kilometers<00:00:47.280> we're<00:00:47.670> almost

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
within about 10 kilometers we're almost

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
within about 10 kilometers we're almost
going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> hit<00:00:48.300> Pluto<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.960> we'll<00:00:49.200> see

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
going to hit Pluto and we'll see

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.680 
going to hit Pluto and we'll see
incredible<00:00:50.100> detail<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.420> seeing

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
incredible detail but what we are seeing

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.569 
incredible detail but what we are seeing
so<00:00:51.989> far<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.469> Pluto<00:00:52.920> turns<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so far is that Pluto turns out to be a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.180 
so far is that Pluto turns out to be a
very<00:00:53.820> dynamic<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.750> interesting<00:00:55.020> world<00:00:55.469> these

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
very dynamic and interesting world these

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.770 
very dynamic and interesting world these
spots<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.820> we're<00:00:57.000> seeing<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> are

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
spots that we're seeing on it are

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.560 
spots that we're seeing on it are
probably<00:00:58.440> Isis<00:00:59.039> because<00:00:59.460> Pluto<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> nice

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
probably Isis because Pluto is a nice

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.630 
probably Isis because Pluto is a nice
world<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> realm<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.250> Isis

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
world it's out in the realm of Isis

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.939 
world it's out in the realm of Isis
beyond<00:01:03.000> Neptune<00:01:03.600> called<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> Kuiper<00:01:04.530> belt

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
beyond Neptune called the Kuiper belt

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.980 
beyond Neptune called the Kuiper belt
and<00:01:05.189> these<00:01:05.700> worlds<00:01:06.119> are<00:01:06.299> made<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.840> different

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and these worlds are made of different

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.230 
and these worlds are made of different
kinds<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.650> Isis<00:01:08.010> there's<00:01:08.280> water<00:01:08.549> ice<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.090> we

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
kinds of Isis there's water ice like we

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880 
kinds of Isis there's water ice like we
have<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.900> earth<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> freezes

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
have here on earth and when it freezes

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.740 
have here on earth and when it freezes
it's<00:01:11.250> nice<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.640> white<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.150> our<00:01:12.299> glaciers

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it's nice and white like our glaciers

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.899 
it's nice and white like our glaciers
but<00:01:13.320> then<00:01:13.470> there's<00:01:13.650> methane<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
but then there's methane that when it

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.850 
but then there's methane that when it
freezes<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.450> starts<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:15.900> blue<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.740> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
freezes it starts out blue and when it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.530 
freezes it starts out blue and when it
sits<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> Sun<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.700> while<00:01:17.909> turns<00:01:18.240> kind

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
sits in the Sun for a while turns kind

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.030 
sits in the Sun for a while turns kind
of<00:01:18.689> pink<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.140> we're<00:01:19.439> already<00:01:19.650> seeing<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
of pink and we're already seeing the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.370 
of pink and we're already seeing the
Pluto<00:01:20.610> has<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> kind<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.420> pinkish<00:01:21.810> color<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
Pluto has a kind of a pinkish color to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
Pluto has a kind of a pinkish color to
it<00:01:22.530> then<00:01:22.950> there's<00:01:23.159> nitrogen<00:01:23.790> ice<00:01:23.939> there's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it then there's nitrogen ice there's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
it then there's nitrogen ice there's
carbon<00:01:24.689> monoxide<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.159> these<00:01:26.310> things

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
carbon monoxide and all of these things

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.070 
carbon monoxide and all of these things
will<00:01:26.759> make<00:01:26.880> splotches<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.810> different

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
will make splotches and different

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.140 
will make splotches and different
patches<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> ground<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.549> when<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.909> see

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
patches on the ground so when we see

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
patches on the ground so when we see
these<00:01:30.360> blobs<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.470> we're<00:01:31.680> seeing<00:01:31.920> right<00:01:32.130> now

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
these blobs that we're seeing right now

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.030 
these blobs that we're seeing right now
they<00:01:32.880> could<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.329> either<00:01:33.570> ice<00:01:34.229> patches<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
they could be either ice patches on the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
they could be either ice patches on the
ground<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.369> are<00:01:35.579> coming<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.509> when

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
ground that are coming and going or when

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
ground that are coming and going or when
these<00:01:37.439> Isis<00:01:37.799> evaporate<00:01:38.400> they<00:01:38.729> form<00:01:39.030> clouds

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
these Isis evaporate they form clouds

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.899 
these Isis evaporate they form clouds
that<00:01:39.869> move<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.920> maybe<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.280> clouds<00:01:41.610> are

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that move around so maybe the clouds are

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.399 
that move around so maybe the clouds are
what<00:01:42.119> we're<00:01:42.270> seeing<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.689> maybe<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> clouds

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
what we're seeing or maybe the clouds
