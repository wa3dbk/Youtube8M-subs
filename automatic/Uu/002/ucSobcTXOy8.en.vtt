00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.270
2010 marked Resthaven's 75th anniversary.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.150
We decided to have a special celebration

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.810
to commemorate the anniversary.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.540
We focussed on various activities that

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.830
we would include, communities that we provide

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.610
services within and also key stakeholders

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.800
that we work with in providing

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.200
outstanding care to older people.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.620
Most students who are at university nowadays are

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.240
studying full time and working part time

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.100
So of course, when they're on clinical placement

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.540
they can't actually work.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.360
The scholarships really provide the opportunity

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.030
to be on placement without having to worry about working.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.700
I'm a mother, I'm a wife and I also have a mortgage.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.630
Receiving the scholarship means I can give up a day of work.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.350
Being a recipient of the scholarship certainly assists

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.100
with a lot of workshops, placement, in addition

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.670
to having to work a lot these days.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.600
It's a brilliant start to my Masters of Nursing (Nurse Practitioner).

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm raising three boys, so I was studying full time.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.170
So this takes the financial burden off of me quite a bit.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.190
Trying to work to pay for childcare while you're

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.870
working full time at a hospital is quite a challenge

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.740
so having that money from Resthaven

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.930
yeah, it'll be fantastic, it'll help me out a lot.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.540
I'll be able to just focus on my studies.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.700
Providing services to older people

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.740
provides an opportunity to make a difference

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.360
to the quality of life of people every day.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.070
We see nurses as critical to the quality

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.050
of care that older people receive.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.440
Looking after older people requires nurses

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.120
who've got really sound theoretical knowledge

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.530
and are able to apply that in practice.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.110
Looking after the older individual who might have

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.530
chronic disease and comorbidities

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.180
requires a level of expertise and knowledge

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.310
that I think a lot of other nurses don't actually understand.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.360
So, it's a very challenging career, but a very rewarding one.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.240
What my interest is is vascular access device insertion

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.160
for a range of treatments, be they infections or

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.370
afflictions that the aged community suffer from,

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.030
diabetes related illnesses.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.980
I've actually been an aged care worker since I was eighteen.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.030
I just found that I was working with someone for eight hours a day

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.040
and when there was something wrong

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.160
I didn't know medically what that was

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.780
and I found that frustrating.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.140
So that's why I've decided to do university

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.640
and become a registered nurse.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.580
I see myself nursing in the community and helping

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.310
aged people stay in their own homes for as long as possible

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.500
and have health support so that they can do so.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.400
I do notice a lot of the difference that so many people

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.900
are living in the community that perhaps shouldn't.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.660
So by staying in aged care and getting people

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.480
to look at it a little differently

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.640
hopefully I can make a difference in that way.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.740
We know that when our students graduate

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.600
and they're ready for employment

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.100
that they've met all of the graduate qualities of the university

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.610
That means they know how to work independently

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.190
but equally, they're comfortable in a team.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.520
They've got good communication skills

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.930
they know where they fit within the team

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.910
and within their industry

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.370
and also on top of that, they've also met all of the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.570
Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council standards

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.440
for practice, so they're ready for any industry partner

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.410
to take them and to move them forward.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.510
Yeah, I'd like to say thank you to Resthaven for providing

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.580
the opportunity for me to continue my nursing studies.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.140
I'd like to thank Resthaven for offering these scholarships.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.840
I congratulate recognising that nurses

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.590
are needing assistance and to also having the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.560
opportunity to be able to go back into aged care.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.130
I thank you Resthaven for my scholarship.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.940
It's going to help me out a lot.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.370
I just want to thank them so much for the opportunity to apply.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.950
It really does mean a lot to myself personally

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.130
in regards to my circumstances and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.680
I can't wait to represent Resthaven to the best of my ability

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.640
and apply what I do to the aged community.
