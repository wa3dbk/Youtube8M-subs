00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.619
 At the end of the video I'll explain all 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.800
 the products I used in detail 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:35.410

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.310
 This is where the capital is. 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.310

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:51.450
 There it is so 30ml 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.230
 in this little pot that in the case would be half 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.579
 of packaging 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.579

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.130
 It's a dalva part that's a rebuilder. 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.590
 to put in the coloring or 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:40.780
 discoloration I'll put it well 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:42.430
 a little bit to put sound even just 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:52.510
 I'll have a good smell of it. 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.660
 so I applied back already, I do not 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.280
 It is not just right is not applied in the world 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.930
 any way between China and 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.430
 Brazil is on the wrong side of the same tac 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.550
 my husband put the reverse side 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.750
 on purpose and then put the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.619
 spirit of being able to see then now I go 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.619
 apply in front 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.079
 That's good, but you act for what? 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.170
 he is not marked 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:30.489
 so people have just applied leftovers 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.109
 a little about a people and I'll wait 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:38.650
 30 minutes and then I'll rinse 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:41.260
 I'll treat my hair and then I'll come 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.200
 the end result for you is 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.870
 then up in a minute and we 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.090
 I already finished the web that my 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.010
 hair does not fully fall asleep 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.680
 and I'm afraid he'll wake me up 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.750
 I could not finish the video, it's before 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.980
 Anyway, I wanted to say that I did not 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.760
 I'm professional 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.280
 it's all I've done here I learned in 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.280
 researching and vide blog I researched 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.389
 a lot of people, I really did 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.620
 researches 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.450
 I analyzed several videos so it was not 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.280
 something like that made her crazy and 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.769
 to do is not this was all analyzed the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.319
 products everything I used I researched 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.290
 then people like you can see the 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.810
 result I really liked a good 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.930
 payer is in the copper chain 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.379
 I did not know if I could see right. 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:37.510
 there through the camera because I tried it 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:39.329
 to move the camera and such, and I got more 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.949
 or less but I could not perfectly 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.659
 but anyway the result is there I liked it 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.000
 very super approved 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.699
 remembering that I'm not professional're 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.519
 I just simply searched a lot 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.560
 information I'm looking for a lot of information 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.109
 When I want to do something in my 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.129
 I've been searching a lot of hair before 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.510
 to do then we go to the products is not the 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.459
 That was the ink 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.940
 dark blond of the parf that ink that 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:15.310
 it does not contain ammonia does not contain ammonia 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.920
 and together with an activator, he does not 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.820
 also has 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.010
 is a volume of 10 20 and 30 it does not contain 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.440
 the volume also does not contain ammonia 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.180
 neither is a product that 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.300
 will not damage your hair with a 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.330
 ink with ammonia would do damage 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.690
 plus he will not damage his hair and 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:42.270
 It's what I did I did the 2-for-1 mix 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:47.600
 is to put 60 ml of hydrogen peroxide 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:50.370
 activator, and I put 30 ml of ink 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.250
 It's always good, I think it's a lot. 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.040
 important you buy a month of 2 and 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.410
 these meters sell at 23 reais in the 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.650
 I would smoke because you will have 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.080
 sure you can not do anything 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.110
 It has to be the right measure even then I 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.840
 I used the meter as you saw it. 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.270
 a little of that bush to have here of the alpha 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.550
 I found a video so I'll go 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.170
 leave the link of a channel that I so 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.020
 I'm in love, you're a pro. 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.610
 She's excellent at what she does so I'm going 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.730
 leave the link from her channel that I 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.160
 I discovered this bush on her channel that is 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.160
 a bug to mix in discoloration 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.640
 or coloration there will treat the hair 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.270
 also and I paid I bought in the market 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.770
 free 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.660
 I found the free market I think 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.640
 which was 16 reais that I paid for 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.460
 because I used the dark blonde because the 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.620
 dark blonde when she fades into her 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.890
 will open a brown and not to charge and 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.050
 And that's why I choose far I 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:53.610
 I paid her and I kept the marchinha here 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:56.520
 I paid for that 1995 ink on Activator 7 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.200
 95 and then after she after I 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.140
 I stayed 40 minutes with the paint on my hair. 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.450
 She's going to have my hair with that shampoo. 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.330
 that transparent and then to do with 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.980
 this one here is the strength brand shampoo 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.160
 of the land I bought in the world see me 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.890

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.580
 congratulating mineral oil it promises and 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:21.480

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.200
 hair it has a very liquid texture 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.840

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.430
 and it's green ado t by gila even 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.280
 The smell of clay did not please me very much. 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.970
 but finally they jaborandi and clay and 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.720
 avocado 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:38.280
 It's there, I warned you, I did. 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:42.270

 I understand beauty in the beauty of the web is 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.970

 that before doing any chemistry like 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:41.380
