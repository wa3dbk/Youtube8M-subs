00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
weight gaining the other one is the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.899 
weight gaining the other one is the
squats<00:01:54.840> now<00:01:55.079> these<00:01:55.320> compound<00:01:55.890> exercises<00:01:56.460> work

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
squats now these compound exercises work

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.179 
squats now these compound exercises work
