 I bring you to know better about this 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.500
 application 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.140
 good as you already know in all 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.570
 applications that I have brought to you are 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.040
 to go here in what is the app store and 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.739
 they are going to look for the next application 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.510
 how can you so call quiz op here 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.920
 is the icon the truth is very good 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.079
 This application is very well done and 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.820
 pretty good the game if they do not reach 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.980
 see here I leave you in this part to 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.570
 to look for it and download it and once 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.850
 that they have downloaded it, we are going to go 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.180
 here in the option to open and we will 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.940
 load the application 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.290
 this application is pretty pretty 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.720
 well done and I liked it very much 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.210
 is quite adapted to what it is today 7 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.040
 and so here we have different types of 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.500
 themes depending on what we want to play 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.410
 we are applying this game is 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.970
 about questions where you compete against 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.640
 others from around the world 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.290
 here we have different here I'm going to 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.290
 choose let's see 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.050
 let's choose what is videogames 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.670
 videogames is well recommended and 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.710
 you can select any that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.510
 it's down if you have one of art here 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.030
 can you see any kind of 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.950
 paintings depending on the theme that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.450
 you dominate more here we also have 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.740
 of movies are different types of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.720
 games that we have different types of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.150
 topics to participate in this better than 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.740
 will choose here one of sports-the break 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.230
 and sports in general and dance 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.690
 traditional here in play now and 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.950
 automatically asked us is very 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.390
 likely that when you start the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.460
 application tell them you want to start 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.840
 account on facebook you give them yes 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.040
 so they can access without any 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.440
 problem 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.440
 it's quite pretty fast and so 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.780
 here we have it there is loading here 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.020
 he tells me is the question that what was the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.420
 that he won the winter games here 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.160
 I do not know between unit to latine like 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.530
 can see here it went green and so 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.530
 does not increase this level when playing 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.239
 it tells me we're going to select how they can 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.920
 see is very very good and I got my 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.050
 score level 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.170
 this is a bit in English, so the truth 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.530
 if it is understood there are others that on wolves 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.640
 you reassign the truth is 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.250
 quite pretty good and goes together 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.989
 different points and you are increasing 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.780
 how can I see that I have 50 and my 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.190
 opponent has 20 as you can see 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.750
 here I was wrong I put it in red 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.750
 but it is as you go past the rounds 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.650
 here is africa is the top of the for 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.650
 that they see 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.940
 and the truth is very even 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.940
 we'll see 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.300
 as you can see it is loading 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.989
 and then all this is for time is going 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.989
 saying here on the top 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.620
 here 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.860
 we are wrong to see if he is wrong 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.860
 all right 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.019
 and as you can see here it tells me that I 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.640
 win and we go collecting different points 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.650
 the memory the only detail is that it is 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.230
 in English but the truth is quite 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.780
 Well, the one I like the most is the one 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.030
 wolves here we have it 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.690
 and we're going to play it so they can see that 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.610
 everything is questions so direct 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.960
 copa de mÃ©rida tells me what he is looking for 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.960
 the user against whom I am going to play 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.390
 and then I'm playing with someone from 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.970
 Kenya 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.160
 and then the other people around the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.080
 world 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.890
 says that the service is obviously 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.890
 it's gmail 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.610
 as there tells me that what is that is from 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.130
 adje this is a subject that has a little 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.540
 more than the other and well, we're going a lot 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.540
 pretty even 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:30.169
 of a liquor of this one 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.139
 just hit brand there's no 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.749
 problem 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.430
 here he tells me it's the world here we go 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:40.040
 to select them 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.180
 and the right to all the questions like that 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.180
 that I'm losing right now 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.139
 this 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.380
 there is the just fine tuning and then 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.910
 we are tied 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.230
 the very very good high this game very 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.880
 entertaining we also need internet 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.880
 so let's go to 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.330
 we are still tied in this game 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.820
 and this is from chelsea and chelsea I won 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.820

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.960
 so I win for having answered it and 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.520
