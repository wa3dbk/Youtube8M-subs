 parentheses but random house are going to 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.070

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.980
 hello that as friends are I like 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.370

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.410
 to read moments and now he's about to 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.640
 take out a book and I hope that you 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 like it and want it and have fun with the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 windsor 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:56.170
 they bring us nothing more and nothing less than the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.120
 book of werevertumorro and that famous 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.280
 acclaimed and master mind of writing 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.850
 that appears on the chips and 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.740
 kindness name and seriously there 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.810
 speaking seriously what happens to them I have a 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.240
 random house before they were cool like 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.970
 I would say conversion are those who perhaps follow 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.950
 the rainbow path to get to the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.950
 pot of gold just like did planet 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.250
 publishing ridiculous youtubers books 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.720
 this sounds too ridiculous that is me 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.910
 I understand that it is a formula that gives 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.300
 extra benefits to the editorial but 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.330
 part of ridiculous copy next super 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.360
 editorial sale is just a guy from 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.390
 about 28 29 years that is dedicated to being 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.360
 youtube on the branch of clear comedy 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.850
 amuse the masses on YouTube 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.429
 mainly young young people who 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.179
 I like the comedy of pastelazo 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.520
 the easy laugh by observing 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.800
 nonsense that perhaps in your books is going to 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.890
 talk about the recycled jokes of 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.140
 the tea and casandra 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.920
 I would not say something pathetic like that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.560
 pathetic really nothing has to do 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.259
 in a literary world they already presented us 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.810
 the news in which our writer 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.140
 prodigy in a few months will publish his 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.110
 book here in mexico a book to which he 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.350
 He dedicated important months of hard work 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.140
 I work writing without stopping myself maybe 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.540
 write of wonder as write as a 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.060
 teacher but reading is not your thing we see 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.830
 how he was cheated by his manager for not 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.860
 have read the contract I did not even 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.410
 finished college not even 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.239
 he studied letters he does not even have a 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.760
 extensive literary baggage to his credit 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.269
 really the books that are behind 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.269
 him in his decoration in his videos not the 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.100
 has read in the admitted then that 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.010
 can contribute to the world of literature 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.250
 There may be a tumor, I wonder, I do not 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.810
 I bet you nothing really you 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.420
 believe that the new book of 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.890
 werevertumorro be the revelation of the year 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.890
 that is pressing 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.080
 not to mention a nobel or maybe yes maybe 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.200
 be our second Nobel literature 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.280
 in our country with the book entitled ay 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.709
 what but puppies that surely can 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.780
 have a tumor is not a very character 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.030
 charismatic that motivates joy to 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.070
 many young people love their style of 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.290
 humor is fine is a means of 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.870
 free youtube entertainment that 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.970
 well there's nothing really wrong with 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.640
 I like that another of its content 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.090
 but this literature is not going anything 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.709
 it's really just a money magnet for 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.120
 the editorial and today I'm not saying 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.650
 in favor ever tomorrow you have prohibited 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.720
 write nobody is forbidding you 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.000
 write really I do not even think that 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.330
 he wrote that book they write for him 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.910
 and they only put his face and his name 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.860
 stamped on the book to sell 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.170
 obviously and they put it as the author 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.090
 intellectual everything is motivated by a 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.790
 mutual agreement d 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.590
 to the gains for both him and the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.569
 editorial and well I missed a bit of 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.450
 penguin because he had it in a 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.860
 concept moderately high good and 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.080
 it will surely be a sales phenomenon 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.690
 that sells a large number of copies 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.190
 I would be surprised if it has a price 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.040
 moderately low buy us other 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.709
 books but good its price is not like 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.630
 its quality but in this case lower 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.690
 even null as he does not mention in the 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.550
 video is going to make us laugh and good to me 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.740
 which publish these books not 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.450
 it causes me no grace remember before 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.419
 that to publish a book you had to 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.740
 have such literary baggage references 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:39.020
 of other works have a narrative style 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.630
 special have imagination originality 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.580
 to longing to express their feelings 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.880
 in a story and not this kind of 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.490
 nonsense like what happens to bloggers 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.160
 that anything that happens to them 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.139
 the mind puts it there and it's only 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.999
 threw up 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.949
 It's a shame that in Mexico I know 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.900
 literature promoted in Mexico not 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.689
 it is characterized for being a reading country 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.430
 but hey that they read this type of 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.330
 content 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.820
 no, it's not like books, because really 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.340
 reading this type of literature does not entail 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.380
 the depth that supports it with 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.009
 priority does not transport us to a 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:23.939
 world beyond our imagination 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:26.490
 plasma a reality that we live not us 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.800
 leave a teaching in itself and good 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.839
 it's a shame I only fulfill my 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.569
 committed here in I say is my job 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:35.580
 do this I like to go back I like it 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.559
 wherever I have nothing against him 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.039
 I think it's a boy who has made a 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:43.949
 Exceptional work on YouTube contributing 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:47.999
 what is today blogger today in 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:50.460
 day with his cool mood before now it's 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:52.499
 a little recycled that can be done 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.120
 really if it's a snuff but good 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:56.189

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.789
