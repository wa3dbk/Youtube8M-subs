00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.160
 hi everyone today we get 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.309
 found for a new short video 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.080
 we end up on the eyelashes this 4g you 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.300
 therefore presented the different codes of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.040
 cheat that binds to the season all of a 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.980
 little good live sound you do not hear 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.000
 more and that close my window 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.880
 so I'm going to show you the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.779
 different cheat codes and for 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 insert his cheat codes 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.660
 it must be low just open the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.240
 console then for you the console you 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.130
 go and press mhc control it's in 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 same time and that you will have a small 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.940
 my console on the top left 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.730
 very important me I met this 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 problem because bah I had not 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.300
 as they say but azogui azot of 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.950
 small streets to do more screen 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.190
 quickly actually it's a shortcut of 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.340
 gas also the match control that's it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.879
 against caa1 screen to do the scan x 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.520
 quite simply 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.559
 so I uninstalled gazeau so that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.050
 the console opens so if the console does 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.110
 not open we were trying to find bah 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.119
 why is it that you have ceased 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.210
 three points it's this combination of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.740
 forgiveness keys who is someone who 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.330
 uses is simply then your 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 site start with the simflouz so 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.799
 money opened your console there 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.770
 just need to mark ka-shing and 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.619
 if you want miles from there and there 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.290
 it gives me 2006 game but borloo of his 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.540
 featured 50000 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.549
 there is also to see your species including 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.399
 you mark fps sounds it's okay 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:39.100
 mark you 're ps right here i'm trying 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:41.610
 to remove his sail to the ola we see it 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.610
 well the fps 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.039
 then you raise them mark you 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.549
 fps off 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.950
 it's easier if you want 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.110
 hide the bubbles of pons and peaks 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:02.530
 you simply mark it 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:07.869
 head lime effect sauce otherwise 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.119
 remove the little bubbles early the ball 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.849
 little text bubbles or with the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.980
 images all that stupid to think there had been 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:21.580
 I'm sorry, I have you 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.930
 to admit that I do not know there a 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.299
 joke after randomly in the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.040
 cheats code window 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:31.660
 ok I do not know what game it does work 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:36.100
 not veiled is going on a mom thing that 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.480
 will you put a joke right there after 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.579
 the advertised things we prefer 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.750
 basically not pass in fullscreen me 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.840
 I did not do otherwise we ricordi 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.909
 kidding 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.650
 bascou the screen own change your thing 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.739
 who have been so full screen of for 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.409
 pass your window there is also the 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:58.299
 fault muhly made but not talk like 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:04.180
 it's very c0 capital 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:06.609
 doubts all the trimmings like that and 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:12.400
 I'm called tomorrow in his 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:16.569
 dribbling so that's his green so have there 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.569
 what did they do know how to ride my thune 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.189
 finally I would say that cheat codes 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.889
 there are some fact that we can 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:26.019
 not see directly and simply passed 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.799
 rather long-term stuff like 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.859
 for example the title that so they 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.209
 call it the bubble of thinking that's it 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.620
 well it's as you go down 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.489
 note that he is no longer present 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.959
 you have the slow motion I see here I have 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.730
 not want to write then a super things 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.040
 interesting and to unlock all 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.049
 game clothes you mark at lock 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.419
 out 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.329
 fit good you mark hockey and 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.769
 when you have created a new sim 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.090
 you will see all the clothes of the 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.979
 game including the clothes of 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.609
 careers sees then you also have 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:08.470
 reset sim so loudon monza I would put 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.190
 she is clean 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:17.260
 that's the way to keep it nasa 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:21.300
 the completely breizh is needed if I 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.449
 redo it's just a test we could see 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.260
 shit 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:34.430
 reset sim m is green 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:36.440
 silva which I put on the road yeah that's 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.210
 that it was actually it's mostly we're going 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.620
 say 1,1 of the bugs 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.500
 here we are going to say that it is one of the bugs 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.450
 then I read you it's a code that 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.180
 allows you to lift abc the very ground 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.820
 when there are walls you have 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.690
 can move objects without them 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.120
 return to the floor grid 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.810
 you have objects are more blurry 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.250
 that you're going to zoom in on task already 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.560
 tell everything one thing that I do not know says 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.590
 you can mark lte here it puts you 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.080
 so all the possible sites so the 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.660
 the money I showed you move 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.390
 freely every 6 May all objects 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:24.850
 unleaded can quickly show my 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:24.850
 object that we see there unfortunately alas 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.550
 oh okay so that's it going to do that to you 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.100
 we are young people allows 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.080
 to increase or decrease the need for 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.370
 change careers so we changed 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.870
 career by clicking on the box 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:51.200
 letters and many other things 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:54.050
 so we will put testing chic and nile 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:06:01.010
 breeze all here we will try 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:04.190
 by the way you become the ambassador to 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.660
 we can not go and we can not go 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.890
 but hey it works like that I said he 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.660
 there's stuff that hurried too long 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.830
 long term 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.540
 so here I think we went around 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.730
 from the bottom of all the codes 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.520
 he does not have his time hundreds 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.450
 up to a million exactly but see it 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.590
 a fortnight the antenna so 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.300
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.110
 will have pleased 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.700
 do not forget the little lake 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.530
 comment and subscribers the string though 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.170
 it's not already done i 'll you 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.780
 propose more than 6 4 because I think 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:37.250
 moment i'm more on sims same 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:39.290
 if they play no more than that but the game 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.740
 that I play more his cheek enormously 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:46.600
 it's sims 4 du so that's it 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.600
 take care of yourself and it will be long
