keys<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:41.660> pumping<00:01:41.990> out<00:01:42.110> now<00:01:42.650> granted<00:01:43.100> it

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
keys that is pumping out now granted it

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.830 
keys that is pumping out now granted it
gives<00:01:43.400> me<00:01:43.520> like<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.790> same<00:01:44.000> eight<00:01:44.270> nine<00:01:44.540> ten

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
gives me like the same eight nine ten

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.600 
gives me like the same eight nine ten
keys<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.620> don't<00:01:45.860> really<00:01:45.950> know<00:01:46.190> if<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.430> would
