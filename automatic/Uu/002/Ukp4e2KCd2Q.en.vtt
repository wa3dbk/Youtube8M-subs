at seven and nine I believe their main
off<00:00:28.619> season<00:00:28.980> goal<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:30.119> address<00:00:30.269> the

you and Seattle might think that you
know<00:00:34.469> that's<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.010> big<00:00:35.309> deal<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.880> not

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
touchdowns 13 interceptions it's fairly

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.870 
touchdowns 13 interceptions it's fairly
all<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.180> know<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:04.159> not<00:02:05.159> too<00:02:05.430> good<00:02:05.670> not

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
all right you know not not too good not

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.630 
all right you know not not too good not
too<00:02:06.119> bad<00:02:06.390> he<00:02:07.259> did<00:02:07.469> produce<00:02:07.829> there<00:02:08.520> was

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
too bad he did produce there was

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.510 
too bad he did produce there was
production<00:02:09.149> there<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:10.080> i<00:02:10.560> believe<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
production there but i believe the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.130 
production there but i believe the
quarterback<00:02:12.000> position

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
quarterback position

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.309 
quarterback position
could<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.410> addressed<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.210> draft<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.780> I

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
could be addressed in the draft and I

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.840 
could be addressed in the draft and I
believe<00:02:16.530> they<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.800> take<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.010> look<00:02:17.250> at<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.610> a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
believe they can take a look at to a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.000 
believe they can take a look at to a
couple<00:02:18.270> guys<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.380> draft<00:02:19.770> and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
couple guys in the in the draft and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.940 
couple guys in the in the draft and
April<00:02:20.459> on<00:02:20.750> one<00:02:21.750> being<00:02:21.959> quarterback<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.770> being

a<00:02:23.040> defensive<00:02:23.520> end<00:02:23.700> Ryan<00:02:24.600> Tannehill<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.260> believe

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
a defensive end Ryan Tannehill I believe

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
a defensive end Ryan Tannehill I believe
could<00:02:26.190> be<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.520> guy<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.700> they<00:02:27.150> end<00:02:27.360> up

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
could be the guy that they end up

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.920 
could be the guy that they end up
looking<00:02:27.840> at<00:02:27.990> in<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:28.890> draft<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.700> say<00:02:30.660> Ryan

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
Tannehill because he very well could be

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.850 
Tannehill because he very well could be
the<00:02:33.150> number<00:02:33.420> three<00:02:33.660> guy<00:02:33.810> behind<00:02:34.200> andrew<00:02:34.620> luck
