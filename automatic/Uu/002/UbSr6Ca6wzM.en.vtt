00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:14.010
 So before you camera sony and with 30 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.230
 and accessory days which has 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:21.890
 marking while wm 1 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.739
 designed for mounting the camera 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.450
 Action camera by sony on hand 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:32.340
 Suitable for both these models and 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.790
 other models excuse proper 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.260
 mounts are quite expensive of course for 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 normal attachment to the hands of which 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:47.040
 imagine everything here is a couple of plastic 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:50.370
 some kind of gum and strap but accessories 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.420
 here to these cameras sonic really expensive 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.220
 there's nothing you can do but nonetheless 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.000
 I nevertheless decided to take them all on the mark 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.000
 or head 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.630
 despite their price so that represents 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.530
 of yourself 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:21.600
 accessory well, nothing particularly standard 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:23.929
 mount on your arm here like it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.929
 fastens 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.290
 rotates in any direction 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.630
 comfortable enough of course did nothing 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.220
 you can not say something difficult to replace 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.689
 such original strap Sora 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:54.659
 why because there are analogues 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:58.140
 the same there is no charge only from 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.850
 gopro fit straps through 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.399
 adapter but they are somehow worse 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.130
 made mount they are not like that 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.619
 all live this strap more interesting 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.619
 appears and more comfortable 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.540
 this case 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.540
 screwed 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:39.000
 and so enough for the lord comes in 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.460
 here 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.510
 so the camera keeps 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:58.180
 Well, of course it does not fall out because 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:00.490
 which does not hold much in this way 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.960
 Well, there is no accident 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.960
 take off you wonâ€™t lose exactly 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.230
 that is, you can shoot any angle here 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.230
 so at least shoot yourself there 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.130
 the application may be the most 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.890
 varied anywhere absolutely 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.040
 you can use this strap 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.110
 just for shooting in order for the camera 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.360
 firstly lie in the hands of the second so 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.970
 she is not not not lost not lost 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:54.350
 if you fell there somewhere or just 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.200
 movement on Sasha reliable keeps 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:03.350
 nothing will happen to her so the thing 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:08.030
 just go the right nothing is lost 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.209
 or again I repeat some look 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.150
 replacement for her because 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.010
 accessories for 2 in general and a whole bunch 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.799
 not cheap steppes there from anywhere you can 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.930
 order whole there whole packs for everything 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:28.550
 Immediately reinforcement will also be an option 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:35.660
 put samples what else can you tell 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:38.560
 pro strap powerful lights what's here 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.560
 rubber what surface is it soft 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.180
 top of the drum due to which 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.919
 This plastic is required and 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.970
 moves 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:55.720
 Well, the mount itself all that he himself 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.720
