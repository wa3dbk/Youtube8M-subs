00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.839
 the ipad is a very versatile equipment that 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.149
 always accompanies us wherever we go to 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.639
 provide us with hours and hours of content 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.100
 multimedia from its first versions 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.289
 I always had multiple songs ready 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.099
 for us and in the most 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.619
 modern even more like videos podcasts and 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.539
 games but many said that you 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.590
 a vital function was missing 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.810
 for them the radio 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.600
 well today the accessory will be taught 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.150
 original that made apple to be able 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.220
 use black radio matters in what 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.450
 you are watching is like an ipod shuffle 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.730
 just that with cable with clamp and all 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.540
 very well since its operation is very 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:51.100
 simple we just have to connect the 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:55.250
 ipod to the accessory and that's it and we have 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.470
 as you can see the radio function 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.380
 you have to admit that sounds pretty 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.220
 well and if the operation is very 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.010
 simple has nothing complex 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.360
 so good for very little money because 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.060
 nor beige can you find this 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.950
 accessory you can have the ration the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.640
 ipod and you do not have to carry an ipod and 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.450
 a radio simply the iphone and this 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.760
 which many will like too 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.710
 how is it also integrated with the ipod 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.890
 serves as command as the command of the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.479
 apple headphones alone that with the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 advantage that as you can put the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.670
 headphones that you want so you can 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.570
 use a plug headphones without 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.420
 spend a lot of money 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.090
 and good as you can see then you can 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.850
 pass songs down and up volume 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.980
 put a pause back on play 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.680
 all 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.690
 the old ipad the interface of the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.270
 This radio application was very 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.480
 similar to the interface of the old 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.920
 mac or sx versions which is good 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.110
 very nostalgic and good now the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.009
 old users will love that 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.720
 polished metallic shine 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.069
 it works well in all 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.650
 old versions of those in front 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.090
 well this has been all for today remember 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.670
 that soon you can see my review of 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.659
 power more than 4 I'm working on it 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.480
 quite so I hope you like it that way 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.810
 how good I think little by little 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.810
 soon
