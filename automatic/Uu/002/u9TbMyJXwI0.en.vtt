00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:17.370
 here is our suspense base and they arrive 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.370
 calmly but here is our dear base 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.090
 but that fall has changed efficiently and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.090
 that's enough 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.250
 the first question for you luisa is the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.730
 following 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.360
 what is the European percentage of groundwater

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.870
 that if not 20 percent do it in 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.489
 which was born very well but I certainly must 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.010

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.170
 exactly the law I love you polluting 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.390
 with our hands bars he followed the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.489
 institutions such as a parachutist who at a 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.470
 throw yourself and the finger to jump without it 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.820
 parachute what so much the face of 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.820
 wimm one wide 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.150
 since you now 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.090
 this I must say 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.840

 front finger closes face from the said al 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.400
 after the second one is concentrated 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.060
 question for her is how much water 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.880
 we consume on average a day there are 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.250

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.530
 floors in another five liters of is 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.090
 minimum and give water to the flowers will be 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.500

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.090

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.769

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:46.350
 worrying though pink luisa you are them 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.350
 name laura I had the same 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.400
 she is truly an inviting tidbit 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.290
 but we need to focus on this 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.329
 will be a way to deepen our own 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.519
 knowledge however for now we have not 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.620
 bait from the script I cordially face 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.400
 to continue 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.049
 we have the third question for you and if 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.340
 answers this last question she will be 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.340
 our first champion 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:37.630
 nothing then does not see the grandmother warms 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:40.840
 in the then the question for her and must 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.500
 cite at least three ways of saying that 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.220
 speak of the water theme or the first I know 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.320
 just denied the proverbs mario reg 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.170
 as an effect, I do n't want to use it 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.200
 on the water but concentrate you will see that 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.790
 you have to work three ways to say about mi 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.130
 I feel this water in my throat 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.410
 question do you not go to school in the 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.080
 projects as my soap and water would do 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.540
 Madam temperament questions 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.550
 changed mommy well then we see a 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.040
 little if Aosta directed pass us so 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.770
 we can change the question or why you 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.250
 Numeric proverbs is indeed a sin 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.900
 but it is water in the mouth 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.870
 OK, but the question for her is a lot 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:31.540
 unfortunately more difficult to tell the movies 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:32.830
 how I feel if I ask her for it later 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.860
 that we accepted the joker of the 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.050
 exchange is the following very complicated is 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.190
 how to recognize a good at school 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.380
 hydraulic saw 10 in the duct 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.240
 the correct answer to understand who the first one 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.240
 see if it's luisa sharpened 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.740
 and sometimes we say these compliments 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.199
 young people of today are just beautiful instead 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.780
 our beautiful and intelligent luisa he 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.340
 today he is a good presenter but he is 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.830
 making bones as they say for 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:10.180
 which since then saw that if trio become 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.180
 bones and powers starting with a shoulder blade 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.820
 Yup 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.629
 knowledge 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.140
 of course 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.120
 gp 

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:56.229
 energy but let's ask ourselves this way 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:06:00.149
 suddenly mario sorry but this is it 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.149
 time of the apples north of the lemons 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.889
