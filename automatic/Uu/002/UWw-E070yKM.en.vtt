Dylan's<00:03:50.230> simplistic<00:03:50.859> artwork<00:03:51.280> even<00:03:51.549> though

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
Dylan's simplistic artwork even though

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.580

if<00:03:52.420> he<00:03:52.510> tried<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.840> draw<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.170> way<00:03:53.319> it's

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
if he tried to draw that way it's

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.610 
if he tried to draw that way it's
totally<00:03:53.920> not<00:03:54.370> simple<00:03:54.790> at<00:03:54.880> all<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.239> really

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
totally not simple at all and really

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.660 
totally not simple at all and really
probably<00:03:56.620> harder<00:03:56.950> than<00:03:57.100> people<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.549> can

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
probably harder than people that can

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.830 
probably harder than people that can
