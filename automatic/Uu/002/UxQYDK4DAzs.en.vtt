 are afraid 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.989
 then we must decide on the plan 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:15.549
 which we need to speed up 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.490
 it should be video and audio files 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.199
 if you have already decided to do 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.820

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.010
 minutes 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.820
 change the speed of the whole file will come 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.820
 let's edge so 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.160
 to change the speed of the video file 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.059
 we need to hover over any 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.160

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.530
 lego pull accelerated 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.620
 first let's do the acceleration 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.620
 let's see what we get 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.810
 great isn't it 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.630

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.370
 heel line with changing speed 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.840
 saw now bass guitar became still 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.600
