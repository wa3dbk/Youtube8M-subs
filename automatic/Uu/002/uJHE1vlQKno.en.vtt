00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.030
 very good to all people I am a machine that 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.190
 Today I bring you a new video of Kate 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.490
 walsh 2 this time I bring you the missions 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 initials of the sylvari race and good 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 let's start the truth is that neither 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.130
 I want to extend a lot and because this 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.630
 is going to finish the good beta although to 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 a few hours will actually give me 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.070
 time to burn some things 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.019
 and well this is basically so that 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.300
 see the first missions and the first 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.920
 boss that we have here always the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.379
 initial missions this is going to happen 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.570
 that is in English as you already know in 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.519
 the first missions are always from the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.350
 personal story this little symbol that 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:49.879
 you see here the light plan in plan 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.879
 star is the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.710
 is the icon that tells us that there 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.850
 we have a mission of history 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.890
 personal 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.020
 and I'm playing a game right now 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.320
 Forest ranger 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.320
 and I go with a spear spear team 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.520
 and they walk us with nonsense 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.050
 good will come right away 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.050
 here 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.060
 what is there as an event 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.060
 must fight against 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.050
 the nightmares are worthy 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.050
 worthy 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.659
 for candelaria some skills 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.000
 This is not bad about the alasitas but in 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.270
 actually I prefer a rifle a bow the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.270
 true 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:08.280
 smarter now I think I would not know here 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.280
 he is a bridge I think it's just 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.000
 I think this is conjuring him 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.989
 spell to make the bridge 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.989
 We're going over there 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.020
 good as you see the aesthetics of garbage 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.300
 there are two ashura whenever I talk about the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.250
 I noted several that I equal the week next to 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.280
 the two races in my mind and I can not no 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.280
 may l 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:37.340
 and for that reason but good the aesthetics of the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.930
 whistle and it is very nature 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.340
 Very forest they are born here 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.250
 forest 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.430
 I do not know if copulate I think not 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.640
 and well we do not do the silverios are born 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.670
 here in the enchanted forest forest 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.800
 all very natural full of roots of 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.000
 huge trees and more or less that's the 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.000
 aesthetic of whistling and 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.530
 I think the boss comes out here in a 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.690
 huge tree species 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.370
 although I'm not sure how it says 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.250
 creation of personalization of the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.990
 whistle characters and with a good one that I 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.569
 I did precisely the one I was playing and 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.459
 to strike him says come on and now the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.459
 boss that is a huge tree 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.460
 and now when I killed him he walks not me 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.270
 he agreed that it was a dinosaur 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.270
 it's pretty good 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.890
 and now when I killed him then we will go to the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.010
 start zone of those whistling and 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:59.470
 where they rise from level 1 to 17 I think 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.470
 that is there is to teach the area a little 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.030
 Being a ranger, I have a pet 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:21.889
 I do not know if I can use it 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.889
 death 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.550
 have revived I killed someone and I 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.550
 They have revived I will heal 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.539
 Now they are throwing things at me 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.770
 4 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.770
 this May had ready 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.110
 202 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.510
 it looks like it's going to fall but 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.230
 it seems that it costs me a little bit my exits 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.230
 because they are all dead 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.480
 It's worth it 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.580
 if I stay 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.590
 perfect and now as always as all 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.230
 the breeds once the first 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.490
 small box although quite large but 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:19.130
 easy we go to the start zone 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.750
 Okay, we're already here in the area 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.139
 start whistling and this would be the 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.840
 zone 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.389
 and it is where we are already in the world where 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.099
 we can see everything to anyone 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.750
 here would be whistling and here 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.620
 is it so 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.310
 I was 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.340
 here are the humans in the snow 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.780
 I think there are the 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.940
 if the huge ones and the garbage are 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.950
 ashura 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.700
 I do not know right now I do not know where they are 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.410
 and here we are at your side 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.240
 and well let's do some very 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.240
 simple more to continue a little 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.260
 just like the story 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.780
 If you do not get here, we always have 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.130
 this kind of people who have this 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.380
 telescope here these are the ones that are going 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.340
 discovering the map if we walk 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.720
 problem sticks how are we going 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.370
 discovering but we can also 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.370
 approaching the scouts that are called in 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.660
 English with this spyglass symbol that 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.640
 they discover us a little the map and we 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.070
 they say they advise us where to go first 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.740
 where to go next do they make us a 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.480
 little the good travel people well this 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.120
 it would be the main area 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.550
 sorry the initial zone of the whistles and 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.380
 as you know the whistle and have a 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.490
 very aesthetic of the forest or very 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.710
 vegetative 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.150
 and well then that if you like the 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.919
 nature if you like silverios 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.870
 I encourage you that when the 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.970
 you play a validated sil and the 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.260
 truth is that they are very well achieved if 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:05.889
 You see, it 's like a 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:09.360
 a human with tree texture 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.360
 the truth is that it is pretty cool 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.760
 so I'm not going to leave anybody here 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:17.290
 I'm going to leave the video here, I think that 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.290
 I have gone too far to see 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.410
 but I have to help people like that 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.689
 that the people I stay here there is a 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.459
 people like people want 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:30.639
 so nothing good people I stay 

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:30.639
 here 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.180
 doing some mission cillas of these 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.500

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.030

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.830
