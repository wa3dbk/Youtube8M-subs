kind of bike were you riding what was
you<00:00:26.880> set<00:00:27.090> up<00:00:27.240> yeah<00:00:27.810> actually

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
you set up yeah actually

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.669 
you set up yeah actually
for<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.949> race<00:00:29.189> we'd<00:00:29.970> start<00:00:30.210> writing<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
for this race we'd start writing a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.280 
for this race we'd start writing a
recently<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.920> switch<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.489> borealis<00:00:33.059> light<00:00:33.290> so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
recently we switch to borealis light so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.780 
recently we switch to borealis light so
the<00:00:34.380> borealis<00:00:34.680> has<00:00:34.829> two<00:00:35.190> different<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the borealis has two different that the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.900 
the borealis has two different that the
bike

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
bike

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.190 
bike
this<00:00:37.270> race<00:00:37.510> we<00:00:37.750> actually<00:00:38.110> made<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.800> yompa

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
this race we actually made the yompa

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.260 
this race we actually made the yompa
vehicle<00:00:41.200> or<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.680> see

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
vehicle or to see

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.990 
vehicle or to see
we<00:00:44.200> thought<00:00:44.470> about<00:00:44.620> using<00:00:44.920> for<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.520> redbull

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
we thought about using for the redbull

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.780 
we thought about using for the redbull
challenge<00:00:46.510> when<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.860> initial<00:00:48.250> course

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
challenge when the the initial course

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.240 
challenge when the the initial course
for<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.090> redbull<00:00:49.420> challenge<00:00:49.810> was<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.080> law

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
for the redbull challenge was the law

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.130 
for the redbull challenge was the law
with<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.400> change<00:00:52.880> on<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.210> last<00:00:53.780> minute<00:00:54.080> we

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
with the change on the last minute we

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.750 
with the change on the last minute we
couldn't<00:00:54.440> patina<00:00:54.710> we<00:00:54.920> actually<00:00:55.280> decided<00:00:55.580> to

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
couldn't patina we actually decided to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.720 
couldn't patina we actually decided to
stick<00:00:56.030> with<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.290> yarmulke<00:00:57.740> deboers<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.520> more

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
stick with the yarmulke deboers is more

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.600 
stick with the yarmulke deboers is more
of<00:00:58.880> our<00:00:59.000> crust<00:00:59.300> concrete

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610

geometry

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.780 
geometry
it<00:01:03.460> worked<00:01:03.640> really<00:01:03.820> well

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
it worked really well

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.090 
it worked really well
all<00:01:05.750> right<00:01:05.870> anybody<00:01:06.140> whole<00:01:06.440> set<00:01:06.710> up<00:01:06.860> what<00:01:07.040> do

all right anybody whole set up what do

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.440 
all right anybody whole set up what do
you<00:01:07.190> weigh<00:01:07.310> around<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.640> tires<00:01:07.880> are<00:01:08.180> four

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
you weigh around the tires are four

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.230 
you weigh around the tires are four
wheels<00:01:08.920> yeah<00:01:09.920> we<00:01:10.250> we<00:01:10.550> actually<00:01:10.670> build<00:01:11.060> this

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
wheels yeah we we actually build this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.710 
wheels yeah we we actually build this
bike<00:01:11.480> it's<00:01:12.320> really<00:01:13.100> light<00:01:13.310> we<00:01:13.820> ended<00:01:14.390> up<00:01:14.480> going

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
bike it's really light we ended up going

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.880 
bike it's really light we ended up going
with<00:01:14.930> next<00:01:15.970> carbon<00:01:16.970> rims<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:18.590> we<00:01:18.740> actually

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
with next carbon rims and we actually

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.780 
with next carbon rims and we actually
have<00:01:19.490> 45<00:01:20.360> more<00:01:20.570> hüsker<00:01:21.230> dü<00:01:21.260> tires<00:01:21.680> Husker<00:01:22.550> dus

railroad track and you also have a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.370 
railroad track and you also have a
little<00:01:41.070> bit<00:01:41.219> of<00:01:41.250> pavement<00:01:41.759> which<00:01:41.939> is

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
little bit of pavement which is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.499 
little bit of pavement which is
necessarily<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.189> favorite<00:01:44.610> ground<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.210> the

necessarily the favorite ground of the
FUD<00:01:45.869> bike<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:47.219> you<00:01:47.369> actually<00:01:47.640> play<00:01:47.789> around

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
FUD bike but if you actually play around

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
FUD bike but if you actually play around
with<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> pressure<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.960> actually<00:01:49.110> have

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
with the pressure you can actually have

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.899 
with the pressure you can actually have
a<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:50.130> competitive<00:01:50.579> ride

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
a pretty competitive ride

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.310 
a pretty competitive ride

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
carbon next five rims that we actually

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.760 
carbon next five rims that we actually
next<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.010> was<00:02:00.250> really<00:02:00.550> kind<00:02:00.730> up<00:02:00.940> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
next I was really kind up to

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
we went with a full SRAM drivetrain we

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.449 
we went with a full SRAM drivetrain we
doing<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.150> living<00:02:17.900> buy<00:02:18.020> one<00:02:18.260> today<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.220> was<00:02:19.430> a

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
doing a living buy one today I was a

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.910 
doing a living buy one today I was a
little<00:02:19.819> little<00:02:20.569> under<00:02:20.930> geared<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.830> were

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
little little under geared we were

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.620 
little little under geared we were
hoping<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.340> do<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.550> last-minute<00:02:22.910> change<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
hoping to do a last-minute change in the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.290 
hoping to do a last-minute change in the
front<00:02:23.870> ring<00:02:24.050> but<00:02:24.400> couldn't<00:02:25.400> do<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.730> time<00:02:25.940> so

with<00:03:30.140> four<00:03:30.830> inch<00:03:31.010> tire<00:03:31.310> or<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.270> can<00:03:32.420> run<00:03:32.630> a

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
29er plus so it actually changes the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.740 
29er plus so it actually changes the
weight<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.410> little<00:03:36.650> bit<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.580> normally<00:03:38.570> it

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
weight a little bit so normally it

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.080 
weight a little bit so normally it
actually<00:03:39.140> just<00:03:39.650> averages<00:03:40.100> about<00:03:40.310> under<00:03:40.700> 22

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090
