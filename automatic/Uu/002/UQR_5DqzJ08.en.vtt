is just the initial review so you know
so<00:00:48.870> far<00:00:48.980> just<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.129> initial<00:00:50.370> unboxing<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so far just the initial unboxing and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.270 
so far just the initial unboxing and
seeing<00:00:51.570> what<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.930> looks<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:53.160> very

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
seeing what it looks like it's very

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.910 
seeing what it looks like it's very
pretty<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.910> very<00:00:54.000> soft<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.530> thing<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
pretty and very soft the one thing I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.860 
pretty and very soft the one thing I
will<00:00:55.980> say<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.789> third<00:00:57.059> bundle<00:00:57.360> which<00:00:57.750> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
will say is the third bundle which is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.959 
will say is the third bundle which is
the<00:00:58.020> longest<00:00:58.199> bundle<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the longest bundle is a little more of a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.290 
the longest bundle is a little more of a
kinky<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.920> loose<00:01:01.920> body<00:01:02.219> wave<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.059> more

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
kinky a loose body wave so this is more

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.500 
kinky a loose body wave so this is more
of<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.510> coarse<00:01:03.840> texture<00:01:04.350> which<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.549> not

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
of a coarse texture which is not

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510 
of a coarse texture which is not
something<00:01:06.900> I'm<00:01:07.200> used<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.710> when<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> comes<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
something I'm used to when it comes to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
something I'm used to when it comes to
ordering<00:01:08.790> hair<00:01:09.150> i<00:01:09.180> usually<00:01:09.689> don't<00:01:09.840> order

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
ordering hair i usually don't order

coarse hair I usually order like the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.390

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
soft and silky brazilian hair so this is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.859 
soft and silky brazilian hair so this is

two heads are like when you're ordering
virgin<00:01:23.310> hair<00:01:23.490> you're<00:01:23.670> always<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> get

virgin hair you're always going to get

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.749 
virgin hair you're always going to get
something<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.740> different<00:01:26.070> each<00:01:26.490> bundle

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
something a little different each bundle

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.880 
something a little different each bundle
just<00:01:27.090> because<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.720> hair<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:27.960> virgin<00:01:28.439> hair<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
just because the hair is virgin hair and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.469 
just because the hair is virgin hair and
it<00:01:29.040> literally<00:01:29.369> came<00:01:29.640> from<00:01:29.850> someone<00:01:30.150> else's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it literally came from someone else's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.859 
it literally came from someone else's
head<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.229> nobody<00:01:31.710> has<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> same<00:01:32.220> exact<00:01:32.549> hair

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
head so nobody has the same exact hair

head so nobody has the same exact hair
so<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> always<00:01:34.320> keep<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.950> mind<00:01:35.130> when

bundle<00:01:40.290> slightly<00:01:40.799> different<00:01:41.220> than<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> other

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
bundle slightly different than the other

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.179 
bundle slightly different than the other
two<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.540> are<00:01:42.750> very<00:01:42.899> silky<00:01:43.290> very<00:01:43.590> soft<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
two these are very silky very soft and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.700 
two these are very silky very soft and
this<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.030> more<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.780> course<00:01:46.049> but

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
this one is just more of a course but

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.950 
this one is just more of a course but
it's<00:01:46.860> still<00:01:47.130> wavy<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it's still wavy but you can see the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
it's still wavy but you can see the
difference<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.460> I'll<00:01:50.610> hold<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:50.909> up

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
difference in this but I'll hold them up

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.420 
difference in this but I'll hold them up
next<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.390> each<00:01:51.509> other<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.399> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
next to each other one is this one is a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.039 
next to each other one is this one is a
little<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> loser<00:01:54.240> wave<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
little more of a loser wave and this is

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.380 
little more of a loser wave and this is
a<00:01:55.079> tighter<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.829> tighter<00:01:56.579> wave<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
a tighter a tighter wave with like a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.950 
a tighter a tighter wave with like a
tighter<00:01:57.719> curl<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.700> one<00:01:59.700> is<00:02:00.090> slightly<00:02:00.600> lighter

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
tighter curl and one is slightly lighter

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.240 
tighter curl and one is slightly lighter
than<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> other<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:01.979> know<00:02:02.070> if<00:02:02.130> it's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
than the other one I don't know if it's

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.410 
than the other one I don't know if it's
delighting<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.030> one's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> little

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
delighting but this one's a little

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
delighting but this one's a little
lighter<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:04.860> will<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
lighter so this one will go on the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.910 
lighter so this one will go on the
bottom<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.030> will<00:02:06.479> deep<00:02:06.689> condition<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.590> best

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
bottom I will deep condition it as best

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.740 
bottom I will deep condition it as best
I<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.780> blend<00:02:09.989> more

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
I can just to get it to blend more

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.570 
I can just to get it to blend more
just<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.200> be<00:02:11.320> softer<00:02:11.740> but<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> texture<00:02:12.340> is

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
just to be softer but the texture is

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.620 
just to be softer but the texture is
just<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.990> little<00:02:14.890> more<00:02:15.550> course<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.150> I'm<00:02:16.300> kind<00:02:16.540> of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
just a little more course so I'm kind of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.660 
just a little more course so I'm kind of
worried<00:02:17.020> about<00:02:17.200> how<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:17.620> will<00:02:17.830> last<00:02:18.070> because

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
worried about how this will last because

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.490 
worried about how this will last because
most<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.390> time<00:02:19.630> when<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.870> have<00:02:20.140> hair<00:02:20.320> like

this<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:21.250> doesn't<00:02:21.430> last<00:02:21.730> me<00:02:22.000> as<00:02:22.090> long<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:22.660> a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
this it doesn't last me as long it's a

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.930 
this it doesn't last me as long it's a
little<00:02:22.990> I<00:02:23.410> don't<00:02:23.920> know<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.160> just<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.520> doesn't

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
