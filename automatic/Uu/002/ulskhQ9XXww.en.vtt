00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
should say um well I really think that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
should say um well I really think that
when<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> comes<00:01:16.829> to<00:01:17.009> gaming<00:01:17.250> YouTube<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.149> I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
when it comes to gaming YouTube that I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.050 
when it comes to gaming YouTube that I
think<00:01:19.140> call<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.439> duty<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.770> pretty<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
think call of duty is pretty much one of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.179 
think call of duty is pretty much one of
the<00:01:21.180> main<00:01:21.390> games<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.890> when<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the main games up there like when it

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.490 
the main games up there like when it
comes<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.520> people<00:01:23.880> uploading<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:25.290> really

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
comes to people uploading and I really

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.450 
comes to people uploading and I really
think<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> change<00:01:26.130> when<00:01:26.399> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
think that's going to change when the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
think that's going to change when the
ps4<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.939> Xbox<00:01:27.240> comes<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.630> due<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> fact
