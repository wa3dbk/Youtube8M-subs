in<00:00:09.709> a<00:00:09.799> certain<00:00:10.040> pattern<00:00:10.370> and<00:00:10.849> then<00:00:11.839> when<00:00:12.080> I

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
in a certain pattern and then when I

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.280 
in a certain pattern and then when I
find<00:00:12.440> out<00:00:12.559> that

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
find out that

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.170 
find out that
working<00:00:13.620> right<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.190> go<00:00:14.309> back<00:00:14.550> and<00:00:14.760> redo

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
working right I have to go back and redo

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.080 
working right I have to go back and redo
it<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.540> redo<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:15.900> until<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.650> find<00:00:17.369> out<00:00:17.520> exactly

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
it and redo it until I find out exactly

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.570 
it and redo it until I find out exactly
what's<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.950> Machine<00:00:20.310> and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
what's going on with the Machine and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.050 
what's going on with the Machine and
sometimes<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.420> take<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:22.170> while<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.950> me<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
sometimes it can take a while for me to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.790 
sometimes it can take a while for me to
get<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.990> Machine<00:00:25.380> down<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.980> right<00:00:26.480> so<00:00:27.800> she

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
get the Machine down just right so she

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.470 
get the Machine down just right so she
had<00:00:28.950> thread<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.430> stuff<00:00:29.700> behind<00:00:29.939> her<00:00:30.270> hook

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
had thread and stuff behind her hook

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.750 
had thread and stuff behind her hook
assembly<00:00:33.050> way<00:00:34.050> behind<00:00:34.410> underneath<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
assembly way behind underneath here and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.200 
assembly way behind underneath here and
everything<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.370> thing<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.760> surprises

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
everything the one thing that surprises

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.530 
everything the one thing that surprises
me<00:00:39.630> and<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> mystery<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.239> cannot

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
me and it's like a mystery and I cannot

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:52.960 
me and it's like a mystery and I cannot
figure<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.020> out<00:00:44.059> but<00:00:45.830> people<00:00:46.830> seem<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.090 

but<00:00:55.370> this<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.580> a<00:00:56.610> closed<00:00:56.940> system<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
but this is a closed system and the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.890 
but this is a closed system and the
motor<00:00:59.310> sits<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> middle<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> system

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
motor sits in the middle of the system

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.810 
motor sits in the middle of the system
and<00:01:02.390> somehow<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:04.379> want<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.979> bobbins<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.549> top

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and somehow you want your bobbins on top

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.569 
and somehow you want your bobbins on top
and<00:01:06.350> there's<00:01:07.350> no<00:01:07.530> way<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.040> threads<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
and there's no way for the threads to

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.719 
and there's no way for the threads to
get<00:01:08.729> down<00:01:08.970> inside<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:10.020> machine<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.799> yet

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
get down inside this machine and yet

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.719 
get down inside this machine and yet
I've<00:01:11.850> been<00:01:12.060> finding<00:01:12.360> machines<00:01:13.310> with<00:01:14.310> threads

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
I've been finding machines with threads

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.500 
I've been finding machines with threads
wrapped<00:01:15.659> all<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> motors<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:17.940> it's<00:01:18.210> just

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
wrapped all in the motors and it's just

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.080 
wrapped all in the motors and it's just
a<00:01:18.630> total<00:01:19.320> mystery<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> me<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.220> how<00:01:20.490> they<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.909> in

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
a total mystery to me of how they get in

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.460 
a total mystery to me of how they get in
there<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.120> don't<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.750> someday<00:01:25.260> I'll

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
there so I don't know someday I'll

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.770 
there so I don't know someday I'll
figure<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.280> out<00:01:26.430> how<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.760> how<00:01:27.090> somebody<00:01:27.570> gets

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
figure it out how that how somebody gets

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.840 
figure it out how that how somebody gets
the<00:01:27.990> thread<00:01:28.380> down<00:01:28.650> inside<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.280> motor<00:01:29.580> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the thread down inside the motor and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.000 
the thread down inside the motor and
it's<00:01:30.750> totally<00:01:31.080> closed<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.920> just

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
it's totally closed up so it's it's just

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.530 
it's totally closed up so it's it's just
one<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> mysteries<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.120> don't<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.390> if

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
one of the mysteries I don't know if

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.960 
one of the mysteries I don't know if
anybody<00:01:36.900> ever<00:01:37.080> knows<00:01:37.890> about<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:38.850> how

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
anybody ever knows about that or how

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.530 
anybody ever knows about that or how
they<00:01:39.150> how<00:01:39.870> they<00:01:39.900> actually<00:01:40.200> did<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:41.210> if<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.479> do

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
they how they actually did it if they do

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.710 
they how they actually did it if they do
then<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.619> drop<00:01:44.400> me<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.610> line<00:01:44.880> drive<00:01:45.360> you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
then you know drop me a line drive you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
then you know drop me a line drive you
know<00:01:45.810> send<00:01:46.110> me<00:01:46.170> an<00:01:46.290> email<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.770> tell<00:01:46.830> me<00:01:47.130> how

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
know send me an email and tell me how

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.510 
know send me an email and tell me how
they<00:01:47.630> did<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.860> maybe<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.010> could<00:01:50.159> figure<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
they did it maybe we could figure the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.310 
they did it maybe we could figure the
mystery<00:01:50.940> out<00:01:53.570> anyway<00:01:54.570> moving<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:57.080> did<00:01:58.080> your

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
mystery out anyway moving on did your

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.830 
mystery out anyway moving on did your
all<00:01:59.220> your<00:01:59.400> patterns<00:01:59.869> okay<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.600> they<00:02:03.600> came<00:02:03.780> out

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
all your patterns okay so they came out

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.890 
all your patterns okay so they came out
pretty<00:02:04.229> good<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.780> adjust

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
pretty good you have to adjust

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.469 
pretty good you have to adjust
attentions<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.860> each<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.189> I<00:02:08.399> do<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.330> my

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
attentions to each one I do all my

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.220 
attentions to each one I do all my
patterns<00:02:09.689> with<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.489> zigzag<00:02:11.489> foot<00:02:12.230> normally

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
patterns with this zigzag foot normally

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.170 
patterns with this zigzag foot normally
you're<00:02:13.739> supposed<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:14.159> use<00:02:14.400> other<00:02:14.670> plastic

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
you're supposed to use other plastic

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.289 
you're supposed to use other plastic
feet<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.680> correct<00:02:17.040> feet<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.670> patterns<00:02:18.120> will

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
feet the correct feet the patterns will

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.619 
feet the correct feet the patterns will
come<00:02:18.480> out<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.629> lot<00:02:18.870> better<00:02:19.700> because<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:21.269> foot

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
come out a lot better because this foot

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.739 
come out a lot better because this foot
is<00:02:21.840> actually<00:02:22.109> solid<00:02:23.069> on<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.489> bottom<00:02:23.639> it's<00:02:24.599> a

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 
is actually solid on the bottom it's a

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.750 
is actually solid on the bottom it's a
flat<00:02:25.139> layer<00:02:25.409> so<00:02:25.799> when<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.099> goes<00:02:26.249> over

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
flat layer so when it goes over

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.830 
flat layer so when it goes over
the<00:02:27.510> stitches<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.319> will<00:02:28.890> pull<00:02:29.190> sometimes<00:02:29.940> but

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the stitches it will pull sometimes but

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.630 
the stitches it will pull sometimes but
these<00:02:31.049> came<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.409> pretty<00:02:31.650> good

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
these came out pretty good

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.420 
these came out pretty good
I<00:02:32.900> do<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.080> buttonhole<00:02:34.440> I'm<00:02:34.890> not<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.280> great

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
I do the buttonhole I'm not that great

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.600 
I do the buttonhole I'm not that great
on<00:02:35.700> buttonholes<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:38.280> pretty

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
on buttonholes but it's it's pretty

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.699 
on buttonholes but it's it's pretty
close<00:02:38.819> for<00:02:39.209> what<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:39.780> would<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.470> use

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
close for what this would is if you use

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
is the machine will be louder alright

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.610 
is the machine will be louder alright
that's<00:04:08.970> just<00:04:09.299> because<00:04:09.480> it's<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.319> needles

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
good microphone so here we go okay so I

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.570 
good microphone so here we go okay so I
went<00:05:00.060> through<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:01.590> lot<00:05:02.099> of<00:05:02.129> the<00:05:02.310> straight

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
went through a lot of the straight

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.519 
went through a lot of the straight
stitches<00:05:03.060> don't<00:05:03.240> worry<00:05:03.479> about<00:05:03.599> the<00:05:04.020> the

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:04.529 
stitches don't worry about the the

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.119 
stitches don't worry about the the
bottom<00:05:04.919> ones<00:05:05.159> sometimes<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:06.120> do<00:05:06.740> I'm<00:05:07.740> operating

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
bottom ones sometimes I do I'm operating

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.850 
bottom ones sometimes I do I'm operating
the<00:05:08.669> machine<00:05:09.449> with<00:05:10.139> one<00:05:10.319> hand<00:05:10.590> on<00:05:10.740> the

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
the machine with one hand on the

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.869 
the machine with one hand on the
material<00:05:11.310> one<00:05:11.520> hand<00:05:11.759> on<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:13.050> foot<00:05:13.229> pedal<00:05:13.879> so

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
material one hand on the foot pedal so

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.629 
material one hand on the foot pedal so
it's<00:05:15.300> kind<00:05:15.599> of<00:05:15.659> hard<00:05:15.839> especially<00:05:16.529> if<00:05:16.620> I<00:05:16.800> start

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
it's kind of hard especially if I start

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.809 
it's kind of hard especially if I start
to<00:05:17.729> do<00:05:17.849> this<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.120> little<00:05:18.330> bit<00:05:18.449> so<00:05:19.580> but<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.669> does

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
to do this a little bit so but it does

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.950 
to do this a little bit so but it does
pretty<00:05:21.060> good<00:05:21.150> straight<00:05:21.569> stitch<00:05:22.969> so<00:05:23.969> that's

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
pretty good straight stitch so that's

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.790 
pretty good straight stitch so that's
her<00:05:25.139> machine<00:05:25.529> so<00:05:27.050> I'll<00:05:28.050> be<00:05:28.169> sending<00:05:28.499> it<00:05:28.620> back
