00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.839
 and after two years another he would print notice it gives a traffic jam there 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.930
 go skating this weekend 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.719
 well that might be possible here and there but not nearly everywhere 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.069
 maybe we should ask the ice masters for a moment 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.509
 because they understand 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.509
 culemborg five kilometers per hour 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.230
 within ten years 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.239
 Willem II 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.889
 A little earlier, it turned out that it reached the second round in which 

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:31.900
 internet it will not work for now 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.900
 also no longer severe frost 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.630
 well and we get a severe frost but if there is snow then I don't want to be like that 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.710
 with that he is 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.810
 just look tomorrow at the local he wrote in as we were on the website 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.460
 of the knsb but there is undoubtedly where the ice rinks are open today 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.060
 four are already open, so maybe tomorrow it will be less, because it will be freezing 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.840
 that is plenty of winter beautiful white is picture and the netherlands is among the clouds 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.710
 by seeing law 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.870
 mt 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.260
 That means that there is snow after what you have of course received for a long time 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.750
 but that snow can also make it very cold tonight, not only with us 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.520
 light snowing over our country in much of europe that will deliver tomorrow 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.380
 particularly low temperatures 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.330
 a large part of the europe that keeps on freezing during the day and also with us 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.430
 the neighborhood we have tomorrow daytime temperatures of minus 16 with us in the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.930
 head of the country falls about minus 5 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.040
 that has snowed a bit in the last few hours in the north 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 snow showers here in the east of the country a little light snow 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.890
 tonight it clears up that lee defeated temperatures on jar minus 13 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.380
 maybe above the snow here in the north 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.380
 if it is enough on ready for up to minus 15 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.960
 and it can get slippery because there are the snow remnants and they freeze up 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 and then it can become a local slippery place 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.990
 then the day might start in many places or foggy temperatures 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.980
 remains low minus 5 in the interior 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.780
 and here on the coast the wind turns to the southwest later and comes with some clouds 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.670
 maybe later in the day it snows and on Sunday we get even more snow 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.250
 are not yet rid of the winter inconveniences it can rain open in the west 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.300
 deliver 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.170
 but in the longer term on Sundays the spot will have to do with snow afterwards 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.490
 it stays wintry during the daytime temperatures around freezing at night 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.329
 keep some light frost 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.329
 that was the weather forecast but filip 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.969

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.559

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.410
 hamas once again struck hard in the first half 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.150
 yesterday the Palestinian extremist organization announced that the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.849
 attack in jerusalem for the time being would be the last but that promise 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.199
 it turned out to be worthless 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.659
 the princess the hague the story of the town square but not yet yesterday 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.099

 it is a very good political and financial heart of evening 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.950
 America has been hit by a series of unprecedented terrorist attacks 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.249
 do not know 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.900
 the result of destruction with possibly thousands of deaths or perhaps even more 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.890
 thousands of complaints and often with a person speaking choirs 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.890
 the last flights 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.370

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.159

 the folk hero 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.159
 he is not a very good evening 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.449
 his home 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.989
 and the place where he was murdered last week 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.989
 hundreds of people said goodbye to theo van gogh this afternoon 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.510
 the good name of being nine days after the Asian earthquake and seems the biggest 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:45.569
 relief operations from history 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.739

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.949
