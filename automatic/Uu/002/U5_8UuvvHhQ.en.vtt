pieces you're going to decrease all the
way<00:02:14.410> around<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.220> decrease<00:02:15.730> instead<00:02:16.180> of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
way around so to decrease instead of

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.880 
way around so to decrease instead of
putting<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.660> piece<00:02:16.690> over<00:02:17.050> two<00:02:17.290> points<00:02:17.620> you

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
putting one piece over two points you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.949 
putting one piece over two points you
put<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.160> over<00:02:18.280> three<00:02:18.610> points<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.540> one<00:02:25.720> pocket

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
put it over three points so one pocket

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.110 
put it over three points so one pocket
has<00:02:26.230> one<00:02:26.440> point<00:02:26.709> going<00:02:26.950> into<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
has one point going into it and the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.699 
has one point going into it and the
other<00:02:28.269> one<00:02:28.450> has<00:02:28.599> two<00:02:28.780> points<00:02:31.590> now<00:02:32.590> you're

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
other one has two points now you're

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.990 
other one has two points now you're
going<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.920> fill<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.310> rest<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:33.790> row

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
going to fill in the rest of this row

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.120
