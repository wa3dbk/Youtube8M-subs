that's what I've done for this episode
so<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.560> will<00:01:28.799> see<00:01:29.009> me<00:01:29.130> opening<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.759> pack<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
so you will see me opening one pack a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.210 
so you will see me opening one pack a
little<00:01:30.720> bit<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> end<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> episode<00:01:31.799> but

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
little bit at the end of the episode but

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.649 
little bit at the end of the episode but
I<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.610> could<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.939> rule<00:01:33.210> where<00:01:33.420> I

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
I think there could be a rule where I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.170 
I think there could be a rule where I
can't<00:01:34.110> sell<00:01:34.409> any<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> their<00:01:34.860> players<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
can't sell any of their players or I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.300 
can't sell any of their players or I
have<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.689> everything<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> pack<00:01:37.650> for

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
and I was very very happy with that and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.400 
and I was very very happy with that and
I<00:03:44.530> decided<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.730> will<00:03:45.850> try<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.720> different

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
I decided that I will try a different

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.170 
I decided that I will try a different
striker<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:47.920> don't<00:03:48.220> know<00:03:48.280> why<00:03:48.550> don't<00:03:48.940> know<00:03:49.000> what

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
striker I don't know why don't know what

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.060 
striker I don't know why don't know what
went<00:03:49.330> through<00:03:49.480> my<00:03:49.540> head<00:03:49.630> here<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.890> wanted

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
went through my head here and I wanted

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.890 
went through my head here and I wanted
to<00:03:51.190> try<00:03:51.340> this<00:03:51.400> this<00:03:51.940> Saudi<00:03:52.209> Arabian<00:03:52.630> striker

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
to try this this Saudi Arabian striker

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.770 
to try this this Saudi Arabian striker
and<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.320> thought<00:03:53.970> he<00:03:54.970> could<00:03:55.120> potentially<00:03:55.600> you

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
and I thought he could potentially you

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.870 
and I thought he could potentially you
know<00:03:55.900> be<00:03:56.410> kind<00:03:56.800> of<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:56.980> new<00:03:57.160> key<00:03:57.340> especially<00:03:57.580> if

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
know be kind of a new key especially if

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.520
