00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
doing a trade binder I feel like I

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.650 
doing a trade binder I feel like I
should<00:05:31.160> do<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.250> trade<00:05:31.430> binder<00:05:31.640> eventually<00:05:32.510> so

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
should do a trade binder eventually so

should do a trade binder eventually so
will<00:05:32.750> try<00:05:32.900> to<00:05:32.960> get<00:05:33.080> that<00:05:33.230> and<00:05:33.470> I'll<00:05:34.250> save<00:05:34.490> a<00:05:34.520> few

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
will try to get that and I'll save a few

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.770 
will try to get that and I'll save a few
more<00:05:34.940> of<00:05:35.000> these<00:05:35.090> codes<00:05:35.390> and<00:05:35.570> we'll<00:05:35.660> do<00:05:35.750> another

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
more of these codes and we'll do another

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.360 
more of these codes and we'll do another
one<00:05:36.080> those<00:05:36.230> code<00:05:36.470> openings<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:36.980> hopefully<00:05:37.280> do

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
one those code openings and hopefully do

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.950 
one those code openings and hopefully do
it<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.550> little<00:05:37.820> bit<00:05:37.940> better<00:05:38.150> than<00:05:38.600> last<00:05:38.780> time
