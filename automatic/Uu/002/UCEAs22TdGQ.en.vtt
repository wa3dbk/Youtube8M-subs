00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.030
POTHOLESES TO

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.930
PERFORM.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.940
IT DOESN'T HELP ME BUT THERE

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.200
ARE MOMS OUT HERE PUSHING

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.900
STROLLERS.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.810
SHE HAS A CHALLENGE FOR YOU.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.810
WE HAVE MORE FOR YOU IN

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.910
BRAINTREE.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.880
AND YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.880

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.890
LOT OF THESE SIGNS PUT UP BY A

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.890
LOCAL WOMAN WHOSE ACTIONS ARE

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.890
INSPIRING OTHERS TO DIG OUT.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.790
IT STARTED ON A PERSONAL NEED.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.130
I STARTED ROLLING DOWN THE

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.970
SIDEWALK TO THE POST OFFICE AND

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.300
I LOOKED BACK AND SAW A CLEAR

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.130
PATH AND I THOUGHT I COULD

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.000
CLEAR THE PATH.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.970
THE 33-YEAR-OLD SUFFERS FROM

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.080
A NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.080
IT DIDN'T STOP HER.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.080
MAKING PARTY FAVORS, AND WASN'T

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.250
GOING TO SLOW HER DOWN.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.150
I PUT IT DOWN AND ROLL WITH

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.350
THE CHAIR AND IT CLEARS THE

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.090
PATH.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.120
SHE PENT OVER 100 HOURS

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.160
MAKING THE SIDEWALKS IN HER

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.330
NEIGHBORHOOD PASSABLE,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.490
INSPIRING VOLUNTEERS TO HELP

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.160
OUT.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.300
THEY CLEARED OUT THIS CORNER.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.200
A MAN AND A FAMILY DROVE BY

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.310
AND SAID I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.180
NOT SURPRISING, SHE IS PART

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.080
OF THE MOVEMENT PURKE THE

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.180
HANDICAP SYMBOL.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.190
THERE IS SO MUCH STIGMA WHAT

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.250
A DISABLED PERSON IS.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.290
THEY DON'T EXPECT US TO BE

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.560
WORKING OR OUT IN THE

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.220
COMMUNITY.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.160
A VITAL PART OF IT.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.400
THERE ARE MOMS OUT HERE PUSHING

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.750
STROLLERS AND CARRY TODDLERS ON

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.470
THE SIDEWALKS AND THERE ARE

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.540
ELDERLY.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.240
IT NEEDS TO BE ACCESSIBLE FOR

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.310
EVERYBODY.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.280
SHE IS REMARKABLE.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.630
DURING THIS HISTORIC WINTER IT
