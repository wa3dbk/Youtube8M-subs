00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.400 
be to my disadvantage but I did that's
why<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> did<00:02:15.900> as<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.890> see<00:02:17.070> here<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.580> says<00:02:18.410> 64

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
why I did as you can see here it says 64

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.040 
why I did as you can see here it says 64
gigabytes<00:02:20.010> right<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.780> definitely

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
gigabytes right so this is definitely

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.560 
gigabytes right so this is definitely
the<00:02:22.530> 64<00:02:23.130> gigabyte<00:02:23.550> version<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:24.240> know<00:02:24.360> maybe

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
the 64 gigabyte version you know maybe

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.440 
the 64 gigabyte version you know maybe

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
the person that commented was a little

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.050 
the person that commented was a little
frustrated<00:02:28.260> at<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.680> announce<00:02:29.010> store<00:02:29.400> his

frustrated at the announce store his

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.930 
frustrated at the announce store his
carriers<00:02:30.660> didn't<00:02:30.990> announce<00:02:31.470> 64<00:02:32.430> gigabyte

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
carriers didn't announce 64 gigabyte

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.770 
carriers didn't announce 64 gigabyte
