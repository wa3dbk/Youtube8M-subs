towards the bottom so I saved some paper
in<00:00:55.379> case<00:00:55.769> I<00:00:56.129> want<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> make<00:00:56.879> another<00:00:57.210> one

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.900 

and<00:01:06.540> take<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:07.080> scissors<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.530> cut<00:01:07.950> around

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.600 

so<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.520> goes<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:22.820> like<00:01:23.820> this

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
so it goes out like this

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.550 
so it goes out like this
and<00:01:25.910> up<00:01:26.420> but<00:01:27.260> then<00:01:27.410> it<00:01:27.560> gets<00:01:27.620> really<00:01:28.070> thin<00:01:28.550> and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
and up but then it gets really thin and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.230 
and up but then it gets really thin and

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
then back out again and that's pretty

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.670 
then back out again and that's pretty
much<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.570> shape<00:01:35.600> now<00:01:36.050> I'm<00:01:36.170> going<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.350> take<00:01:36.530> the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
much the shape now I'm going to take the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.680 
much the shape now I'm going to take the
scissors<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.070> I'm<00:01:37.850> going<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:38.060> start<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.510> cut

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
pretty close to the real thing I tried

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.680 
pretty close to the real thing I tried
to<00:01:56.660> go<00:01:56.810> as<00:01:57.080> close<00:01:57.320> as<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:57.770> could<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:59.360> center

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
but you have to have some support for

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:16.550 
but you have to have some support for
the<00:02:03.410> mess

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.620
