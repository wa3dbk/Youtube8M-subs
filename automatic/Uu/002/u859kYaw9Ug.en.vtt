to<00:02:19.989> straight<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.750> we<00:02:22.959> have<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.410> board

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
to straight and then we have the board

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:41.550 
to straight and then we have the board
itself<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:36.069> is<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.580> brown<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:38.760> gold<00:02:40.560> looking

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
itself so it is a brown and gold looking

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.119 
itself so it is a brown and gold looking
board

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
board

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.910 
board
there's<00:02:42.790> your<00:02:43.030> fm2<00:02:43.390> socket<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.319> course<00:02:44.590> and

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
there's your fm2 socket of course and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.140 
there's your fm2 socket of course and
your<00:02:45.099> two<00:02:45.510> ddr3<00:02:46.510> dimms<00:02:46.540> slots<00:02:47.910> might<00:02:48.910> we'll

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
your two ddr3 dimms slots might we'll

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.300 
your two ddr3 dimms slots might we'll
get<00:02:49.269> my<00:02:49.390> complaint<00:02:49.930> out<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.380> way<00:02:50.530> first<00:02:50.890> is

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
get my complaint out of the way first is

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.449 
get my complaint out of the way first is
the<00:02:51.549> fact<00:02:51.819> that<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:53.200> two<00:02:53.349> PCIe<00:02:53.799> slots<00:02:54.280> are

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
the fact that the two PCIe slots are

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.319 
the fact that the two PCIe slots are
right<00:02:54.610> on<00:02:54.760> top<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.000> each<00:02:55.209> other<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:56.549> if<00:02:57.549> you<00:02:58.090> put

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
right on top of each other so if you put

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.140 
right on top of each other so if you put
a<00:02:58.360> dual<00:02:58.599> socket<00:02:59.200> or<00:02:59.709> dual<00:02:59.950> slot<00:03:00.310> card<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
a dual socket or dual slot card in the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.470 
a dual socket or dual slot card in the
the<00:03:01.510> 16x<00:03:02.079> slot<00:03:02.459> you're<00:03:03.459> screwed<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:04.060> using

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
the 16x slot you're screwed in using

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.949 
the 16x slot you're screwed in using
this<00:03:04.630> one<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.170> don't<00:03:05.410> understand<00:03:05.890> why<00:03:06.959> you

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
this one so I don't understand why you

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.089 
this one so I don't understand why you
know<00:03:08.079> this<00:03:08.410> legacy

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
know this legacy

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.280 
know this legacy
I'd<00:03:09.310> rather<00:03:09.549> almost<00:03:10.030> see<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.360> legacy<00:03:10.720> gone

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
I'd rather almost see this legacy gone

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.270 
I'd rather almost see this legacy gone
completely<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.940> have<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.090> dead<00:03:13.390> space

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
completely and just have a dead space

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.819 
completely and just have a dead space
because<00:03:15.280> how<00:03:15.970> many<00:03:16.120> people<00:03:16.600> are<00:03:17.170> gonna<00:03:17.530> you

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
because how many people are gonna you

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.400 
because how many people are gonna you
know<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.069> what<00:03:18.670> if<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.850> have<00:03:19.030> an<00:03:19.750> audio<00:03:20.139> card

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
know like what if you have an audio card

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.410 
know like what if you have an audio card
or<00:03:20.560> something<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.920> want<00:03:21.069> to<00:03:21.130> use<00:03:21.280> here<00:03:21.639> now

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
or something you want to use here now

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.379 
or something you want to use here now
you<00:03:22.480> can't<00:03:22.870> use<00:03:22.959> your<00:03:23.109> 16<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.389> doesn't

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
you can't use your 16 and it doesn't

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.580 
you can't use your 16 and it doesn't
just<00:03:25.540> doesn't<00:03:25.780> make<00:03:25.840> any<00:03:25.900> sense<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.260> me<00:03:26.380> guys

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
just doesn't make any sense to me guys

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.680 
just doesn't make any sense to me guys
and<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.459> lot<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.670> motherboards<00:03:28.150> do<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.450> not

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
and a lot of motherboards do this not

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.330 
and a lot of motherboards do this not
just<00:03:28.870> Asus<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:30.569> there's<00:03:31.569> your<00:03:31.750> 4<00:03:32.049> pin<00:03:32.290> power<00:03:34.139> to

SATA ports our ninety degree and three
are<00:03:51.660> straight<00:03:52.660> up<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.019> I<00:03:53.349> don't<00:03:53.590> know<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:53.920> I

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
are straight up and I don't know that I

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.250 
are straight up and I don't know that I
like<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:55.329> be<00:03:55.450> completely<00:03:55.599> honest<00:03:56.170> with

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
like this to be completely honest with

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.530 
like this to be completely honest with
you<00:03:56.319> how<00:03:57.190> I'm<00:03:57.430> gonna<00:03:57.549> be<00:03:57.790> building<00:03:58.060> out<00:03:58.359> the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
you how I'm gonna be building out the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.539 
you how I'm gonna be building out the
media<00:03:58.810> center<00:03:59.079> PC<00:03:59.109> that's<00:03:59.650> gonna<00:03:59.950> actually

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
media center PC that's gonna actually

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.390 
media center PC that's gonna actually
cause<00:04:00.849> some<00:04:00.880> issues<00:04:01.420> for<00:04:01.630> me<00:04:01.920> these<00:04:02.920> three

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
cause some issues for me these three

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.199 
cause some issues for me these three
luckily<00:04:04.389> I<00:04:04.420> think<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.840> may<00:04:05.019> not<00:04:05.200> need<00:04:06.000> more<00:04:07.000> than

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
luckily I think I may not need more than

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.080 
luckily I think I may not need more than
three<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:09.120> good<00:04:10.120> idea<00:04:10.480> but<00:04:11.130> mmm<00:04:12.130> not<00:04:13.060> really

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
three so good idea but mmm not really

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.970 
three so good idea but mmm not really
for<00:04:13.569> me<00:04:13.630> I<00:04:13.750> wish<00:04:13.989> they<00:04:14.139> would<00:04:14.290> just<00:04:14.319> stack<00:04:14.739> them

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
for me I wish they would just stack them

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.229 
for me I wish they would just stack them
all<00:04:15.069> together<00:04:15.250> down<00:04:15.639> there's<00:04:15.880> plenty<00:04:15.940> of

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
all together down there's plenty of

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.620 
all together down there's plenty of
circuit<00:04:16.630> board<00:04:16.810> space<00:04:17.079> there<00:04:17.380> so<00:04:18.419> along<00:04:19.419> the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
circuit board space there so along the

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.620 
circuit board space there so along the
bottom<00:04:19.810> we<00:04:20.769> have<00:04:21.030> again<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.680> 3sat<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.890> there

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
bottom we have again the 3sat is there

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:34.800

so<00:04:53.350> pretty<00:04:54.150> low<00:04:57.570> feature<00:04:58.570> set<00:04:58.930> board<00:04:59.260> it<00:04:59.560> is

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
so pretty low feature set board it is

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.490 
so pretty low feature set board it is
very<00:05:00.490> value<00:05:01.000> oriented<00:05:01.390> and<00:05:03.000> like<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.150> mentioned

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
very value oriented and like I mentioned
