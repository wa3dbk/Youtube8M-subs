00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.869
 At this time 2 trillion suspects but criticizing this personnel affairs 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.869
 It was only each other 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.620
 Everybody's guide shop 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.120
 Aimi is a player's day 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.200
 Meanwhile a new start line 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.800
 Take the hand brake and let it experience for the first time with emotion 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.990
 Suddenly 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.320
 Two people can run away Confirm safety in the curtain 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.810
 It is service corresponding to curb if it is not dangerous 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.810
 We checked safety and delivered it 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.120
 An obstacle has been seen on the track. A course change is necessary. 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.170
 After confirming safety by aiming at Room mirror road 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.290
 We will hold on the right 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.310
 Furthermore we confirm safety in the back ground and change course 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.909
 Then the room mirror hat gets secure 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:20.059
 Change your interest rate if it's safe to go boxing on the left 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.059
 To do 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.559
 Let's see the flow in the city 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:35.339
 Open to the right when you check the Humira door mirror 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.339
 I will change course after checking visually 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.759
 It seems that it was on the left near the room mirror and the door mirror 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.759
 I will eat and change my course 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.939
 Where this sign is 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.939
 We put out 40km per hour 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.069
 8 May start 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.489
 A big signal is given by the registration machine transfer in 2007 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.489
 Remove a bit more and invade 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.819
 In this way, when it stops, it shifts to the left 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.819
 Match the conversion of the car to the ball 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:39.589
 When there is a slope that comes from the prefecture and reaches 140,000 people 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:42.589
 It is the difference of the time of course change 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.829
 When entering the 14th, after confirmation of safety, the curve mirror is from the vicinity 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.909
 Boldly change course and run from the center line 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.909
 I will 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.259

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:06.089
 In case of editorial, it is necessary to check the involvement 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:21.160
 When the leading car waiting for a signal derails 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.990
 We confirmed the start after the signal turned to blue
