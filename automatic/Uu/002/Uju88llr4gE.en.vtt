so if we go back out let me go into the
other<00:02:34.780> side<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.380> what<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.709> can<00:02:35.890> create

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
other side of this what you can create

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.130 
other side of this what you can create
the<00:02:36.370> world<00:02:36.580> how<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.390> works<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.959> get<00:02:38.110> a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
the world how this works is you get a

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.390 
the world how this works is you get a
selection<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.769> bottom<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.190> screen

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
selection on the bottom of the screen

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.720 
selection on the bottom of the screen
here<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:40.930> click<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.230> plus<00:02:41.410> button<00:02:41.730> and

you can put anything you want into the
world<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.099> scroll<00:02:45.340> through<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.760> map

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
world you can scroll through the map

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.180 
world you can scroll through the map
like<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:47.050> simply<00:02:47.290> just<00:02:47.739> take<00:02:47.860> an

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
like this and you simply just take an

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.580 
like this and you simply just take an
object<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.849> drag<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.330> onto<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.500> screen

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
object and you drag it onto the screen

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.030 
object and you drag it onto the screen
like<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.680> can<00:02:53.709> create

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
like this so you can create

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.410 
like this so you can create
neighborhoods<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.980> create<00:02:57.420> starting

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
neighborhoods you can create starting

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.199 
neighborhoods you can create starting
lines<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.140> finish<00:02:59.500> lines<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.250> traffic<00:03:00.880> signs

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
lines and finish lines and traffic signs

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.690 
lines and finish lines and traffic signs
and<00:03:01.720> all<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.680> sort<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:02.920> good<00:03:02.980> stuff<00:03:03.099> you<00:03:03.489> can

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
and all that sort of good stuff you can

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.140 
and all that sort of good stuff you can
create<00:03:05.069> jumps<00:03:06.069> by<00:03:06.400> putting<00:03:06.730> them<00:03:06.849> in<00:03:06.940> like

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
create jumps by putting them in like

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.699 
create jumps by putting them in like
this<00:03:07.390> meaning<00:03:07.690> obviously<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.230> jump<00:03:08.530> up<00:03:08.680> that

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
this meaning obviously you jump up that

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.910 
this meaning obviously you jump up that
way<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:10.480> can<00:03:10.630> put<00:03:10.810> those<00:03:11.019> sorts<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.530> things<00:03:11.739> in

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
way you can put those sorts of things in

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
way you can put those sorts of things in
you<00:03:12.099> can<00:03:12.310> create<00:03:12.640> groups<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.239> houses<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:15.730> by

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
you can create groups of houses just by

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.740 
you can create groups of houses just by
putting<00:03:16.299> these<00:03:16.480> in<00:03:16.780> here<00:03:17.110> like<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:19.480> so

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
putting these in here like that and so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.289 
putting these in here like that and so
on<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.260> endless<00:03:21.220> possibilities<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.030> what<00:03:22.180> you

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
on so endless possibilities to what you

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.180 
on so endless possibilities to what you
can<00:03:22.450> do<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.260> then<00:03:23.380> when<00:03:23.530> you're<00:03:23.680> ready<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.950> go
