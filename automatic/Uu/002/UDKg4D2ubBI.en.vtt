00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.259
 knitting gum required 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.210
 a small piece of cloth here I have from 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.139
 flesh left tissues 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.320
 to tie a gum on a fabric basis 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.410
 dimensions 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 in width somewhere 40 42 centimeters and 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.650
 a height of eight nine centimeters and need 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.560
 cut the fabric and sing it so that it does not 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:32.579
 blossomed now take cotton take 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.700
 hook 075 that is thin and begin 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.620
 to tie one side of the gum rather 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.059
 tissue until then there is this side 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.440
 now I will tie 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.640
 so well, you can with his faces with 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:54.410
 seamy side, as it were a special special 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.410
 there is no difference from fastening the thread 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.530
 So 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.850
 and begin to tie the fabric 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:25.030
 but so on, i.e. 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:30.510
 here to this place and so here I am knitted 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.510
 one side now I will need 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:40.680
 turn around I'll link here one more 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.680
 column to stand on the corner and 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:49.020
 Now I combine these two sides . 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.770
 I see specifically on the wrong side 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:59.380
 so that it is more convenient to do so and 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:05.740
 now from here I will connect here 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:08.470
 these two sides gently pull out 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.509
 thread and here it is here connecting here 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.640
 will need to leave space for the gum 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.060
 in order to insert a gum that is 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:22.420
 knit column then skip some 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.430
 distance and add further so null 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.489
 dressed to the middle approximate untied 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:34.780
 tail at the same time tying and now just 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:36.910
 I will tie a chain of literally 3 air 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.280
 loop I think this will be enough 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.489
 or you can have posts on one side 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.489
 knit and retreat given distance 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:54.910
 so we continue to connect these two 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.630
 Here are the parts, that is, you need to link up 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.630
 the end 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.600
 so here I am connected now 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.750
 me 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.340
 fabrics are required on one side of 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.400
 connected here with such an angle 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.770
 now you need to tie up the second 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.440
 side, that is, it will simply be here 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.570
 connected nothing wrong no the same 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:27.600
 we tie the very same columns and 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:29.950
 So I finished it and now I will need 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.570
 connect here these two Circuits 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.010
 Rivne 2 St side of this model and 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:42.220
 connect them and that is tie them together 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:45.030
 first I will change the hook that is 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.000
 a thin hook was needed only for fabric 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:56.050
 connect with the beginning of knitting 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:00.250
 semi-column so now I connect the data 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:07.980
 two sides and still need to make a loop 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:09.690
 and begin to bind these two sides 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.110
 together 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.780
 single crochets here number of loops 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.690
 from maybe different on one another 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.229
 the country will therefore just need them as 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.229
 would fit 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.270
 that is, if you have one side going 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.810
 a little ahead then you knit 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.760
 let's say on that side it will be 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.470
 the previous column is this next 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.120
 there is just enough to do it all but 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.570
 more or less number of loops should 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.620
 so there will be no problems here 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.729
 joining 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.919
 and so here you look at me a little 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.900
 how would the front row leave so i 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.310
 now in the front row knit 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:04.900
 the same loop of which I knit a 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:08.090
 in the back following this way 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.540
 you can align this 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:17.919
 they and so here I finish the connection 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.960
 one five left 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:27.080
 You can still here with the beginning 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.770
 knitting how to connect and get 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.770
 here is such 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.130
 gum 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.690
 so and then there may be options then 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.210
 here you can do any strapping I will 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:49.700
 knit pattern of crowns on site 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.860
 can see and so here i am 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.380
 practically I mean now 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.320
 I see the last row of this pattern here 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.510
 I want to make beads too 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.460
 how to do it means a bead for me 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.000
 intertwined 1 in the middle of this 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.250
 element here i have 7 should be 7 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.790
 peak and instead of this central 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.890
 peak I tie a bead to start 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:21.890
 I will change the hook to thin 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:24.130
 so turn on the central peak u see 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.610
 one loop 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:31.300
 so now 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:41.060
 put the loop on the hook 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:44.270
 pull the thread then attach to 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:50.180
 previous loop and from here to 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:52.700
 the base and so it turns out 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.390
 fastening the beads further turn on 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:01.240
 the next peak is peak i have them a hook so 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:03.540
 how thin it is very convenient for me to knit 3 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.600
 eyelets 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.600
 so careful fastening and 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:16.770
 joining in this way and so 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.870
 so I finished the finish here remains 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.720
 cut the thread but I already cut 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:25.110
 tie a knot and clean it neatly 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.150
 thread knitting and paste gum that is 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.890
 there is a place that is special 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.610
 left for this purpose and here 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.610
 gum is inserted
