00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this is why I thought that would be you

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.250 
this is why I thought that would be you
know<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.500> dual<00:00:43.829> LED<00:00:44.160> flash<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> iPhone<00:00:45.570> or

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
know a dual LED flash like the iPhone or

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.779 
know a dual LED flash like the iPhone or
it<00:00:46.350> has<00:00:46.469> two<00:00:46.680> different<00:00:46.829> colors<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.430> help<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it has two different colors to help it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.700 
it has two different colors to help it
right<00:00:48.090> yet<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:48.989> white<00:00:49.200> balance<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
right yet the right white balance of the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
right yet the right white balance of the
flash<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.280> no<00:00:50.460> no<00:00:51.120> they<00:00:51.300> did<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.570> didn't<00:00:51.809> do

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
flash but no no they did they didn't do

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.430 
flash but no no they did they didn't do
that<00:00:52.020> either

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that either

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.189 
that either
so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> mean<00:00:53.550> 16<00:00:54.239> megapixel<00:00:54.690> camera<00:00:54.989> that's

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
so I mean 16 megapixel camera that's

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.549 
so I mean 16 megapixel camera that's
nice<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.489> 805<00:00:57.480> snapdragon<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.440> not

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
nice I think it's 805 snapdragon I'm not

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
nice I think it's 805 snapdragon I'm not
quite<00:00:58.800> sure<00:00:58.829> they<00:00:59.219> don't<00:00:59.309> even<00:00:59.489> let<00:00:59.730> us<00:00:59.789> know

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
quite sure they don't even let us know

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.599 
quite sure they don't even let us know
that<00:01:00.359> yet<00:01:00.949> gameplay<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> ride<00:01:02.579> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that yet gameplay I have to ride that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.329 
that yet gameplay I have to ride that
out<00:01:02.910> thus<00:01:03.239> far<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.750> very<00:01:04.350> very<00:01:05.040> very

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.539 
out thus far and it's very very very
very<00:01:05.580> very<00:01:05.729> smooth<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> plus<00:01:07.549> but

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
