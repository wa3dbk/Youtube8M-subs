00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello guys how are you welcome to a 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.430
 new video here I have written what 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.020
 I have planned to tell you in this video 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.269
 but first of all if you are in 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.429
 this video and you are already subscribed to this 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.740
 channel like the video we'll see 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.030
 how many people watch the videos and are 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.220
 subscribed because they may have 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.109
 people who are subscribed but I do not 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.520
 remain line allow 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.080
 you understood me I'm going to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.430
 explain several things about this channel 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.320
 Several people have asked me 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.930
 what in a gameplays my face does not come out and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 all that and I think it is necessary that 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.859
 the face comes out when the gameplay what 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.390
 merit or let's say it's a gameplay 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.460
 of terror and toxo because the idea is that 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.469
 you see how I scare like a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.170
 girl when they are gameplays let's say how 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.570
 the xinzo with the dgt so super normal 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.090
 Well, I'm not going to take the task 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.489
 by the oasis to record the reaction of my 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 face and all this well so let's say 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.000
 can upload more gameplays if all that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.920
 The important thing is that you are 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.559
 commenting on the gameplay and all that but 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 then I explain when it is worth 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.000
 the face and all that already when 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.739
 the gameplay is worth it for me to have 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.260
 my face there for you to see my 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.000
 reaction that will happen I want them 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 comment we are having on these 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.710
 moments two series that is the one of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.800
 minecraft that I started contact and that of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.500
 the ins that I want to achieve about 40 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.180
 episodes more or less and already after 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.479
 that then I will do another series with the ins and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 so the one of classrooms that is only the first 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.369
 chapter I had a problem with the game and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.509
 I had to reinstall and all that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.250
 project is better what you are going to buy 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 original and all that so you do not have 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.289
 the problems because it turns out that I 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.720
 had advanced but did not keep the 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.610
 process and then how was a game 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.280
 downloaded cracked out there the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.470
 internet let's say it was not not so 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.300
 cool then they have some tips that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.190
 I will buy it and there we make this 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.110
 series has been quite quick and 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.850
 we left her in a week or two 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.770
 weeks this is mostly a 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.869
 question for all of you and it's 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.479
 regarding the duration of the videos and 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.220
 I would like to know if it bothers you that 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.750
 have gameplays let's say like those of the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.149
 series that there are times many last 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.480
 minutes then I'm really interested 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.510
 much that they comment 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.130
 because it's important for me to know that and 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.570
 it is this video I do it more than anything 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.190
 that for us to say we have a 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.710
 conversation you who see the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.810
 game 3 and I also wanted to ask them the 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.810
 please tell me about many games 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.150
 random that they would like to see since they are 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.330
 more or less the games that I like 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.890
 a lot of playing here on the channel but it does not fit 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
 I doubt that I also like it when 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.460
 you recommend me games and then 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.950
 then do not stop recommending them in 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.260
 the gameplays comment and it occurred to me 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.750
 that you upload a gameplay of the game and here 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.010
 I want to apologize for some 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.440
 gameplays that the audio has been 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.450
 pretty bad I'm trying to fix 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.120
 I do not know why some presal game is 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.160
 supremely well and others not in and is the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.110
 same microphone then I'm trying 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.240
 to solve that I think he already caught 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.670
 the shot and all that then really 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.380
 sorry for these inconveniences and 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.630
 everything is the same we are starting with this 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.370
 channel and the idea is that we go very 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.650
 well and I go learning a lot a lot 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.840
 very much if you have suggestions if 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.330
 they know something they think I should know 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.070
 so do not hesitate to let me know 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.030
 this is a question also for all 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.200
 your 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.700
 also as something I wanted 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.890
 share with you and it is that I was 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.750
 some ideas to make a 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.330
 new contests either one monthly 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.680

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.630
 Obtain something obviously everything 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.459
 related to posts then I 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.709
 I wonder what kind of things if 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.200
 they want accounts in some game if 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.120
 they want some original game could 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.520
 do something like this let's say that this month I'm going 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.550
 to give such a game for pc the other month 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.739

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.870
 game for playstation then you guys 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.630
 let me know in the comments 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.070
