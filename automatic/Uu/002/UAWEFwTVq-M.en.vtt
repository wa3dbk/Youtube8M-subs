 I have not come here for a little while you have a good excuse 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.830
 I was lazy you saw all three months conditional lazy months 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.469
 for example 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.710
 these events the big maneuvers neighbor I was well in pain of skull 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.709
 then I will have to make decisions 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.749
 Ruffier 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.899
 kayak 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.409
 afterwards I realized that I wanted toys at 5 9% in the end they had 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.800
 a minimum of fairly confused problem players is that I have always had the 

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.799

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 mayor 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.850
 after I have never seen 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.140
 the places she dropped a bomb head of the old lady 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.120
 but the more time passes and the more I feel free I forget the world 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.010
 it even happens to me in this respect is not because I'm too lazy to cook 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.590
 golden palms - 9 years old but it does not bother anyone but especially 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.080
 after last year 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 always stronger 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.340

 Strategic for co-development jaked order 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.750
 the e-book accessing the ground 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.750
 i am a whore g 23 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.780
 what to do 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.620
 except that in fact 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.960

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.960

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.280

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.310
 credible 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.490
 rachid benaissa thom mayne next week is not a competition 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.410

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.449

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.929
 not easy 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.969
 on the other hand it will be necessary to let him influx 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.679
 his goal is to help the victim family was never grown at the time of 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.709
 the accident it overflows the title backwards by 0 25% 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.519
 crap 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.039

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.349
