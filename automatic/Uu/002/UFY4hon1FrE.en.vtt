for two for you to bring down a pillar

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.490 
for two for you to bring down a pillar
it's<00:01:56.459> not<00:01:56.640> worth<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> mean<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:57.990> yes<00:01:58.259> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
it's not worth it but I mean if yes you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.990 
it's not worth it but I mean if yes you
wanted<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.830> slowly<00:01:59.069> try<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.459> start<00:01:59.700> taking<00:01:59.939> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
wanted to slowly try to start taking it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
wanted to slowly try to start taking it
down<00:02:00.209> and<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.630> off<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.289> it's<00:02:01.740> kind<00:02:01.950> of

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
down and get off it it's kind of

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:12.130 
down and get off it it's kind of
annoying<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.060> know<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.539> it<00:02:03.780> is

okay<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.410> lastly<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.099> takes<00:02:14.459> between<00:02:15.239> four

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
okay and lastly it takes between four

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.380 
okay and lastly it takes between four
and<00:02:15.720> five<00:02:16.019> c4's<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.769> take<00:02:16.950> down<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.130> pillar<00:02:17.390> it's

used the attack helicopter and PC to
bring<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.390> down<00:02:30.540> yet<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.930> don't<00:02:30.989> know<00:02:31.109> how

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200

many missiles it would take or how many
shots<00:02:33.900> from<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.410> from<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:34.890> gunner<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.340> I'm

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
shots from the from the gunner but I'm

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.500 
shots from the from the gunner but I'm
sure<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.230> possible<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.370> also<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:39.239> tank

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
sure it is possible and also the tank

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.240 
sure it is possible and also the tank
will<00:02:39.720> only<00:02:39.959> take<00:02:40.200> two<00:02:40.470> shots<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.920> break<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
will only take two shots to break a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.590 
will only take two shots to break a
killer<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:41.819> that's<00:02:42.030> something<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.299> keep<00:02:42.450> in

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
killer so that's something to keep in

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.020 
killer so that's something to keep in
