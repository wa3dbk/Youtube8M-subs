00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
minecraft design I actually got in the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.310 
minecraft design I actually got in the
same<00:00:21.330> video<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> did<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:24.320> super

same video that I did the the super
compact<00:00:25.680> wrexham<00:00:26.099> torch<00:00:26.340> key<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> thing

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
compact wrexham torch key now the thing

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.570 
compact wrexham torch key now the thing
about<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.170> design<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.890> awesome<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.460> it's

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
about this design it's awesome and it's

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.310 
about this design it's awesome and it's
small<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.150> flush<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.660> wall<00:00:30.750> but

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
small and it's flush with the wall but

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.440 
small and it's flush with the wall but
the<00:00:31.590> problem<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.309> not<00:00:32.399> tileable<00:00:33.149> it's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the problem is it's not tileable it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.080 
the problem is it's not tileable it's
not<00:00:33.950> stackable<00:00:34.950> anything<00:00:35.309> along<00:00:35.520> those<00:00:35.730> lines

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
not stackable anything along those lines

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940 
not stackable anything along those lines
but<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.690> basically<00:00:37.020> need<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
but if you basically need just like a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.680 
but if you basically need just like a
single<00:00:38.280> double<00:00:38.670> piston<00:00:38.820> extender<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.510> will

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
single double piston extender this will

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.819 
single double piston extender this will
do<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.840> job<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:42.570> let's<00:00:42.750> build<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.739> what

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
do the job so let's build it so what

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.180 
do the job so let's build it so what
we're<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.680> 33<00:00:46.680> wide<00:00:46.950> base

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
we're going to do is it's a 33 wide base

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.240 
we're going to do is it's a 33 wide base
3<00:00:47.910> by<00:00:48.120> 4<00:00:48.180> should<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.809> good<00:00:49.010> we're<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> do

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
3 by 4 should be good we're going to do

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
3 by 4 should be good we're going to do
oh<00:00:50.280> snap<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.320> go

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
oh snap don't have that there we go

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.430 
oh snap don't have that there we go
sticky<00:00:53.039> piston<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.600> lock<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
sticky piston here and here lock that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.310 
sticky piston here and here lock that
it's<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> push<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.199> this<00:00:58.199> is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it's going to push out like so this is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
it's going to push out like so this is
where<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.590> wall<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.840> right

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
where your wall is going to be right

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.330 
where your wall is going to be right
there<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.680> we're<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.039> redstone

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
there then we're going to put redstone

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.630 
there then we're going to put redstone
dust<00:01:02.820> repeater<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.930> two<00:01:04.260> ticks<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> a

normally would be here there you got a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
normally would be here there you got a
double<00:01:16.890> piston<00:01:17.130> extending<00:01:17.729> now<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> thing

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
double piston extending now the thing

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.170 
double piston extending now the thing
about<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.530> redstone<00:01:20.100> line<00:01:20.430> has<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> go

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
about it is this redstone line has to go

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
about it is this redstone line has to go
into<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.630> block<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.890> want<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> like
