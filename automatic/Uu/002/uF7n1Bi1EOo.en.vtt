00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.480
 Uschi -ing 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.450
 as you can see 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.690
 many boats move more ashore as well as the water they roll 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.660
 be taken somewhere and there it happens exactly that they are somewhere 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.050
 on the highway and have to 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.720
 that it is very important that their transport damage 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.220
 are insured 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.830
 but sometimes it's not just the transportation on the highway 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.020
 but maybe that too can do what they do every year 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.590
 happens exactly what you see here a small yacht is damaged dean 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.940
 Maybe it should be part of your comprehensive insurance 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.940
 These transports should be in the cover 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.050
 Korea stands for me the ugly face of damage at all 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.190
 The Maltese in the winter camp wall has seen ships beyond recognition 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.289
 burnt 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.590
 that should really work 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.660
 worry about whether the insurance value he with his 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.860
 Insurer made off has really stuck 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.350
 no deductions as time value or similar 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.509
 the second thing you have to keep in mind from the hall operator 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.520
 or the neighbor where the fire may have started 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.619
 Just see something if they can really keep the imprisonment for you 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.720
 to go to the brute prove safety fire push theirs 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.110
 Comprehensive insurance covered third point, the WAK said must cost such 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.720
 Ships leave traces These traces must be disposed of as hazardous waste 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.930
 and very important 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 that includes Minden of her caste 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.070
 Button they see that works fast and sometimes 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.049
 It happens in situations where they do not know each other 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.600
 it does not happen in the best time so you have to have a hotline from 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.280
 please ask your insurer 365 days a year, seven days a week 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.520
 please do not just do that at their deeds table as they come in 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.070
 Wait a minute 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.190
 nowadays a memory in the mobile phone 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.950
 maybe very pocketed in your pocket very importantly recognized do a lot 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.790
 you can rinse their engines with frits and so on 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.490
 that she will then 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 last song again to do sensible water sports 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.040
 the corner measure church 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.569
 we see in the picture 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.450
 but boss has lost the mast sad story often more expensive damage altogether 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.840
 important if you have such an i have to push that 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.879
 advertise new behavior 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.890
 No one will know the active ones in the automotive sector 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.590
 There are no used parts 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.209
 They need to be in the place where they have the damage 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.420
 in the quality as they have the damage he keeps replacing the damage 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.049
 to let 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.780
 Two of the points that are important are the consequential damage from wear 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.539
 and so on wear is usually uninsured 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:47.579
 but the consequence of this may put a kid that sounds in Brake's 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.099
 made sure that the complete way from the field 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.469
 this exclusion 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.960
 be insured the consequence of the exclusion material 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.530
 Wear must be assured that it may not be replaced inspired 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.360
 but get the actual outbreak the expensive damage fifteen thousand euros 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.359
 the one with this Hanseatic League 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.359
 it has to be completely replaced 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.549
 all the stable when I started these lectures three years ago 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.699
 Obama still in sixth place now we are in fourth place 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.429
 Things that I can use on the hall floor, I can also on the other 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.679
 Use beluga group and you always know exactly there are big ones 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.959
 Warehouses Thousands of ships are in a marina while ships in one 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.009
 Waran a rodent hall 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.039
 It can quickly come that professionals come to the idea of ​​things too 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.439
 to change 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.180
 steal 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.770
 There is an engraving action 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.460
 many water police departments are there with we support it 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.480
 Identifier from Andy King will be attached if stolen 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.970
 will be clearly identifiable as if they are successful 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.129
 Action almost nothing just once 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.440
 look on the internet side 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.079
 then they can take part in it 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.699
 The second important thing your insurer should have over a network 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:54.280
 feature 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.089
 if the complete book way 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.780
 and that does not matter if it's a new boat is an old state gates 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.250
 or a cheap one pretty or an ugly one 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.470
 Boats are needed for everything yes my network over a hundred thousand 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.760
 Contacts are initiated 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.349
 if a sandwich is stolen we have a reconnaissance quota of nearly 70 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.159
 percent 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.400
 and you are the owner 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.160
 Certainly proud to get your boat back if they are not us 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
 maybe ask a couple of questions 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.879
 and ere radiation is certainly already happening in there 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.750
 We are spoiled for different species and ways in Northern Germany 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.570
 there is 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.320
 the German society to rescue castaways if we have something 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.629
 happens to drag and drop which costs a few euros in the Czech Republic 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.270
 something he likes to pay other countries other customs 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.240
 this is about salvaged values 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.330
 or can such a salvage as we see here in front of the island Krippenfahrt 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.599
 Hermann costs 60 thousand euros 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:47.990
 something if 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.770
 Only covered is bad insurance and should be covered if they 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.440
 These mountains have been considered necessary if they were afraid a bit more 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.639
 Hull insurance must be done by the day quite important 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.639
 thereon 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.400
 envy 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.430
 The Englishman says Keck dips a nice word there if it's a bad thing 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.009
 they saw one here in 2004 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.999
 Jena may be supposed Rincón safe 250 ships are ashore 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.409
 but why not go so far Marina Wendtorf 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.399
 there are also ship ashore what can you do insured he must damage 

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.789
 Management can operate when their boss is in the hall 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.680
 then you can not rely on it just that the hall operator 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.650
 worry about it 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.940
 that the ships get out there we start playing Mikado 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.809
 get three four Thiele Kane 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:37.770
 what if the boats underneath these ruined halls 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.250
 "People who are strong enough can know that when it comes to harm 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.650
 We pick up our shack Word "Out" They look for a strong partner 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.650
 then she can be sure that it is his own 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:58.969
 really the most common cause of damage we have around 30 percent appeared 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.619
 are collisions 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:04.330
 Fortunately, the individual are not so expensive in Gaal if they are optimists 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.210
 full of ambition popping together 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.089
 Motor yachts that meet many or 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:10.090
 any 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.529
 Ute each other 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.789
 destroy at the beginning when I started the damage at Pentling 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:15.330
 at division 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.230
 Haldimann wondered why people end up on tons at around 7 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.349
 very easily 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.729
 the Kurdin species are in the map I set my way for the points 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.559
 Autopilot right there 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.150
 the one just below the ground my coffee cup 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.080
 and schwuppdiwupp 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.610
 sees himself on a stone 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.809
 but also all mountains 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:31.940
 is very important 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.550
 when it comes to collisions 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.550
 that they have a competent partner here 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.090
 that it is race regulation and they regulate shipping lanes 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.780
 Forcing collision avoidance or doing something else 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.689
 her the song is short 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:47.689
 with us in Oberburg Europe maximum of April 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:51.469
 maybe September October if then insurer would be 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.580
 it takes a lot of time to work on the damage 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.129
 you know that's over too 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:56.409
 Siam put a lot of money in it 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:58.809
 We do not wish that we are looking for you are competent 

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:00.319
 then that's a lot of fun done quickly
