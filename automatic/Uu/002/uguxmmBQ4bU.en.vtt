00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.040
 well how about friends this is a new 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:15.460
 video in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.529
 how to make the memory change 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:22.610
 external and internal in our samsung 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:25.370
 galaxy s advance with cyanogenmod 10.1 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.070
 it's something that I usually use for 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.400
 the fact that I have several games 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.920
 installed 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.140
 I show you I have a lot of four 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.620
 plants versus two zombies of wheat 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.870
 and if fa 14 and as you can see what 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.829
 needed was to pass the data to the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.440
 external memory 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.160
 and of course have the applications 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.530
 in memory of 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.840
 well what we do let's rudd 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.050
 explorer or any explorer 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.850
 files with root access so that 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.280
 we can access the root of access 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.250
 now that explorer works very well and 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.520
 is the one he has used since I know him 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.860
 and since I'm in the world of android 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.240
 and then we go up one level 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.240
 we go to the root directory 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.990
 we can not see after we go down 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.730
 to the system folder in the directory 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.759
 root 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.710
 we are going to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.100
 etc or etcetera 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.190
 a folder we went down to the end and 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.700
 we found the file vol 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.690
 efe is long 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.750
 we keep pressed to open with 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.470
 and there we put a text editor that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.580
 we want 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.670
 well you can not see well the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.130
 I do not think it's true, but I know 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.500
 I explain so simple what they have to 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.530
 do 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.659
 is in the case of 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.180
 well it takes a little bit even though I do not know 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.869
 note says internalize carbon 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.300
 vermont in the case of mount is at 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.840
 beginning of the internal line of sd card 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.739
 says that that of jail or 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.069
 then it has bar storage sd bar 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.010
 card 0 back and that what we do is 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.650
 change it to zero those two values are 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.350
 it loads it or is this one of zero cal and that of 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.940
 jail we change it for s vicar 1 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.130
 it was ruled out 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.160
 and we leave it as it is but you 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.560
 we change the value and in the most 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.140
 down external SD card 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.690
 exactly the same but as in this 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.990
 case of monk you see each one what 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.170
 we change for cancer 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.430
 and then we put save options and 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.430
 leave and there after doing this 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.430
 we restart 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.260
 and that 's where the change should be 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.790
 of memory that want to be I show you 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.530
 a storage space in 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.010
 configurations 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:15.260
 good and you will see the internal storage 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.769
 and after the internal storage that 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.310
 I get 14 81 gigas it is actually 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.579
 a memory card of 16 gb and I the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.530
 I take as storage inta and then 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.110
 of the internal storage that remain 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.720
 the 4 gigas that the cell phone leaves for 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.420
 our bus 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.580
 and well that would be the change but what 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.890
 can do and another option that I think that 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.890
 it's the easiest but they were wanted 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.590
 show the drop for when they are over 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.410
 advanced on the subject if you follow 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.540
 updating the rom and do not have to 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.250
 be loading the file and so on 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.410
 etc 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:59.770
 they are going to explorer the same they go to the 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:02.260
 root directory go to system etc and there 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.880
 what they do is paste the file that they 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.050
 I'm going to leave 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.180
 in the mega rise description that is going to 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.730
 have the same file name as 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.450
 we just edited it would be bold 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.639
 efe ct avelar 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.560
 and what they do what they would have to do 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.900
 with this file with silk with the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.810
 originals grabbed 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.910
 and copy and paste it in any 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.860
 place where you can 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.039
 protect on your cell phone and if you want 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.100
 can pass to the pc porta hood in case 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:38.940
 that they want to have memory again 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.490
 It is with the original as coming but if not 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.720
 what they can do is replace it 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.490
 in the file that I leave in the 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.880
 description and paste it here in it 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:55.060
 here in the directory would be root system 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:58.150
 etc put him ride hereu bar w I think 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.430
 what is it and that is going to allow them to paste what 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.310
 they do not replace and restart and there 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.380
 It should work more than anything to 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.320
 save yourself the whole round but as you 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.290
 said at the beginning and when they are more 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.060
 more with confidence and if they want to save 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.520
 weather 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.350
 to make the change you have to be 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.260
 his first file going from cell phone 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.860
 etcetera already directly change over 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.180
 the values of the file and such would be 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.870
 well this has been today's video 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.020
 I hope you have served them and any 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.880
 I leave you in comments I leave the 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.669
 link to download the file and what 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.850
 can replace thanks and even the 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.850
 next
