00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 so continuing the construction decided 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:10.110
 dig a trench even deeper for some 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 my snowy cause is muddy here 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.220
 here the soil is so wet here you can see 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.689
 Immediately very easily smeared 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:25.170
 glen clay itself consists of 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.510
 little bits there 0 0 1 millimeter then 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 have them very tiny it's like me 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.730
 tired of the sand so she comes out like 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.660
 moisture barrier but it does 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.850
 it keeps itself wet and constantly it is like 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.390
 would be saying it is near 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.239
 with clay somewhere and when frost comes 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.610
 this moisture starts to expand freezing 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.600
 and pushes foundation whereby 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 I decided to try to dig more as 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.520
 at least on the bayonet deeper and wake up 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.930
 sand and this trench 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.180
 This is what I thought everyone said that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.549
 clay is like a good foundation under 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.820
 house new forces that can not be she 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.619
 good because she can 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 foundation push nobody listen 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.450
 never collect 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.310
 many many opinions and do your 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.729
 own decision because 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.380
 only you are responsible for building the house 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.299
 build your house even if you 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.829
 what non brigade works anyway you 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.520
 will answer themselves because it is home 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.100
 you will live with him and all of them 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.549
 shoals is your decision to hire 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.030
 these very people are also collecting a bunch 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.799
 opinions make your decision 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.360
 when you yourself answer you treat 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:51.360
 all with all my occupation with most 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.380
 accuracy and more reasonableness in 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.649
 Generally digging somewhere else on the bayonet of the wedge 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.200
 So you see what it is adhered to even 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.229
 shoes and wet wet i.e. moisture 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.409
 it constantly lingers chamber on 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.099
 all as clay on the sole all 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.590
 sticks 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.349
 therefore she cannot but be good 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.099
 foundation for the foundation like me 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:20.040
 advises some in general sand gonna 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.319
 pour ramming and then more rubble 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.230
 I will order everything, I will put it in rubble too 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.510
 I put to sleep on top and about ramming a little 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.480
 the list will be better 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.760
 will allow to amortize that is when 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.410
 David here is this ground from below although I have 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.690
 deeper than the depth of freezing but still 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.040
 just in case I decided to hedge 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.849
 after all, it's not your house to save 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.569
 It is like this, when the ground presses on 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.090
 foundation below then sand is capable 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.510
 it starts to absorb 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.420
 roll in the sides once walked and thereby 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.840
 reduces the load on the foundation therefore 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.670
 sand you need to do a pension pillow 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.819
 not on all soils but on such here 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.790
 as they are called heaving soils 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.430
 which are heaving ones which 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.129
 rises when the ground freezes from 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.870
 it's better to make them worse on them 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.080
 it definitely won't make a good piece 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.840
 sustain the load on its own and certainly 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.950
 I do not remember but about five kilograms 5 6 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.430
 kilogram per centimeter per centimeter 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.379
 square to whom 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.659
 I donâ€™t remember these characteristics 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.930
 you can see it more read 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.670
 more information gather information 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.359
 different opinions people advise different 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.879
 someone advises 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.189
 build on clay someone advise not 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.819
 build on clay are you going to this whole 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:51.069
 information as much as possible opinions 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.629
 analyze some mean take 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:57.219
 the solution to all of this, use logic 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:01.150
 see what is more logical 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:02.919
 from what people say, they say that 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.530
 good waterproofing clay types for 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:07.419
 the foundation and the bottom that does not pass from it 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.129
 water well what kind of waterproofing is it 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.430
 itself here it is wet it is 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:15.489
 water glitters can waterproofing be 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.570
 inside is wet i think it is not 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:22.210
 some kind of fig waterproofing 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.120
 natural natural no she not 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.560
 waterproofing is just not comfortable 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.300
 trench material in general 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.910
 continuing to dig further i just decided 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.530
 while resting do such here their 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.530
 considerations video
