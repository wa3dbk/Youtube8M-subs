and it the reason it's so hard to find

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.219 
and it the reason it's so hard to find
is<00:05:15.430> because<00:05:15.669> it<00:05:15.789> actually<00:05:15.820> comes<00:05:16.300> in<00:05:16.510> a<00:05:16.599> set<00:05:16.990> of

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
is because it actually comes in a set of

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.830 
is because it actually comes in a set of
like<00:05:17.440> a<00:05:17.590> lot<00:05:18.010> of<00:05:18.039> clothes<00:05:18.460> so<00:05:18.729> it<00:05:19.240> comes<00:05:19.450> in<00:05:19.719> a

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
like a lot of clothes so it comes in a

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.480 
like a lot of clothes so it comes in a
set<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.200> like<00:05:20.349> all<00:05:20.530> of<00:05:20.560> these<00:05:20.800> different<00:05:20.860> genes

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
last two that I am going to be showing

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.800 
last two that I am going to be showing
you<00:06:08.349> they<00:06:09.039> are<00:06:09.340> a<00:06:09.880> little<00:06:10.210> bit<00:06:10.389> different<00:06:10.719> I

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
you they are a little bit different I

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:37.779 
top but it's okay I think it still looks

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:39.810 
top but it's okay I think it still looks
pretty<00:06:37.930> good<00:06:38.169> very<00:06:38.500> old<00:06:38.830> Justin<00:06:39.400> Bieber<00:06:39.789> but

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
pretty good very old Justin Bieber but

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.430 
pretty good very old Justin Bieber but
it<00:06:40.060> is<00:06:40.150> really<00:06:40.360> long<00:06:40.630> in<00:06:40.810> the<00:06:40.870> back<00:06:41.050> so<00:06:41.289> it<00:06:41.409> is

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
it is really long in the back so it is

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.959 
it is really long in the back so it is
kind<00:06:41.740> of<00:06:41.830> nice<00:06:41.979> I<00:06:42.159> do<00:06:42.219> like<00:06:42.520> it<00:06:42.700> it<00:06:42.820> looks

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:42.969 
kind of nice I do like it it looks

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.670 
kind of nice I do like it it looks
pretty<00:06:43.060> good<00:06:43.389> this<00:06:43.930> is<00:06:44.080> one<00:06:44.200> of<00:06:44.229> those<00:06:44.320> hairs<00:06:44.560> I

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
pretty good this is one of those hairs I

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
pretty good this is one of those hairs I
think<00:06:44.860> what<00:06:44.979> that<00:06:45.130> would<00:06:45.279> look<00:06:45.400> a<00:06:45.490> little<00:06:45.580> bit

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
think what that would look a little bit

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.370 
think what that would look a little bit
better<00:06:45.909> like<00:06:46.150> in<00:06:46.389> game<00:06:46.750> rather<00:06:47.020> than<00:06:47.139> in

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
better like in game rather than in

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.710 
better like in game rather than in
create-a-sim<00:06:48.010> that's<00:06:48.639> just<00:06:48.940> my<00:06:49.060> opinion<00:06:49.539> I

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
create-a-sim that's just my opinion I

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.900 
create-a-sim that's just my opinion I
like<00:06:49.750> it<00:06:50.110> I'm<00:06:50.259> gonna<00:06:50.410> keep<00:06:50.590> it<00:06:50.800> so<00:06:51.039> that's<00:06:51.669> what

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
like it I'm gonna keep it so that's what

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.879 
like it I'm gonna keep it so that's what
I'm<00:06:52.030> going<00:06:52.180> with<00:06:52.479> so<00:06:53.110> that<00:06:53.259> is<00:06:53.410> it<00:06:53.620> for<00:06:53.770> my

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889
