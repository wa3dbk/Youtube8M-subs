extreme<00:00:08.650> compression<00:00:08.980> on<00:00:09.280> drums<00:00:09.580> is<00:00:09.820> a<00:00:10.059> sound

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
extreme compression on drums is a sound

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.330 
extreme compression on drums is a sound
we're<00:00:10.690> all<00:00:10.809> familiar<00:00:11.049> with<00:00:11.320> the<00:00:12.039> ambient

qualities<00:00:12.850> of<00:00:13.030> a<00:00:13.120> room<00:00:13.360> can<00:00:13.959> sound<00:00:14.230> like

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
qualities of a room can sound like

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.930 
qualities of a room can sound like
they're<00:00:14.559> pumping<00:00:15.010> and<00:00:15.190> beat<00:00:15.400> with<00:00:15.549> the<00:00:15.730> song

they're pumping and beat with the song

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.210 
they're pumping and beat with the song
which<00:00:16.390> makes<00:00:16.660> us<00:00:16.810> imagine<00:00:17.259> a<00:00:17.349> room<00:00:17.560> that<00:00:18.130> is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
which makes us imagine a room that is

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.150 
which makes us imagine a room that is
saturated<00:00:18.550> with<00:00:19.000> excitement<00:00:19.840> and<00:00:20.050> energy<00:00:20.349> but

snare<00:02:10.420> drum<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.500> now<00:02:11.590> we're<00:02:11.709> going<00:02:11.800> to

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
snare drum so now we're going to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.990 
snare drum so now we're going to
activate<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.459> compressor<00:02:12.940> by<00:02:13.090> hitting<00:02:13.269> play

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.580 

to<00:02:19.000> illustrate<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.540> extreme<00:02:19.930> possibilities

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
to illustrate the extreme possibilities

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.380 
to illustrate the extreme possibilities
of<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:20.860> process<00:02:21.370> we're<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.120> set<00:02:22.269> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
of this process we're going to set the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.870 
of this process we're going to set the
attack<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.019> release<00:02:23.110> controls<00:02:23.920> both<00:02:24.610> to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
attack and release controls both to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
attack and release controls both to
their<00:02:25.030> fastest<00:02:25.599> settings

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.330 

pull<00:02:31.900> down<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.080> threshold<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.830> we<00:02:32.950> really<00:02:33.220> get

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
pull down the threshold so we really get

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:42.539 
pull down the threshold so we really get
it<00:02:33.430> cooking<00:02:40.319> now<00:02:41.319> slowly<00:02:41.620> turn<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.099> the

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
it cooking now slowly turn up the

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.940 
it cooking now slowly turn up the
parallel<00:02:42.940> drum<00:02:43.330> aux<00:02:43.599> fader<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.530> blend<00:02:44.799> the

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.130 

check<00:03:01.849> it<00:03:01.939> out<00:03:02.000> let's<00:03:02.209> let's<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.689> be<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.959> with

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
check it out let's let's a be it with

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:13.660 
check it out let's let's a be it with
and<00:03:03.290> without<00:03:03.379> this<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.859> with<00:03:09.310> with

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.480 

without

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.950 

now<00:03:17.490> we're<00:03:17.610> going<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.760> add<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.240> room<00:03:18.480> mics<00:03:18.750> to

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
now we're going to add the room mics to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.760 
now we're going to add the room mics to
the<00:03:19.080> parallel<00:03:19.470> bus

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
the parallel bus

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.260 
the parallel bus
notice<00:03:20.040> how<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.220> room<00:03:20.490> qualities<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.210> the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
notice how the room qualities of the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.510 
notice how the room qualities of the
recording<00:03:21.780> or<00:03:22.010> hyperaccelerated<00:03:23.010> like

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
recording or hyperaccelerated like

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:33.290 
recording or hyperaccelerated like
they're<00:03:23.670> ready<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.060> take<00:03:24.270> off<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:32.700> wasn't<00:03:33.000> just

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
they're ready to take off it wasn't just

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.460 
they're ready to take off it wasn't just
the<00:03:33.450> parallel<00:03:33.900> bus

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.320 

it's<00:03:41.470> really<00:03:41.830> flying<00:03:42.100> now<00:03:42.430> let's<00:03:42.970> see<00:03:43.090> what<00:03:43.240> it

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
it's really flying now let's see what it

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.000 
it's really flying now let's see what it
sounds<00:03:43.540> like<00:03:43.570> if<00:03:43.720> we<00:03:43.840> take<00:03:44.050> away<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.470> room<00:03:44.710> and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
sounds like if we take away the room and

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.130 
sounds like if we take away the room and
add<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.580> overheads

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.570 

now<00:03:50.140> it's<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.409> symbols<00:03:50.799> that<00:03:50.860> are<00:03:51.069> pumping<00:03:51.400> to

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
now it's the symbols that are pumping to

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:00.490 
now it's the symbols that are pumping to
extremes

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.810 

and<00:04:01.500> just<00:04:01.710> for<00:04:01.860> fun<00:04:02.010> watch<00:04:02.250> what<00:04:02.460> happens<00:04:02.670> when

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
and just for fun watch what happens when

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.120 
and just for fun watch what happens when
we<00:04:02.910> add<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> reverb<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.530> parallel<00:04:04.950> bus

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
we add a reverb to the parallel bus

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.110 
we add a reverb to the parallel bus
let's<00:04:05.910> hear<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.360> load

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.290 

it's<00:04:11.780> similar<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.410> room<00:04:12.650> but<00:04:13.310> different

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
it's similar to the room but different

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.039 
it's similar to the room but different
for<00:04:14.480> sure<00:04:16.540> so<00:04:17.540> that's<00:04:17.720> it

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
for sure so that's it

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.689 
for sure so that's it
now<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.560> have<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.739> basic<00:04:18.980> sense<00:04:19.400> of<00:04:19.549> how<00:04:19.669> a

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
now you have a basic sense of how a

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.600 
now you have a basic sense of how a
parallel<00:04:20.299> drum<00:04:20.570> bus<00:04:20.780> can<00:04:21.019> work<00:04:21.169> again<00:04:22.040> we

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
parallel drum bus can work again we

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.460 
parallel drum bus can work again we
usually<00:04:22.940> push<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.360> for<00:04:23.570> noticeable<00:04:24.080> effect

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
usually push it for noticeable effect

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.050 
usually push it for noticeable effect
when<00:04:24.650> we're<00:04:24.800> mixing<00:04:25.160> but<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.400> don't<00:04:25.580> have<00:04:25.760> to

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
when we're mixing but you don't have to

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.530 
when we're mixing but you don't have to
you<00:04:26.750> can<00:04:26.780> explore<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.380> wide<00:04:27.710> range<00:04:28.190> between

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
you can explore a wide range between

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.570 
you can explore a wide range between
subtlety<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:29.750> extremes<00:04:30.620> on<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.070> drums<00:04:31.370> or

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
subtlety and extremes on the drums or

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.820 
subtlety and extremes on the drums or
