00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello everyone is steven is 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.910
 today in this new video I 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.190
 will introduce you five eyeos themes 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.859
 so is five of my favorite themes that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.420
 I find particularly successful and they 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.070
 are all paying for this first 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.529
 episode but soon I will propose 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.300
 five other themes all free so 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.580
 I left the first 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.420
 selected here it is so it's a theme 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.580
 magnificent 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.070
 that's what it looks like it is called in 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.969
 iris and he came out very recently on 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 cydia 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.960
 this is what he proposes for icons 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.610
 they are all edit more than 200 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.800
 icon redone with this theme she 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.570
 comes from the app store of cydia or 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 that she is native we really a 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 beautiful theme that draws inspiration 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.879
 a lot of what ios is proposing is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.140
 but still modifying a small 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.059
 little icons you see what that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 so it's still pretty close to the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.850
 ayo's style is so for those who 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.620
 appreciate it can really be a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.399
 good point while still modifying 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.230
 The icons 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.219
 then what I find really cool 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.230
 with this theme it is that it proposes 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.210
 several custom wallpapers that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.920
 find you here in the category of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.229
 wallpapers of a bone is so by 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 example this one so we have six funds 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.490
 screen in total that come with eiris 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 and they are all really successful so 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.119
 I who particularly appreciate the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.979
 beautiful wallpapers with eiris I 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.869
 rather served so look what it 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.420
 for example this one here it is 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.790
 now on the springboard 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.850
 the second theme that I selected the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.840
 here it is called anne kate new so I 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.369
 you had already presented it in a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.720
 complete video I had you too 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.070
 besides proposed to win it 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.840
 so that's a theme you have 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 really appreciated that's why I 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.860
 present them here very quickly he goes 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.280
 also change a lot of your 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.259
 icons 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.670
 again the apps that 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.320
 come from the app store or from 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 cydia as these are modified 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.470
 really a sublime theme n kate 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.560
 the third theme of this little top 5 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.119
 here he is called fusion and he 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.740
 looks a little bit like iris that I 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.600
 introduced you first because 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.789
 resumes the style of a bone is in 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.259
 adapting it slightly this is how 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.110
 presents all the icons that are proposed 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.000
 fusion these are mostly native icons 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.380
 who will have a new design but fusion 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.729
 is continually updated 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.540
 it is a theme that I recommend 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.280
 also really cool cheaper than a 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.860
 breadstick the fourth theme 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.660
 is called cigna and that's how he gets 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.799
 present so it's probably the best 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.230
 value for money 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.209
 an extremely comprehensive theme with 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.190
 beautiful icons and who walks away 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.209
 a lot more of the style of a bone is that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.890
 the precedents such as I have you 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.470
 shown but that remains really 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.880
 beautiful too so it's a theme 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.590
 that I used a lot in 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.700
 old videos and every time you 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.430
 ask me what is his name 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.160
 now you have the answer this theme 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.829
 these acronyms in full details 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.959
 beautiful this theme is called heroes the 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.070
 see this is available for iphone ipod 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.400
 touch and ipad 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.420

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.859
 full of widgets that you will be able to 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.090
 place a little bit everywhere as per 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.730
 example here on my screen of 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.320
 lock still on the springboard 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.150

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.280

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.930
