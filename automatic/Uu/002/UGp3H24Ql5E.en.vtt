you guys always have me talking about

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.300 
you guys always have me talking about
subgrouping<00:01:27.560> perfect<00:01:28.560> example<00:01:29.159> right<00:01:29.280> there

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
subgrouping perfect example right there

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.660 
subgrouping perfect example right there
even<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.940> could<00:01:30.150> be

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.730 

open<00:01:38.670> after<00:01:39.120> that

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.040 

open<00:01:46.430> e<00:01:46.549> after<00:01:46.939> that<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.329> then<00:01:47.600> 3e<00:01:47.930> hammer<00:01:48.439> 25

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.940 

and<00:01:51.890> then<00:01:52.460> open<00:01:53.300> e<00:01:53.390> palm<00:01:53.660> muted<00:01:55.930> 11<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.740> nine

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
and then open e palm muted 11 so nine

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.580 
and then open e palm muted 11 so nine
times<00:01:57.980> but<00:01:58.550> that's<00:01:58.730> how<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:58.880> would<00:01:59.090> count<00:01:59.330> it

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.639 

I<00:02:05.240> think<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.299> does<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> twice<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:07.200> after

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
I think it does that twice then after

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.020 
I think it does that twice then after
that<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> same<00:02:08.459> thing<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.729> you're

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
that it's the same thing but you're

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.430 
that it's the same thing but you're
going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> I'll<00:02:09.929> show<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> difference<00:02:12.440> go

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
going to I'll show you the difference go

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.300 
going to I'll show you the difference go
to<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.590> power<00:02:14.010> cord<00:02:14.400> now<00:02:14.580> after<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.090> riff<00:02:15.300> here
