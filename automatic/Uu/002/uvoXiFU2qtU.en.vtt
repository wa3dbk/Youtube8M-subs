00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.830
 hello friends welcome to a new appointment 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.930
 with chess from here on out then 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.219
 now we 're not going to rely on touching a 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.219
 only tactical theme 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.369
 as we had been doing for example with 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 the issue of deviation because I think that 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.259
 are many exercises followed by a 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.240
 same subject and it may even turn out to be something 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.789
 boring for time so from here 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.239
 forwards let's mix let's go to 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.050
 mix then different themes because 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:37.280
 are issues of opening a column or 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.550
 the destruction of the pawn shelter or 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.300
 the persecution or conjunction of methods 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.430
 tactical or attraction or attack 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.000
 until with x- rays or and of 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.720
 interception or tactical issues of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.790
 opening a column of infinity of 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.240
 tactical issues that there are and that we will go 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.390
 combining in 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.500
 in the following weeks then a few days 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.190
 we will make themes of a tactical motive 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.900
 and other days because others are good in 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.900
 this position then we have 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:21.170
 22 reasons 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:24.500
 1 would be attack to the discovery the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.210
 blacks would have a one position with a 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.939
 theme of attack to the discovered well 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.070
 simple that is the guess is worth and the 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.159
 so I would have a theme that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.770
 we have been giving that is a matter of deviation 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.030
 and at the same time an attraction theme 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.580
 OK 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.070
 when it's time to move to the white stop 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.290
 the video try to guess what is 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.409
 the best move on the part of the white and 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.070
 on the part of the black one is worth it already 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.190
 we have stopped already you have thought therefore what 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.649
 that you have not guessed I can explained 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.470
 which is the best play is worth the best 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.500
 play we see that here the bishop is 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.739
 indirectly threatening the lady worth 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:12.769
 if this tower was not there then the lady 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.900
 could be captured but for that but 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.510
 to see the tower as the lady goes in the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.110
 next move and the black one does not 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.380
 they have time to capture the with which 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.450
 is the theme of the open face that 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.350
 it's just going out with the tower 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.390
 giving a check in this case would be 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:38.030
 tower for g 2 check and now the white 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.430
 they do not have time to move the lady because 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.590
 the king is in check and he has to 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.170
 capture the tower with which he loses the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.040
 lady because the black take advantage and the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.040
 capture worth 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.660
 this would be the check on the discovery 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.350
 OK 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:00.250
 very important issue that will make us win 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.250
 9 many of our games in case of 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.230
 let them move to the black forgiveness 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.430
 to white then simply with 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:15.220
 lady to 8 check of grace you have to 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.990
 move to h 7 and now enter the tower 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.270
 nation with a sacrifice is worth in h 6 that 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.990
 your goal is 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.140
 both attraction and deviation 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.640
 it may be to attract the king to a 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.670
 key box that interests the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.760
 white as to divert this pawn from 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.750
 a defensive box that also has 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.400
 white gas fine if the black 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.400
 capture with the king of the king 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.650
 has been attracted to this this box with 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.810
 which the lady can enter 8 with 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:01.750
 Check only movement of the blacks of 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:06.350
 the black would be king g5 og 6 but with lady 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.760
 h 5 would be a check mate 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.760
 let's keep the position 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.440
 and in the case that blacks do not 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.320
 decide to take with the king for this subject 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:27.330
 So if they decide to capture with the pawn 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.290
 the deviant of the box is worse 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.200
 key 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.280
 efe 6 and now the horse simply 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.000
 take a leap and get a double fork 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.660
 to the king to the lady 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.740
 check and the lady is captured when she 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.740
 move vale 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.620
 Well, if you liked this video 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.080

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.080
