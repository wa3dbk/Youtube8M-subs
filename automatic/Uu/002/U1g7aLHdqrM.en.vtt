 is mine 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.299
 the signature in the typography I have 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.820
 really a very own handwriting and whole 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.920
 hard direct color techland each other 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 gives such a powerful each other will power 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 by you endure 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.460
 we have this warm and pleasant 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.140
 sustainability is also one of ours 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.550
 an important point of attention is also going 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 over after electric earring from it 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.390
 bussel sport and this theme with bus and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.920
 sustainability and in particular now ratified 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.839
 been to show her passion of it 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.890
 but not cruel it is for sure 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.890
 intended to remain the guests 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.610
 what are the reactions of the passengers 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.230
 very enthusiastic 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.460
 you see people looking really surprised 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.290
 about it this helps but you notice that 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.850
 people just want to keep looking 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.650
 many pictures also made in the bus 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.090
 objects that are in it and what heals 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.410
 surprisingly much of the bus is the pines 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.940
 smells here once you catch the bus 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.740
 so now I suddenly feel like you're in the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.890
 breastbone and when you look around 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.150
 theme wild life what is on the bus that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.920
 was just and that makes it whole 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.229
 succeeded and really had the intention to 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.310
 bring nature inside 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.350
 that's why we just have photos 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.380
 use of real wood 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.149
 real trees real air and we did 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.410
 from the outside in small 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.670
 come up in the design to be the one again 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.670
 to make something together 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.800
 so he succeeded so well he really shines like 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.710
 a little bit of sun rises reker 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.240
 boom a bombardment of color and a 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.350
 specially something you hope the passengers 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.880
 to give 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.190
 there is very large 3 on the back 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.690
 Buddha Square became very important there 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.310
