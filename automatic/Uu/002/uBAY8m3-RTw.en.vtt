00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.359 
hey man I'm Chris with bum cats and here

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.049 
hey man I'm Chris with bum cats and here
is<00:00:07.479> a<00:00:07.510> 3<00:00:08.080> funky<00:00:08.710> very<00:00:08.980> simple<00:00:09.490> game<00:00:09.670> called

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
is a 3 funky very simple game called

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.320 
is a 3 funky very simple game called
2048<00:00:10.889> yes<00:00:11.889> I<00:00:12.160> feel<00:00:12.370> like<00:00:12.490> this<00:00:12.639> is<00:00:12.790> very<00:00:12.820> close

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
2048 yes I feel like this is very close

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.670 
2048 yes I feel like this is very close
to<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.570> style<00:00:13.960> of<00:00:14.320> threes<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:16.360> they<00:00:16.900> did<00:00:17.530> it

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
to the style of threes but they did it

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.620 
to the style of threes but they did it
with<00:00:17.830> tues<00:00:18.160> so<00:00:18.699> I<00:00:18.730> guess<00:00:19.000> it's<00:00:19.180> a<00:00:19.269> completely

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
with tues so I guess it's a completely

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.230 
with tues so I guess it's a completely
different<00:00:19.869> game<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:21.250> basically<00:00:21.460> swipe

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
different game you basically swipe

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.060 
different game you basically swipe
around<00:00:22.689> and<00:00:22.960> all<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.260> tiles<00:00:23.590> will<00:00:23.769> move<00:00:23.920> in

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
around and all the tiles will move in

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.950 
around and all the tiles will move in
that<00:00:24.189> direction<00:00:24.220> and<00:00:24.849> then<00:00:25.330> you<00:00:25.449> just<00:00:25.660> want<00:00:25.869> to

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
that direction and then you just want to

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.859 
that direction and then you just want to
get<00:00:26.160> numbers<00:00:27.160> touching<00:00:27.670> each<00:00:27.880> other<00:00:28.179> and<00:00:28.449> then

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
get numbers touching each other and then

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.410 
get numbers touching each other and then
you<00:00:28.960> combine<00:00:29.170> them<00:00:29.500> like<00:00:29.650> that<00:00:29.920> I<00:00:30.210> got<00:00:31.210> pretty

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
you combine them like that I got pretty

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.780 
you combine them like that I got pretty
far<00:00:31.599> on<00:00:31.720> my<00:00:31.750> best<00:00:32.020> was<00:00:32.200> 1468<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.340> it<00:00:33.430> took<00:00:33.610> me<00:00:33.640> a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
far on my best was 1468 and it took me a

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.930 
far on my best was 1468 and it took me a
really<00:00:33.970> long<00:00:34.360> time<00:00:34.600> um<00:00:35.850> there's<00:00:36.850> something

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
really long time um there's something

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.150 
really long time um there's something
hyper<00:00:37.450> addictive<00:00:38.020> about<00:00:38.230> this<00:00:38.500> like<00:00:38.770> I<00:00:38.950> never

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
hyper addictive about this like I never

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.959 
hyper addictive about this like I never
got<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.460> play<00:00:39.579> or<00:00:39.910> I<00:00:39.969> never<00:00:40.030> picked<00:00:40.480> up<00:00:40.629> threes

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
got to play or I never picked up threes

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.569 
got to play or I never picked up threes
but<00:00:42.969> if<00:00:43.120> this<00:00:43.360> is<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.050> style<00:00:44.559> of<00:00:44.829> gameplay<00:00:45.100> I

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
but if this is the style of gameplay I

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.389 
but if this is the style of gameplay I
can<00:00:45.850> see<00:00:46.120> where<00:00:46.719> the<00:00:47.199> addiction<00:00:47.710> comes<00:00:47.949> from

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
can see where the addiction comes from

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.850 
can see where the addiction comes from
and<00:00:48.789> I<00:00:49.690> don't<00:00:49.809> even<00:00:49.899> know<00:00:50.110> man<00:00:50.320> I<00:00:50.500> like

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
and I don't even know man I like

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.250 
and I don't even know man I like
multiples<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.789> three<00:00:52.180> like<00:00:52.510> I<00:00:52.629> can<00:00:52.780> be<00:00:52.899> kind<00:00:53.170> of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
multiples of three like I can be kind of

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.990 
multiples of three like I can be kind of
like<00:00:53.379> number<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.890> Philae<00:00:54.399> or<00:00:54.550> whatever<00:00:54.850> the

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
like number of Philae or whatever the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.410 
like number of Philae or whatever the
right<00:00:55.149> phrase<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.780> um<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.820> tues<00:00:58.059> are<00:00:58.300> way<00:00:58.390> more

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
right phrase is um but tues are way more

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.270 
right phrase is um but tues are way more
easier<00:00:59.079> like<00:00:59.350> you<00:00:59.440> can<00:00:59.559> get<00:00:59.680> nice<00:00:59.890> and<00:00:59.920> rain

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280
