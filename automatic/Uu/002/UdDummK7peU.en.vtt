00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.640
 after winning by 4-2 at levante jose 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.769
 mourinho launched several messages 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.690
 important in press conference first 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.030
 that distance is important respect 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.749
 to barÃ§a and consequently there is room for 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.570
 error 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:19.179
 second that almost 40 points are missing for 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.210
 be a league champion and third the team 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:24.410
 You need to improve concentration and 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.039
 starts of matches 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:33.309
 if my math does not betray us 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:36.579
 are missing 39 points that are 3 electors is 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.700
 A lot of stuff 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.030
 ok 10.2 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.730
 10 points are 10 points 10 points each 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.850
 one 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.660
 a margin of error as it is lost is a 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.110
 party is not a borderline situation 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.280
 we continue with an advantage but every 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.840
 match is difficult we will not fail 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.350
 we will simply lose 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.979
 in the first part of the championship 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.950
 we will talk again 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:16.340
 10 points are 10 points only 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.080
 a small space of the best you have 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.060
 but 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.240
 we have very complicated matches out 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.610
 from home and same in our house is 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.830
 Demonstrating that 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.370
 that each match is complicated 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.580
 win the teams know 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.820
 they know how to play if they know how to organize today 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.740
 example here comes a release that 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.440
 it is practically very strong very well 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.170
 organized up to 10 players know 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.420
 perfectly what they had to do in 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.840
 field every game is difficult 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.049
 and point you have to keep winning matches 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.110
 because championships are won when 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.370
 when mathematics is objectively 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.180
 who are 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.500
 the championship is finished and in 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.890
 that moment the math says that 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.890
 we almost 40 points to be able to win 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.820
 what will the world take in these two 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.820
 weeks 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.860
 he thought the team has felt and has 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.970
 I sense that something special for 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.810
 Christian and it seems that he was a go 4.002 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:34.440
 of ship or a thing like that too he what 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.900
 deserves to put his name in that in that 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.180
 in that beautiful fact playing against days 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.980
 they will be can not mark you or you 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.290
 can come with danger and they have 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.500
 marked have ever arrived with a 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.390
 danger and that's why a team that plays 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:58.440
 to win championship has to have 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:01.200
 another type of head in control 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.940
 of the situation and it seems to me that we enter 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.040
 the parties with little concentration 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.450
 after a good situations 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.240
 is that the team has a lot of confidence 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.630
 offensive football game has a lot of people 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.900
 he can score goals meter was created 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.630
 a lot of opportunities and it's hard 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.140
 put rival to come here and think only 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.420
 in defending and enduring is very difficult 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.630
 because normally we finish 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.440
 always to do 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.440
 something
