00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
form curls and that makes sense this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.490

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.780 
that I can go grocery shopping don't
really<00:05:12.650> have<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:12.890> worry<00:05:13.070> about<00:05:13.100> ruining<00:05:13.520> the

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
really have to worry about ruining the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.550 
really have to worry about ruining the
braid<00:05:14.000> out<00:05:14.150> definitely<00:05:14.900> could<00:05:15.320> have<00:05:15.350> done<00:05:15.530> a

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
braid out definitely could have done a

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.720 
braid out definitely could have done a
better<00:05:15.620> job<00:05:15.830> at<00:05:16.160> this

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
better job at this

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:30.690 
better job at this
maybe<00:05:16.970> all<00:05:17.210> six<00:05:17.900> are<00:05:18.410> fair<00:05:18.680> I<00:05:19.010> definitely<00:05:19.250> will

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.440 

here's<00:05:31.700> a<00:05:31.820> couple<00:05:32.000> weird<00:05:32.840> hairs<00:05:33.170> but<00:05:33.590> okay<00:05:34.580> so

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
here's a couple weird hairs but okay so

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.030 
here's a couple weird hairs but okay so
the<00:05:35.570> reason<00:05:35.900> why<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:36.050> do<00:05:36.230> my<00:05:36.380> braid<00:05:36.710> out<00:05:36.830> like

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
the reason why I do my braid out like

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.740 
the reason why I do my braid out like
this<00:05:37.220> is<00:05:37.460> something<00:05:38.000> that<00:05:38.300> I<00:05:38.330> already

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
this is something that I already

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.320 
this is something that I already
mentioned<00:05:39.440> in<00:05:39.680> my<00:05:40.100> hair<00:05:40.370> update<00:05:40.700> video<00:05:40.970> but<00:05:41.240> I

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
mentioned in my hair update video but I

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.030 
mentioned in my hair update video but I
will<00:05:41.420> see<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:41.990> again<00:05:42.200> because<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.650> don't<00:05:42.710> feel

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
will see it again because I don't feel

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.280 
will see it again because I don't feel
like<00:05:43.280> everyone<00:05:43.730> watches<00:05:44.060> every<00:05:44.450> video<00:05:44.600> I<00:05:44.990> do

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
like everyone watches every video I do

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.200 
like everyone watches every video I do
my<00:05:45.410> braids<00:05:45.590> out<00:05:45.620> like<00:05:45.830> this<00:05:46.010> because<00:05:46.370> when<00:05:46.790> my

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
my braids out like this because when my

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.850 
my braids out like this because when my
braid<00:05:47.600> out<00:05:47.690> is<00:05:47.840> smaller<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:48.530> it's<00:05:48.680> much

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
braid out is smaller and it's much

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.550 
braid out is smaller and it's much
closer<00:05:49.220> to<00:05:49.610> my<00:05:49.730> actual<00:05:50.120> curl<00:05:50.450> pattern<00:05:50.840> when

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
closer to my actual curl pattern when

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.360 
closer to my actual curl pattern when
the<00:05:52.070> wind<00:05:52.640> and<00:05:53.030> rain<00:05:53.450> and<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.960> frizz<00:05:54.290> or<00:05:54.770> the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
the wind and rain and the frizz or the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.400 
the wind and rain and the frizz or the
humidity<00:05:55.790> when<00:05:56.180> all<00:05:56.360> of<00:05:56.540> that<00:05:56.570> hits<00:05:56.990> my<00:05:57.200> hair

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
humidity when all of that hits my hair

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.370 
humidity when all of that hits my hair
it<00:05:57.500> makes<00:05:57.620> it<00:05:57.770> really<00:05:57.920> frizzy<00:05:58.420> my<00:05:59.420> hair<00:05:59.810> starts

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
it makes it really frizzy my hair starts

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.900 
it makes it really frizzy my hair starts
to<00:06:00.470> revert<00:06:00.770> back<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:01.190> its<00:06:01.340> natural<00:06:01.460> chrome

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
to revert back to its natural chrome

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.180 
to revert back to its natural chrome
pattern<00:06:02.240> and<00:06:02.510> this<00:06:02.840> is<00:06:03.110> very<00:06:03.590> close<00:06:03.919> to<00:06:04.100> my

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
pattern and this is very close to my

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.650 
pattern and this is very close to my
natural<00:06:04.310> chrome<00:06:04.700> hundred<00:06:05.060> so<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.480> basically

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
natural chrome hundred so it basically

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.050 
natural chrome hundred so it basically
just<00:06:06.020> adds<00:06:06.470> a<00:06:06.740> little<00:06:07.190> bit<00:06:07.310> more<00:06:07.430> volume<00:06:08.030> to

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
just adds a little bit more volume to

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.170 
just adds a little bit more volume to
what's<00:06:08.480> already<00:06:08.750> here<00:06:09.200> if<00:06:09.500> folks<00:06:10.040> hard<00:06:10.550> let<00:06:10.970> me

what's already here if folks hard let me
