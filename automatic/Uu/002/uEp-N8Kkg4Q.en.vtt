00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.520
 let's show you with the virtual keyboard commented the deletion of the 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.109
 treatment initially 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.719
 I'll show you that here in the case 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.799
 I have this perfect technique. 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.189
 on the keyboard 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.310
 this month she has clear 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.029
 she gets weak and I'm going to get away if you guys have been having me 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.070
 they will notice the same thing they called him again 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.070
 and it turns on another other test that I want to show you is the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.000
 Following 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.980
 I have it here 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.260
 marcia becker that is with a death 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.310
 but that on the keyboard often appears as cartes in north 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.380
 and when you pressed the caps lock 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.960
 how's it going now 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.920
 uppercase letters are called uppercase 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.140
 so you can see d 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.300
 but attention in tight looked box-high 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.980
 the same thing happens on the track 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.200
 the former athlete I box-high 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.920
 the jokes a turtle shift 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.960
 it also makes the kaka think it's what seems impossible 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.530
 other technicians 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.910
 here in this numerical part of this process is serious because it is clear that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:15.750
 you 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810
 the pear will appear in question 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.980
 ef 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.290
 this can have this picture already has 6 7 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.770
 And you have to go well here. 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.370
 the pack you know is usually a little bit behind her 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.170
 are 76% 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.940
 fernanda takai south chapadão internet you 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.150
 next to the front 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.190
 It's also something else that we can be here and I hung up that a joke 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.510
 Neither is the counted key. 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.380
 I hit the key here 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.670
 in case what to show appearing 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.250
 no more 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.110
 she also has others to other activities the same thing happens 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.110
 the stage key here 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.440
 currently both sides have here 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.569
 and also currently has when so far 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.859
 this key here he has in mind the media other numbers other 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.709
 keyboard features 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.569
 showing up what he can do 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.859
 pressing that question 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.009
 in the keyboards that a little flag pinch 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.309
 will appear same thing start here below I pressed the flag 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.459
 appeared house indicted that the pass the mouse 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.340
 who also appeared the programs of my computer want all 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.779
 we look here 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.099
 My contract here is this. 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.479
 click like it's a rock now 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.849
 and then I take all the same thing who the bandeirinha that on the side 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.899
 right if you press that appears again the flag again tighten I the conseg 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:58.019
 some keyboards also believe in this key here what until the house of the minor 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.089
 because I stayed here 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:04.089
 the menubar key 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:05.149
 the shot 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.389
 and port 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.179
 the same menu keypad 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:10.949
 these texts here 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.599
 appears on the keyboard are technical 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.109
 we can 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.329
 walk side to side 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.810
 in the case here he even told why here the possibility to replicate here 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:27.119
 I have a crucifix my numeric keypad when the shot here he has 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:31.899
 other words still writing writing nor sleep here mind the word that 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:33.069
 break in 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.489
 he 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.489
 here begins the word and having as e 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.119
 for each of them can yes the cinema 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.010
 I stayed a long time without 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.129
 Hi, what's up? 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.939
 this side here 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.559
 the medicament 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:52.889
 bittar 1 who appeared down and on this side here 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.089
 usually the client so much that the page up 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.409
 c let's stick around now with this video lesson just showing basic né 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.870
 It is a breakthrough for me not to miss the trip one of the techniques that is very 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.399
 Arab 15 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:12.040
 already the mark 4% 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.219
 when it's somewhere you leave that land 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.739
 and then we'll talk about some function techniques what's here 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.430
 I'll stick around now 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.340
