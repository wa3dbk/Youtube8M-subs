00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
got me thinking long and hard would it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.979 
got me thinking long and hard would it
be<00:00:40.920> possible<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.239> course<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.809> would

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
be possible and of course what would

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.190 
be possible and of course what would
make<00:00:43.200> nemesis<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.550> unique<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.200> from

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
make nemesis more unique as from

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.990 
make nemesis more unique as from
terminator<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.370> you're<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.610> aware

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
terminator because if you're not aware

both<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.780> these<00:00:48.930> characters<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.680> minigun

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
both of these characters have a minigun

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.810 
both of these characters have a minigun
and<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:52.199> Nemesis<00:00:52.680> characters<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.670> got

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and the Nemesis characters can have got

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.910 
and the Nemesis characters can have got
more<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.270> modern<00:00:54.480> gun<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:54.989> more<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
more of a modern gun it's more like the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.389 
more of a modern gun it's more like the
chainsaw<00:00:56.520> as<00:00:56.730> opposed<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.989> minigun<00:00:58.980> from

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
chainsaw as opposed to the minigun from

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.299 
chainsaw as opposed to the minigun from
the<00:01:00.030> assault<00:01:00.930> juggernaut<00:01:01.410> soil<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.859> course

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the assault juggernaut soil of course

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.650 
the assault juggernaut soil of course
that<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:02.640> make<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.030> different<00:01:03.239> boats

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that would make it different boats

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.270 
that would make it different boats
essentially<00:01:04.379> both<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:04.979> characters

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
essentially both of these characters

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190 
essentially both of these characters
will<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> reskin<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.930> assault

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
will just be a reskin of the assault

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.320 
will just be a reskin of the assault
jigga<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.460> course<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.909> would<00:01:09.060> both

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
jigga not and of course they would both

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.109 
jigga not and of course they would both
have<00:01:09.650> somewhat<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.040> minigun<00:01:11.460> I'm<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.909> sure

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
have somewhat of a minigun I'm not sure

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.750 
have somewhat of a minigun I'm not sure
hope<00:01:12.390> hard<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.860> reskin<00:01:14.400> guns

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
hope hard it is for them to reskin guns

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
hope hard it is for them to reskin guns
and<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.140> really<00:01:16.530> easy

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and I know that it's really really easy

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
and I know that it's really really easy
to<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.250> reskin<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> character<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to kind of reskin a character that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.289 
to kind of reskin a character that
wouldn't<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.710> difficult<00:01:19.850> but<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:21.119> not

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
wouldn't be that difficult but I'm not

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.270 
wouldn't be that difficult but I'm not
really<00:01:21.450> sure<00:01:21.630> how<00:01:21.990> difficult<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.710> would<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
really sure how difficult it would be a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
really sure how difficult it would be a
reskin<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> gun<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.930> gun<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
reskin and a gun because the gun that

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.920 
reskin and a gun because the gun that
nemesis<00:01:25.799> uses<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:27.060> kind<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> modern-day

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
nemesis uses is a kind of a modern-day

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.840 
nemesis uses is a kind of a modern-day
gun<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.500> got<00:01:28.650> kind<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.979> an<00:01:29.100> indicator<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
gun it's got kind of an indicator of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.929 
gun it's got kind of an indicator of
your<00:01:30.509> ammo<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.140> stuff<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.909> i

your ammo and stuff like that and like i
said<00:01:33.119> i'm<00:01:33.270> not<00:01:33.299> sure<00:01:33.659> hope<00:01:33.930> hard<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.829> would

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
said i'm not sure hope hard that would

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.580 
said i'm not sure hope hard that would
actually<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.079> makes<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
actually be know what kind of makes this

if am if I'm kind of you know aware and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.440 
if am if I'm kind of you know aware and
stuff<00:02:15.020> like<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.650> would<00:02:15.890> mean<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.850> yes

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
stuff like that it would mean that yes

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.030 
stuff like that it would mean that yes
they<00:02:17.690> do<00:02:17.750> need<00:02:18.080> permission<00:02:18.650> because<00:02:18.770> of

they do need permission because of

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.740 
they do need permission because of
course<00:02:19.280> they<00:02:19.490> would<00:02:19.640> essentially<00:02:20.150> be<00:02:20.330> an

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
course they would essentially be an

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.050 
course they would essentially be an
earning<00:02:21.440> money<00:02:21.770> off<00:02:22.070> their<00:02:22.340> characters<00:02:22.880> and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
earning money off their characters and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.880 
earning money off their characters and
stuff<00:02:23.270> like<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.380> think<00:02:24.440> there's<00:02:24.830> been

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
stuff like that so I think there's been

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.830 
stuff like that so I think there's been
some<00:02:25.220> kind<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.580> deal<00:02:25.850> between<00:02:26.030> universal

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
some kind of deal between universal

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.170 
some kind of deal between universal
studios<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.640> Activision<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.760> make<00:02:28.940> this

possible well I said please do not take
this<00:02:31.850> one<00:02:32.180> hundred<00:02:32.660> percent<00:02:32.690> now<00:02:34.180> like<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.209> said

previously<00:02:35.720> what<00:02:36.350> would<00:02:36.530> make<00:02:36.740> nemesis

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
previously what would make nemesis

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.510 
previously what would make nemesis
different<00:02:38.030> from<00:02:38.600> terminator<00:02:39.230> apart<00:02:40.100> from<00:02:40.310> the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
different from terminator apart from the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.880 
different from terminator apart from the
kind<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.970> Bob<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:42.080> they've<00:02:42.320> both<00:02:42.560> got

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
kind of Bob that they've both got

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.070 
kind of Bob that they've both got
different<00:02:43.190> mini<00:02:43.610> guns<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.900> got<00:02:45.050> me

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
different mini guns and it got me

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.530 
different mini guns and it got me
thinking<00:02:45.230> long<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:45.920> hard<00:02:46.160> like<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.610> said<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.209> I

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
thinking long and hard like I said and I

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.000 
thinking long and hard like I said and I
was<00:02:47.660> thinking<00:02:47.690> why<00:02:48.260> couldn't<00:02:48.650> they<00:02:48.770> do<00:02:48.830> a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
was thinking why couldn't they do a

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.820 
was thinking why couldn't they do a
reskin<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.390> guard<00:02:50.690> dog<00:02:50.900> by<00:02:51.260> actually

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
reskin of the guard dog by actually

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.550 
reskin of the guard dog by actually

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
introducing the dogs from Resident Evil

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.840 
introducing the dogs from Resident Evil
know<00:02:54.709> what<00:02:54.920> these<00:02:55.070> actually<00:02:55.580> out<00:02:55.820> there

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
know what these actually out there

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.900 
know what these actually out there
they're<00:02:56.450> just<00:02:56.720> normal<00:02:56.900> guard<00:02:57.410> dogs<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:57.950> BOTS

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.910 
they're just normal guard dogs and BOTS

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
are really really scary characters

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.140 
are really really scary characters
especially<00:03:05.150> within<00:03:05.840> resident<00:03:06.410> evil<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.150> this

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
especially within resident evil and this

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.270 
especially within resident evil and this
will<00:03:08.360> just<00:03:08.540> make<00:03:08.660> nemesis<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.590> more<00:03:09.800> unique

like<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.610> said<00:03:11.000> just<00:03:11.600> because<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:13.010> would<00:03:13.250> be

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
like I said just because and it would be

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.789 
like I said just because and it would be

it's<00:03:16.010> actually<00:03:16.190> going<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.730> be<00:03:16.760> that

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940

duty<00:03:41.180> series<00:03:41.690> but<00:03:42.079> it's<00:03:42.200> always<00:03:42.380> kind<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.799> good

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
duty series but it's always kind of good

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.220 
duty series but it's always kind of good
to<00:03:43.190> think<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.610> new<00:03:43.640> ideas<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.959> course

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
to think of new ideas and of course

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.259 
to think of new ideas and of course
infinite<00:03:45.739> swad<00:03:45.980> if<00:03:46.250> they<00:03:46.430> actually<00:03:46.880> saw<00:03:47.090> this

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
infinite swad if they actually saw this

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.640 
infinite swad if they actually saw this
they<00:03:47.540> could<00:03:47.810> think<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.260> know<00:03:48.380> that<00:03:48.560> is

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
they could think you know that is

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.720 
they could think you know that is
actually<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.040> good<00:03:49.190> idea<00:03:49.250> we<00:03:49.610> could

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
actually a good idea we could

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.000 
actually a good idea we could
incorporate<00:03:49.880> this<00:03:50.450> into<00:03:50.660> our<00:03:50.780> game<00:03:51.230> or<00:03:51.470> of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
incorporate this into our game or of

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.130 
incorporate this into our game or of
course<00:03:52.040> they<00:03:52.430> could<00:03:52.640> introduce<00:03:52.940> it<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.600> you

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
course they could introduce it and you

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.080 
course they could introduce it and you
know<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.290> few<00:03:54.739> years<00:03:55.010> then<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.400> wine<00:03:55.640> bolts

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
know a few years then the wine bolts

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.930 
know a few years then the wine bolts
that<00:03:56.720> if<00:03:57.019> that<00:03:57.440> is<00:03:57.680> kind<00:03:57.950> of<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.220> fear<00:03:58.549> it

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
that if that is kind of the fear it

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.509 
that if that is kind of the fear it
would<00:03:59.360> make<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.810> very<00:03:59.840> very<00:04:00.380> unique<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:01.250> dogs

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
would make it very very unique the dogs

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.300 
would make it very very unique the dogs
would<00:04:01.760> also<00:04:02.030> make<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.540> unique<00:04:03.079> and<00:04:03.230> also<00:04:04.010> kind

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
would also make it unique and also kind

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.000 
would also make it unique and also kind
of<00:04:04.400> take<00:04:04.640> us<00:04:04.820> back<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.420> track<00:04:05.840> zombie<00:04:06.350> days

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
of take us back to the track zombie days

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.759 
of take us back to the track zombie days
with<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.519> zombie<00:04:08.269> dogs<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:09.350> just<00:04:09.560> think

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
with the zombie dogs and I just think

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.050 
with the zombie dogs and I just think
that<00:04:09.860> would<00:04:10.100> be<00:04:10.310> really<00:04:10.340> really<00:04:10.760> cool

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
that would be really really cool

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.390 
that would be really really cool
honestly<00:04:11.600> but<00:04:12.170> that<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.769> pretty<00:04:12.980> much<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.190> for

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
honestly but that is pretty much it for

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.789 
honestly but that is pretty much it for
this<00:04:13.579> video<00:04:13.790> guys<00:04:14.000> if<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.630> guys<00:04:14.660> have<00:04:15.230> got<00:04:15.260> any
