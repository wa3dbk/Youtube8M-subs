this thing's rated for 150 feet 2.4
gigahertz<00:00:10.880> so<00:00:11.880> extended<00:00:12.389> range<00:00:12.630> I've<00:00:13.019> been

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
gigahertz so extended range I've been

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.189 
gigahertz so extended range I've been
using<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.469> logitech<00:00:14.040> presenter<00:00:14.809> it<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.929> rated

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
using a logitech presenter it was rated

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.380 
using a logitech presenter it was rated
for<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.529> 50<00:00:16.949> feet<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.340> there<00:00:17.910> was<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.150> venue

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
for like 50 feet and there was one venue

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.120 
for like 50 feet and there was one venue
where<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.750> just<00:00:18.900> wasn't<00:00:20.180> reaching<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.720> I

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
where it just wasn't reaching so I

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.040 
where it just wasn't reaching so I
thought<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.340> would<00:00:23.400> try<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:27.050> hopefully

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
thought I would try this and hopefully

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.460 
thought I would try this and hopefully
it<00:00:28.439> lives<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.570> its<00:00:30.570> name<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.260> got<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it lives up to its name so it's got a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.010 
it lives up to its name so it's got a
nice<00:00:31.679> looks<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> nice<00:00:32.579> case<00:00:33.710> that's<00:00:34.710> good

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:47.319 

I<00:00:40.020> will<00:00:41.750> in<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.020> video<00:00:44.000> come<00:00:45.000> back<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.450> add<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
I will in this video come back and add a

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.430 
I will in this video come back and add a
notation<00:00:49.129> regarding<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.850> said<00:00:51.809> range<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
notation regarding that said range and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.680 
notation regarding that said range and
if<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.710> actually<00:00:53.300> does<00:00:54.300> improve<00:00:54.870> upon<00:00:56.690> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
if it actually does improve upon the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.750 
if it actually does improve upon the
logic<00:00:57.960> types<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> using<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:58.980> guess<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.520> it's

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.910 

actually<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.799> do<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> says<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
actually going to do what it says so

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.210 
actually going to do what it says so
standard<00:01:07.920> sigh<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.760> size<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.750> too<00:01:09.960> big

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
standard sigh you know size not too big

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.859 
standard sigh you know size not too big
it's<00:01:11.220> got<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.350> standard<00:01:13.350> receiver<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.570> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
it's got the standard receiver and it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.140 
it's got the standard receiver and it
looks<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.200> yeah<00:01:16.770> they<00:01:16.950> give<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> couple

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:28.120 

energizer<00:01:21.150> batteries<00:01:24.320> that's<00:01:25.320> nice<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.680> them

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.060 

so<00:01:29.130> we'll<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:30.200> throw<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.799> test

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so we'll just throw these in and test

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.090 
so we'll just throw these in and test
the<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.520> green<00:01:32.820> laser

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.040 

so<00:01:40.670> yeah<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.360> can<00:01:41.390> see<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:42.280> green<00:01:43.280> laser<00:01:43.460> so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
so yeah you can see a green laser so

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.710 
so yeah you can see a green laser so
like<00:01:45.050> I<00:01:45.170> said<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:46.159> supposed<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.430> be<00:01:46.580> 150<00:01:47.360> foot

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
like I said it's supposed to be 150 foot

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.290 
like I said it's supposed to be 150 foot
range<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.380> will<00:01:48.770> I'll<00:01:49.640> just<00:01:49.850> make<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> little

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
range I will I'll just make a little

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.620 
range I will I'll just make a little
note<00:01:50.660> here<00:01:51.140> in<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.290> video<00:01:51.940> about<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.180> and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
note here in the video about that and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.760 
note here in the video about that and
whether<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:53.930> find<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.710> that's<00:01:54.920> true<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.520> my

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
whether I find that that's true in my

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.070 
whether I find that that's true in my
specific<00:01:57.770> space<00:01:58.490> but<00:01:59.330> I'm<00:01:59.450> hoping<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.900> does

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
specific space but I'm hoping it does

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.590 
specific space but I'm hoping it does
because<00:02:00.500> it's<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.740> good<00:02:00.920> value<00:02:01.280> if<00:02:01.430> it<00:02:01.640> gets

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
because it's a good value if it gets

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.200 
because it's a good value if it gets
that<00:02:02.750> much<00:02:02.960> more<00:02:03.170> range<00:02:03.440> over<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.040> ones<00:02:04.940> that

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
that much more range over the ones that

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.550 
that much more range over the ones that
are<00:02:05.860> basically<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.070> same<00:02:07.250> price
