 I've already enjoyed the holidays 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.500

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.259
 attentive to the channel 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.710
 and well here we have the new video of 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.630
 xbox one is a video that has 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.700
 distributed microsoft officially 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.190
 in which all the improvements are detailed 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.050
 of the control of xbox one by the way 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.030
 It has an excellent look and notice that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 I prefer more for playstation 4 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.690
 so far but yes that is true 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.090
 that the command of xbox one calls enough 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.750
 good attention on this occasion the network 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.030
 wi-fi alam from microsoft focus on 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.190
 show us in detail the new 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.220
 command of the console a command that includes 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.950
 more than 40 different improvements compared to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 that we already have in xbox 360 as per 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.820
 example the fact that each of the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.340
 Triggers have independent vibration 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.410
 also thanks to some new sensors and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.540
 to kinect the console will know everything 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.310
 moment who has command in the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.649
 hands so it's going to change the profile 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.290
 player automatically when 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.690
 hold another person another of the improvements 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.210
 that we can find is the biggest 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.270
 New earphone acoustic quality 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.549
 sticks and the crosshead completely renovated 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.030
 a reduction in the distance there 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.400
 between 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.170
 button is a low power mode and a 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.900
 internal compartment for the battery 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.420
 pay attention to this video because all 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.520
 these data are those given to us in the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.220
 also one of the latest information 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.619
 that have been given regarding this command of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.080
 xbox one is going to be compatible 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.880
 also with pc and it's going to be from 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.430
 next year and is that you already know that the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.710
 xbox 360 controls are totally 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.570
 compatible with pc and microsoft has 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.550
 revealed on this occasion that he waits 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.259
 have compatibility available 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.390
 the new controls with computers 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.540
 with windows sometime next 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.040
 year and allow PC gamers 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.620
 benefit from the advantages of command 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.840
 from xbox one the company has also said 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.880
 that it will be necessary to optimize the code 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.370
 to work properly since 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.920
 they say them while you can 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.600
 look like something trivial yes it has true 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.000
 work to make it direct and 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.970
 simple for the user is to say that no 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.160
 the use of the xbox command is complicated 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.250
 one on a pc so far they have not 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.070
 specified dates but I repeat the next 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.820
 year 2014 we can finally use the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.820
 command of xbox 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.370
 very well
