00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:14.619
 I made my debut in rap ya nine 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.820
 month is frankly to tell you I'm 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:20.800
 walk but downright more than alex of 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.750
 66 and a better level even in 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.570
 beginner I already had better level than 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.669
 early so here I am doing this video for 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.890
 to hide alex from the 76 because there is a 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.630
 youtuber who asked me I would say 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.310
 no no because I'm not an all 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:41.470
 case we hold you there so I start to 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:46.360
 exile 76 blaze your place the rotten I 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.330
 do not see why you put alex of the 76 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.110
 want to represent the high normandie done 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.700
 there is no problem but you could have 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.030
 to do otherwise than by putting it on your 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.740
 boondocks 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.780
 so that's after a title 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.220
 I clicked directly on your video 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.730
 when I saw your title because I 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.530
 I'm told that maybe it was good but 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.030
 when I listened to your direct sound 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.950
 at first it broke my ears 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.020
 after two minutes charity a 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 video month after a few days after I 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.260
 I still started listening to it 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.320
 completely and it broke me 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.800
 makes even more ears crack 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.500
 so I'll start with the lyrics 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.360
 not by the sound the sound quality of your 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.750
 clip but drop it is rotten 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.030

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.550
 your words - in hand shit and that 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.930

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.820
