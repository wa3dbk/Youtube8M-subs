00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.550
 Hey, beauty guys, I'm back with 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.890
 one more video and this is going to be a video 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.070
 I'm going to talk about some of those 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.189
 truths here gost the community 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.580
 back to the community do not beauty 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.590
 enough attention in the video is in my 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.630
 comment on gameplay because gameplay 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.870
 reflects a lot that I would like to 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.080
 Talk about this good video here is one that the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.060
 hungry 6 v6 put a little aside 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.800
 to the hotel a bit saturated and 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.160
 I decided to play the one that hungry 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.820
 this room was good without leg not the hit 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.800
 detection was excellent beauty 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.980
 of those game place would be fucking 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.770
 gameplay with over 70 pounds joking 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.810
 Until when did you play? 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.830
 watch and pay attention to my 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.470
 comment 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.160
 guys in my opinion black ops 2 is the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.660
 more balanced code of all 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.930
 including weapons by kits 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.780
 weapons attachments and that the most 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.740
 balanced of all but the great 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:29.890
 problem is you can not use cloud 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:32.490
 is vetoed the vis atilde dogs the swarm 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.110
 they are there to decorate 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.850
 developer put them there but not 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.979
 It's for you to use to stop 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.400
 embellish them there divine when you go 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.650
 there to see what they are for and uses 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.650
 lower suites such as a thousand 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.799
 your hair storm is the electric discharge 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.049
 anyway you can not use these and I 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.200
 I hope you understood. 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.870
 sarcasm that I wanted to put that phrase 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.950
 and or these words is not that you do not 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.260
 can is that the community today does not allow 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.390
 You use this kind of kiss kiss them. 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.729
 week scores how to speak use language 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.459
 of black ops two here on your c tap 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.770
 because if you call the vetou for example 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:19.320
 or load be or vsat 1.1 call 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.540
 eighty percent of the host cases 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.640
 migration and why rock and see 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.740
 because those people who do not want 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.710
 pick them up then why did you buy the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.800
 shit if you knew you'd have that 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.830
 kind of thing in the game that this part 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.900
 of the game that shame is part of the game 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.240
 that the low guy is part of the game 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.430
 when playing my friends with 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.100
 That's where I've been, I 've already told 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.170
 they do not put it from the stadium see top and 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.480
 who plays with me is testimony there 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.220
 on the video so they can see no 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.670
 because you do not put it because you 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.030
 call is going to load the guys will leave 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.460
 stop and then it gets annoying I'm up 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.170
 thus losing the desire to post video 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.470
 because black the two is the game of the moment 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.890
 Dude you do not want to see the gameplay of 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.710
 mw2 yes some but most do not 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.960
 want to see some gameplay mw3 yes 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.350
 but most not this I'm going to miss one 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.700
 channel feedback and dating the old 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.280
 so I do not know what's happening 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.620
 It's a I do not know what happens to the 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.700
 most expensive community I do not know how 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.830
 to fix 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.690
 I do not know how the guys could 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.090
 to fix the community for us if 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.420
 amuse I'm kind of saturated I 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.209
 wanted for example by pulling the channel is 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.820
 a little more I wanted to post more 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.220
 often but I realized that you can not 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.590
 Do this because it's hard for you 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.130
 get decent gameplay now 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.260
 happens the last 1st church some 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.360
 guy pulled cable on many will talk 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.350
 but it's happening straight to mega 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.060
 happens because of connection problems 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.220
 I agree 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.620
 this happens but honestly one 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.190
 gameplay like that where the connection 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.350
 I was excellent hit detection tava 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.209
 too spectacular was not connection 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.150
 head and it was black pulling the cable and this 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.560
 has happened most often 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:20.520
 I fill the bag I fill the bag is a 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.650
 games of those old crazy sorry apologies 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.340
 My language here but I had to 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.080
 and that's why I 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.820
 decreases the frequency of posts I do not 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.280
 I know for example 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.020
 It's how we could change this. 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.610
 situation and community 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.730
 I just know it's pretty boring'm already a 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.890
 little well saturated black ops 2 much 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.340
 more than I am a space of time 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.840
 much smaller because mw3 saturday was 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.860
 This is my opinion and I hope that you 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.600
 have understood 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.130
 leave in the comments that you think 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.970
 Did you like the video if you did not like it? 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.890
 face 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.950
 leave in the comments leave your 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.810
 feedback an unlike slip anyway this is 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.730
 My opinion I wanted to say it was 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.760
 a little bit saturated other face migration 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.130
 and the room is going to fall then I go there 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.230
 make an excellent gameplay but I could not 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.390
 because the community today does not allow 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.060
 plus you use swarm drugs from sat 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.680
 these kits are loud I stay here said 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.680
 Thanks until the next time and I went
