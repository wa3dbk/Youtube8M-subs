now<00:00:05.290> I'm<00:00:05.439> going<00:00:05.680> to<00:00:05.740> demonstrate<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:07.330> B

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:07.599 
now I'm going to demonstrate the B

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.869 
now I'm going to demonstrate the B
channel<00:00:08.080> this<00:00:08.680> is<00:00:08.860> the<00:00:08.889> channel<00:00:09.039> that<00:00:09.490> I<00:00:09.519> use

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:09.879 
channel this is the channel that I use

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.990 
channel this is the channel that I use
for<00:00:10.119> the<00:00:10.209> boost<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.769> have<00:00:12.280> the<00:00:12.400> tone<00:00:12.580> control

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
for the boost I have the tone control

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.539 
for the boost I have the tone control
set<00:00:13.330> to<00:00:13.779> what<00:00:14.020> I<00:00:14.049> consider<00:00:14.139> kind<00:00:14.830> of<00:00:14.949> a<00:00:15.070> unity

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
set to what I consider kind of a unity

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.480 
set to what I consider kind of a unity
tone<00:00:15.939> and<00:00:16.380> that<00:00:17.380> unity<00:00:17.800> tone<00:00:18.010> includes

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
tone and that unity tone includes

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.640 
tone and that unity tone includes
cutting<00:00:18.939> the<00:00:19.150> bass<00:00:19.330> boosting<00:00:20.199> the<00:00:20.289> trouble

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
cutting the bass boosting the trouble

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.070

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
just a slight overdrive at the gain

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.950 
just a slight overdrive at the gain
settings<00:01:56.439> I've<00:01:56.649> got<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:58.030> actually<00:01:58.479> has<00:01:58.659> quite

now back to the original setting and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.140 
now back to the original setting and
what<00:03:01.189> we<00:03:01.310> want<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.579> do<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:01.939> want<00:03:02.090> to

what we want to do is we want to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.600 
what we want to do is we want to
fine-tune<00:03:02.689> it<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.799> we're<00:03:04.370> going<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.549> be

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
fine-tune it so that we're going to be

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.970 
fine-tune it so that we're going to be
in<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.819> soft<00:03:05.060> position<00:03:05.599> we<00:03:06.319> want<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.650> set<00:03:06.950> so

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
in the soft position we want it set so

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.220 
in the soft position we want it set so
that<00:03:07.370> there's<00:03:07.579> just<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:08.030> little<00:03:08.780> bit<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.019> gain

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
that there's just a little bit of a gain

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:18.520 
that there's just a little bit of a gain
boost<00:03:09.470> here<00:03:16.720> I'm<00:03:17.720> going<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.930> go<00:03:18.079> a<00:03:18.109> little

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
boost here I'm going to go a little

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.550 
boost here I'm going to go a little
higher<00:03:18.829> in<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.220> game<00:03:19.430> now<00:03:20.420> if<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.290> let's

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
higher in the game now if you let's

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.970 
higher in the game now if you let's
let's<00:03:22.220> switch<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.609> off<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.150> we're<00:03:24.019> gonna<00:03:24.109> go

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
let's switch it off and we're gonna go

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.130 
let's switch it off and we're gonna go
back<00:03:25.129> to<00:03:25.189> the<00:03:25.459> dirty<00:03:25.700> channel<00:03:26.180> which<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.720> have

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
back to the dirty channel which I have

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:38.619 
back to the dirty channel which I have
set<00:03:27.439> up<00:03:27.470> for<00:03:28.340> channel<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:37.489> now<00:03:38.329> we're<00:03:38.540> gonna

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
set up for channel a and now we're gonna

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.259 
set up for channel a and now we're gonna
run<00:03:38.900> channel<00:03:39.290> B<00:03:39.440> as<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.829> input<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.459> with<00:03:41.239> a

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
run channel B as the input to it with a

00:03:41.269 --> 00:04:16.220 
run channel B as the input to it with a
slight<00:03:41.599> canvas

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.680 

and<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:18.250> my<00:04:18.430> demonstration<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> bb+

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
and that's my demonstration of the bb+

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.930 
and that's my demonstration of the bb+
preamp<00:04:20.290> as<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:21.160> can<00:04:21.310> tell<00:04:21.489> it's<00:04:21.670> a<00:04:21.730> great

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
preamp as you can tell it's a great

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.780 
preamp as you can tell it's a great
pedal<00:04:22.330> goes<00:04:22.570> from<00:04:22.840> mild<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.290> wild<00:04:23.790> two

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
channels each channel capable of going

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.420 
channels each channel capable of going
from<00:04:26.890> boost<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.850> overdrive<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.570> back<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:30.250> can

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
from boost to overdrive and back you can

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.460 
from boost to overdrive and back you can
configure<00:04:30.790> it<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.120> go<00:04:31.360> from<00:04:31.540> A<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.780> B<00:04:31.900> or<00:04:32.020> B<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.440> A

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
configure it to go from A to B or B to A

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.640 
configure it to go from A to B or B to A
which<00:04:32.890> is<00:04:32.920> extremely<00:04:33.460> nice<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:34.470> we'll<00:04:35.470> do

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
which is extremely nice and we'll do

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.410 
which is extremely nice and we'll do
some<00:04:35.920> more<00:04:35.950> next<00:04:36.340> time<00:04:36.520> with<00:04:36.730> maybe<00:04:36.940> a<00:04:37.030> strat

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
some more next time with maybe a strat

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.080 
some more next time with maybe a strat
and<00:04:37.630> some<00:04:37.960> other<00:04:38.140> settings<00:04:38.730> take<00:04:39.730> care<00:04:39.970> and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
and some other settings take care and
