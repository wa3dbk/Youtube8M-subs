how can you possibly travel the world

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.360 
how can you possibly travel the world
and<00:01:12.730> meet<00:01:12.790> face<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.600> face<00:01:13.840> more<00:01:14.470> than<00:01:14.680> 2,000

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
and meet face to face more than 2,000

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.970 
and meet face to face more than 2,000
freight<00:01:15.550> forwarders<00:01:16.060> with<00:01:16.540> airline<00:01:17.050> cost<00:01:17.410> the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
freight forwarders with airline cost the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.820 
freight forwarders with airline cost the
amount<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:18.310> hotel<00:01:18.760> cost<00:01:19.060> or<00:01:19.810> more<00:01:20.410> importantly

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
amount of hotel cost or more importantly

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.520 
amount of hotel cost or more importantly
the<00:01:21.040> amount<00:01:21.250> of<00:01:21.400> time<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:22.090> will<00:01:22.150> require

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the amount of time that it will require

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.250 
the amount of time that it will require
versus<00:01:23.530> coming<00:01:23.770> into<00:01:23.980> one<00:01:24.310> central<00:01:24.880> location

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
versus coming into one central location

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.660 
versus coming into one central location
so<00:01:26.260> I<00:01:26.290> think<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.710> cost<00:01:26.950> savings<00:01:27.340> are<00:01:27.460> very

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
so I think the cost savings are very

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.630 
so I think the cost savings are very
very<00:01:28.000> obvious<00:01:31.260> saving<00:01:32.260> money<00:01:32.500> yes<00:01:33.070> that's<00:01:33.550> a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
very obvious saving money yes that's a

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.610 
very obvious saving money yes that's a
no-brainer

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
no-brainer

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.200 
no-brainer
the<00:01:35.620> one-on-one<00:01:36.010> meetings<00:01:36.640> are<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.850> very<00:01:37.150> good

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
the one-on-one meetings are a very good

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.450 
the one-on-one meetings are a very good
idea<00:01:37.420> because<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:38.080> get<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.500> meet<00:01:38.650> in<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.220> lapse

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
idea because you get to meet in a lapse

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.850 
idea because you get to meet in a lapse
of<00:01:39.610> three<00:01:39.910> days<00:01:40.150> perhaps<00:01:40.570> study<00:01:40.930> 30<00:01:41.380> persons

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
of three days perhaps study 30 persons

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.310 
of three days perhaps study 30 persons
40<00:01:42.250> persons<00:01:42.640> very<00:01:43.090> very<00:01:43.330> productive<00:01:43.870> and<00:01:44.020> well
