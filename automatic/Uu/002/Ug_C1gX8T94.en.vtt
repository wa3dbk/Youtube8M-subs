00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.140
 the ingredients needed to 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.850
 French bread and their 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.619
 quantities of each are as follows 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.939
 flour thousand grams 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:31.540
 the ice water 600 grams of salt 20 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:36.420
 grams sugar 10 grams of yeast 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:40.230
 fresh 30 grams margarine 20 grams 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.670
 10 gram breeder 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.990
 we will show the process of elaboration 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.430
 of French bread by direct method 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.120
 first ingredients need to be 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.120
 heavy 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.450
 observe the portion of ice being 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.910
 used to get the ice water 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.520
 After the mixture is weighed, the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.470
 ingredients in the maceira beginning with 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.110
 of dry goods 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.270
 after a few seconds the maceira 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.180
 should be turned off to add the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.370
 other ingredients the yeast that will be 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.360
 used in this case is the biological 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.400
 fresh 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.630
 so it will be added 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.820
 later as you already know 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.160
 reaching the gluten veil point at 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.619
 maceira will be switched off and the 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.930
 transferred to the table slightly 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:38.380
 smeared with one vegetable oil wetness 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.720
 fast effect at this time and then 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.720
 the mass is put to rest 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.719
 when it doubles in volume it will be added 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:53.119
 to be divided up to obtain 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.700
 Good French with 50 grams each 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.420
 after baking each portion of the dough 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.969
 should weigh around 70 grams as 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.490
 this divisive divide the dough into 30 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:09.140
 parts will need to be placed in your 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.629
 drawer two kilos and one hundred grams of mass 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.450
 it should be well placed in the drawer 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.980
 which should already be slightly smeared with 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.010
 vegetable oil 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.010
 after dividing each part the thrashing 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.860
 then opened in the hand and then carried 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.290
 for the modeler to be glued to the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.910
 As the masses are being rolled up 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.820
 are transferred to the treadmills 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.390
 where they are slightly tight 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.390
 With the hands 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.550
 that points to the mass that was 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.460
 rolled down is in contact with the 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.640
 mat for the roller does not open during the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.640
 launch 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.720
 as the stars are filled 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.360
 are placed in the growth chamber 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.680
 where they will remain until the folding masses 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.870
 volume 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.690
 When this happens the mats will be 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.440
 withdrawals and the masses received a 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.380
 cut with a very thin blade is 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.840
 incision refers to the finish that is 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.190
 given to French bread and will allow the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.380
 mass the work while it is roasted 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.860
 The mats will then be taken to the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.170
 furnace whose temperature should be 220 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.620
 degrees and the time of release around 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.170
 of 20 minutes while baking will require 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.900
 make two injections of steam into the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.660
 oven in the first five minutes 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.800
 this helps to make the product 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.330
 with soft crisp peel 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.850
 after baking the bread will be 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.850
 removed from the oven and placed 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.870
 cool to finally be exposed 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.870
 to the final consumer
