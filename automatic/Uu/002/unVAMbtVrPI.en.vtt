studio earphone is because it's 8 feet
long<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.409> by<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.859> mean<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.249> cord<00:02:05.579> is

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
long and by that I mean this cord is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.450 
long and by that I mean this cord is
extremely<00:02:06.840> long<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> longest<00:02:08.369> I've

extremely long one of the longest I've
ever<00:02:08.490> seen<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.179> consumer<00:02:09.690> type<00:02:09.869> headphones

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
ever seen in consumer type headphones

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.170 
ever seen in consumer type headphones
and<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.860> goes<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.160> one<00:02:11.310> ear<00:02:11.550> which<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.910> really

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and it goes to one ear which is really

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.300 
and it goes to one ear which is really
nice<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.600> don't<00:02:12.810> like<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.380> go<00:02:13.710> into<00:02:13.860> both<00:02:14.069> ear

nice I don't like to go into both ear

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.950 
nice I don't like to go into both ear
design<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:14.940> gets<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.330> way<00:02:15.420> yeah<00:02:15.660> I

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
design it just gets in the way yeah I

design it just gets in the way yeah I
don't<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.459> has<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.239> ear

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
don't like it so it has this one ear

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.640 
don't like it so it has this one ear
design<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:18.930> for<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.170> headphones<00:02:19.500> themselves

design as for the headphones themselves
you<00:02:20.099> can<00:02:20.220> see<00:02:20.400> there<00:02:20.549> are<00:02:20.640> pretty<00:02:20.849> high

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
you can see there are pretty high

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.140 
you can see there are pretty high
quality<00:02:21.120> construction

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
quality construction

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.970

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
there's just plastic but the diaphragms

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.099 
there's just plastic but the diaphragms
inside<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:35.640> know<00:02:35.760> like<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.269> said<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.810> cord

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
inside you know like I said one cord

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.569 
inside you know like I said one cord

titanium<00:02:42.150> they're<00:02:42.480> nothing<00:02:42.689> like<00:02:43.079> to<00:02:43.409> show

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
titanium they're nothing like to show

titanium they're nothing like to show
off<00:02:43.829> but<00:02:44.040> they<00:02:44.159> look<00:02:44.340> pretty<00:02:44.519> sharp<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:45.000> have

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
off but they look pretty sharp you have

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.690 
off but they look pretty sharp you have
this<00:02:45.269> rubberized<00:02:45.629> band<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.379> here<00:02:46.620> which<00:02:47.549> is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
this rubberized band up here which is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.339 
this rubberized band up here which is
pretty<00:02:47.849> nice<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.329> doesn't<00:02:48.450> grip<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.900> anything

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
pretty nice it doesn't grip to anything

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.729 
pretty nice it doesn't grip to anything
but<00:02:49.639> it's<00:02:50.639> good<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.030> grip<00:02:51.299> on<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:52.439> then<00:02:52.650> you

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
but it's good to grip on to and then you

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.349 
but it's good to grip on to and then you
have<00:02:52.889> the<00:02:53.040> band<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.459> rolls<00:02:53.639> through<00:02:53.760> all<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
have the band that rolls through all the

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.300 
have the band that rolls through all the
way<00:02:54.450> around<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.230> have<00:02:55.889> to<00:02:55.980> say<00:02:56.099> these<00:02:56.250> are

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
way around here I have to say these are

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.890 
way around here I have to say these are
one<00:02:56.549> of<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:56.730> most<00:02:56.939> comfortable<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.720> ear

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
one of the most comfortable on ear

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.750 
one of the most comfortable on ear
headphones<00:02:57.930> I've<00:02:58.409> ever<00:02:58.620> used<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.159> it's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
headphones I've ever used and it's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.030 
headphones I've ever used and it's
because<00:03:00.180> they<00:03:00.359> are<00:03:00.599> over<00:03:01.260> ear<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.799> they<00:03:01.889> don't

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
because they are over ear and they don't

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.649 
because they are over ear and they don't
sit<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.400> your<00:03:02.549> ear<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:02.760> pretty<00:03:03.120> much<00:03:03.299> cover

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
sit on your ear they pretty much cover

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.809 
sit on your ear they pretty much cover
your<00:03:03.900> entire<00:03:04.049> ear<00:03:04.530> there's<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.220> lot<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.669> real

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
your entire ear there's a lot of real

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.460 
your entire ear there's a lot of real
estate<00:03:05.849> inside<00:03:06.689> for<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.139> stick<00:03:07.319> your

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
estate inside for you to stick your

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.619 
estate inside for you to stick your
whole<00:03:07.620> ear<00:03:07.919> in<00:03:08.069> here<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.879> that's<00:03:09.150> one<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
whole ear in here so that's one of the

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.420 
whole ear in here so that's one of the
reasons<00:03:10.079> it<00:03:10.290> has<00:03:10.530> some<00:03:10.799> very<00:03:11.010> good<00:03:11.129> noise

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
reasons it has some very good noise

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.369 
reasons it has some very good noise
cancellation<00:03:12.120> now<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.689> is<00:03:12.780> an<00:03:12.870> active<00:03:13.200> noise

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
cancellation now it is an active noise

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.659 
cancellation now it is an active noise
cancellation<00:03:13.859> there's<00:03:14.129> no<00:03:14.220> batteries

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669 
cancellation there's no batteries

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.699 
cancellation there's no batteries
there's<00:03:14.879> none<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.209> stuff<00:03:15.569> that<00:03:15.709> noise

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
there's none of that stuff that noise

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.619 
there's none of that stuff that noise
cancels<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.519> don't<00:03:17.669> like<00:03:17.849> that<00:03:18.030> artificial

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
cancels I don't like that artificial

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.559 
cancels I don't like that artificial
noise<00:03:18.810> canceling<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.319> like<00:03:20.359> passive<00:03:21.359> or

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
noise canceling I like passive or

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.479 
noise canceling I like passive or
natural<00:03:22.409> noise<00:03:22.560> cancelling<00:03:23.069> and<00:03:23.129> that's<00:03:23.310> what

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
natural noise cancelling and that's what

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.129 
natural noise cancelling and that's what
these<00:03:23.609> have<00:03:23.819> these<00:03:24.030> closed<00:03:24.269> ear<00:03:24.510> cut<00:03:24.750> designs

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
these have these closed ear cut designs

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.559 
these have these closed ear cut designs
provide<00:03:25.769> maximum<00:03:26.129> isolation<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.269> that's<00:03:27.389> one

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
provide maximum isolation and that's one

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.170 
provide maximum isolation and that's one
thing<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.109> should<00:03:28.739> note<00:03:28.949> of<00:03:29.909> course

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
thing that you should note of course

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
they have the expansion so you can

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.469 
they have the expansion so you can
adjust<00:03:32.099> your<00:03:32.280> head<00:03:32.459> size<00:03:32.669> just<00:03:33.030> move<00:03:33.150> up<00:03:33.299> and

down and you're ready to go now they
also<00:03:35.190> fold<00:03:35.489> up<00:03:35.669> for<00:03:35.970> easy<00:03:36.120> transport<00:03:36.780> not<00:03:37.409> a

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
also fold up for easy transport not a

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.000 
also fold up for easy transport not a
ton<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.370> enough<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.620> hold<00:03:40.620> up<00:03:40.949> here<00:03:42.739> hold<00:03:43.739> up

ton but enough to hold up here hold up

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.210 
ton but enough to hold up here hold up
come<00:03:44.400> on<00:03:44.750> they<00:03:45.750> fold<00:03:46.019> up<00:03:46.169> for<00:03:46.199> easy<00:03:46.530> transmit

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
come on they fold up for easy transmit

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.369 
come on they fold up for easy transmit
kind<00:03:47.729> of<00:03:47.879> somehow<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.629> don't<00:03:48.870> remember<00:03:49.109> how

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
kind of somehow I don't remember how

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.000 
kind of somehow I don't remember how
they<00:03:49.409> did<00:03:49.709> it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
they did it

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.729 
they did it
I<00:03:50.359> got<00:03:51.359> Best<00:03:51.599> Buy<00:03:51.750> showed<00:03:51.959> Pam<00:03:52.229> there's<00:03:52.590> a

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
I got Best Buy showed Pam there's a

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.110 
I got Best Buy showed Pam there's a
thing<00:03:53.010> something<00:03:53.459> like<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.790> don't<00:03:54.060> know

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
thing something like that I don't know

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.140 
thing something like that I don't know
anyway<00:03:54.810> that's<00:03:55.440> not<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.650> point

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
anyway that's not the point

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.360 
anyway that's not the point
so<00:03:57.150> they<00:03:57.269> fold<00:03:57.479> up<00:03:57.629> somehow<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.799> will<00:03:59.040> remain

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
so they fold up somehow that will remain

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.969 
so they fold up somehow that will remain
a<00:03:59.400> mystery<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.199> they<00:04:01.199> had<00:04:01.379> their<00:04:01.680> ultra

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
a mystery and they had their ultra

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.159 
a mystery and they had their ultra
durable<00:04:02.129> lifetime<00:04:02.849> warranty<00:04:03.269> all<00:04:03.629> that<00:04:03.989> good

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
durable lifetime warranty all that good

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.960 
durable lifetime warranty all that good
stuff<00:04:04.199> really<00:04:04.709> long<00:04:04.859> cord<00:04:05.099> titanium<00:04:05.699> coated

high<00:04:06.060> polymer<00:04:06.449> diaphragms<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.260> let's<00:04:07.439> get

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
high polymer diaphragms so let's get

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.009 
high polymer diaphragms so let's get
into<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.129> sound<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:09.120> 50<00:04:09.389> bucks<00:04:09.419> you<00:04:09.870> know<00:04:09.959> you

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
into the sound for 50 bucks you know you

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.319 
into the sound for 50 bucks you know you
can't<00:04:10.379> expect<00:04:10.829> a<00:04:10.949> lot<00:04:11.189> but<00:04:11.400> costs<00:04:11.729> really<00:04:11.970> puts

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
can't expect a lot but costs really puts

can't expect a lot but costs really puts
out<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.780> I'm<00:04:13.260> pretty<00:04:13.290> well<00:04:13.769> happy<00:04:14.099> with<00:04:14.250> these

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
out and I'm pretty well happy with these

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.099 
out and I'm pretty well happy with these
headphones<00:04:14.639> now<00:04:15.000> as<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.150> stated<00:04:15.389> earlier<00:04:15.840> these

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
headphones now as I stated earlier these

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.830 
headphones now as I stated earlier these
were<00:04:16.229> released<00:04:16.650> back<00:04:16.919> in<00:04:17.220> 2003<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.570> these<00:04:18.659> are

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
were released back in 2003 so these are

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.180 
were released back in 2003 so these are
old<00:04:18.989> headphones<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.620> mean<00:04:19.769> there's<00:04:19.919> seven

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
old headphones I mean there's seven

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.099 
old headphones I mean there's seven
years<00:04:20.400> well<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.209> mean<00:04:21.599> they've<00:04:21.750> been<00:04:21.780> on<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
years well I mean they've been on the

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.360 
years well I mean they've been on the
market<00:04:22.440> for<00:04:22.470> seven<00:04:22.830> years<00:04:22.979> I'm<00:04:23.070> sure<00:04:23.220> these

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
market for seven years I'm sure these

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.770 
market for seven years I'm sure these
aren't<00:04:23.639> seven<00:04:23.849> years<00:04:24.090> old<00:04:24.240> themselves

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
aren't seven years old themselves

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.149 
aren't seven years old themselves
they're<00:04:24.960> still<00:04:25.169> in<00:04:25.289> manufacturing<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.099> they

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
they're still in manufacturing and they

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.249 
they're still in manufacturing and they
haven't<00:04:26.340> been<00:04:26.490> discontinued<00:04:27.240> but<00:04:27.449> that<00:04:27.960> bones

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
haven't been discontinued but that bones

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.800 
haven't been discontinued but that bones
themselves<00:04:28.470> are<00:04:28.860> pretty<00:04:29.250> dang<00:04:29.639> old<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.690> so

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
themselves are pretty dang old and so

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.899 
themselves are pretty dang old and so
the<00:04:30.930> technology<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.529> can<00:04:31.710> imagine<00:04:32.159> has<00:04:32.490> evolved

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
the technology I can imagine has evolved

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:34.029 
the technology I can imagine has evolved
much

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
much

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.649 
much
in<00:04:34.099> these<00:04:34.279> headphones<00:04:34.639> over<00:04:34.819> the<00:04:35.029> years<00:04:35.300> but

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 
in these headphones over the years but

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.749 
in these headphones over the years but
headphone<00:04:36.409> technology<00:04:36.949> as<00:04:37.009> a<00:04:37.099> whole<00:04:37.129> hasn't

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
headphone technology as a whole hasn't

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.420 
headphone technology as a whole hasn't
really<00:04:38.389> come<00:04:38.629> that<00:04:38.900> far<00:04:39.229> and<00:04:39.469> for<00:04:40.159> the<00:04:40.219> price

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
really come that far and for the price

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.829 
really come that far and for the price
you<00:04:40.610> pay<00:04:40.759> you<00:04:40.819> get<00:04:41.029> really<00:04:41.240> good<00:04:41.419> sound<00:04:41.659> so

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:41.839 
you pay you get really good sound so

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:43.209 
you pay you get really good sound so
let's<00:04:41.990> talk<00:04:42.169> about<00:04:42.229> it<00:04:42.439> as<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.860> stated<00:04:43.069> earlier

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219 
let's talk about it as I stated earlier

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:44.379 
let's talk about it as I stated earlier
there<00:04:43.580> was<00:04:43.669> no<00:04:43.789> active<00:04:44.119> noise-cancelling

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
there was no active noise-cancelling

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.239 
there was no active noise-cancelling
it's<00:04:44.899> all<00:04:44.990> passive<00:04:45.409> but<00:04:45.499> it<00:04:45.619> sounds<00:04:45.830> very<00:04:45.979> good

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:46.249 
it's all passive but it sounds very good

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.749 
it's all passive but it sounds very good
it<00:04:47.210> has<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.419> very<00:04:47.809> very<00:04:48.110> tight<00:04:48.589> punchy<00:04:49.309> low-end

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
it has a very very tight punchy low-end

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.519 
it has a very very tight punchy low-end
which<00:04:49.999> I<00:04:50.149> was<00:04:50.300> very<00:04:50.539> surprised<00:04:51.020> by<00:04:51.229> I<00:04:51.259> thought

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:51.529 
which I was very surprised by I thought

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.200 
which I was very surprised by I thought
this<00:04:51.649> would<00:04:51.830> have<00:04:51.919> been<00:04:52.039> really<00:04:52.909> bright

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
this would have been really bright

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.119 
this would have been really bright
really<00:04:53.539> tinny<00:04:53.899> not<00:04:54.139> something<00:04:54.529> that<00:04:54.710> you

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
really tinny not something that you

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:56.529 
really tinny not something that you
really<00:04:55.490> want<00:04:55.669> to<00:04:55.759> listen<00:04:55.909> to<00:04:56.119> but<00:04:56.300> I<00:04:56.389> was

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
really want to listen to but I was

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.689 
really want to listen to but I was
proven<00:04:57.050> wrong<00:04:57.080> it<00:04:57.710> was<00:04:58.009> a<00:04:58.039> little<00:04:58.339> bit<00:04:58.460> bright

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
proven wrong it was a little bit bright

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.879 
proven wrong it was a little bit bright
in<00:04:58.909> the<00:04:58.999> beginning<00:04:59.389> and<00:04:59.599> you<00:04:59.719> needed<00:04:59.990> about<00:05:00.110> 15

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
in the beginning and you needed about 15

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.219 
in the beginning and you needed about 15
to<00:05:01.039> 24<00:05:01.430> hours<00:05:01.729> worth<00:05:01.909> of<00:05:01.999> burnin<00:05:02.360> but<00:05:02.869> after

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
to 24 hours worth of burnin but after

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.989 
to 24 hours worth of burnin but after
that<00:05:03.319> the<00:05:03.529> bass<00:05:03.770> really<00:05:04.249> started<00:05:04.729> to<00:05:04.819> come

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:04.999 
that the bass really started to come

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:08.320
