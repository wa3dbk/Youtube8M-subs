actually<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.120> tree<00:00:57.539> line<00:00:57.719> right

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
actually this is the tree line right

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.590 
actually this is the tree line right
here<00:00:59.210> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.809> south<00:01:01.649> side<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.879> along<00:01:02.940> that

here on the south side all along that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
here on the south side all along that
tree<00:01:04.019> line<00:01:04.170> right<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:04.710> that's<00:01:05.189> that's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
tree line right there that's that's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.640 
tree line right there that's that's
going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.210> key<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.170> tree<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.439> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
going to be key and this tree and this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
going to be key and this tree and this
tree<00:01:07.710> line<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.520> right<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.060> is

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
tree line that I'm on right here this is

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.570 
tree line that I'm on right here this is
on<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.540> county<00:01:09.930> road<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.409> here

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
on this little county road right here

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.490 
on this little county road right here
that's<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.700> good<00:01:11.850> bet<00:01:12.030> awesome<00:01:12.960> place<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.200> hunt

all<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.520> these<00:01:14.670> tree<00:01:14.880> lines<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.270> can't<00:01:15.450> go

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
all on these tree lines you can't go

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.520 
all on these tree lines you can't go
wrong<00:01:15.720> anywhere<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.450> three<00:01:19.320> more
