basically<00:01:32.590> confined<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:33.640> small<00:01:34.210> space

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
basically confined to this small space

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.859 
basically confined to this small space
and<00:01:36.490> there's<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:36.970> really<00:01:37.270> cool<00:01:37.450> texture
