00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
next clip as you can see after i zoom in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.709 
next clip as you can see after i zoom in
on<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> target<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.950> he<00:00:44.100> puts<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.430> EMP<00:00:45.210> UAV

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
on the target then he puts a EMP UAV

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.690 
on the target then he puts a EMP UAV
down<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.440> has<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.010> through<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
down that it has to go through and it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.520 
down that it has to go through and it
still<00:00:47.940> goes<00:00:48.059> through<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> double

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
still goes through it and I get a double

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.260 
still goes through it and I get a double
kill<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> next<00:00:50.460> clip<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.969> put<00:00:51.180> an

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
kill out of it in the next clip I put an

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.380 
kill out of it in the next clip I put an
EMP<00:00:51.780> UAV<00:00:52.379> down<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.460> coming<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.300> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
EMP UAV down as it's coming in and I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
EMP UAV down as it's coming in and I
zoom<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> target<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.280> pretty

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
zoom in on the target and it's pretty

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
zoom in on the target and it's pretty
obvious<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.449> goes<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:57.989> through<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
obvious that it goes right through the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.610 
obvious that it goes right through the
EMP<00:00:58.800> UAV<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.789> still<00:01:00.510> comes<00:01:00.780> down<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.410> blows

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
EMP UAV and still comes down and blows

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.799 
EMP UAV and still comes down and blows
up<00:01:01.649> white<00:01:02.399> words<00:01:02.579> post<00:01:03.000> too<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
up white words post too but the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.780 
up white words post too but the
infantrymen<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.159> out<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> blast

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
infantrymen is just out of the blast

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.660 
infantrymen is just out of the blast
radius<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:07.140> finally<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.830> last<00:01:07.890> clip<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
radius and finally in this last clip the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
radius and finally in this last clip the
same<00:01:08.880> thing<00:01:09.150> happens<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.840> only<00:01:09.990> difference

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
same thing happens the only difference

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
same thing happens the only difference
is<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.890> hits<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.430> building<00:01:11.820> instead<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
is it hits the building instead of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.810 
is it hits the building instead of
anybody<00:01:12.720> around<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> blast<00:01:13.439> zone<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.640> think

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
anybody around the blast zone so I think

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.570 
anybody around the blast zone so I think
it's<00:01:15.119> pretty<00:01:15.360> safe<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> say<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.560> EMP<00:01:16.920> UAV

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's pretty safe to say that the EMP UAV

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
it's pretty safe to say that the EMP UAV
on<00:01:17.790> cruise<00:01:18.030> missiles<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.810> current<00:01:19.590> gen<00:01:19.920> does

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
on cruise missiles on current gen does

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.109 
on cruise missiles on current gen does
not<00:01:20.520> work<00:01:20.909> at<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.420> judging<00:01:22.110> by<00:01:22.259> those<00:01:22.470> clips

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
not work at all judging by those clips

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.490 
not work at all judging by those clips
anyway<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.270> gonna<00:01:24.360> pick<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.780> my<00:01:24.810> PlayStation
