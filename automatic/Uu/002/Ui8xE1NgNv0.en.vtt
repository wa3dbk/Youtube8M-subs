00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
okay first thing you have to do is get

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.620 
okay first thing you have to do is get
it<00:00:07.919> out<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.189> package<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:10.160> you<00:00:11.360> want<00:00:12.360> to

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
it out of the package and you want to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.259 
it out of the package and you want to
mash<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.139> barb<00:00:13.320> down<00:00:13.650> as<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.759> first<00:00:15.030> thing

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
mash the barb down as the first thing

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.320 
mash the barb down as the first thing
that's<00:00:15.900> important<00:00:17.359> and<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.779> best<00:00:19.199> tool<00:00:19.560> for

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
that's important and the best tool for

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.890 
that's important and the best tool for
doing<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.720> there's<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.529> mono<00:00:22.800> crimping<00:00:23.310> tool

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
doing that there's a mono crimping tool

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.050 
doing that there's a mono crimping tool
because<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> contour<00:00:26.269> fits<00:00:27.320> exactly<00:00:29.060> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
because the contour fits exactly the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:39.650 
because the contour fits exactly the
contour<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> hook<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.830> smaller<00:00:32.160> slot

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.080 

and<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.560> mash<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.830> down<00:00:41.060> you<00:00:42.060> get<00:00:42.530> nice

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
and when you mash it down you get nice

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.710 
and when you mash it down you get nice
even<00:00:46.040> lay<00:00:47.040> down<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> barb<00:00:48.000> along<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
even lay down of the barb along the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.060 
even lay down of the barb along the
shank<00:00:48.990> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> hook<00:00:52.700> this<00:00:53.700> is<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.970> tool<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:55.070> made

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
shank of the hook this is a tool I made

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.280 
shank of the hook this is a tool I made
for<00:00:56.790> holding<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> hook<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.630> has<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.810> slot<00:00:58.260> that

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
for holding the hook it has a slot that

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.580 
for holding the hook it has a slot that
fits<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:59.100> perfectly<00:00:59.480> there's<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.690> round<00:01:01.320> hole

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
fits it perfectly there's a round hole

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.330 
fits it perfectly there's a round hole
for<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> sleeve<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.900> in<00:01:04.080> circling

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:42.470 

yep<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.640> hook<00:01:08.940> into<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.510> slot

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.620 

okay<00:01:43.480> next<00:01:43.810> thing<00:01:43.930> we<00:01:44.080> can<00:01:44.110> do<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:45.430> with<00:01:46.090> we

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
okay next thing we can do is with we

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.500 
okay next thing we can do is with we
since<00:01:46.900> we<00:01:47.050> have<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.230> right<00:01:47.530> hand<00:01:47.740> rotation

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
since we have a right hand rotation

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.190 
since we have a right hand rotation
we're<00:01:49.510> going<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:50.080> move<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:51.990> point<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.080> the

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
we're going to move the point of the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:22.900 
we're going to move the point of the
hook<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.460> right<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.780> then<00:01:56.020> roll<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.500> tail

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:33.600 

bring<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.570> up<00:02:23.660> close

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.390 

I<00:02:36.010> want<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.100> explain<00:02:37.550> what<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:37.910> do<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.540> hooks

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
I want to explain what I do to the hooks

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.200 
I want to explain what I do to the hooks
since<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.580> FBR<00:02:40.970> has<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> right<00:02:42.110> hand<00:02:42.380> rotation

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
since the FBR has a right hand rotation

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.770 
since the FBR has a right hand rotation
you<00:02:44.210> can<00:02:44.390> see

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.490 

that<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.200> bent<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.950> shank<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.990> tip<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.320> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
that I bent the shank of the tip of the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.090 
that I bent the shank of the tip of the
hook<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:53.820> direction<00:02:54.480> plus<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.590> rolled<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
hook that direction plus I rolled the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:04.780 
hook that direction plus I rolled the
tip<00:02:57.620> yeah<00:02:59.330> there's<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.450> standard

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790
