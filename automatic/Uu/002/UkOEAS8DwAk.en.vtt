 nor less than the big brother of the compass 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.630

 understanding of their neighbors homeland come to benefit the public the 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:32.760
 group crunch time 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.100
 strong of his 163 horses the patriot does not amuse the ground and especially on 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.170
 road where he exits more fluid with a certain ease 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.560
 moreover this engine is discreet and available from low speeds 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.830

 hardcore franchisor 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660
 its bodywork is actually too limited and its bodywork is 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.610
 vulnerable 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.980
 the clip is not to agitate his clumsy behavior the criminal roads

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.430
 on board some improvements have been made, particularly at 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.310
 design but nothing too naughty 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.980
 alas the hard plastics are still probably and the assemblies 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.020
 uncertain 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.350
 short the competition on this plane there is no need to worry about 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.610
 equipment we find three levels of finishes including the top version of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.820

 the trunk volume is about 3 120 1 3357 cubic decimeters next 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.140
 the configuration of the seats which is correct nevertheless pity that the
