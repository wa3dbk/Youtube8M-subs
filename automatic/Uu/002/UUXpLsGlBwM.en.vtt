their<00:02:13.530> team<00:02:13.770> would<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:13.980> built<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.400> the

championship<00:02:16.830> sad<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.300> kind<00:02:18.600> of

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
championship sad I think that's kind of

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.380 
championship sad I think that's kind of
what<00:02:18.780> everybody<00:02:19.140> expected<00:02:19.709> is<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.970> know<00:02:21.120> not

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
what everybody expected is you know not

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.510 
what everybody expected is you know not
too<00:02:21.750> many<00:02:21.900> players<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.860> have<00:02:22.980> gone<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.400> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
too many players that have gone to the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.160 
too many players that have gone to the
finals<00:02:23.940> like<00:02:24.120> Cleveland<00:02:24.510> did<00:02:24.660> what<00:02:24.930> three

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
finals like Cleveland did what three

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.290 
finals like Cleveland did what three
years<00:02:25.350> ago<00:02:25.470> would<00:02:26.370> lose<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> player<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.150> has

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300

San Francisco but no I think there's a
lot<00:04:52.780> of<00:04:52.840> anticipation<00:04:53.230> when<00:04:53.860> checking<00:04:54.160> back

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
lot of anticipation when checking back

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.630 
lot of anticipation when checking back
it<00:04:54.640> because<00:04:54.880> it<00:04:54.970> was<00:04:55.000> just<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.360> energy<00:04:55.600> of<00:04:56.050> the

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
it because it was just the energy of the

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.620 
it because it was just the energy of the
personalities<00:04:57.640> that<00:04:57.670> were<00:04:57.970> involved<00:04:58.240> in<00:04:58.480> it

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
personalities that were involved in it

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.710 
personalities that were involved in it
that<00:04:59.530> was<00:04:59.680> big<00:04:59.920> I<00:05:00.190> think<00:05:01.000> that<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.270> boston

like what seventeen eighteen in Rome now

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.310 
like what seventeen eighteen in Rome now
that<00:05:15.190> was<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.370> also<00:05:16.300> anticipating<00:05:17.050> game<00:05:17.140> so

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
that was a also anticipating game so

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.710 
that was a also anticipating game so

that<00:05:21.370> sack<00:05:22.000> return<00:05:22.900> game<00:05:23.110> when<00:05:23.320> you're<00:05:23.500> with

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
that sack return game when you're with

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.850 
that sack return game when you're with
your<00:05:23.710> family<00:05:23.920> or<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.550> did<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:26.140> I<00:05:26.320> did<00:05:26.410> once<00:05:26.710> the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
your family or I did it I did once the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.770 
your family or I did it I did once the
first<00:05:27.100> half<00:05:27.250> all<00:05:27.370> watch<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.670> second<00:05:28.060> but<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.450> did

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
first half all watch a second but I did

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.559 
first half all watch a second but I did
see<00:05:28.960> something

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.399 

I<00:05:37.509> think<00:05:38.509> this<00:05:38.569> will<00:05:38.719> be<00:05:38.779> the<00:05:38.930> approach<00:05:39.139> of<00:05:39.169> the

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
I think this will be the approach of the

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:47.860 
I think this will be the approach of the
year<00:05:43.479> oh<00:05:45.460> you<00:05:46.460> touched<00:05:46.729> a<00:05:46.819> lot<00:05:46.939> of<00:05:46.999> mine<00:05:47.599> great

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
year oh you touched a lot of mine great

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.779 
year oh you touched a lot of mine great
to<00:05:48.020> use<00:05:48.139> a<00:05:48.169> difficult<00:05:48.830> is<00:05:48.979> it<00:05:49.009> to<00:05:49.129> turn<00:05:49.610> around

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
to use a difficult is it to turn around

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.409 
to use a difficult is it to turn around
a<00:05:50.180> quickly<00:05:51.069> from<00:05:52.069> outside<00:05:52.550> perspective<00:05:53.089> it

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
a quickly from outside perspective it

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.189 
a quickly from outside perspective it
was<00:05:53.539> it<00:05:54.080> took<00:05:54.259> a<00:05:54.669> real<00:05:55.669> pennant<00:05:56.120> come<00:05:56.659> to<00:05:56.809> Jesus

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
was it took a real pennant come to Jesus

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.600 
was it took a real pennant come to Jesus
more<00:05:57.379> than<00:05:57.529> I<00:05:57.620> think<00:05:57.860> for<00:05:58.069> their<00:05:58.189> team<00:05:58.400> you

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
more than I think for their team you

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.920 
more than I think for their team you
know<00:05:58.729> the<00:05:58.819> kind<00:05:58.939> of<00:05:59.059> done<00:05:59.240> returns<00:05:59.599> with<00:05:59.809> who

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
know the kind of done returns with who

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.200 
know the kind of done returns with who
they<00:06:00.080> were<00:06:00.139> you<00:06:01.099> know<00:06:01.189> this<00:06:01.819> is<00:06:01.849> what<00:06:02.120> we're

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
they were you know this is what we're

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.640 
they were you know this is what we're
going<00:06:02.330> to<00:06:02.419> be<00:06:02.569> I'm<00:06:02.930> going<00:06:03.110> to<00:06:03.169> play<00:06:03.469> within

going to be I'm going to play within

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.269 
going to be I'm going to play within
this<00:06:03.919> framework<00:06:04.879> of<00:06:05.300> how<00:06:05.330> we<00:06:05.509> play<00:06:06.169> and<00:06:06.499> they
