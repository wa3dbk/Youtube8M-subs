 British Mega Crass at the first 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.850
 Team so that looks great 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.159
 I thought it stays a bit 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.170
 So it will depend on the taste yes 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.390
 but I was so braided the first time 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 because it tasted so good people and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.530
 That's why I'm curious how 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.610
 this one tastes like it looks now 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.659

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.610
 The last time I have three and a half 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.720
 minutes used to info and then 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:59.119
 Let's take a look around here you see 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.500
 this portion I 'll be back separately 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.149

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.490
 what exactly was sachs now ? 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.190

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.239

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.360
 reinhard minutes at 600 watts so that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.480
 right in any case itself very well 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.170

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:45.890
 just do not try it here 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:45.890
 yes, I would have tasted without the sauce 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:57.659
 ok I think the sauce has to stop it 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.090
 I will distribute them now and then 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.430

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.970

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.970

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:20.190
