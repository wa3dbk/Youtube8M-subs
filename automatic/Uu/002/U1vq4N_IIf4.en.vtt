00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
lot of a massive board state so this one

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
breaks the board state seismic rupture

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.170 
breaks the board state seismic rupture
so<00:00:57.059> two<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.719> red<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.770> card<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.340> sorcery

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so two and a red this card is a sorcery

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.000 
so two and a red this card is a sorcery
it<00:01:00.449> deals<00:01:00.690> two<00:01:00.930> damage<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.440> each<00:01:01.649> creature

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
it deals two damage to each creature

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
it deals two damage to each creature
without<00:01:02.250> flying<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.390> good<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.719> pyroclasm

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
without flying not as good as pyroclasm

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.620 
without flying not as good as pyroclasm
I<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:05.189> hoping<00:01:05.519> pyroclasm<00:01:06.060> would<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
I was hoping pyroclasm would see a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.870 
I was hoping pyroclasm would see a
reprint<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> mean<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:07.950> card<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.400> guess<00:01:08.610> is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
reprint but I mean this card I guess is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
reprint but I mean this card I guess is
good<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.450> tokens<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.080> long<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:10.530> don't

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619
