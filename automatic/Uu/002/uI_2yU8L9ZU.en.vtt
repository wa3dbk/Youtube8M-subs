00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hey marshall do you know any reliable page 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.390
 They will buy coins clear sagas 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.540
 dotcom merger the best selling page 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.280
 of coins the link in the description 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.650
 Y 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.450
 to see how we are are jump more and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.740
 what happens that to finish the non-floor of 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.650
 break that is beverly and here you have a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
 equipment of funds already with a match and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.410
 here you have the all silver equipazo 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.700
 Thursday that are silver wash that is 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 premier league which we consider 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.500
 as savings because they are great to play is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.509
 as they dance for example and there you have 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.160
 also apart that and makes this 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.260
 team because a very dangerous team already 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.930
 the expensive time if the truth that this team 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.170
 with said we consider that by quality 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.780
 price and for normal quality too 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.329
 We believe that it is better than ours 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.190
 because they are silver players that with the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.499
 speed they do everything to you because there 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.359
 you have how it goes, it goes away and the 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.399
 rosquita goal that gets us through the 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.269
 stick with long goalkeeper is a great goal 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.039
 as said 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.510
 Weinman is a player who probably 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.969
 be the best silvers that has the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.769
 premier and the truth that right now its 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.379
 price is not very high the truth that 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.180
 many people kiss flying and people like that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.979
 but you think that many times 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.110
 you need to spend a million for 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.880
 have good silver games because 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 many things that the silver ones do is 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.120
 run pull the center band and little 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.100
 plus 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.120
 and also silver fuck they have 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.190
 technique 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.480
 very well with them I truly know that there 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.370
 some who do everything there you see how 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.170
 we were superior in shots at least in 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.820
 the first part was winning us a 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.500
 rival but good luckily we're going to 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.360
 plant something to which we were going to 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.400
 serve too much you'll see because in 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.440
 as a result of the match because it 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.090
 makes it very difficult for teams like this to 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.830
 are made the conscience has searched 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 results for example here technically 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.520
 that for something it says here we have 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.890
 our draw almost minute 80 of bonn and 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.330
 a player who has complied in all 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.220
 parties virtually every 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.920
 that we have been teaching you from your 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.320
 signing has been fitting goals a couple of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 hat tricks also consecutive that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040
 got and at the moment yes a surprise of the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.600
 series that total recommendation of this 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.760
 player even some more we have 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.260
 gone recommending and nothing here you see how 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.360
 we put the tie which was not going to 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.060
 serve a lot because the player is like that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.680
 that the rival team has is very 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.899
 complicated in terms of silver because it 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.520
 they face you and they seem to be 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.020
 totals seem to be all legend or 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.580
 it is very very complicated here 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.550
 you how to get the rebound and 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.980
 then game and the minute 87 put the 2-1 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.840
 and practically the end point if the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.910
 true that the game will end with 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.690
 final result of 3 to 1 in our 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.760
 against because 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.860
 a match that has told me that the rival 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.570
 look for you look for tickles in 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.980
 speed because our power to 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.260
 increase right now they are not very fast 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.380
 because the rapids are very expensive and 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.390
 you will see in the dam our foresees how it 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.010
 is progressing there you have a goal of 20 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.560
 that is an author game that really is 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.820
 the best striker this year for 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.440
 quality-price of all the small 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.270
 because not some expensive and good there goes to 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.960
 drop the game like I did 13 in 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.030
 against is a game that we see 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.800
 ballasted by our low speed that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.300
 there good we have a bonilla without 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.380
 bonus contracts and that the truth as 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.880
 said player tenacity 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.800
 completely quality-price in this 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.540
 series be the best as explored because 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.100
 it cost us eight hundred coins and look what 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.680
 he has done has scored 12 goals in nine 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.360
 parties you truly love for that and 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.450
 this from the entry so Ivorians with 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.370
 quality wanted us as I say seemed 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.590
 to drug the truth that gives that touch 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.660
 You can even give this touch to them 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.520
 whole that arrives now there was lukaku 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.320
 with 6000 kinda currency at the time that 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.490
 expensive that pretty pretty reel 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.710
 now you can not find it for that 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.700
 neither price nor I do not know what they know that 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.200
 I have an account that is happening 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.700
 coins 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.470
 and nothing we have there we premiere 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.400
 forward and we started this team 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.989
 that up has a forward that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.000
 like that ricky van wolfswinkel the 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.920
 Sporting Lisbon player and other 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.900
 brilliant merino referee players 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.580
 look at them there badly placed or leroy fer that 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.110
 we have already had lennon and other homes 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.239
 as small and we share the 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.230
 without it there is a fair we tried it 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.000
 in this in this series sorry and ricky go 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.849
 wolfswinkel is a player who loves 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.870
 because these as I like to see is a 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.220
 party very ballasted by the 4-3-3 that you 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.690
 try to play because we are 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.950
 players that we like to touch the ball 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.390
 then when we find that 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.459
 equal more or less that is equal to 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.010
 we have a hard time playing there 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.450
 you see that not to 0-0 the first part was going to 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.489
 be a party like I said I quite 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.980
 difficult on our part to play it 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.500
 because you see how are you from the pressure 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.570
 above and above always difficulty with 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.459
 its three middle centers that the output of 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.300
 ball and well there you have a goal with a 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.520
 so much of fortune of leroy fer 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.650
 we believe that the ife probably of the 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.569
 best mediocentres not brilliant of 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.220
 all the midcentre barclays did not deserve 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.870
 mc2 because we know that the best in the 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.490
 ceo not bright the chin of the hall 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.259
 vicky which we have in 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.030
 template just like we have the gray in 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.300
 bowling chris smalling that if it goes 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.580
 simply his second match is a goal 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.400
 he is a defender who goes very well up 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.900
 it is as if in the previous video 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.580
 well that went above and well here yes 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.190
 will end the game a very action 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.229
 very very critical on the part of the rival and the 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.729
 we can take out and good kids what 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.289
 always if you are liking the 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.449
 barquisimetana trick do not hesitate to vote 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.889
 the here we see how hold bis goes and went 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.509
 to enter kevin de bruyne a player who 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.789
 you really love saga so that from 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.080
 bruijn we love the other city and 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.060
 anyone who tries it because it 's from 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.110
 those players who leave a mark costs 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.180
 a lot to remove the post 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.250
 that is , tin for example 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.590
 that after the treatment of the 2m ugly 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.610
 total surprise and good is that informed 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.780
 our team 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.430
 Yes, good kids, as always if you have 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.930
 liked the video give the TV favorites 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.259
 and until next time until next time 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.259
 kids
