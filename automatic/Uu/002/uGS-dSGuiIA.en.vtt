00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.740
 good friends of youtube this time 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:11.030
 I want to introduce you how to install the 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.540
 samsung keyboard in our custom 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.690
 Rom is from the course where I presented at 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.140
 the previous video that the miracle 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.360
 look at it the miracle and the rom based 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.700
 usually on cyanogenmod they bring a 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.880
 keyboard that is called on the keyboard 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.290
 Android that is this brings us the keyboard 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.330
 3 x 4 that some of you will be 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.570
 accustomed very for example this 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.879
 keyboard I do not like does not mean that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.320
 is to love him I just did not adapt 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:47.750
 that's why I prefer the 3 x 4 keyboard 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.020
 that the one I'm going to teach him as if he's 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.820
 the good the file they need I'm going 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.520
 to leave in the description so that you 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.940
 can download 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.770
 and the file is so a sip who does not 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.990
 they must decompress themselves 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.809
 also how is the zip keep it in 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.060
 your memory card at the root of being 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.350
 possible to locate it as quickly as possible 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.150
 good for 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.150
 to have the 3 x 4 keyboard that we want 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.680
 restart in my phone recovery mode 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.210
 usually only the rom based 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:32.470
 in stock bring the keyboard 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.960
 of the original samsung let's say it like that 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.520
 who are older than 7 or others by 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.740
 the generals only bring this keyboard 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.470
 good for the key character of 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.310
 samsung is very simple first we 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.490
 we go in mount storage that is I do not know if 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.520
 it is pronounced like this but in the end 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.689
 the intention is 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.689
 mount system 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.950
 we have system mount data 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.930
 we go back and grain I love is so 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.930
 frantic 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.420
 we enter joe shipp from the city car 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.420
 Y 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.350
 Here we give you look in the file 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.740
 declarative of samsung galaxy 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.760
 and we choose 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.760
 of moyes 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.950
 and a quick process 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.060
 we give it rebound exist side 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.550
 and declared the one that I prefer because I 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.250
 it is more comfortable to write 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.280
 with one hand since the use of clear me 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.560
 it costs quite a lot and honestly I do not 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.780
 determined for him and that's why I prefer 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.020
 to the old keyboard uses the keyboard that 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.020
 bring 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.840
 on our phone like this 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.950
 we hope that the initial round is the 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.500
 rice miracle in this last one in this 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.260
 video they use it for the last time after 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.560
 already from now on use another 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.430
 rom to show you the analysis 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.430
 correspondent 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.710
 and how they will have realized the type 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.550
 of analysis that I do is a little bit 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:36.690
 different from two others that can already see 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.490
 you can now find about of 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:44.040
 suddenly the rom suddenly are not there's no 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.720
 too much maybe my rom coincide with the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.030
 from another channel what I did have some 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.000
 new maybe not others but what's important 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.550
 is that I try to try to give it a 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.130
 different approach teach you more detail 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.580
 and teach how to solve problems that 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.790
 they bring certain roms and not only 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.490
 show what files do you already have 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.440
 I want to show you as much as you can 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.350
 good here that started on the phone 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.350
 we unlocked we enter messages 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.739
 today we come to be written 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.980
 and as you can see, this function has been enabled 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.930
 does not distinguish is like a gear that 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.270
 before there was no good to change the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.490
 keyboard keep tight here in the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.690
 part of scream on sage and meter 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.400
 text input we click and 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.370
 we choose 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.750
 here is going to come out this good you 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.430
 application that I have is called lucky 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.660
 patch and shows how we use 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.880
 use later 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:53.100
 no matter what's important now 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.100
 we continue what we saw 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.600
 we keep tight here 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.070
 and we enter a method of introducing 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.760
 text 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.160
 we choose consumption keyboards 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.090
 goal 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.030
 and the samsung keyboard will not appear or 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.290
 Any case may not appear by default 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.290
 this keyboard 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.400
 maybe you see it this 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.309
 but it does not matter they already know that to take 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.529
 this nail in bouquet here in the gear 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:34.939
 and we chose vertical keyboards and 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:36.740
 we choose keyboard 3 x 4 and good the 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.719
 keyboard can tell you to give you for 4 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.520
 is to enable not only for messages 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.719
 but stop it one time for the 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.909
 application of browsers and other good 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:49.129
