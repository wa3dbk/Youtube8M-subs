middle to scream because it was too low
before<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.290> anyways<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.680> um<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:48.390> would

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
before so anyways with this um it would

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.530 
before so anyways with this um it would
be<00:01:48.600> awesome<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.229> could<00:01:49.259> take<00:01:49.740> halo<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
be awesome if I could take halo for it

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.090 
be awesome if I could take halo for it
but<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.320> not<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> case<00:01:52.770> because

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
but that's just not a case because

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.440 
but that's just not a case because
you're<00:01:53.220> up<00:01:53.340> close<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.909> does<00:01:54.030> shitty

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you're up close and it does shitty

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.200 
you're up close and it does shitty
damage<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.079> you're<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.470> close<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.979> him<00:01:56.210> also

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
damage if you're that close to him also

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.270

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
psyfiend into something else because he

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.740 
psyfiend into something else because he
liked<00:02:04.860> crawls<00:02:05.130> around<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.520> floor<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.180> the

away<00:02:50.970> from<00:02:51.330> your<00:02:51.450> rotation<00:02:51.870> because<00:02:52.019> you'd

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
away from your rotation because you'd

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.830 
away from your rotation because you'd

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
have to use it once every 15 seconds you

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.430 
have to use it once every 15 seconds you
know<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.049> does<00:02:55.200> hit<00:02:55.350> him<00:02:55.470> twice<00:02:55.880> cascade<00:02:56.880> does

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.229 
know it does hit him twice cascade does
about<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.620> much<00:02:58.769> damage<00:02:59.040> as<00:02:59.340> divine<00:02:59.700> starr<00:02:59.970> and

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
it's on a 25 second cooldown so you

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.860 
it's on a 25 second cooldown so you
don't<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.430> use<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:02.880> often<00:03:03.060> as<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> 15

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
don't have to use it as often as a 15

second<00:03:04.260> divine<00:03:04.470> starr<00:03:04.680> that's<00:03:04.980> why<00:03:05.130> i<00:03:05.160> used<00:03:05.400> it

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
second divine starr that's why i used it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.640 
second divine starr that's why i used it
you<00:03:06.239> do<00:03:06.450> want<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.810> use<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.110> because<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.620> a

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
you do want to use it because it is a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.440

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
really think of anything else that this

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.229 
really think of anything else that this
fight<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:15.410> it's<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.650> DPS<00:03:17.040> race<00:03:17.310> with<00:03:18.209> a

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
fight is it's just a DPS race with a

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.910 
fight is it's just a DPS race with a
really<00:03:18.840> annoying<00:03:19.170> maze<00:03:20.040> mechanic<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.829> was

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
really annoying maze mechanic and it was

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.670 
really annoying maze mechanic and it was
only<00:03:23.010> possible<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.760> PTR<00:03:24.090> unless<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.260> just

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
only possible on the PTR unless I just

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.259 
only possible on the PTR unless I just
had<00:03:25.829> amazing<00:03:26.340> gear<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.609> my<00:03:26.760> which<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.209> don't

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
had amazing gear on my which I don't

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.440 
had amazing gear on my which I don't
because<00:03:28.220> we<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.400> like<00:03:29.700> two<00:03:29.880> other<00:03:30.000> majors<00:03:30.329> in

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
because we have like two other majors in

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.880 
because we have like two other majors in
our<00:03:30.540> group<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:30.810> get<00:03:30.930> all<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.140> dps<00:03:31.470> gear<00:03:31.500> that

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
our group we get all the dps gear that

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.910 
our group we get all the dps gear that
drops<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:32.940> really<00:03:33.180> just<00:03:33.420> get<00:03:33.630> leftovers<00:03:34.290> and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
drops so I really just get leftovers and

one<00:03:39.090> last<00:03:39.299> thing<00:03:39.540> at<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> end<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.260> fight

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
one last thing at the end of the fight

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.860 
one last thing at the end of the fight
it<00:03:40.769> appears<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.310> he's<00:03:41.579> kind<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.820> bugged<00:03:42.090> so

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
it appears that he's kind of bugged so

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.110 
it appears that he's kind of bugged so
you<00:03:43.410> just<00:03:43.560> have<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.799> keep<00:03:44.040> spinning<00:03:44.940> in

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
you just have to keep spinning in

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.420 
you just have to keep spinning in
circles<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.840> way<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.380> stupid<00:03:46.859> lines<00:03:47.070> don't

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
circles that way the stupid lines don't

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.000 
circles that way the stupid lines don't
kill<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.850> kill<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.600> even<00:03:49.049> though<00:03:49.320> he's<00:03:49.739> dead

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
kill you kill you even though he's dead

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.400 
kill you kill you even though he's dead
which<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.090> why<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.269> didn't<00:03:51.989> actually<00:03:52.109> get

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
which is why I didn't actually get

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.519 
which is why I didn't actually get
credit<00:03:52.769> for<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:52.950> first<00:03:53.220> kill
