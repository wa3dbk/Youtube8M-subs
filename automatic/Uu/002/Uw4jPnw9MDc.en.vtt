00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.420 
couldn't even imagine how they would
make<00:04:06.660> something<00:04:07.019> like<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.379> usable<00:04:07.919> because

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
make something like that usable because

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.460 
make something like that usable because
there<00:04:08.669> wasn't<00:04:08.959> software<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.109> was<00:04:10.230> really

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
there wasn't software that was really

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.110 
there wasn't software that was really
designed<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.919> take<00:04:11.129> advantage<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.699> that<00:04:11.819> yet

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
designed to take advantage of that yet

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.930 
designed to take advantage of that yet
but<00:04:12.959> now<00:04:13.139> we<00:04:13.530> know<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:14.040> they<00:04:14.190> are<00:04:14.220> building

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
but now we know that they are building

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.089 
but now we know that they are building
the<00:04:15.060> software<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.840> make<00:04:16.019> this<00:04:16.199> work<00:04:16.560> which

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
the software to make this work which

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.490 
the software to make this work which
means<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.760> device<00:04:18.090> in<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.419> category<00:04:19.260> is

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
means that a device in that category is

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.640 
means that a device in that category is
all<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.919> more<00:04:20.099> likely

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
all the more likely

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.730 
all the more likely
but<00:04:21.250> what<00:04:21.459> would<00:04:21.639> that<00:04:21.669> device<00:04:22.210> look<00:04:22.630> like<00:04:22.900> I'm

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
but what would that device look like I'm

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.920 
but what would that device look like I'm
not<00:04:24.130> really<00:04:24.310> sure<00:04:24.669> maybe<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.240> guys<00:04:25.479> have<00:04:25.540> some

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
not really sure maybe you guys have some

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.050 
not really sure maybe you guys have some
ideas<00:04:26.050> with<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:27.009> technology<00:04:27.550> that<00:04:27.669> exists

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
ideas with the technology that exists

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.550 
ideas with the technology that exists
today<00:04:28.090> our<00:04:28.750> guests<00:04:28.990> would<00:04:29.139> be<00:04:29.199> that<00:04:29.440> it<00:04:29.530> would

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
today our guests would be that it would

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.129 
today our guests would be that it would
be<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.949> sub<00:04:30.580> phablet<00:04:31.150> sized<00:04:31.389> or<00:04:31.660> mid-sized

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
be a sub phablet sized or mid-sized

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.770 
be a sub phablet sized or mid-sized
phone<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:33.460> also<00:04:33.669> ships<00:04:34.180> or<00:04:34.360> at<00:04:34.449> least<00:04:34.600> has

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
phone that also ships or at least has

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.260 
phone that also ships or at least has
the<00:04:34.810> option<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.650> shipping<00:04:36.190> with<00:04:36.729> an<00:04:36.910> external

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
the option of shipping with an external

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.540 
the option of shipping with an external
display<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:38.440> might<00:04:38.770> have<00:04:38.979> a<00:04:39.009> keyboard

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
display that might have a keyboard

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.820 
display that might have a keyboard
attached<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.270> as<00:04:40.449> well<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.990> would<00:04:41.620> imagine

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
attached to it as well I would imagine

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.430 
attached to it as well I would imagine
that<00:04:42.100> something<00:04:42.550> around<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.600> same<00:04:43.840> shape<00:04:44.229> and

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
that something around the same shape and

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.040 
that something around the same shape and
size<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.430> current<00:04:46.060> surface<00:04:46.419> maybe<00:04:46.840> the

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
size of a current surface maybe the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.020 
size of a current surface maybe the
surface<00:04:47.410> 3<00:04:47.680> but<00:04:48.130> obviously<00:04:48.550> quite<00:04:48.759> a<00:04:48.820> bit

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
surface 3 but obviously quite a bit

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.909 
surface 3 but obviously quite a bit
thinner<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.389> lighter<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:50.770> have<00:04:50.889> a

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
thinner and lighter so it have a

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.950 
thinner and lighter so it have a
kickstand<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.639> high-resolution<00:04:52.360> display<00:04:52.720> a

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
kickstand a high-resolution display a

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.860 
kickstand a high-resolution display a
very<00:04:53.530> large<00:04:53.949> battery<00:04:54.400> capacity<00:04:55.090> would

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
very large battery capacity would

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.629 
very large battery capacity would
definitely<00:04:56.320> be<00:04:56.470> an<00:04:56.560> option<00:04:56.979> and<00:04:57.190> then

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
definitely be an option and then

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.250 
definitely be an option and then
compatibility<00:04:58.360> with<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.570> current<00:04:59.050> type

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
compatibility with the current type

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.779 
compatibility with the current type
covers<00:04:59.590> would<00:04:59.770> also<00:04:59.949> make<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.280> lot<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.520> sense

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
covers would also make a lot of sense

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.060 
covers would also make a lot of sense
it's<00:05:01.479> also<00:05:01.720> entirely<00:05:02.229> possible<00:05:02.410> that

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
it's also entirely possible that

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.129 
it's also entirely possible that
Microsoft<00:05:03.580> just<00:05:03.850> wants<00:05:04.150> people<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.660> be<00:05:04.990> able

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
Microsoft just wants people to be able

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.510 
Microsoft just wants people to be able
to<00:05:05.199> connect<00:05:05.470> their<00:05:05.620> phones<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.130> whatever

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
to connect their phones to whatever

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.370 
to connect their phones to whatever
displays<00:05:07.060> they<00:05:07.270> have<00:05:07.360> in<00:05:07.479> their<00:05:07.570> house<00:05:07.750> their

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
displays they have in their house their

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.890 
displays they have in their house their
TV<00:05:08.800> or<00:05:09.039> their<00:05:09.220> monitor<00:05:09.669> or<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.539> stream<00:05:10.780> it

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
TV or their monitor or to stream it

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.010 
TV or their monitor or to stream it
wirelessly<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.650> their<00:05:11.800> Xbox<00:05:12.250> one<00:05:12.599> or<00:05:13.599> any

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
wirelessly to their Xbox one or any

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.890 
wirelessly to their Xbox one or any
other<00:05:14.260> miracast<00:05:14.830> enabled<00:05:15.699> display<00:05:16.630> or

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
other miracast enabled display or

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.170 
other miracast enabled display or
adapter<00:05:17.470> so<00:05:18.430> that<00:05:18.550> also<00:05:18.699> could<00:05:19.030> be<00:05:19.060> a

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
adapter so that also could be a

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.120 
adapter so that also could be a
possibility<00:05:19.660> but<00:05:20.289> we<00:05:20.440> think<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:21.039> would

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
possibility but we think that it would

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.060 
possibility but we think that it would
make<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.520> lot<00:05:21.759> more<00:05:21.970> sense<00:05:22.030> for<00:05:22.840> this<00:05:23.050> new<00:05:23.830> piece

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
make a lot more sense for this new piece

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.740 
make a lot more sense for this new piece
of<00:05:24.099> information<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.729> line<00:05:25.030> up<00:05:25.210> with<00:05:25.240> rumours

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
of information to line up with rumours

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.050 
of information to line up with rumours
that<00:05:25.780> we've<00:05:26.050> heard<00:05:26.320> about<00:05:26.610> Microsoft<00:05:27.610> making

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
that we've heard about Microsoft making

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.260 
that we've heard about Microsoft making
a<00:05:28.210> surface<00:05:28.690> phone<00:05:29.199> /<00:05:29.770> laptop<00:05:30.669> hybrid<00:05:31.120> and

a surface phone / laptop hybrid and

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.150 
a surface phone / laptop hybrid and
we're<00:05:31.720> very<00:05:32.020> excited<00:05:32.199> to<00:05:32.530> see<00:05:32.710> something<00:05:33.039> like

we're very excited to see something like

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.310 
we're very excited to see something like
