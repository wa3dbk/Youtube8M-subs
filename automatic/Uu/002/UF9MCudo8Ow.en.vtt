doing is fine Slayers so he said there's
an<00:00:30.869> epic<00:00:31.109> track<00:00:31.380> I'm<00:00:32.329> I'm<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.570> quite<00:00:34.050> sure

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
an epic track I'm I'm not quite sure

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.799 
an epic track I'm I'm not quite sure
that's<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.739> case<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.160> mean<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.420> dirt

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
that's the case I mean it's just dirt

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.690 
that's the case I mean it's just dirt
and<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.200> stops<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:37.860> no<00:00:38.129> powered<00:00:38.489> rails

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and then it stops here no powered rails

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.270 
and then it stops here no powered rails
and<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.899> know<00:00:40.050> his<00:00:40.530> house<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.800> pretty

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
and but you know his house is pretty

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.220 
and but you know his house is pretty
awesome<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.910> oh<00:00:41.940> there's<00:00:42.329> more<00:00:42.510> tracks<00:00:43.020> here

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
awesome so oh there's more tracks here

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.020 
awesome so oh there's more tracks here
so<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:43.890> guessing<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.489> makes<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
so I'm guessing that makes up for it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.490 
so I'm guessing that makes up for it
what<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> say<00:00:45.300> well<00:00:45.629> no<00:00:45.840> damn<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> I've<00:00:46.260> got<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
quick portals on stop what does it say

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.619 
quick portals on stop what does it say

guy's got this guy this looks like it's

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.800 
guy's got this guy this looks like it's
just<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.350> ceiling<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:14.220> he's<00:04:14.459> built<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.420> ceiling

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
just the ceiling so he's built a ceiling

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.420 
just the ceiling so he's built a ceiling
like<00:04:15.959> this<00:04:16.200> with<00:04:16.560> these<00:04:16.709> stone<00:04:16.980> slabs<00:04:17.280> and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
like this with these stone slabs and

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.920 
like this with these stone slabs and
then<00:04:17.520> he<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.790> floor<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.209> going<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.420> be<00:04:18.480> wood<00:04:18.660> so

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
then he the floor is going to be wood so

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.410 
then he the floor is going to be wood so
most<00:04:19.650> people<00:04:19.770> will<00:04:20.010> combine<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.790> floor<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.330> a

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
most people will combine a floor and a

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.670 
most people will combine a floor and a
ceiling<00:04:21.480> all<00:04:21.780> in<00:04:21.930> one<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.140> save<00:04:22.320> them<00:04:22.500> time

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
ceiling all in one and save them time

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.010 
ceiling all in one and save them time
but<00:04:22.979> this<00:04:23.520> guy<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:23.850> guys<00:04:24.240> doing<00:04:24.510> it<00:04:24.600> good<00:04:24.900> and

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
but this guy is guys doing it good and

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.560 
but this guy is guys doing it good and
proper<00:04:25.229> but<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.130> think<00:04:26.310> that's

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
proper but I think that's

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.170 
proper but I think that's
much<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.990> for<00:04:27.200> his<00:04:27.440> house<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.610> he's<00:04:28.820> got<00:04:28.940> more

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
much it for his house so he's got more

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.570 
much it for his house so he's got more
layers<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.110> add<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.770> farm<00:04:31.040> at<00:04:31.220> some<00:04:31.370> point

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
layers to add to the farm at some point

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.030 
layers to add to the farm at some point

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
and if i can remember which way it is to

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.380 
and if i can remember which way it is to
the<00:04:34.130> nearby<00:04:34.340> houses<00:04:34.700> will<00:04:34.970> go<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.090> little<00:04:35.210> fly

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
who owns this at all it just seems to be

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.510 
who owns this at all it just seems to be
like<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.380> collection<00:04:39.770> of<00:04:39.860> farms<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.370> wouldnt

like a collection of farms it wouldnt

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.420 
like a collection of farms it wouldnt
probably<00:04:40.760> find<00:04:40.910> out<00:04:41.060> whose<00:04:41.720> house<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.200> this

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
that's him I'm I don't understand what

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.810 
that's him I'm I don't understand what
the<00:04:48.200> glass<00:04:48.530> panes<00:04:48.890> are<00:04:49.100> oh<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.400> think<00:04:49.610> I

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
the glass panes are oh I think I

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.340 
the glass panes are oh I think I
actually<00:04:49.940> but<00:04:50.450> I<00:04:50.480> think<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.720> can<00:04:50.870> figure<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.260> out

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
actually but I think I can figure it out

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.460 
actually but I think I can figure it out
i've<00:04:51.530> never<00:04:51.710> seen<00:04:51.980> this<00:04:52.100> before<00:04:52.160> but<00:04:52.610> my<00:04:52.910> guess

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
i've never seen this before but my guess

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.470 
i've never seen this before but my guess
and<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:54.590> can<00:04:54.710> tell<00:04:54.890> me<00:04:55.010> if<00:04:55.070> i'm<00:04:55.190> wrong<00:04:55.300> or<00:04:56.300> tell

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
and you can tell me if i'm wrong or tell

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.660 
and you can tell me if i'm wrong or tell
me<00:04:56.540> if<00:04:56.630> I'm<00:04:56.720> right<00:04:56.860> my<00:04:57.860> guess<00:04:58.100> is<00:04:58.130> these<00:04:58.400> glass

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
me if I'm right my guess is these glass

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.290 
me if I'm right my guess is these glass
panes<00:04:59.030> are<00:04:59.360> to<00:04:59.990> stop<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.710> butt<00:05:01.580> well<00:05:02.210> they

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
panes are to stop the butt well they

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.330 
panes are to stop the butt well they
were<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.510> stop<00:05:02.780> big<00:05:03.320> trees<00:05:03.620> like<00:05:03.860> this<00:05:04.070> from

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
were to stop big trees like this from

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.090 
were to stop big trees like this from
growing<00:05:04.610> but<00:05:05.300> clearly<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:06.290> hasn't<00:05:06.500> worked<00:05:06.650> if

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
growing but clearly it hasn't worked if

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.320 
growing but clearly it hasn't worked if
that's<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.370> case<00:05:07.520> clearly<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.030> hasn't

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
that's the case clearly that hasn't

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.410 
that's the case clearly that hasn't
worked<00:05:08.950> this<00:05:09.950> time<00:05:10.010> around<00:05:10.490> maybe<00:05:11.030> just<00:05:11.210> make

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
worked this time around maybe just make

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.110 
worked this time around maybe just make
them<00:05:11.540> a<00:05:11.570> bit<00:05:11.690> lower<00:05:11.930> I<00:05:12.230> don't<00:05:12.860> know<00:05:12.920> and<00:05:13.730> then<00:05:13.880> I

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
them a bit lower I don't know and then I

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.500 
them a bit lower I don't know and then I
