00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
now from practice I know that if I treat

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.570 
now from practice I know that if I treat
these<00:02:35.120> people<00:02:35.360> for<00:02:36.110> food<00:02:36.320> allergies<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.100> clean

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
now the easy way to do that right off

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.270 
now the easy way to do that right off
the<00:02:40.010> top<00:02:40.220> go<00:02:40.610> on<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.820> meat<00:02:41.660> veggies<00:02:42.410> fruit<00:02:42.950> a

there's food allergies there's a yeast
overgrowth<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:35.390> lot<00:03:35.720> of<00:03:35.780> times<00:03:35.930> there's<00:03:36.140> some

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
overgrowth a lot of times there's some

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.710

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.390 
though we don't know what's causing this
one<00:03:47.570> of<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.750> things<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.200> we've<00:03:48.380> has<00:03:49.220> been

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
one of the things that we've has been

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.280 
one of the things that we've has been
postulated<00:03:49.720> because<00:03:50.720> this<00:03:50.870> is<00:03:50.989> an<00:03:51.080> energy

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
postulated because this is an energy

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.560 
postulated because this is an energy
thing<00:03:51.800> I'm<00:03:52.100> gonna<00:03:52.220> make<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.459> big<00:03:52.820> circle<00:03:53.180> here

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
thing I'm gonna make a big circle here

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.870 
thing I'm gonna make a big circle here
okay<00:03:53.900> this<00:03:54.500> circle<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.160> called<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.580> Krebs

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
okay this circle is called the Krebs

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.390 
okay this circle is called the Krebs
cycle<00:03:56.030> it's<00:03:56.810> also<00:03:57.050> called<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.590> TCA<00:03:58.160> cycle

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
cycle it's also called the TCA cycle

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.330 
cycle it's also called the TCA cycle
this<00:03:59.150> is<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.330> chemical<00:03:59.630> reaction<00:04:00.230> starts<00:04:00.980> here

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
this is a chemical reaction starts here

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.300 
this is a chemical reaction starts here
goes<00:04:01.700> around<00:04:02.030> comes<00:04:02.690> up<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.470> in<00:04:03.709> this<00:04:04.010> process

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
goes around comes up so in this process

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.199 
goes around comes up so in this process
glucose<00:04:05.030> comes<00:04:05.390> in<00:04:05.860> right<00:04:06.860> with<00:04:07.430> oxygen

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
glucose comes in right with oxygen

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.729 
glucose comes in right with oxygen
present<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.410> makes<00:04:09.709> your<00:04:10.310> body<00:04:10.519> makes<00:04:10.820> 40

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
present and it makes your body makes 40

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.750 
present and it makes your body makes 40
ATP<00:04:13.000> 40<00:04:14.000> okay<00:04:14.660> but<00:04:15.500> oxygen<00:04:16.010> has<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.310> be<00:04:16.340> present

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
ATP 40 okay but oxygen has to be present

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.289 
ATP 40 okay but oxygen has to be present
Google<00:04:17.420> has<00:04:17.600> Google

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
Google has Google

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.570 
Google has Google
and<00:04:18.419> all<00:04:18.690> these<00:04:19.019> chemicals<00:04:19.739> succinate<00:04:20.669> malate

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and all these chemicals succinate malate

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.950 
and all these chemicals succinate malate
oxaloacetate<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:24.090> variety<00:04:24.599> of<00:04:24.630> different

chemicals in this biochemical pathway

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.969 
chemicals in this biochemical pathway
okay<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.539> all<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.080> enzymes<00:04:28.530> have<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.889> be

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
okay and all the enzymes have to be

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.969 
okay and all the enzymes have to be
present<00:04:29.340> if<00:04:29.520> they<00:04:29.789> aren't<00:04:30.210> all<00:04:30.419> there<00:04:30.979> the

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
present if they aren't all there the

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.300 
present if they aren't all there the
glucose<00:04:32.370> will<00:04:32.400> go<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:33.139> can't<00:04:34.139> use<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:34.770> cycle

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
glucose will go I can't use this cycle

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.129 
glucose will go I can't use this cycle
to<00:04:36.240> make<00:04:36.360> 40<00:04:36.889> ATP<00:04:37.889> which<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.430> body's<00:04:38.699> fuel

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
to make 40 ATP which is the body's fuel

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.120 
to make 40 ATP which is the body's fuel
I'll<00:04:40.139> go<00:04:40.590> over<00:04:40.710> here<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.930> lactic<00:04:43.710> acid

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
I'll go over here to the lactic acid

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.939 
I'll go over here to the lactic acid
cycle<00:04:44.340> or<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:45.090> anaerobic<00:04:46.080> metabolism<00:04:46.229> now

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
cycle or the anaerobic metabolism now

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.249 
cycle or the anaerobic metabolism now
the<00:04:47.009> problem<00:04:47.430> with<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.789> is<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.840> only<00:04:48.990> makes

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
the problem with this is it only makes

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.629 
the problem with this is it only makes
like<00:04:49.470> four<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:50.039> eight<00:04:50.300> ATP<00:04:51.300> per<00:04:51.690> glucose<00:04:52.639> so

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
like four to eight ATP per glucose so

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.230 
like four to eight ATP per glucose so
that's<00:04:53.789> a<00:04:53.909> huge<00:04:54.500> reduction<00:04:55.500> from<00:04:56.159> the<00:04:56.250> Krebs

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
that's a huge reduction from the Krebs

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.080 
that's a huge reduction from the Krebs
cycle<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:58.289> problem<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.710> if<00:04:58.919> there's<00:04:59.460> oxygen

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
cycle the problem is if there's oxygen

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.939 
cycle the problem is if there's oxygen
there's<00:05:00.479> not<00:05:00.599> one<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:00.900> chemicals<00:05:01.349> it<00:05:01.440> has<00:05:01.800> to

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
there's not one is chemicals it has to

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.189 
there's not one is chemicals it has to
go<00:05:02.069> there<00:05:02.220> also<00:05:02.849> the<00:05:03.120> problem<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.569> now<00:05:03.990> there's

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
go there also the problem is now there's

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.409 
go there also the problem is now there's

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
pushing the limits well you know will

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.600 
pushing the limits well you know will
increase<00:05:46.530> some<00:05:46.710> of<00:05:46.800> your<00:05:46.889> pain<00:05:47.099> either<00:05:47.250> today

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
increase some of your pain either today

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.570 
increase some of your pain either today
or<00:05:47.639> tomorrow<00:05:47.819> right<00:05:48.599> so<00:05:49.199> if<00:05:49.440> you<00:05:49.590> stay<00:05:50.130> clear

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580
