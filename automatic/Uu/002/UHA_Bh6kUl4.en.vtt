now<00:03:15.410> let's<00:03:15.590> analyze<00:03:15.740> the<00:03:16.160> two<00:03:16.310> files<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:17.540> can

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
now let's analyze the two files you can

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.090 
now let's analyze the two files you can
immediately<00:03:17.930> see<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.620> there's<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:18.860> big

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
immediately see that there's a big

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.710 
immediately see that there's a big
difference<00:03:19.460> in<00:03:19.580> speed<00:03:19.880> at<00:03:20.120> one<00:03:20.270> section<00:03:20.630> of

the track towards the end of the lap the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.790 
the track towards the end of the lap the
second<00:03:23.570> driver<00:03:23.750> in<00:03:23.990> this<00:03:24.110> instance<00:03:24.530> was<00:03:24.770> a

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
second driver in this instance was a

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.620 
second driver in this instance was a
professional<00:03:25.370> racing<00:03:25.550> driver<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.180> his

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
professional racing driver and his

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.230 
professional racing driver and his
qualifying<00:03:27.050> lap<00:03:27.290> time<00:03:27.500> was<00:03:27.670> 3.77<00:03:28.670> seconds

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
qualifying lap time was 3.77 seconds

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.150 
qualifying lap time was 3.77 seconds
quicker<00:03:29.510> than<00:03:29.660> his<00:03:29.720> teammate<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.800> let's<00:03:30.980> work

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
quicker than his teammate so let's work

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.940 
quicker than his teammate so let's work
out<00:03:31.400> exactly<00:03:32.000> how<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.240> was<00:03:32.570> achieved<00:03:32.950> this

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
out exactly how that was achieved this

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.710 
out exactly how that was achieved this
time<00:03:34.220> we'll<00:03:34.550> display<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:35.000> split<00:03:35.240> times<00:03:35.480> to

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
we have six sectors and you can see

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.619 
we have six sectors and you can see

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
that is the largest area for improvement

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.320 
that is the largest area for improvement
what<00:05:34.450> about<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:34.810> rest<00:05:34.990> of<00:05:35.140> the<00:05:35.230> lap<00:05:36.330> let's

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
what about the rest of the lap let's

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.120 
what about the rest of the lap let's
examine<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.840> whole<00:05:38.020> lap<00:05:38.290> by<00:05:38.560> clicking<00:05:38.920> on<00:05:39.040> the

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
examine the whole lap by clicking on the

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.280 
examine the whole lap by clicking on the
lap<00:05:39.250> time<00:05:39.490> rather<00:05:39.910> than<00:05:40.060> an<00:05:40.360> individual<00:05:40.990> split

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
lap time rather than an individual split

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.220 
lap time rather than an individual split
time<00:05:41.730> now<00:05:42.730> you<00:05:42.790> can<00:05:42.880> see<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.300> Delta<00:05:43.450> t<00:05:43.840> channel

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
time now you can see the Delta t channel

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.900 
time now you can see the Delta t channel
showing<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.680> gradual<00:05:45.070> time<00:05:45.280> loss<00:05:45.490> throughout

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
showing a gradual time loss throughout

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.610 
showing a gradual time loss throughout
the<00:05:46.090> lap<00:05:46.270> before<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:46.870> larger<00:05:47.290> difference

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
the lap before the larger difference

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.680 
the lap before the larger difference
near<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.950> end<00:05:48.160> of<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.400> lap<00:05:48.520> let's<00:05:49.510> pick<00:05:49.660> a

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
near the end of the lap let's pick a

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.420 
near the end of the lap let's pick a
high<00:05:49.870> speed<00:05:50.140> corner<00:05:50.470> and<00:05:50.620> see<00:05:50.770> exactly<00:05:51.190> what

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
high speed corner and see exactly what

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.700 
high speed corner and see exactly what
he's<00:05:51.520> going<00:05:51.820> on<00:05:52.020> by<00:05:53.020> looking<00:05:53.290> carefully<00:05:53.530> at

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
he's going on by looking carefully at

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.470 
he's going on by looking carefully at
the<00:05:53.800> video<00:05:54.040> you<00:05:54.310> can<00:05:54.610> see<00:05:54.820> that<00:05:54.970> the<00:05:55.060> faster

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
the video you can see that the faster

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.360 
the video you can see that the faster
driver<00:05:55.690> is<00:05:56.110> using<00:05:56.440> a<00:05:56.500> little<00:05:56.710> bit<00:05:56.890> more<00:05:57.100> curve

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
driver is using a little bit more curve

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.400 
driver is using a little bit more curve
than<00:05:57.580> his<00:05:57.700> teammate<00:05:58.020> compare<00:05:59.020> where<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.290> edge

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
than his teammate compare where the edge

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.350 
than his teammate compare where the edge
of<00:05:59.560> the<00:05:59.620> track<00:05:59.830> meets<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.190> bonnet<00:06:00.460> this<00:06:01.210> is

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
of the track meets the bonnet this is

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.180 
of the track meets the bonnet this is
probably<00:06:01.630> easiest<00:06:01.990> in<00:06:02.140> full-screen<00:06:02.530> video<00:06:02.890> so

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
probably easiest in full-screen video so

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.320 
probably easiest in full-screen video so
we'll<00:06:03.340> press<00:06:03.550> f5<00:06:03.910> again<00:06:05.880> going<00:06:06.880> back<00:06:07.000> to<00:06:07.240> the

we'll press f5 again going back to the

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.540 
we'll press f5 again going back to the
graph<00:06:07.570> you<00:06:08.140> can<00:06:08.260> just<00:06:08.590> see<00:06:08.770> that<00:06:09.160> this<00:06:09.280> allows

up<00:06:24.380> you<00:06:24.919> get<00:06:25.039> the<00:06:25.160> remaining<00:06:25.490> time<00:06:25.880> which<00:06:26.090> has
