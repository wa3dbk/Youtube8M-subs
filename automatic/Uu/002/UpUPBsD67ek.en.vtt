know<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.560> expected<00:01:17.310> heat<00:01:17.430> wave<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.759> right

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
know the expected heat wave and right

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
know the expected heat wave and right
here<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.570> thought<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.259> switch<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.860> slowbro<00:01:20.250> was

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
here I thought the switch to slowbro was

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
here I thought the switch to slowbro was
a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.030> too<00:01:21.240> obvious<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.990> went<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
a little bit too obvious so I went to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200 
a little bit too obvious so I went to
sand<00:01:22.409> /<00:01:22.650> bitching<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.070> fusion<00:01:23.759> bold<00:01:23.939> move

sand / bitching that fusion bold move
the<00:01:24.600> electric<00:01:24.990> type<00:01:25.140> move<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.590> what

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the electric type move I don't know what

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.480 
the electric type move I don't know what
it's<00:01:25.830> called<00:01:26.240> Victini<00:01:27.240> often<00:01:27.750> carries<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's called Victini often carries and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.560 
it's called Victini often carries and
because<00:01:29.490> he<00:01:29.520> doesn't<00:01:29.700> set<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> trick<00:01:30.299> room<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
because he doesn't set up a trick room I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.380 
because he doesn't set up a trick room I
know<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.840> he<00:01:30.900> scarfed<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.820> second<00:01:33.270> be

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
seed comes like in which actually turns

out<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.759> light<00:02:00.000> screen<00:02:00.270> was<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.719> best<00:02:00.990> play

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
out to so light screen was the best play

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.469 
out to so light screen was the best play
either<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.590> switch<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.969> didn't

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
either that or switch out I didn't

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.429 
either that or switch out I didn't
really<00:02:03.630> want<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> switch<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.290> know

really want to switch out I don't know

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.850 
really want to switch out I don't know
why<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.960> right<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.200> go<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.530> slack<00:02:07.680> off

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
why so right here we go for slack off

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.080 
why so right here we go for slack off
because<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.220> doesn't<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.640> regenerator

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
because this doesn't have regenerator

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.960 
because this doesn't have regenerator
because<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.569> band<00:02:10.410> dreamworld<00:02:11.069> abilities<00:02:11.849> on

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
because I band dreamworld abilities on

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.410 
because I band dreamworld abilities on
my<00:02:12.120> team<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.690> own

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
my team on my own

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.140 
my team on my own
anyways<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.560> he's<00:02:15.340> he<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:15.730> sensible<00:02:15.970> each

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
anyways so he's he just sensible each

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.880 
anyways so he's he just sensible each
seed<00:02:16.390> which<00:02:16.599> that's<00:02:16.959> what<00:02:17.170> Pharisee<00:02:17.590> does

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
seed which that's what Pharisee does

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.220 
seed which that's what Pharisee does
he's<00:02:18.790> probably<00:02:18.910> got<00:02:19.150> evo<00:02:19.480> light<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.959> he<00:02:20.080> needs

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
he's probably got evo light so he needs

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.490 
he's probably got evo light so he needs
some<00:02:20.440> kind<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.739> recovery<00:02:21.250> at<00:02:21.400> some<00:02:21.640> point<00:02:21.849> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
some kind of recovery at some point and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.750 
some kind of recovery at some point and
i'm<00:02:23.500> going<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.800> send<00:02:23.980> out<00:02:24.069> my<00:02:24.190> stand<00:02:24.400> /<00:02:24.580> now

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
i'm going to send out my stand / now

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.800 
i'm going to send out my stand / now
pretty<00:02:24.970> much<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.390> die<00:02:26.010> because<00:02:27.810> that's

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
pretty much just the die because that's

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.120 
pretty much just the die because that's
premature<00:02:29.080> only<00:02:29.349> chance<00:02:29.560> like<00:02:29.739> i<00:02:29.830> could<00:02:30.010> have

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
premature only chance like i could have

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.800 
premature only chance like i could have
maybe<00:02:30.340> rapid<00:02:30.760> span<00:02:31.000> but<00:02:31.480> that's<00:02:31.630> about<00:02:31.750> it

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
maybe rapid span but that's about it

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.660 
maybe rapid span but that's about it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
know at this point I'd had no idea he

know at this point I'd had no idea he
was<00:03:47.950> scarfed<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.549> I<00:03:48.820> figured<00:03:49.180> well<00:03:49.209> if<00:03:49.540> he<00:03:49.660> is

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
was scarfed and I figured well if he is

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.420 
was scarfed and I figured well if he is
scarf<00:03:50.049> but<00:03:50.230> I<00:03:50.320> might<00:03:50.530> be<00:03:50.680> faster<00:03:50.980> effort<00:03:51.190> after

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
scarf but I might be faster effort after

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.099 
scarf but I might be faster effort after
one<00:03:51.790> dragon<00:03:52.120> dance<00:03:52.269> cuz<00:03:52.450> i<00:03:52.510> have<00:03:52.600> no<00:03:52.720> idea<00:03:52.989> how

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
one dragon dance cuz i have no idea how

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.259

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
fast these things are and i am max speed

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.490 
fast these things are and i am max speed
jolly<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.459> figured<00:03:57.459> well<00:03:57.609> I<00:03:58.170> I'm<00:03:59.170> screwed

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
jolly so I figured well I I'm screwed

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.009 
jolly so I figured well I I'm screwed
either<00:03:59.739> way<00:03:59.829> so<00:03:59.980> i<00:04:00.489> guess<00:04:01.269> i<00:04:01.359> could<00:04:01.450> i<00:04:01.720> could

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
either way so i guess i could i could

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.140 
either way so i guess i could i could
have<00:04:02.109> went<00:04:02.230> for<00:04:02.440> like<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:03.430> know<00:04:03.459> at<00:04:03.790> touhy
