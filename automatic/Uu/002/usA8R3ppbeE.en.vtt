 per kirkeby 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.090
 geological studies is a man who has an extremadura con tura 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.669
 that covers from the knowledge of the natures 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.919
 until 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.219
 the most complex art expressions 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.419
 as an artist he has dedicated 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.659
 to painting to sculpture 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.989
 novels 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.480
 poems 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.699
 essays 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.500
 he makes movies he also makes scenographies 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.360
 when he was younger he made 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.610
 a series 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.660
 d performances 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.399
 all this makes his work 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.380
 it will be complex 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.780
 difficult perhaps to assimilate impossible in any case to pigeonhole in the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020
 usual categories 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.450
 additional photo 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.080
 on the occasion of resignation 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.700
 of the sculpture that has made the plan that his permanent sculpture is 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.080
 he thought about making this exhibition to those who give 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.350
 i due to the complexity and the variety of the time of kirkeby the own 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.860
 artist proposed us to show one of the series of his work these poor what 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.450
 is a the masonic paintings more net a conglomerate of wood 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.450
 he has been doing these works since the year 77 and there are edward works and of all 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.550
 the years not the sense that this series is born in this context 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.140
 first is the regularity of these works that are all exactly the same 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.480
 122% format 22 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.350
 regularity in front of an irregular space and a space 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.920
 a little mind with 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.220
 these works are like a sort of notebook alphabet in which 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.650
 write your reasons 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.030
 since he always uses reasons that are repeated and that accumulate 1 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.110
 after another 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 The other part 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.470
 of the exhibition consists of a collection 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.569
 33% 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.920
 in small bronze models that represent the shape 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.030
 of some of the large sculptures who previously 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.859
 has made in brick 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:19.400
 it's not about work models, it's not about 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.230
 d present their ideas through other material and on another scale 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.119
 with different 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.519
 in what interested him more there 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.029
 they are also aspects of texture 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.159
 per cent to spread them and lion 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.159
 d the way 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.889
 in the valley of is there we have 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:57.239
 an oberÃ¡ in brick a work in addition as much and forceful as for the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.379
 shapes and volumes 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.619
 made with a single material the brick 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.390
 that configured walls 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.260
 le havre 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.159
 doors 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.289
 and windows 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:09.639
 and that encloses 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.669
 a space that is kind of like 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:17.299
 of condenser of country ag that is around him 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:24.369
 I believe that the traveler who is able to get there who was comforted 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:28.359
 for this union between art and nature
