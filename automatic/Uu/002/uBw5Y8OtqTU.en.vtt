00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.989
 hello everyone i am from you class 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:12.900
 this is the presentation of the shoe and 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:15.059
 jordan eleven who does not know the jordan 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.910
 11 well in the end who knows michael 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.560
 jordan knows that shoe is journal 11 la 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.390
 the first thing that comes to mind is the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.609
 license and air or this skin 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.130
 glossy that has been inserted for the first 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.039
 time on this journal udc da 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.259
 think art designer before nike i brands 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.230
 and then of jordan brand and we leave immediately 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.250
 with the one that the technical presentation 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 starting as always from amortization 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.160
 in this area 11 we have a full house 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.500
 length is gathered or joined to all 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.719
 length of area inserted in the inter 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.149
 this gives us good protection 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.879
 from the impacts maybe a poor one 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.590
 reactivity alone then we'll see what comes 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.359
 added another item that will give 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 that reactivity that is lacking for how long 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.210
 it concerns the materials as I already have 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.600
 said there is this leather license that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.850
 surrounds all the shoe is the element 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.439
 characteristic at the end of this 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.140
 jordan 11 and emitted both as a touch 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.090
 aesthetic but also born to give more 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.080
 shoe support in movements 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.570
 lateral 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.549
 the rest of the upper is made from 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.840
 blue in this color in the law 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.189
 from skin from normal and balistic skin 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.380
 match that the other material 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.659
 characteristic of jordan 11 only 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.700
 on the tongue in other colors 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.610
 like the brÃ¨de the concord and I think 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.920
 we also have the balistic space jam 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.079
 match and in all the upper excluded 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.090
 obviously the homeland and it is for how much 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.469
 regards the fit the shoe dresses true 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.140
 to site then went quietly 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.070
 with the size you normally wear 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.829
 regularly 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.479
 regarding the support here in 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.729
 this shoe is more abundant is 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.909
 definitely better at the level of 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.219
 of the midsole since we have this 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.740
 spring flat this fiber dish of 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.229
 carbon that covers almost all of it 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.429
 the sole that is put both for 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.720
 protection therefore to the prevailing torsion 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.729
 for protection of twists that 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.890
 could be harmful both to 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.560
 arch support that is a lot 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.900
 very accentuated and as I said 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.329
 first to give that responsiveness e 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.549
 the spring back that is missing in the is 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:34.400
 assembled in the inserted air unit 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:35.690
 to inter sole as considerations 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.579
 final 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.950
 tinker maybin shine michael maiden 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.959
 never damp chronic flight as it also says 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.470
 this sentence which is written on the box of the 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.870
 day to 11 is the most iconic shoe 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.450
 always used in michael jordan 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.180
 remains very very good at the level of 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.280
 performance therefore at a technical level and 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.560
 super used even nowadays 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.989
 and therefore you can use it despite being one 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.760
 one day a retro has a good one 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.400
 cushioning therefore protection from 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.290
 impacts good support even if the pad 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.690
 slider at a moment disappointed expectations 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.079
 still when it came out it holds anyway 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.030
 also good in lateral movements and how 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.819
 I told you it was used a lot too 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.340
 from Italian players in the air including 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.950
 alessandro gentile who wears jordan 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.230
 brand and very often has used them 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.239
 all the top this year and already has 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.099
 also used this coloration of the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.290
 blue law as always I thank you 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.379

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.530
