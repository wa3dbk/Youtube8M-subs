00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
this amplifier and the standard imperial

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.330 
this amplifier and the standard imperial
and<00:00:33.450> yes<00:00:34.110> Marc's<00:00:34.470> been<00:00:34.560> building<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.100> amp

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
and yes Marc's been building this amp

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.970 
and yes Marc's been building this amp
for<00:00:35.520> 20<00:00:35.850> years<00:00:36.150> so<00:00:36.720> it's<00:00:37.350> been<00:00:37.410> around<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.800> long

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
for 20 years so it's been around a long

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.450 
for 20 years so it's been around a long
time<00:00:39.050> this<00:00:40.050> amplifier<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.830> totally<00:00:41.220> hand

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
time this amplifier is totally hand

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.210 
time this amplifier is totally hand
wired<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:42.480> had<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.020> lot<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.410> people<00:00:43.650> asking<00:00:44.070> for

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
wired we had a lot of people asking for

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.940 
wired we had a lot of people asking for
a<00:00:44.250> hand<00:00:44.520> wired<00:00:44.730> circuit<00:00:45.330> so<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.410> hand

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
a hand wired circuit so this is a hand

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.430 
a hand wired circuit so this is a hand
wired<00:00:47.160> circuit<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.030> does<00:00:48.690> also<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
wired circuit it does also have the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.530 
wired circuit it does also have the
attenuator<00:00:49.980> built<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.150> back<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
attenuator built in to the back and

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.000 
attenuator built in to the back and
we'll<00:00:51.630> demonstrate<00:00:51.810> that<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.560> in<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
we'll demonstrate that here in just a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.160 
we'll demonstrate that here in just a
minute<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.490> far<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> front<00:00:54.750> section<00:00:55.110> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
minute as far as the front section of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.630 
minute as far as the front section of
the<00:00:55.230> amplifier<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:55.980> pretty<00:00:56.190> straight<00:00:56.490> ahead

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the amplifier it's pretty straight ahead

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.810 
the amplifier it's pretty straight ahead
in<00:00:57.000> tradition<00:00:57.480> traditional<00:00:58.820> chunking

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
in tradition traditional chunking

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.330 
in tradition traditional chunking
fashion<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.140> 20<00:01:01.920> watt<00:01:01.950> amplifier

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
fashion so this is a 20 watt amplifier

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:24.160 
fashion so this is a 20 watt amplifier
with<00:01:02.900> two<00:01:03.900> 6v<00:01:04.530> sixes

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.450 

we've<00:01:25.170> got<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> reverb<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:25.890> quite<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.190> bit

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
we've got the reverb up quite a bit

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.390 
we've got the reverb up quite a bit
there<00:01:26.700> again<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.650> nice<00:01:28.890> smooth

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
there again it's just really nice smooth

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.220 
there again it's just really nice smooth
clean<00:01:29.670> tones

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
clean tones

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.140 
clean tones
let's<00:01:31.770> hit<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.460> lead<00:01:32.640> channel<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.120> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
let's hit the the lead channel here a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.760 
let's hit the the lead channel here a
little<00:01:33.330> bit<00:01:33.480> without<00:01:33.890> any<00:01:35.870> effects<00:01:36.870> or<00:01:37.140> pedals

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
little bit without any effects or pedals

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
little bit without any effects or pedals
on<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.310> what<00:01:38.760> you've<00:01:38.910> got<00:01:38.940> here<00:01:39.300> with<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
on it and what you've got here with the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
on it and what you've got here with the
mid<00:01:39.720> bite<00:01:40.020> control<00:01:40.500> you've<00:01:40.680> got<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> broad

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
mid bite control you've got a broad

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.330 
mid bite control you've got a broad
range<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.110> affect<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.650> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
range that you can affect the the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.180 
range that you can affect the the
channel<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:46.500> anywhere<00:01:46.770> from

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
channel with and go anywhere from

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.570 
channel with and go anywhere from
traditional<00:01:48.590> American<00:01:49.590> style<00:01:49.830> amplifiers<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
traditional American style amplifiers to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:02:42.960 
traditional American style amplifiers to
to<00:01:51.240> an<00:01:51.390> English<00:01:51.720> style<00:01:51.930> amplifier<00:01:52.500> so

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.640 

that's<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.780> lead<00:02:43.990> channel<00:02:44.320> on<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
that's the lead channel on the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.710 
that's the lead channel on the
employment<00:02:45.040> now<00:02:45.400> go<00:02:45.640> back<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.210> rhythm<00:02:46.570> and

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
employment now go back to the rhythm and

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.260 
employment now go back to the rhythm and
we'll<00:02:46.870> demonstrate<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.950> tremolo<00:02:48.280> again<00:02:49.150> this

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
we'll demonstrate the tremolo again this

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.570 
we'll demonstrate the tremolo again this
is<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.480> bias<00:02:49.780> controlled<00:02:50.470> tremolo<00:02:51.040> as<00:02:51.250> opposed

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
is a bias controlled tremolo as opposed

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.220 
is a bias controlled tremolo as opposed
to<00:02:51.790> an<00:02:51.940> occupation<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:54.130> gives<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.460> a<00:02:54.490> wider

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
to an occupation it gives you a wider

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.470 
to an occupation it gives you a wider
depth<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.610> broader<00:02:57.910> range<00:02:58.240> of

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
depth and and just a broader range of

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:21.280 
depth and and just a broader range of
tremolo<00:02:58.840> all<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.170> way<00:02:59.260> across<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.740> board
