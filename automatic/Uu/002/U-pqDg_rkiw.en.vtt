settings going to go back into look and
feel<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.390> now<00:03:24.870> we're<00:03:24.990> gonna<00:03:25.080> go<00:03:25.200> into<00:03:25.440> layout

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
feel and now we're gonna go into layout

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.220 
feel and now we're gonna go into layout
now<00:03:26.550> if<00:03:26.700> this<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> first<00:03:27.360> time<00:03:27.600> using<00:03:27.990> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
now if this is the first time using the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.690 
now if this is the first time using the
layouts<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.710> should<00:03:29.070> look<00:03:29.220> pretty<00:03:29.280> much<00:03:29.640> like

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
layouts it should look pretty much like

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.580 
layouts it should look pretty much like
this<00:03:30.180> has<00:03:30.360> got<00:03:30.510> your<00:03:30.600> custom<00:03:30.960> ciders<00:03:31.320> over

this has got your custom ciders over

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.660 
this has got your custom ciders over
here<00:03:31.740> at<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:31.920> bottom<00:03:32.070> as<00:03:32.370> well<00:03:32.430> as

drag this to the bottom like that and
then<00:03:37.950> take<00:03:38.220> off<00:03:38.430> automatically<00:03:39.030> determine

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
then take off automatically determine

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.080 
then take off automatically determine
grid<00:03:39.750> size<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:40.650> will<00:03:40.800> not<00:03:40.980> allow<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.670> to

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
grid size this will not allow you to

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.730 
grid size this will not allow you to
pretty<00:03:42.390> much<00:03:42.480> change<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.930> grid<00:03:43.080> size<00:03:43.260> at<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
pretty much change the grid size at the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.650 
pretty much change the grid size at the
world<00:03:43.980> now<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.580> grid<00:03:44.910> size<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.300> pretty<00:03:45.450> much

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
world now this grid size is pretty much

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.690 
world now this grid size is pretty much
the<00:03:45.720> same<00:03:45.930> as<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.440> launch<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:47.010> grid<00:03:47.220> size<00:03:47.430> it

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
the same as a launch a grid size it

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.390 
the same as a launch a grid size it
determines<00:03:48.270> how<00:03:49.050> many<00:03:49.500> rows<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.010> columns

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
determines how many rows and columns

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.460 
determines how many rows and columns
you're<00:03:50.550> gonna<00:03:50.670> have<00:03:50.940> for<00:03:51.480> your<00:03:51.660> lock<00:03:52.440> screen

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
you're gonna have for your lock screen

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.040 
you're gonna have for your lock screen
so<00:03:53.040> I'll<00:03:53.220> go<00:03:53.400> for<00:03:53.580> ten<00:03:53.850> by<00:03:54.000> eight<00:03:54.210> just<00:03:54.720> because

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
so I'll go for ten by eight just because

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.500 
so I'll go for ten by eight just because
it's<00:03:55.350> quite<00:03:55.730> large<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.060> allows<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.480> just

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
it's quite large and allows you just

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.420 
it's quite large and allows you just
pretty<00:03:57.870> much<00:03:57.990> for<00:03:58.290> more<00:03:58.440> freedom<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.100> moving

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
pretty much for more freedom of moving

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.120

the uccw widgets around and remember
just<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> go<00:04:02.490> save<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.270> will<00:04:03.390> save<00:04:03.720> that

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
just to go save and it will save that

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.690 
just to go save and it will save that
setting<00:04:04.440> for<00:04:04.740> you<00:04:04.860> now<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.520> is<00:04:05.580> just

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700

I<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.209> personally<00:04:12.660> like<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.320> hidden

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
I just personally like to have it hidden

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.949 
I just personally like to have it hidden
but<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.610> doesn't<00:04:14.730> actually<00:04:15.030> mean<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.510> it

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
but that doesn't actually mean that it

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.710 
but that doesn't actually mean that it
is<00:04:16.109> disabled<00:04:17.010> if<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.820> do<00:04:17.970> want<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.239> disable<00:04:18.510> it

you want to go into buttons and inputs

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.770 
you want to go into buttons and inputs
