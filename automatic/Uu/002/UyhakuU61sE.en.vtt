00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.020 
lane departure warning system and it has
smart<00:02:27.230> key<00:02:27.350> access<00:02:27.380> I'm<00:02:28.010> not<00:02:28.160> really<00:02:28.280> sure<00:02:28.550> I'm

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
smart key access I'm not really sure I'm

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.130

afraid<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.420> touch<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.600> because<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.959> alarm

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
afraid to touch it because the alarm

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.860 
afraid to touch it because the alarm
might<00:02:30.410> go<00:02:30.530> off<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.120> think<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.390> see<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.660> keys

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
might go off and I think I see the keys

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.960 
might go off and I think I see the keys
in<00:02:33.080> there<00:02:33.260> which<00:02:34.160> if<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.400> could<00:02:34.550> get<00:02:34.670> into<00:02:34.880> this

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
in there which if I could get into this

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.360 
in there which if I could get into this
whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo<00:02:35.959> I'll<00:02:36.620> be<00:02:36.890> there<00:02:37.069> at<00:02:37.250> the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo I'll be there at the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.160 
whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo I'll be there at the
camper<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.720> can<00:02:38.840> see<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.050> does<00:02:39.140> have

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
camper but you can see it does have

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.920 
camper but you can see it does have
push-button<00:02:39.620> start<00:02:39.830> now<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.880> red<00:02:41.360> button<00:02:41.720> I

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
push-button start now the red button I

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.180 
push-button start now the red button I
guess<00:02:42.769> that's<00:02:42.950> kind<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.100> a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
guess that's kind of a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.030 
guess that's kind of a
take-it-or-leave-it<00:02:43.400> kinda<00:02:44.030> sticks<00:02:44.209> out<00:02:44.390> but

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
take-it-or-leave-it kinda sticks out but

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.070 
take-it-or-leave-it kinda sticks out but
it's<00:02:46.040> kind<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.640> powerful<00:02:47.120> looking<00:02:47.660> if<00:02:47.870> you

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
it's kind of powerful looking if you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.009 
it's kind of powerful looking if you
will<00:02:49.120> but<00:02:50.120> anyways<00:02:50.390> that's<00:02:50.569> really<00:02:50.870> pretty
