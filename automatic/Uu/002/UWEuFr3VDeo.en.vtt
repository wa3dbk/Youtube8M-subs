00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
this is the battery that's the optical

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.140 
this is the battery that's the optical
drive<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:31.010> is<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.310> hard<00:01:31.490> drive<00:01:31.580> but

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
drive and this is the hard drive but

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.580 
drive and this is the hard drive but
what<00:01:32.360> we're<00:01:32.510> focusing<00:01:33.020> on<00:01:33.140> here<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.410> this

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
which is the ram ports so what you're

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.450 
which is the ram ports so what you're
going<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.260> do<00:01:36.410> is<00:01:36.650> you're<00:01:36.830> going<00:01:37.010> to<00:01:37.220> pull<00:01:37.430> out

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
going to do is you're going to pull out

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.550 
going to do is you're going to pull out
on<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.150> two<00:01:38.300> tabs<00:01:38.570> at<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.869> same<00:01:39.080> time<00:01:39.290> and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
on the two tabs at the same time and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.880 
on the two tabs at the same time and
remove<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.820> top<00:01:41.119> portion<00:01:41.960> of<00:01:42.260> ram<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.710> then

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
remove the top portion of ram and then

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.330 
remove the top portion of ram and then
you're<00:01:43.040> going<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.250> do<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.550> same<00:01:44.380> until<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
you're going to do the same until the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.920 
you're going to do the same until the
bottom<00:01:46.610> portion<00:01:46.759> of<00:01:47.000> ram<00:01:47.119> comes<00:01:47.390> up<00:01:47.600> now<00:01:47.780> this

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
bottom portion of ram comes up now this

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.570 
bottom portion of ram comes up now this
one's<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.229> little<00:01:48.470> bit<00:01:48.680> trickier<00:01:49.040> than<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.369> top

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
one's a little bit trickier than the top

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.660 
one's a little bit trickier than the top
portion<00:01:49.850> however<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:52.070> will<00:01:52.190> get<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.490> done

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
portion however you will get it done

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.460 
portion however you will get it done
don't<00:01:52.970> force<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.510> it<00:01:53.750> looks<00:01:53.990> like<00:01:54.080> I'm<00:01:54.290> forcing

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
don't force it it looks like I'm forcing

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.900 
don't force it it looks like I'm forcing
it<00:01:54.710> here<00:01:54.860> but<00:01:55.010> I'm<00:01:55.100> definitely<00:01:55.250> not<00:01:55.550> forcing

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
it here but I'm definitely not forcing

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.220 
it here but I'm definitely not forcing
it<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.120> didn't<00:01:56.330> want<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.510> break<00:01:56.630> anything<00:01:56.930> so

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
it I didn't want to break anything so

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.030 
it I didn't want to break anything so
you're<00:01:57.350> just<00:01:57.410> going<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.680> pull<00:01:57.800> them<00:01:57.950> apart

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
you're just going to pull them apart

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.370 
you're just going to pull them apart
very<00:01:58.460> fast<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.120> that<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.720> bottom<00:01:59.840> portion<00:02:00.290> of

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
very fast so that the bottom portion of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
very fast so that the bottom portion of
ram<00:02:00.590> does<00:02:00.860> come<00:02:01.100> out

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 

so<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.289> can<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:04.560> i<00:02:04.590> purchased<00:02:05.250> the

this brand of RAM works quite well and
it<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.420> used<00:02:15.690> for<00:02:15.780> my<00:02:15.930> 8

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230

what<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.260> check<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> gold<00:02:23.069> connector

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
what I do is I check the gold connector

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.770 
what I do is I check the gold connector
plates<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.970> see<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.300> they<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.420> anything

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
plates to see that they have anything

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.509 
plates to see that they have anything
not<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.230> them<00:02:25.470> because<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.800> last<00:02:25.980> time<00:02:26.160> I

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
not on them because the last time I

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.160 
not on them because the last time I
installed<00:02:26.879> some<00:02:26.970> ram<00:02:27.300> there<00:02:27.629> was<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> tiny

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
installed some ram there was just a tiny

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.550 
installed some ram there was just a tiny
speck<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.890> glue<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.549> it<00:02:30.480> messed<00:02:31.260> up<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> whole

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
speck of glue and it messed up the whole

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.900 
speck of glue and it messed up the whole
process<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.400> i'll<00:02:32.489> tell<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.730> more<00:02:32.849> about

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
process but i'll tell you more about

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.670 
process but i'll tell you more about
that<00:02:33.090> later<00:02:33.269> so<00:02:34.170> what<00:02:34.260> you're<00:02:34.349> going<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.590> is

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
that later so what you're going to do is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.580 
that later so what you're going to do is
line<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:34.950> up<00:02:35.129> with<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.400> bottom<00:02:36.110> port<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.319> the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
line it up with the bottom port of the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.530 
line it up with the bottom port of the
connection<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.700> you're<00:02:38.940> going<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.150> slide<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
connection and you're going to slide it

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.600 
connection and you're going to slide it
in<00:02:39.810> make<00:02:40.019> sure<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.319> fits<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.769> snugly<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.400> then

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
in make sure it fits in snugly and then

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.470 
in make sure it fits in snugly and then
what<00:02:41.760> you're<00:02:41.849> going<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.030> do<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.299> you're<00:02:42.360> going

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.509 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:02:42.569> push<00:02:42.720> down<00:02:42.750> evenly<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.709> both<00:02:43.739> sides<00:02:44.220> until

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
to push down evenly on both sides until

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.490 
to push down evenly on both sides until
you<00:02:44.819> hear<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> satisfying<00:02:45.720> click<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.260> that's

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
you hear a satisfying click and that's

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.309 
you hear a satisfying click and that's
when<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.829> know<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.579> is<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:47.880> securely<00:02:48.319> now

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
when you know that it is in securely now

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.839 
when you know that it is in securely now
you're<00:02:49.530> going<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.829> repeat<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.250> process<00:02:50.489> with

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
you're going to repeat this process with

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.580 
you're going to repeat this process with
the<00:02:51.060> top<00:02:51.239> portion<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.660> RAM<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:52.140> line<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.380> up

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the top portion of RAM just line it up

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.650 
the top portion of RAM just line it up
with<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.860> gold<00:02:53.130> connectors<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.849> slide<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.329> in

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
with the gold connectors and slide it in

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.509 
with the gold connectors and slide it in
until<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.230> snug<00:02:55.500> fit<00:02:55.530> then<00:02:56.340> you're<00:02:56.430> going

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
until it's a snug fit then you're going

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.160 
until it's a snug fit then you're going
to<00:02:56.579> push<00:02:56.760> down<00:02:56.790> evenly<00:02:57.299> on<00:02:57.450> both<00:02:57.480> sides<00:02:57.870> again

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
to push down evenly on both sides again

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.970 
to push down evenly on both sides again
until<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.590> hear<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:58.980> satisfying<00:02:59.549> click<00:02:59.940> and

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
until you hear that satisfying click and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.550 
until you hear that satisfying click and
your<00:03:01.980> RAM<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.430> installed<00:03:02.970> now<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:04.290> way<00:03:04.379> you're

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
your RAM is installed now the way you're

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.780 
your RAM is installed now the way you're
going<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.739> test<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.069> see<00:03:05.220> if<00:03:05.250> it's<00:03:05.430> installed

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
going to test to see if it's installed

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.009 
going to test to see if it's installed
properly<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.299> you're<00:03:06.870> obviously<00:03:07.799> going<00:03:08.250> to

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
properly is you're obviously going to

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.839 
properly is you're obviously going to
replace<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.680> back<00:03:10.829> portion<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.640> macbook

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
replace the back portion of the macbook

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.670 
replace the back portion of the macbook
pro<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.540> then<00:03:12.840> what<00:03:12.989> you're<00:03:13.110> going<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.379> do<00:03:13.500> is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
pro and then what you're going to do is

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.500 
pro and then what you're going to do is
you're<00:03:13.799> going<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.129> screw<00:03:14.819> in<00:03:15.030> all<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.269> screws

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
you're going to screw in all the screws

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.420 
you're going to screw in all the screws
again<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.930> tend<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.500> not<00:03:16.620> do<00:03:16.799> them<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.130> tightly

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
again I tend to not do them so tightly

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.890 
again I tend to not do them so tightly
because<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:18.000> want<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.269> check<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.720> ram

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
because you want to check that the ram

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.360 
because you want to check that the ram
is<00:03:19.049> working<00:03:19.230> first<00:03:19.680> by<00:03:19.859> turning<00:03:20.100> on<00:03:20.280> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
is working first by turning on the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.270 
is working first by turning on the
computer<00:03:20.750> but<00:03:21.750> yeah<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.829> don't<00:03:22.950> do<00:03:23.130> them

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
computer but yeah so don't do them

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.370 
computer but yeah so don't do them
tightly<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:24.389> way<00:03:24.600> if<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.079> haven't

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
tightly that way if you haven't

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.020 
tightly that way if you haven't
installed<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.799> correctly<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.609> come<00:03:26.850> back

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
installed it correctly you can come back

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.289 
installed it correctly you can come back
and<00:03:27.359> you<00:03:28.079> can<00:03:28.519> unscrew<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.760> screws<00:03:30.000> very

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
and you can unscrew the screws very

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.690 
and you can unscrew the screws very
easily<00:03:30.540> again<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.889> once<00:03:32.069> all<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.310> screws<00:03:32.549> are

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
easily again so once all the screws are

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.129 
easily again so once all the screws are

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139
