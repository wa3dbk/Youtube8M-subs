00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.109
 apply a base and I took there 24 to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.590
 members pass for the eyes in the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.050
 range plus a premium from mac and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.989
 Then remember a pity with 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.809
 rounded pencil like this is the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.670
 brush a forum to delay those plays 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.260

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.480

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.340

 so that's the color that just here so 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.399
 this knife but still 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.920
 hot because sometimes some rates 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.750
 who will be grayer 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.390
 so I read everywhere on the eyelid 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.399
 mobile for us a job slightly 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.109

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.400
 360 m2 schering lot and i will put it 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.530
 slightly in the hollow to start 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.150
 work the moment no I take 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.390
 then children a little bit stronger 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.450
 always a little more gray is the 378 m 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.700

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.159
 straw are defined 110 watts and I have 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.460
 more a child but it could have been the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.229
 even still move I'm going out I'm 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.960
 baker for a very obscure reason 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.479
 I will then become applied to 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.460
 cream-colored famars like this 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:48.110
 it's the only lÃ¶rrach crime so 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.110
 it's in the call their hitch 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.280
 I then went back to that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.690
 would not recognize the hard then 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.470
 I'm going to take it and I'm so 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.020

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.490
 of a beautiful blue three funds and I want 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.220
 come to the master on the outer corner 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.120
 like this so it's really when 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.000
 trace for example a v that goes from the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.209
 here is our end of the hollow there 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.840
 fill his frames so the inside of the 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.970
 bus and I mean gently pat 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.970
 inward to create a fund said 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.490
 he had brought her back just a tiny 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.490
 little in the hollow 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.170
 I will resume 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.260
 personally I hope to crack 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.900
 flood 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.099
 I take a brush crying siemens 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.220
 could take a beveled brush 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.569
 also I will resume the want and I 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.790
 the air trace the line of eyelashes 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.530
 endless 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.060
 I try to stay close to me anyway 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.549
 do not want flour too wide 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.290
 I associate myself with people that it is 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.510
 well connected which is kepa of species 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.269
 blog i'm going to put the 15 young blacks 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.269
 blue on the inside so on michael 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.860
 I will learn ps or even more if 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.850
 I came to find the turquoise 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.670
 is just so kiel 413 peace from home 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.920
 note and i want to come slightly favre 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.120
 the bottom inner corner I'm taking a bad 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.570
 do not wish and I will come blurry 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.570
 the bottom line 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.420
 I am going to draw a line of hawaii 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.420
 the first one of your choice 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.659
 lately I have a lot 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.519
 leave with the black ink of 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.489
 with us here for really their 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.200
 very very dark side haring I'm not doing 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.670
 my line directly with this product the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.129
 game follows - get used to it because it's a 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.329
 tip that is softer than it is in 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.430
 brush hairs 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.930
 but this most accustomed can the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.000
 do it directly with that one you 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.659
 can also unfortunately never redo my 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.689
 mascara 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.400
 I chose the melt expo game from home 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.379
 smartbox I use since a few 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.030
 weeks then I learned it's fine 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.980
 brush and the very big ones for example 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.230
 whose intentions you do not make in 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.970
 put everywhere and then I like 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.760
 completed by putting the diario of 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.099
 benefit game use it for only the 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.930
 say now because I find 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.840
 that they were really very very very 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.860
 very very good and every day I 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.289
 find it a little bit to rearm 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.740
 for water repellent products but is it 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.930
 really talk to each other but I find that 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.090
 when they use they really give 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.820
 a nice fan too the well is well 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.039
 black so we went back to the other mass 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.389
 because below it is possible that they 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.039
 also adhere to a name that will look like 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.430
 a lot easier but I have when 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:49.560
 even the benefits of the troublemaker in terms 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.909
 of volumes and range of eyelashes and 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.530
 to finish I already have something 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.250
 square enough on the eyes I'm going 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:05:00.810
 put a good crystal from clarins 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:03.930
 it's the one 02 so could hydrate and 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.759
 give a little globe to the lips and we 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.949
 can include a large club 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.659
 here you are the cac ends and 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.889
 I hope you enjoyed it all 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.320
 products as usual despite the 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.389
 training bar under the video I you 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.830
 invite to stay on the lookout on my goat 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.670
 afa next week for a 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.080
 next video so 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.550
 it's a good day then 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.600
 be precisely in this next 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.600
