00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
a different question but anyway so let's

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.780 
a different question but anyway so let's
just<00:00:31.050> start<00:00:31.349> about<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> design<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.460> this<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
just start about the design so this is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.310 
just start about the design so this is
what<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.390> look<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.600> obviously<00:00:37.170> they're

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
what they look like obviously they're

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.490 
what they look like obviously they're
the<00:00:37.350> boat<00:00:37.739> shoe<00:00:38.100> style<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.719> side<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the boat shoe style so on this side the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260 
the boat shoe style so on this side the
only<00:00:40.829> thing<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.399> really<00:00:41.670> represents<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
only thing that really represents the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.319 
only thing that really represents the
brand<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.980> on<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.610> says<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:45.090> tough

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
brand is on these it says very tough

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
brand is on these it says very tough
slider<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.170> can't<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.860> but

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
slider on it but you can't see that but

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.779 
slider on it but you can't see that but
that<00:00:47.430> doesn't<00:00:47.700> even<00:00:47.789> matter<00:00:47.969> um<00:00:49.520> then<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.610> just

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
probably about three or four weeks of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.100 
probably about three or four weeks of
wearing<00:02:15.160> them<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.730> off<00:02:15.849> I'm<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.360> couple
