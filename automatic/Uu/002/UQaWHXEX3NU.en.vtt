bass<00:00:39.589> guitar<00:00:40.589> is<00:00:40.890> probably<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.460> best<00:00:41.730> gun<00:00:42.059> in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
bass guitar is probably the best gun in

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.619 
bass guitar is probably the best gun in
the<00:00:42.930> game<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.910> without<00:00:44.910> stopping<00:00:45.510> power

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the game to use without stopping power

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.639 
the game to use without stopping power
so<00:00:46.200> i<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.620> using<00:00:46.770> hard<00:00:47.010> line<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
so i was using hard line with it I

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
so i was using hard line with it I
pretty<00:00:49.649> much<00:00:49.800> all<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.730> second<00:00:51.059> verse<00:00:51.210> are

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
pretty much all the second verse are

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.010 
pretty much all the second verse are
great<00:00:52.050> especially<00:00:52.710> Danger<00:00:53.399> Close<00:00:53.430> that's

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
great especially Danger Close that's

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.220 
great especially Danger Close that's
unbelievably<00:00:55.020> good<00:00:55.199> gotta<00:00:56.010> love<00:00:56.190> noob<00:00:56.370> tubing

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
unbelievably good gotta love noob tubing

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.799 
unbelievably good gotta love noob tubing
but<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.530> hard<00:00:58.739> line<00:00:58.920> setup<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.430> really<00:01:00.180> handy

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
but the hard line setup is really handy

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.939 
but the hard line setup is really handy
especially<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.500> you're<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.800> her

especially if you're going to her

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.810 
especially if you're going to her
something<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> nuke<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:05.399> really

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
something like a nuke but it really

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.560 
something like a nuke but it really
helps<00:01:06.119> me<00:01:06.149> out<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.479> game<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:07.910> this<00:01:08.910> score<00:01:09.240> in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
helps me out this game and this score in

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.740 
helps me out this game and this score in
the<00:01:09.810> end<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.440> isn't<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.890> great<00:01:11.390> but<00:01:12.390> as

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750

using a superb there on sub base the
ac-130<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.530> actually<00:02:02.860> better<00:02:03.160> than<00:02:03.520> the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
ac-130 is actually better than the

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.330 
ac-130 is actually better than the
chopper<00:02:04.000> gunner<00:02:04.300> though<00:02:04.420> because<00:02:05.160> for<00:02:06.160> some
