00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
queue of when I like directly when I

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.240 
queue of when I like directly when I
started<00:01:59.549> recording<00:01:59.700> video<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.040> link<00:02:02.040> up

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
so that I'm all in line and it makes

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.460 
so that I'm all in line and it makes
sense<00:02:09.629> obviously

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
sense obviously

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.450

obviously<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.320> can<00:02:43.380> tell<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.490> lot<00:02:44.580> of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
obviously you can tell there is a lot of

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.320 
obviously you can tell there is a lot of
background<00:02:45.150> noise<00:02:45.570> there<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.150> see

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
background noise there and you can see

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.200 
background noise there and you can see
the<00:02:49.050> line<00:02:49.230> isn't<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:49.790> it's<00:02:50.790> perfectly

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
the line isn't like it's perfectly

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.420 
the line isn't like it's perfectly
smooth<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:51.990> all<00:02:52.110> these<00:02:52.260> jagged<00:02:52.590> bits

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
smooth you can see all these jagged bits

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.330 
smooth you can see all these jagged bits
which<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.180> just<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.510> static<00:02:54.960> because<00:02:55.890> my<00:02:56.160> mic

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
which is just a static because my mic

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.440 
which is just a static because my mic
sucks<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.950> use<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.130> noise<00:02:59.370> effect<00:02:59.790> removal

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
sucks so to use a noise effect removal

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.610 
sucks so to use a noise effect removal
first<00:03:01.290> thing<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.860> want<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.100> highlight<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:03.620> spot

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
first thing you want to highlight a spot

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.750 
first thing you want to highlight a spot
where<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.010> aren't<00:03:05.310> speaking<00:03:05.520> you<00:03:05.880> need<00:03:06.030> a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
where you aren't speaking you need a

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.570 
where you aren't speaking you need a
basically<00:03:08.760> like<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.270> sample<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:11.280> white

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
basically like a sample of the white

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.210 
basically like a sample of the white
noise<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.390> audacity<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.440> go<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:13.950> get

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
noise so that audacity can go in and get

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.580 
noise so that audacity can go in and get
rid<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.720> highlight<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.350> section

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
rid of that so you highlight a section

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.530 
rid of that so you highlight a section
where<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.760> noise<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.390> go<00:03:18.480> to

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
where it's just the noise you go to

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.010 
where it's just the noise you go to
effect<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.680> go<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.890> noise<00:03:20.459> removal<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.120> then

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
effect you go to noise removal and then

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.560 
effect you go to noise removal and then
you<00:03:22.140> get<00:03:22.320> noise<00:03:22.500> profile<00:03:23.010> which<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.820> basically

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
you get noise profile which is basically

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.020 
you get noise profile which is basically
that's<00:03:24.870> when<00:03:25.080> audacity<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.880> figuring<00:03:26.880> out

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that's when audacity is figuring out

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.570 
that's when audacity is figuring out
what<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.300> noise<00:03:27.450> sounds<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.890> after<00:03:29.459> that

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
what the noise sounds like so after that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.550 
what the noise sounds like so after that
if<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:29.850> click<00:03:30.120> here<00:03:30.450> you'll<00:03:30.660> select<00:03:31.170> the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
if you click here you'll select the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.820 
if you click here you'll select the
entire<00:03:32.100> track<00:03:32.540> from<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:34.170> click<00:03:34.410> effect

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
entire track from there you click effect

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.370 
entire track from there you click effect
you<00:03:35.250> go<00:03:35.340> back<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.850> noise<00:03:36.030> removal<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.720> can

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
you go back to noise removal and you can

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.229 
you go back to noise removal and you can
either<00:03:37.530> preview<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:38.640> can<00:03:38.820> hear<00:03:39.060> what<00:03:39.209> it

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
either preview so you can hear what it

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.110 
either preview so you can hear what it
would<00:03:39.450> sound<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:39.950> um<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.160> if<00:03:41.250> that's<00:03:41.489> good

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
would sound like um and if that's good

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.940 
would sound like um and if that's good
for<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.450> then<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.750> press<00:03:42.989> ok<00:03:43.140> or<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.769> can

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
for you then you press ok or you can

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.180 
for you then you press ok or you can
mess<00:03:44.310> around<00:03:44.340> with<00:03:44.700> these<00:03:44.959> leopards<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.200> bibs

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
mess around with these leopards and bibs

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.460 
mess around with these leopards and bibs
and<00:03:47.459> bobs<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:48.050> personally<00:03:49.050> don't<00:03:49.230> know<00:03:49.290> what

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
and bobs I personally don't know what

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.420 
and bobs I personally don't know what
any<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:49.860> means

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
any of this means

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.620 
any of this means
so<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.970> don't<00:03:51.209> do<00:03:51.420> much<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.890> but<00:03:52.890> I<00:03:53.220> mean<00:03:53.630> if

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
so I don't do much of that but I mean if

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.270 
so I don't do much of that but I mean if
you<00:03:54.870> understand<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:55.769> think<00:03:55.980> you

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
you understand that and you think you

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.680 
you understand that and you think you
can<00:03:56.430> figure<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:56.640> out<00:03:56.760> go<00:03:57.150> for<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.510> but

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
can figure it out go for it but

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.300 
can figure it out go for it but
generally<00:03:58.080> audacity<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.709> really<00:03:59.010> good<00:03:59.190> at

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
generally audacity is really good at

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.449 
generally audacity is really good at
doing<00:03:59.580> it<00:03:59.700> for<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.930> uh<00:04:01.320> we'll<00:04:02.070> just<00:04:02.280> press

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
doing it for you so uh we'll just press

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.060 
doing it for you so uh we'll just press
ok<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.330> audacity<00:04:03.750> will<00:04:04.110> clean<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.470> up<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.950> can

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
ok and audacity will clean it up you can

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.160 
ok and audacity will clean it up you can
see<00:04:05.250> here<00:04:05.519> it's<00:04:05.900> perfectly<00:04:06.900> straight

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
see here it's perfectly straight

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.160 
see here it's perfectly straight
basically<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.459> let's<00:04:09.300> go<00:04:09.480> ahead<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.750> play<00:04:09.989> it

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
basically so let's go ahead and play it

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.160 
basically so let's go ahead and play it
and<00:04:10.320> we'll<00:04:10.590> listen<00:04:11.250> for<00:04:11.459> uh<00:04:11.730> we'll<00:04:12.660> hear<00:04:13.050> the

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
and we'll listen for uh we'll hear the

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.159 
and we'll listen for uh we'll hear the
difference<00:04:13.970> recording<00:04:14.970> stuffs<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.630> such<00:04:15.870> and

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
difference recording stuffs and such and

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.370 
difference recording stuffs and such and
yay<00:04:16.530> hello<00:04:17.250> yeah<00:04:17.820> great

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
yay hello yeah great

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.530 
yay hello yeah great
yeah<00:04:20.480> so<00:04:21.680> as<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.890> can<00:04:22.980> tell<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:24.150> noise<00:04:24.330> is

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
yeah so as you can tell the noise is

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.180 
yeah so as you can tell the noise is
practically<00:04:25.110> gone<00:04:25.290> which<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.680> actually<00:04:26.010> very

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
practically gone which is actually very

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.700
