this<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:02.010> now<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.159> third<00:00:02.610> video<00:00:02.939> looking<00:00:03.330> at<00:00:03.449> the

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
this is now a third video looking at the

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.630 
this is now a third video looking at the
locus<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.080> complex<00:00:04.410> number<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.490> last

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
locus of a complex number in the last

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.190 
locus of a complex number in the last
video<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.180> looked<00:00:06.390> at<00:00:06.509> perpendicular

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
video we looked at perpendicular

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.129 
video we looked at perpendicular
bisectors<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.340> form<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.970> mod<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.420> Z<00:00:09.900> minus

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
bisectors in the form the mod of Z minus

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.060 
bisectors in the form the mod of Z minus
a<00:00:10.650> was<00:00:11.250> equal<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.790> K<00:00:12.480> multiplied<00:00:13.380> by<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.710> mod

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
a was equal to K multiplied by the mod

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.150 
a was equal to K multiplied by the mod
of<00:00:14.250> said<00:00:14.610> minus<00:00:15.299> B<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:16.260> all<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.770> those<00:00:16.859> cases

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
of said minus B in all of those cases

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.330 
of said minus B in all of those cases
the<00:00:17.520> value<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.330> K<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.990> equal<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.439> 1<00:00:19.619> when<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the value of K was equal to 1 when the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.429 
the value of K was equal to 1 when the
value<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.670> K<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.939> equal<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.300> 1<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:21.960> end<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.320> with

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
value of K is equal to 1 we end up with

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.099 
value of K is equal to 1 we end up with
a<00:00:22.470> perpendicular<00:00:22.890> bisector<00:00:23.539> when<00:00:24.539> K<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
a perpendicular bisector when K is a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.339 
a perpendicular bisector when K is a
real<00:00:25.529> number<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:26.189> not<00:00:26.580> equal<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> 1<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.810> end<00:00:28.050> up

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
real number but not equal to 1 we end up

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.589 
real number but not equal to 1 we end up
with<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> circle<00:00:29.119> we're<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.359> look<00:00:30.449> at

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
with a circle we're going to look at

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.110 
with a circle we're going to look at
those<00:00:30.750> cases<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:32.040> video<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:33.000> going

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
those cases in this video and I'm going

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.520 
those cases in this video and I'm going
to<00:00:33.149> start<00:00:33.360> off<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> relatively

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
to start off with a relatively

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.799 
to start off with a relatively
straightforward<00:00:34.980> example<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.120> we're

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
straightforward example of this we're

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.340 
straightforward example of this we're
going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.170> now<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.410> mod<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.100> Z<00:00:39.030> minus<00:00:39.350> 5

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
going to have now the mod of Z minus 5

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.190 
going to have now the mod of Z minus 5
plus<00:00:41.100> 4i<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.710> equal<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:44.010> two<00:00:44.760> lots<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.870> mod

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
plus 4i is equal to two lots of the mod

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.430 
plus 4i is equal to two lots of the mod
of<00:00:46.440> Z<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.579> then<00:00:48.149> we'll<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.450> 4<00:00:48.719> minus<00:00:49.410> 2<00:00:49.739> plus<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
of Z and then we'll go 4 minus 2 plus I

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.810 
of Z and then we'll go 4 minus 2 plus I
what<00:00:52.440> we're<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.949> asked<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.699> an

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
what we're going to be asked to do in an

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.540 
what we're going to be asked to do in an
exam<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.420> convert<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.500> Cartesian<00:00:56.070> form

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
exam is convert this to Cartesian form

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.200 
exam is convert this to Cartesian form
and<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.210> sketch<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.050> locus<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.710> Z<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.399> we<00:01:00.059> go

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
and then sketch the locus of Z if we go

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.869 
and then sketch the locus of Z if we go
back<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> our<00:01:00.600> understanding<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.710> Z<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.850> know

back to our understanding of Z we know

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.200 
back to our understanding of Z we know
that<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.600> equal<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.019> X<00:01:04.350> plus<00:01:04.860> iy<00:01:05.210> I'm

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that this is equal to X plus iy I'm

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
that this is equal to X plus iy I'm
going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> convert<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.950> Cartesian

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
quantity y plus 1 all squared so if we

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.830 
quantity y plus 1 all squared so if we
just<00:02:08.429> square<00:02:08.789> both<00:02:08.819> sides<00:02:09.090> we're<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.780> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
just square both sides we're going to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.740 
just square both sides we're going to
end<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:10.289> with<00:02:10.470> X<00:02:10.739> minus<00:02:11.489> 5<00:02:11.760> all<00:02:12.270> square

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
end up now with X minus 5 all square

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.880 
end up now with X minus 5 all square
plus

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
why plus 4 all squared will be equal to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.880 
why plus 4 all squared will be equal to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
plus 1 all squared all we're left to do

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.790 
plus 1 all squared all we're left to do
now<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.700> express<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.540> Cartesian<00:02:27.780> form<00:02:28.260> and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
now is express it in Cartesian form and

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.820 
now is express it in Cartesian form and
get<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.640> an<00:02:29.819> equation<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.959> circle<00:02:31.170> so

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
get it as an equation of a circle so

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
get it as an equation of a circle so

going<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.739> multiply<00:02:44.100> through<00:02:44.280> by<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.520> 4<00:02:44.880> thing

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
going to multiply through by the 4 thing

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.330 
going to multiply through by the 4 thing
4x<00:02:45.900> squared<00:02:46.260> then<00:02:46.770> we're<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.190> have

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
4x squared then we're going to have

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.770 
4x squared then we're going to have
that's<00:02:47.520> going<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.970> be<00:02:48.120> minus<00:02:48.800> 16x<00:02:49.940> plus<00:02:50.940> 16

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that's going to be minus 16x plus 16

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.660 
that's going to be minus 16x plus 16
plus<00:02:52.700> 4y<00:02:53.700> squared<00:02:54.500> plus<00:02:55.500> 8y<00:02:56.150> plus<00:02:57.150> 4<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:59.280> let's

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
plus 4y squared plus 8y plus 4 so let's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.699 
plus 4y squared plus 8y plus 4 so let's
now<00:03:00.000> set<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.420> left-hand<00:03:00.810> side<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.080> 0

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
now set the left-hand side to 0

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.470 
now set the left-hand side to 0
let's<00:03:01.890> get<00:03:02.010> an<00:03:02.130> x<00:03:02.310> squared<00:03:02.430> +<00:03:02.790> y<00:03:02.970> squared<00:03:03.000> off

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
let's get an x squared + y squared off

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.810 
let's get an x squared + y squared off
both<00:03:03.690> sides<00:03:03.950> 3x<00:03:04.950> squared<00:03:05.459> plus<00:03:06.390> 3y<00:03:07.230> squared

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
both sides 3x squared plus 3y squared

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.840 
both sides 3x squared plus 3y squared
we've<00:03:08.820> got<00:03:09.030> minus<00:03:09.510> 10x<00:03:09.930> minus<00:03:10.380> 16x<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.310> adding

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
we've got minus 10x minus 16x so adding

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.300 
we've got minus 10x minus 16x so adding
10<00:03:12.060> X<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.390> both<00:03:12.510> sides<00:03:12.810> minus<00:03:13.320> 6<00:03:13.620> X

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
10 X to both sides minus 6 X

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.870 
10 X to both sides minus 6 X
we<00:03:15.239> got<00:03:15.420> plus<00:03:16.110> 8y<00:03:16.380> plus<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.070> twice<00:03:17.280> over<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.640> 8

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
we got plus 8y plus a twice over the 8

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.020 
we got plus 8y plus a twice over the 8
Y's<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.269> going<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.480> go<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.829> side<00:03:20.040> well<00:03:20.940> we

Y's are going to go on this side well we

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.270 
Y's are going to go on this side well we
got<00:03:21.150> 25<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.750> 16<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.350> on<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.620> side<00:03:22.829> we<00:03:23.010> got<00:03:23.040> -

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
got 25 and 16 and on this side we got -

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.270 
got 25 and 16 and on this side we got -
16<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.760> 4<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.079> start<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.680> six<00:03:25.950> teens<00:03:26.130> are

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
16 and 4 so if I start the six teens are

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.900 
16 and 4 so if I start the six teens are
going<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.459> go<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.940> let's<00:03:27.480> take<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.400> tape<00:03:29.400> 25

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
going to go and let's take the tape 25

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.220 
going to go and let's take the tape 25
off<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:30.390> going<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.630> give<00:03:30.840> me<00:03:30.959> now<00:03:31.970> -21

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
off so it's going to give me now -21

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.569 
off so it's going to give me now -21
that<00:03:34.230> works<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.530> quite<00:03:34.739> nicely<00:03:34.920> as<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.250> divides

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
that works I quite nicely as it divides

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.729 
that works I quite nicely as it divides
through<00:03:35.820> by<00:03:35.970> 3<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.600> 0<00:03:36.630> is<00:03:37.110> going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.410> be<00:03:37.560> equal

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
through by 3 so 0 is going to be equal

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.479

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
going to be equal to 8 so we can see

center<00:04:11.040> at<00:04:11.250> what's<00:04:11.790> that<00:04:11.940> going<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.090> be<00:04:12.150> 1

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
center at what's that going to be 1

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.560 
center at what's that going to be 1
comma<00:04:12.720> 0<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.410> then<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.280> radius<00:04:14.820> is<00:04:15.090> going<00:04:15.450> to

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
comma 0 and then the radius is going to

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.969 
comma 0 and then the radius is going to
be<00:04:15.690> equal<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.620> root<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:17.010> 8<00:04:17.130> or<00:04:17.430> 2<00:04:18.030> root<00:04:18.510> 2<00:04:18.979> so

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
be equal to the root of 8 or 2 root 2 so

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.490 
be equal to the root of 8 or 2 root 2 so
if<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.160> wanted<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.519> sketch<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.840> would

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
if you wanted to sketch that you would

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.010 
if you wanted to sketch that you would
simply<00:04:22.979> get<00:04:23.310> your<00:04:23.580> Cartesian<00:04:24.330> XY<00:04:24.750> plane<00:04:25.080> up

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
simply get your Cartesian XY plane up

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.260 
simply get your Cartesian XY plane up
I<00:04:26.050> think<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.680> looks<00:04:26.889> straight<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.580> then<00:04:28.120> we

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
I think that looks straight and then we

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.320 
I think that looks straight and then we
would<00:04:28.419> get<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:29.020> circle<00:04:29.860> let's<00:04:30.400> per<00:04:30.610> circle<00:04:31.180> on

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
would get a circle let's per circle on

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.200 
would get a circle let's per circle on
something<00:04:32.289> looking<00:04:33.000> approximately<00:04:34.000> that

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
something looking approximately that

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.960 
something looking approximately that
don't<00:04:34.630> worry<00:04:34.750> about<00:04:34.780> if<00:04:35.139> it's<00:04:35.319> not<00:04:35.590> huge<00:04:36.460> AK<00:04:36.699> as

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
don't worry about if it's not huge AK as

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.460 
don't worry about if it's not huge AK as
long<00:04:37.120> as<00:04:37.240> you've<00:04:37.360> got<00:04:37.389> some<00:04:37.720> values<00:04:38.080> on<00:04:38.229> here

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
long as you've got some values on here

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.980 
long as you've got some values on here
what<00:04:39.310> we've<00:04:39.460> got<00:04:39.669> then<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.419> point<00:04:40.690> and

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
what we've got then is this point and

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.279 
what we've got then is this point and
this<00:04:41.440> point<00:04:41.500> is<00:04:41.949> going<00:04:42.069> to<00:04:42.190> be<00:04:42.280> 1<00:04:42.669> comma<00:04:42.970> 0<00:04:43.289> this

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
this point is going to be 1 comma 0 this

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.920 
this point is going to be 1 comma 0 this
point<00:04:44.650> now<00:04:44.860> remember<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.699> radius<00:04:46.150> is<00:04:46.360> at<00:04:46.599> 2

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
point now remember the radius is at 2

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.210 
point now remember the radius is at 2
root<00:04:47.110> 2<00:04:47.139> so<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:47.470> might<00:04:47.620> just<00:04:47.860> want<00:04:48.009> to<00:04:48.039> say

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
root 2 so you might just want to say

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.960 
root 2 so you might just want to say
that<00:04:48.370> that's<00:04:48.490> 1<00:04:49.000> plus<00:04:49.750> 2<00:04:50.169> root<00:04:50.560> 2<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.460> then

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
that that's 1 plus 2 root 2 and then

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.900 
that that's 1 plus 2 root 2 and then
you're<00:04:52.120> going<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.389> have<00:04:52.569> now<00:04:52.780> 1<00:04:53.349> minus<00:04:54.340> 2<00:04:54.669> root

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
you're going to have now 1 minus 2 root

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.029 
you're going to have now 1 minus 2 root
2<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:56.169> might<00:04:56.349> just<00:04:56.530> want<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.860> put<00:04:57.009> a

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
2 and you might just want to put a

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.550 
2 and you might just want to put a
radius<00:04:57.759> on<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.150> put<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.509> values<00:04:58.840> up<00:04:59.020> here<00:04:59.349> and

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
radius on and put the values up here and

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.870 
radius on and put the values up here and
up<00:04:59.680> here<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:00.370> this<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:00.729> going<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:00.940> be<00:05:01.030> 2<00:05:01.419> root<00:05:01.900> 2

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
up here and this is going to be 2 root 2

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.870 
up here and this is going to be 2 root 2
so<00:05:03.880> there<00:05:04.030> we<00:05:04.180> go<00:05:04.300> that<00:05:04.509> is<00:05:04.539> a<00:05:05.320> sketch<00:05:05.949> of<00:05:06.190> the

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
so there we go that is a sketch of the

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.629 
so there we go that is a sketch of the
locus<00:05:07.330> now<00:05:08.320> let's<00:05:08.590> go<00:05:08.710> back<00:05:08.919> to<00:05:09.190> this<00:05:09.430> point

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
locus now let's go back to this point

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.159 
locus now let's go back to this point
right<00:05:09.880> here<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.120> just<00:05:10.210> read<00:05:10.599> what<00:05:10.840> this<00:05:10.990> is

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
right here and just read what this is

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.890 
right here and just read what this is
saying<00:05:11.349> the<00:05:11.729> distance<00:05:12.729> from<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.570> complex

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
saying the distance from the complex

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.779 
saying the distance from the complex
number<00:05:14.320> now<00:05:14.560> 5<00:05:15.400> minus<00:05:16.060> 4i<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:16.740> 2<00:05:17.740> lots<00:05:18.099> of<00:05:18.340> the

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
number now 5 minus 4i is 2 lots of the

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.430 
number now 5 minus 4i is 2 lots of the
distance<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.449> same<00:05:19.630> complex<00:05:19.990> number<00:05:20.259> from

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
distance of the same complex number from

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.070 
distance of the same complex number from
2<00:05:20.770> minus<00:05:21.220> I<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:22.240> what<00:05:22.389> we're<00:05:22.539> looking<00:05:22.810> at<00:05:22.870> then

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
2 minus I so what we're looking at then

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.230 
2 minus I so what we're looking at then
is<00:05:23.259> this<00:05:23.740> is<00:05:23.919> going<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.220> be<00:05:24.310> double<00:05:24.880> the

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
is this is going to be double the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.450 
is this is going to be double the
difference<00:05:25.659> what<00:05:26.650> I'm<00:05:26.710> going<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.889> do<00:05:27.009> is<00:05:27.159> draw

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
difference what I'm going to do is draw

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.860 
difference what I'm going to do is draw
this<00:05:27.610> up<00:05:27.789> and<00:05:27.970> hopefully<00:05:28.150> it'll<00:05:28.449> make<00:05:28.630> some

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
this up and hopefully it'll make some

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.230 
this up and hopefully it'll make some
sense<00:05:29.139> you<00:05:29.860> can<00:05:30.159> go<00:05:30.310> through<00:05:30.580> this<00:05:30.729> purely

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
sense you can go through this purely

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.420 
sense you can go through this purely
algebraically<00:05:31.900> but<00:05:32.620> often<00:05:33.009> having<00:05:33.340> an

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
algebraically but often having an

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.070 
algebraically but often having an
understanding<00:05:34.090> of<00:05:34.180> what's<00:05:34.570> going<00:05:34.750> on<00:05:34.930> these

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
understanding of what's going on these

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.999 
understanding of what's going on these
isn't<00:05:35.590> helpful

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
isn't helpful

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.219 
isn't helpful
I<00:05:36.099> suppose<00:05:36.430> so<00:05:37.180> let's<00:05:37.419> let's<00:05:37.780> get<00:05:37.930> this<00:05:38.050> point

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
I suppose so let's let's get this point

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.800 
I suppose so let's let's get this point
this<00:05:38.409> is<00:05:38.530> gonna<00:05:38.650> be<00:05:38.800> 5<00:05:39.070> minus<00:05:39.729> 4<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:40.330> let's<00:05:40.539> pop

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
this is gonna be 5 minus 4 so let's pop

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.499 
this is gonna be 5 minus 4 so let's pop
this<00:05:40.990> point<00:05:41.259> on<00:05:41.440> so<00:05:42.039> let's<00:05:42.789> put<00:05:43.030> this<00:05:43.120> point<00:05:43.360> on

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
this point on so let's put this point on

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.439 
this point on so let's put this point on
there<00:05:43.630> so<00:05:43.930> we<00:05:44.440> have<00:05:44.620> 5<00:05:44.949> minus<00:05:45.219> 4i<00:05:45.969> which<00:05:46.300> is

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
there so we have 5 minus 4i which is

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.050 
there so we have 5 minus 4i which is
going<00:05:46.599> to<00:05:46.659> be<00:05:46.780> just<00:05:47.139> here<00:05:47.409> okay<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.130> then<00:05:48.610> also

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
going to be just here okay and then also

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.999 
going to be just here okay and then also
what<00:05:49.479> we<00:05:49.599> had<00:05:49.930> was<00:05:50.259> this<00:05:50.380> one<00:05:50.590> which<00:05:50.770> is<00:05:50.889> going

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
what we had was this one which is going

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.510 
what we had was this one which is going
to<00:05:51.070> be<00:05:51.159> 2<00:05:51.520> minus<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:52.300> so<00:05:53.229> if<00:05:53.289> we<00:05:53.380> put<00:05:53.560> that<00:05:53.650> on<00:05:53.860> 2

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
to be 2 minus I so if we put that on 2

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.810 
to be 2 minus I so if we put that on 2
minus<00:05:55.000> I<00:05:55.120> is<00:05:55.570> going<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.050> be<00:05:56.199> just<00:05:56.590> here<00:05:56.919> so

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
minus I is going to be just here so

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.219 
minus I is going to be just here so
these<00:05:58.000> are<00:05:58.210> our<00:05:58.240> two<00:05:58.300> points<00:05:58.570> every<00:05:58.960> had<00:05:59.110> an

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
these are our two points every had an

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.450 
these are our two points every had an
Argand<00:05:59.530> diagram<00:05:59.650> they<00:06:00.009> would<00:06:00.159> be<00:06:00.280> for<00:06:00.430> two

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
Argand diagram they would be for two

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.790 
Argand diagram they would be for two
points<00:06:00.849> right<00:06:00.969> here<00:06:01.000> now<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.840> circle<00:06:02.440> we

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
points right here now the circle we

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.159 
points right here now the circle we
found<00:06:03.190> for<00:06:03.550> circle<00:06:03.909> to<00:06:04.090> be<00:06:04.180> X<00:06:04.419> minus<00:06:04.840> 1<00:06:05.020> 1

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
found for circle to be X minus 1 1

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.070 
found for circle to be X minus 1 1
squared<00:06:05.440> plus<00:06:06.099> y<00:06:06.280> squared<00:06:06.310> is<00:06:06.699> equal<00:06:06.940> to<00:06:07.270> 8<00:06:07.419> so

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
squared plus y squared is equal to 8 so

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.649 
squared plus y squared is equal to 8 so
it's<00:06:08.320> a<00:06:08.380> circle<00:06:08.770> 1<00:06:09.039> comma<00:06:09.250> 0<00:06:09.340> and<00:06:09.820> a<00:06:10.060> radius<00:06:10.509> of

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
it's a circle 1 comma 0 and a radius of

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.959 
it's a circle 1 comma 0 and a radius of
2<00:06:10.840> root<00:06:11.020> 2<00:06:11.110> I'm<00:06:11.889> now<00:06:12.070> going<00:06:12.250> to<00:06:12.310> draw<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:12.789> on

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
2 root 2 I'm now going to draw that on

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:16.560 
2 root 2 I'm now going to draw that on
here<00:06:13.210> so<00:06:13.449> let's<00:06:13.479> grab<00:06:14.050> up<00:06:14.259> a<00:06:14.380> circle<00:06:15.210> so<00:06:16.210> there

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
here so let's grab up a circle so there

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.110 
here so let's grab up a circle so there
it<00:06:16.840> is<00:06:16.870> that's<00:06:17.289> our<00:06:17.500> 1<00:06:17.740> 0<00:06:18.070> and<00:06:18.460> what<00:06:18.969> we're

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
it is that's our 1 0 and what we're

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.580 
it is that's our 1 0 and what we're
gonna<00:06:19.180> have<00:06:19.300> is<00:06:19.690> something<00:06:20.020> that's<00:06:20.440> gonna

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
gonna have is something that's gonna

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.879 
gonna have is something that's gonna
look<00:06:20.919> let's<00:06:21.460> that<00:06:22.030> looks<00:06:22.240> about<00:06:22.389> right<00:06:22.889> now

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
look let's that looks about right now

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.820 
look let's that looks about right now
consider<00:06:24.759> what<00:06:25.570> we've<00:06:25.719> got<00:06:25.960> here<00:06:26.199> we've<00:06:26.380> got

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
consider what we've got here we've got

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.459 
consider what we've got here we've got
these<00:06:27.009> two<00:06:27.340> complex<00:06:27.789> numbers<00:06:28.150> a<00:06:28.900> and<00:06:28.930> B<00:06:29.289> these

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:29.469 
these two complex numbers a and B these

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:32.100 
these two complex numbers a and B these
are<00:06:29.530> fixed<00:06:29.860> points<00:06:29.949> the<00:06:30.940> locus<00:06:31.449> of<00:06:31.599> said<00:06:31.840> is

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
are fixed points the locus of said is

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.290 
are fixed points the locus of said is
now<00:06:32.500> for<00:06:32.770> circumference<00:06:33.190> of<00:06:33.460> this<00:06:33.580> circle<00:06:33.639> and

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
now for circumference of this circle and

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.839 
now for circumference of this circle and
if<00:06:34.750> we<00:06:34.900> look<00:06:35.080> at<00:06:35.199> this<00:06:35.320> let's<00:06:35.650> grab<00:06:36.039> one<00:06:36.639> of

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
if we look at this let's grab one of

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.050 
if we look at this let's grab one of
these

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
these

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.610 
these
and<00:06:38.150> we'll<00:06:38.389> put<00:06:38.600> this<00:06:38.750> point<00:06:38.960> on<00:06:39.139> here<00:06:39.320> let's

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
and we'll put this point on here let's

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.820 
and we'll put this point on here let's
just<00:06:39.919> let's<00:06:40.820> just<00:06:40.880> put<00:06:41.120> it<00:06:41.260> we<00:06:42.260> will<00:06:42.440> see<00:06:42.680> that

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
just let's just put it we will see that

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.040 
just let's just put it we will see that
the<00:06:42.980> distance<00:06:43.430> from<00:06:43.760> the<00:06:44.210> complex<00:06:44.570> number<00:06:44.840> B

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
the distance from the complex number B

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.770 
the distance from the complex number B
to<00:06:45.710> the<00:06:45.830> circumference<00:06:46.370> is<00:06:46.669> half<00:06:47.300> the

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
to the circumference is half the

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.730 
to the circumference is half the
distance<00:06:48.230> as<00:06:48.530> a<00:06:49.100> from<00:06:49.580> the<00:06:49.910> font<00:06:50.750> a<00:06:50.930> to<00:06:51.410> piss

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
distance as a from the font a to piss

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.290 
distance as a from the font a to piss
compass<00:06:52.040> these<00:06:52.340> points<00:06:52.639> are<00:06:52.700> not<00:06:52.760> moving<00:06:53.000> and

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
compass these points are not moving and

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.290 
compass these points are not moving and
a<00:06:54.260> nicer<00:06:54.950> way<00:06:55.070> to<00:06:55.100> see<00:06:55.400> this<00:06:55.580> if<00:06:55.730> we<00:06:55.850> trace<00:06:56.120> this

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
a nicer way to see this if we trace this

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.340 
a nicer way to see this if we trace this
round<00:06:56.630> this<00:06:57.560> length<00:06:57.919> now<00:06:58.250> so<00:06:58.700> ei<00:06:59.300> or<00:06:59.690> AE<00:07:00.080> is

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
round this length now so ei or AE is

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.680 
round this length now so ei or AE is
always<00:07:00.680> going<00:07:00.770> to<00:07:00.830> be<00:07:00.980> the<00:07:01.070> same<00:07:01.280> as<00:07:01.490> B<00:07:01.690> it's

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
always going to be the same as B it's

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.570 
always going to be the same as B it's
going<00:07:03.230> to<00:07:03.320> be<00:07:03.440> twice<00:07:03.830> as<00:07:03.889> much<00:07:04.190> and<00:07:04.370> you<00:07:04.430> can

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
going to be twice as much and you can

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.159 
going to be twice as much and you can
see<00:07:04.790> it<00:07:04.910> perfectly<00:07:05.389> at<00:07:05.510> that<00:07:05.660> point<00:07:05.900> where<00:07:06.080> it

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169 
see it perfectly at that point where it

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:08.590 
see it perfectly at that point where it
crosses<00:07:06.440> this<00:07:07.220> length<00:07:07.550> if<00:07:07.820> we<00:07:08.120> take<00:07:08.300> this<00:07:08.450> to

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600 
crosses this length if we take this to

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.420 
crosses this length if we take this to
be<00:07:08.630> one<00:07:08.930> is<00:07:09.080> going<00:07:09.200> to<00:07:09.290> be<00:07:09.380> root<00:07:09.590> 2<00:07:09.620> and<00:07:10.250> that's

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
be one is going to be root 2 and that's

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.490 
be one is going to be root 2 and that's
going<00:07:10.580> to<00:07:10.700> be<00:07:10.850> 2<00:07:11.060> root<00:07:11.270> 2<00:07:11.330> if<00:07:11.840> we<00:07:12.080> go<00:07:12.440> around

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
going to be 2 root 2 if we go around

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.140 
going to be 2 root 2 if we go around
here<00:07:12.740> we<00:07:13.040> can<00:07:13.220> see<00:07:13.460> now<00:07:13.639> that<00:07:13.669> it's<00:07:13.940> going<00:07:14.060> to

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
here we can see now that it's going to

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.990 
here we can see now that it's going to
be<00:07:14.240> double<00:07:14.690> and<00:07:14.979> that's<00:07:15.979> perfectly<00:07:16.610> spot-on

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 
be double and that's perfectly spot-on

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.210 
be double and that's perfectly spot-on
so<00:07:17.419> this<00:07:18.229> is<00:07:18.410> what<00:07:18.560> it<00:07:18.650> will<00:07:18.740> do<00:07:18.830> it<00:07:18.919> will<00:07:18.950> trace

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
so this is what it will do it will trace

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.060 
so this is what it will do it will trace
out<00:07:19.430> a<00:07:19.490> circle<00:07:20.000> and<00:07:20.180> for<00:07:21.020> complex<00:07:21.410> numbers<00:07:21.680> ed

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.070 
out a circle and for complex numbers ed

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.280 
out a circle and for complex numbers ed
will<00:07:22.580> sit<00:07:22.880> somewhere<00:07:23.419> on<00:07:23.660> here<00:07:23.900> so<00:07:24.080> it<00:07:24.169> might

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.290 
will sit somewhere on here so it might

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.360 
will sit somewhere on here so it might
be<00:07:24.350> there<00:07:24.560> it<00:07:24.710> might<00:07:24.830> be<00:07:24.889> there

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
be there it might be there

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.670 
be there it might be there
it's<00:07:25.700> just<00:07:26.150> now<00:07:26.419> a<00:07:26.450> locus<00:07:27.110> of<00:07:27.229> all<00:07:27.440> of<00:07:27.590> those

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 
it's just now a locus of all of those

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.540 
it's just now a locus of all of those
points<00:07:28.030> so<00:07:29.030> there<00:07:29.210> we<00:07:29.300> go<00:07:29.330> that's<00:07:30.310> let's<00:07:31.310> just

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
points so there we go that's let's just

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.400 
points so there we go that's let's just
leave<00:07:31.700> her<00:07:31.880> somewhere<00:07:32.330> around<00:07:32.419> there<00:07:32.630> that's

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.410 
leave her somewhere around there that's

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.590 
leave her somewhere around there that's
now<00:07:33.770> the<00:07:34.280> forum<00:07:34.610> where<00:07:35.240> we've<00:07:35.419> got<00:07:35.889> X<00:07:37.330> so<00:07:38.330> for

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:38.600 
now the forum where we've got X so for

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.750 
now the forum where we've got X so for
much<00:07:38.810> of<00:07:38.930> us<00:07:39.050> is<00:07:39.169> that<00:07:39.320> minus<00:07:39.650> a<00:07:39.770> is<00:07:39.830> equal<00:07:40.070> to<00:07:40.460> K

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:40.760 
much of us is that minus a is equal to K

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.270 
much of us is that minus a is equal to K
multiplied<00:07:41.419> by<00:07:41.600> 4<00:07:42.080> modulus<00:07:42.440> is<00:07:42.620> EV<00:07:42.770> minus<00:07:43.100> B

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 
multiplied by 4 modulus is EV minus B

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.420 
multiplied by 4 modulus is EV minus B
when<00:07:43.850> K<00:07:44.240> is<00:07:44.600> a<00:07:44.810> real<00:07:45.229> number<00:07:45.680> and<00:07:45.919> it's<00:07:46.100> not

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.430 
when K is a real number and it's not

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.060 
when K is a real number and it's not
equal<00:07:46.669> to<00:07:47.060> 1<00:07:47.240> we'll<00:07:48.200> do<00:07:48.320> some<00:07:48.500> more<00:07:48.590> examples

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.070 
equal to 1 we'll do some more examples

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.969 
equal to 1 we'll do some more examples
of<00:07:49.220> this<00:07:49.310> in<00:07:49.580> future<00:07:49.850> videos<00:07:50.539> but<00:07:51.530> if<00:07:51.650> you<00:07:51.770> just

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:51.979 
of this in future videos but if you just

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:54.040 
of this in future videos but if you just
want<00:07:52.220> to<00:07:52.340> go<00:07:52.550> it<00:07:52.850> and<00:07:53.020> manipulate<00:07:54.020> it

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.050 
want to go it and manipulate it

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.980 
want to go it and manipulate it
algebraically<00:07:54.710> that<00:07:55.190> will<00:07:55.970> give<00:07:56.240> you<00:07:56.450> now

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:56.990 
algebraically that will give you now

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.169 
algebraically that will give you now
your<00:07:57.590> quick<00:07:58.400> sketch<00:07:58.669> in<00:07:58.910> your<00:07:58.940> Cartesian<00:07:59.780> form
