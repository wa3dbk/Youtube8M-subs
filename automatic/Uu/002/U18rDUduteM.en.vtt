as human beings we have the same DNA as

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.150 
as human beings we have the same DNA as
a<00:01:16.930> chimpanzee<00:01:17.930> or<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.140> monkey<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:18.740> we<00:01:18.890> should<00:01:19.040> be

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
a chimpanzee or a monkey so we should be

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.040 
a chimpanzee or a monkey so we should be
taking<00:01:19.520> in<00:01:19.670> 60<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.240> 70<00:01:20.600> percent<00:01:20.750> of

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
taking in 60 to 70 percent of

taking in 60 to 70 percent of
chlorophyll<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.590> day<00:01:21.830> how<00:01:22.550> much<00:01:22.730> are<00:01:22.910> you<00:01:23.030> doing

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
chlorophyll a day how much are you doing

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.010 
chlorophyll a day how much are you doing
right<00:01:24.070> hmm<00:01:25.130> anyway<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.270> this<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.630> going<00:01:26.870> to<00:01:26.930> be

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
right hmm anyway so this is going to be

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.870 
right hmm anyway so this is going to be
a<00:01:27.050> great<00:01:27.440> way<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.680> get<00:01:28.040> in<00:01:28.220> lots<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:29.060> them<00:01:29.360> of

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
a great way to get in lots of them of

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.060 
a great way to get in lots of them of
course<00:01:31.880> though<00:01:32.120> and<00:01:32.690> calcium<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.860> we're

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
course though and calcium and we're

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.030 
course though and calcium and we're
going<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.550> use<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:35.090> food<00:01:35.390> processor<00:01:35.450> today<00:01:36.440> with

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
going to use a food processor today with

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.680 
going to use a food processor today with
the<00:01:37.190> s<00:01:37.310> plate<00:01:38.800> now<00:01:39.800> we<00:01:40.430> want<00:01:40.909> it<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.180> be<00:01:41.300> kind<00:01:41.570> of

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
the s plate now we want it to be kind of

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.510 
the s plate now we want it to be kind of
chunky<00:01:42.230> so<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:42.590> don't<00:01:42.710> want<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:42.890> blend<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.370> too

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
chunky so we don't want to blend it too

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.890 
chunky so we don't want to blend it too
much<00:01:43.670> we're<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.000> kind<00:01:44.150> of<00:01:44.210> kind<00:01:44.360> of<00:01:44.540> break<00:01:44.870> it

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
much we're just kind of kind of break it

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.600 
much we're just kind of kind of break it
up<00:01:45.080> a<00:01:45.230> little<00:01:45.260> bit<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:45.980> I'm<00:01:46.040> going<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.250> start<00:01:46.490> by

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
up a little bit so I'm going to start by

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:55.300 
up a little bit so I'm going to start by
putting<00:01:46.850> my<00:01:47.060> card<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:54.409> I'm<00:01:54.590> just<00:01:54.800> going<00:01:55.070> to

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
putting my card and I'm just going to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:10.839 
putting my card and I'm just going to
break<00:01:55.940> these<00:01:56.180> up

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.220 

now<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.269> would<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:13.170> equivalent<00:02:15.230> this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
now this would be the equivalent this

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.589 
now this would be the equivalent this
would<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.799> equivalent<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.970> our<00:02:18.209> cracked

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
would be the equivalent of our cracked

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:37.160 
would be the equivalent of our cracked
wheat<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:36.090> next<00:02:36.360> we're<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.750> put<00:02:36.989> our

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
wheat and next we're going to put our

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.580 
wheat and next we're going to put our
