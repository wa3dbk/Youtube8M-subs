00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.699
 worse than arriving late the party is 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.410
 arrive late to bring warm beer but 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.599
 there is already a way for you to 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.570
 vacilÃ£o for the coolest guy in the galley 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.970
 in a matter of minutes as with the aid 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.310
 sprint west gadget that only needs 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.260
 with four daughters and a little ice to 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.600
 transform the inedible liquid into 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.940
 cold beer in a few minutes 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.370
 the magic is done by fitting the beer into the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.770
 sprint or by placing the can or bottle 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.570
 direct contact with ice by 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.220
 to turn the beer in 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.800
 high speed 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.720
 according to the creators of spithill after 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.270
 one minute running on ice at 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.640
 beer temperature reduced by 25 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.010
 and it comes out of the package at the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.350
 to be tasted to prove it 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.079
 we tested the spithill with canned beers 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.090
 bottles of various sizes in one 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.750
 place at room temperature of 21 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.540
 degrees 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.850
 the results with cans cans and cans 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.460
 beer were great when we left 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.590
 the sprint and work for two minutes 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.700
 the beer reached the glass with 3 degrees and 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.580
 average on average 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.800
 despite all the drive to beer 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.370
 Do not burst can bottom is open and no 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.200
 rolling loss of gas taste change 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.510
 turning the cans for just one minute 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.729
 the beverage temperature did not fall below 8 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.570
 degrees and a half and required 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.220
 turn the glass already with the glass bottles 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.479
 the time and size of the bottle 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.909
 made a difference 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.130
 after one or two minutes to 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.120
 beer was always warm next to the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.299
 15 degrees 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.670
 so if you pay you pay 199 reais in the 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.049
 spithill it's good to risk the next 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.909
 shopping lists to be sold in 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.450
 helmets of 600 ml 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.450
 the name is not
