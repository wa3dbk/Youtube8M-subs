right
you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.869> beat<00:01:40.020> three<00:01:40.259> spaces<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.310> you're

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you can beat three spaces but if you're

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
you can beat three spaces but if you're
like<00:01:41.579> where<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> am<00:01:42.150> by<00:01:42.329> ahead<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.229> jump

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
like where I am by ahead you can jump

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:43.940 
like where I am by ahead you can jump
over<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
over it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
over it
so<00:01:44.159> let's<00:01:44.340> say<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.149> want<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:47.600> 3c<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.049> you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.630 
actually move the bigness our eight
spaces<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.530> must<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> say<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.520> eight

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
spaces so must I say this is eight

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850 
spaces so must I say this is eight
spaces<00:02:08.910> he<00:02:09.810> comes<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.110> contact<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.619> them<00:02:10.739> if

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860

well<00:04:26.440> goes<00:04:26.710> back<00:04:27.550> over<00:04:27.670> here<00:04:28.680> my<00:04:29.680> guitar<00:04:29.980> goes

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
well goes back over here my guitar goes

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
cuz I think it's a lot cooler of an idea

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.540 
cuz I think it's a lot cooler of an idea
just<00:06:08.050> adds<00:06:08.230> a<00:06:08.350> bit<00:06:08.530> more<00:06:08.740> fun<00:06:09.130> but<00:06:09.310> it<00:06:09.370> again
