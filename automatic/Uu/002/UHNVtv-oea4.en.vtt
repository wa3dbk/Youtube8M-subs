using<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.149> hairpin<00:00:03.600> is<00:00:03.840> an<00:00:04.049> excellent<00:00:04.410> way<00:00:04.740> to

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
using a hairpin is an excellent way to

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.639 
using a hairpin is an excellent way to
make<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> pic<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.940> hairpin<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.899> made<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.290> spring

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
make a pic the hairpin is made of spring

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.500 
make a pic the hairpin is made of spring
steel<00:00:07.799> which<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.340> ideal<00:00:08.790> material<00:00:09.150> for

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
steel which is the ideal material for

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.249 
steel which is the ideal material for
making<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:10.139> pic<00:00:11.059> now<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.120> make<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> pic<00:00:12.780> start

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
making a pic now to make the pic start

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.049 
making a pic now to make the pic start
from<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> tip<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.070> hairpin<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.790> break

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
from the tip of the hairpin and break

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.029 
from the tip of the hairpin and break
off<00:00:15.269> about<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.109> quarter<00:00:16.289> inch<00:00:16.590> lengths

of<00:00:17.250> material<00:00:20.180> spring<00:00:21.180> steel<00:00:21.539> will<00:00:21.990> break<00:00:22.289> when

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
of material spring steel will break when

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:32.920 
of material spring steel will break when
bent<00:00:23.100> back<00:00:23.430> at<00:00:23.730> 90<00:00:24.150> degrees

little ball at the end of the hairpin

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:49.000 
little ball at the end of the hairpin
with<00:00:39.500> your<00:00:39.680> long<00:00:39.920> nose<00:00:40.100> pliers

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.360 

once<00:00:49.640> this<00:00:49.820> is<00:00:50.000> done<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.989> very<00:00:51.200> tip<00:00:51.680> of<00:00:52.010> the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
once this is done the very tip of the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.010 
once this is done the very tip of the
leg<00:00:52.579> needs<00:00:52.970> to<00:00:53.150> be<00:00:53.239> bent<00:00:53.660> back<00:00:54.079> 45<00:00:54.920> degrees<00:00:55.460> and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
leg needs to be bent back 45 degrees and

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.650 
leg needs to be bent back 45 degrees and
a<00:00:57.020> lot<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.430> pressure<00:00:58.430> is<00:00:58.730> needed<00:00:58.940> actually<00:00:59.540> to

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
a lot of pressure is needed actually to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.630 
a lot of pressure is needed actually to
bend<00:00:59.870> this<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.350> use<00:01:00.890> your<00:01:01.040> back<00:01:01.340> of<00:01:01.520> your

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
bend this and use your back of your

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.729 
bend this and use your back of your
pliers<00:01:02.120> or<00:01:02.329> long<00:01:02.600> nose<00:01:02.780> pliers<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.350> grip<00:01:03.620> it

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
pliers or long nose pliers and grip it

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:16.130 
pliers or long nose pliers and grip it
very<00:01:03.949> tightly<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.580> bend

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.350 

and<00:01:16.290> once<00:01:17.160> it's<00:01:17.430> been<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.970> should<00:01:18.180> look

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and once it's been it should look

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
and once it's been it should look
something<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:21.800> very<00:01:22.800> tip

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
something like this and now the very tip

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.540 
something like this and now the very tip
of<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.720> hairpin<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.990> very<00:01:25.290> sharp<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:26.010> has<00:01:26.520> a

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
of the hairpin is very sharp or has a

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.120 
of the hairpin is very sharp or has a
sharp<00:01:26.880> edge<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.480> it<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:27.840> needs<00:01:28.800> to<00:01:28.980> be

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
sharp edge to it and needs to be

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.430 
sharp edge to it and needs to be
smoothed<00:01:29.940> out<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.720> run<00:01:30.870> smoothly<00:01:31.200> over

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
smoothed out so we can run smoothly over

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.580 
smoothed out so we can run smoothly over
the<00:01:31.650> pins<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.840> either<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.200> done<00:01:34.230> by

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the pins this can either be done by

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.010 
the pins this can either be done by
rubbing<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.220> sheet<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.670> concrete<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.480> by

rubbing it on a sheet of concrete or by

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.530 
rubbing it on a sheet of concrete or by
using<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.500> grinder<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.000> case<00:01:39.240> I'm<00:01:39.420> going

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
using a grinder in this case I'm going

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:53.870 
using a grinder in this case I'm going
to<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.690> using<00:01:39.870> a<00:01:40.080> grinder<00:01:52.370> once<00:01:53.370> you've<00:01:53.550> done

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
to be using a grinder once you've done

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.290 
to be using a grinder once you've done
this<00:01:54.120> your<00:01:54.690> hairpin<00:01:55.760> pick<00:01:56.760> feeler<00:01:57.150> is

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
this your hairpin pick feeler is

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.960 
this your hairpin pick feeler is
completed<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.770> make<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.130> little<00:01:59.400> nicer

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
completed but to make it a little nicer

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.480 
completed but to make it a little nicer
and<00:02:00.090> easier<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.570> grip<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.200> strip<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.800> black<00:02:02.070> tape

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
and easier to grip a strip of black tape

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
and easier to grip a strip of black tape
can<00:02:02.760> be<00:02:02.790> used<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.420> wrap<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.840> wrapped<00:02:04.110> around

can be used to wrap be wrapped around

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:21.720 
can be used to wrap be wrapped around
the<00:02:04.590> end<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:06.260> air<00:02:07.260> pen

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.729 

and<00:02:21.819> there<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.569> have<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.780> an<00:02:23.050> excellent

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
and there you have it an excellent
