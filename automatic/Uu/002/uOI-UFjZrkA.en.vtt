but it's just a little bit Messier I

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.590 
but it's just a little bit Messier I
personally<00:03:25.650> love<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.430> haircut<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:27.269> very

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
personally love this haircut it's very

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.170 
personally love this haircut it's very
similar<00:03:27.930> in<00:03:28.320> cut<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.010> length<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.940> first

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
similar in cut and length to the first

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.120 
similar in cut and length to the first
option<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:31.110> it's<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.320> little<00:03:31.470> bit<00:03:31.680> Messier

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
option but it's a little bit Messier

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.890 
option but it's a little bit Messier
it's<00:03:32.340> just<00:03:32.580> styled<00:03:33.000> differently<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.690> lot

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
it's just styled differently and a lot

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.110 
it's just styled differently and a lot
of<00:03:33.930> times<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:34.590> more<00:03:35.010> about<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.400> styling<00:03:35.940> of

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
of times it's more about the styling of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.570 
of times it's more about the styling of
the<00:03:36.269> hair<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.350> cut<00:03:37.590> itself<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
the hair then the cut itself and the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.600 
the hair then the cut itself and the
third<00:03:38.790> style<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.450> modern<00:03:40.019> pompadour<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.220> I

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
third style a modern pompadour and I

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.490 
third style a modern pompadour and I
think<00:03:41.850> this<00:03:42.000> would<00:03:42.150> look<00:03:42.180> great<00:03:42.450> also<00:03:43.080> but

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
think this would look great also but

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.470 
think this would look great also but
here's<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.920> deal<00:03:44.130> when<00:03:44.430> you're<00:03:44.640> going<00:03:44.880> from<00:03:45.239> a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
here's the deal when you're going from a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.020 
here's the deal when you're going from a
long<00:03:45.750> length<00:03:46.110> like<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> meal<00:03:46.739> currently<00:03:47.250> has<00:03:47.459> to

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
long length like a meal currently has to

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.060 
long length like a meal currently has to
shorter<00:03:48.450> let's<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.290> logically

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
shorter let's do it logically

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.670 
shorter let's do it logically
methodically<00:03:50.510> so<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.540> recommended<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.620> he

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
methodically so I recommended that he

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.920 
methodically so I recommended that he
actually<00:03:53.190> go<00:03:53.370> with<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.760> more<00:03:53.910> playful<00:03:54.209> messy

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
actually go with the more playful messy

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.070 
actually go with the more playful messy
medium<00:03:55.709> length<00:03:55.890> style<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.640> try<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.570> because

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
medium length style and try it because

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.780 
medium length style and try it because
if<00:03:58.290> he<00:03:58.410> doesn't<00:03:58.590> like<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.130> can<00:03:59.280> always<00:03:59.610> go

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
if he doesn't like it we can always go

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.090 
if he doesn't like it we can always go
shorter<00:04:00.209> but<00:04:00.330> if<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.570> go<00:04:00.720> shorter<00:04:01.170> first<00:04:01.470> then

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
shorter but if you go shorter first then

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.160 
shorter but if you go shorter first then
you<00:04:02.430> got<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.700> let<00:04:02.820> your<00:04:03.000> hair<00:04:03.180> grow<00:04:03.390> back<00:04:03.720> start

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
with the longer style and then you can

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.270
