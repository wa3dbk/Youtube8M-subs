touchscreen<00:02:20.370> mmm<00:02:21.370> could<00:02:21.610> be<00:02:21.760> better<00:02:22.150> i<00:02:22.270> mean

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
touchscreen mmm could be better i mean

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.750 
touchscreen mmm could be better i mean
it's<00:02:22.660> much<00:02:22.840> better<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.260> way<00:02:23.470> if<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.490> go<00:02:24.670> on

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
it's much better this way if you go on

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.330 
it's much better this way if you go on
the<00:02:24.880> back<00:02:25.030> side<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:26.230> pretty<00:02:26.770> much<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.950> same

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
the back side it's pretty much the same

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.180 
the back side it's pretty much the same
but<00:02:28.090> if<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.600> notice<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.620> two<00:02:29.830> clips

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
but if you notice that the two clips

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.920 
but if you notice that the two clips
which<00:02:30.430> used<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.850> be<00:02:31.000> on<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.540> right<00:02:31.720> on<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
which used to be on the right on the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.010 
which used to be on the right on the
left<00:02:32.200> side<00:02:32.470> are<00:02:32.770> not<00:02:33.010> there<00:02:33.310> anymore<00:02:33.580> well<00:02:34.330> the

left side are not there anymore well the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.540 
left side are not there anymore well the
reason<00:02:35.200> being<00:02:35.470> would<00:02:35.770> be<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.310> know<00:02:36.340> most

dome<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:06.010> as<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.910> remember<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:07.690> the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
dome is that as you remember in the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.250 
dome is that as you remember in the
previous<00:03:07.840> one<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:09.220> software<00:03:10.090> was<00:03:10.450> really

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
previous one the software was really

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.470 
previous one the software was really
really<00:03:11.650> slow<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.280> mean<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.820> used<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.150> give<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.450> a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
really slow I mean it used to give you a

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.300 
really slow I mean it used to give you a
hard<00:03:13.840> time<00:03:13.990> when<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.620> used<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.920> move<00:03:15.190> it

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
hard time when you used to move it

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.640 
hard time when you used to move it
around<00:03:15.400> but<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.060> time<00:03:16.120> if<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.540> notice<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.140> is

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
around but this time if you notice it is

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.699 
around but this time if you notice it is
actually<00:03:18.010> moving<00:03:19.000> with<00:03:19.600> my<00:03:19.840> finger<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.320> don't

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
actually moving with my finger I don't

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.890 
actually moving with my finger I don't
have<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.160> actually<00:03:21.400> wait<00:03:21.940> for<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.300> software

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
have to actually wait for the software

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.460 
have to actually wait for the software
so<00:03:23.530> this<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.490> really<00:03:25.150> good<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.660> mean<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.170> phones

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
so this is really good I mean the phones

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.430 
so this is really good I mean the phones
much<00:03:26.890> faster<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:28.030> firm<00:03:28.330> is<00:03:28.360> really<00:03:28.990> stable

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
much faster the firm is really stable
