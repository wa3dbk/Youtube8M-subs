00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
you'll probably make the first chair the

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.090 
you'll probably make the first chair the
wrong<00:00:46.010> size<00:00:46.690> actually<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:47.839> should<00:00:48.079> use<00:00:48.289> C<00:00:48.559> PVC

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
wrong size actually you should use C PVC

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.149 
wrong size actually you should use C PVC
cement<00:00:49.309> for<00:00:49.729> see<00:00:49.999> PVC<00:00:50.479> piping<00:00:51.019> but<00:00:51.829> it's

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
cement for see PVC piping but it's

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.189 
cement for see PVC piping but it's
orange<00:00:52.909> and<00:00:53.179> it<00:00:53.269> kind<00:00:53.449> of<00:00:53.510> looks<00:00:53.719> funny<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:54.109> the

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
orange and it kind of looks funny on the

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.789 
orange and it kind of looks funny on the
pipe<00:00:54.409> so<00:00:54.709> I'm<00:00:54.829> using<00:00:55.059> PVC<00:00:56.059> cement<00:00:56.269> and<00:00:56.799> it

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
pipe so I'm using PVC cement and it

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.270 
pipe so I'm using PVC cement and it
holds<00:00:58.579> almost<00:00:58.789> as<00:00:59.089> well<00:00:59.299> and<00:00:59.600> it's<00:00:59.780> clear

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
holds almost as well and it's clear

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.279
