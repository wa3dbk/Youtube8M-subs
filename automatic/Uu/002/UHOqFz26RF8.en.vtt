hi guys quite a lot of people ask me
about<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:07.799> Android<00:00:08.429> system<00:00:08.820> animations<00:00:09.150> and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
about my Android system animations and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.299 
about my Android system animations and
how<00:00:09.660> they<00:00:09.840> can<00:00:10.019> get<00:00:10.170> them<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.559> themselves<00:00:10.740> and

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309

as you can already see it's about those
system<00:00:22.230> animations<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.699> also<00:00:23.910> as<00:00:24.420> you

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the system animations this would be all

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.349 
the system animations this would be all
the<00:01:01.140> windows<00:01:01.440> transition<00:01:02.010> animations<00:01:02.850> then

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the windows transition animations then

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
the windows transition animations then
you<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.629> ListView<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> scrolling

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you have ListView this is the scrolling

the progress by is something a bit
different<00:01:14.400> which<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.970> possible<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
different which is possible with the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.170 
different which is possible with the
module<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.380> will<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.650> talking<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:17.580> there

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
module I will be talking because there

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.240 
module I will be talking because there
is<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> second<00:01:18.780> solution<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.439> called<00:01:19.680> xui

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is a second solution which is called xui

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850 
is a second solution which is called xui
mod<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.049> will<00:01:22.200> need<00:01:22.259> xposed

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
mod and for that you will need xposed

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.080 
mod and for that you will need xposed
framework<00:01:22.920> which<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.460> will<00:01:23.610> show<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.820> how<00:01:24.030> to

hit<00:01:58.409> install<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.490> update<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.479> prompt

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
hit install and update it will prompt

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
hit install and update it will prompt
you<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.930> update<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.920> update<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.729> once

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you to update just update it and once

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.950 
you to update just update it and once
that<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.659> done<00:02:04.040> reboot<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.450> once<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:06.630> reboot

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that is done reboot and once your reboot

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.449 
that is done reboot and once your reboot
that<00:02:07.110> your<00:02:07.229> xposed<00:02:07.560> framework<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:08.069> already

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
that your xposed framework is already

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.609 
that your xposed framework is already
working<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.420> will<00:02:09.569> need<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.289> one

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
working what you will need now is one

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.600 
working what you will need now is one
module<00:02:11.099> which<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.790> called<00:02:12.060> Xu

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
module which is called Xu

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.870 
module which is called Xu
I<00:02:12.640> might<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.320> end<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.560> xui<00:02:15.310> Mart<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.820> you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
I might just end the xui Mart and you

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.540 
I might just end the xui Mart and you
will<00:02:16.060> already<00:02:16.300> see<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:18.280> same<00:02:18.520> as

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
will already see it it's same as

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.570 
will already see it it's same as
installing<00:02:19.120> an<00:02:19.330> app<00:02:19.480> from<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.780> Play<00:02:20.470> Store<00:02:20.800> just

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
installing an app from a Play Store just

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.580 
installing an app from a Play Store just
download<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.360> install<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.750> app<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.320> will

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
download and install the app you will

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.940 
download and install the app you will
need<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.850> restart<00:02:25.090> again<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:26.290> restart<00:02:26.800> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
need to restart again just restart and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.220 
need to restart again just restart and
once<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.280> restart<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.880> enter<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.840> app<00:02:28.990> and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
once you restart it enter the app and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.440 
once you restart it enter the app and
here<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.890> can<00:02:30.040> already<00:02:30.220> see<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.150> pretty

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
here you can already see it is pretty

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.420 
here you can already see it is pretty
much<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.840> same<00:02:32.050> as<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.440> custom<00:02:32.830> room<00:02:32.980> but

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
much the same as on the custom room but

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.970 
much the same as on the custom room but
the<00:02:33.820> differences<00:02:34.570> are<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.320> animations

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
the differences are in the animations

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.100 
the differences are in the animations
and<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.160> options<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.700> will<00:02:36.880> get<00:02:37.110> animation

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
and the options you will get animation

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.670 
and the options you will get animation
control<00:02:38.850> also<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.240> is<00:02:40.360> again<00:02:40.660> all<00:02:41.560> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
control also that is again all the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.220 
control also that is again all the
windows<00:02:42.010> transition<00:02:42.459> actions<00:02:43.050> if<00:02:44.050> you're

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
windows transition actions if you're

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.050 
windows transition actions if you're
going<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:44.500> list<00:02:44.680> view<00:02:44.800> list<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.580> as<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.730> showed

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
going to list view list you as I showed

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.250 
going to list view list you as I showed
you<00:02:46.090> already<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.900> scrolling

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
you already this is the scrolling

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.040 
you already this is the scrolling
animation<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.730> want<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.090> feel<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.540> won't

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
animation and to want to I feel I won't

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.870 
animation and to want to I feel I won't
go<00:02:50.260> into<00:02:50.410> all<00:02:50.530> into<00:02:50.890> detail<00:02:51.220> because<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.730> would

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
go into all into detail because it would

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.640 
go into all into detail because it would
just<00:02:51.910> take<00:02:52.390> too<00:02:52.420> long<00:02:52.690> but<00:02:53.140> what<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.440> have<00:02:53.620> is

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
just take too long but what you have is

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.150 
just take too long but what you have is
wave<00:02:54.250> scale<00:02:54.880> alpha<00:02:55.540> deck<00:02:55.989> unfold<00:02:56.920> fold

a<00:02:59.500> few<00:02:59.680> more<00:03:00.100> here<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:01.060> module<00:03:01.450> then<00:03:01.600> on

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
a few more here in the module then on

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.660 
a few more here in the module then on
the<00:03:01.900> custom<00:03:02.230> rooms<00:03:02.440> but<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.400> always

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
the custom rooms but this is always

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.670 
the custom rooms but this is always
something<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.120> can<00:03:04.390> differ<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:05.170> also<00:03:05.410> have

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
something that can differ you also have

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.440 
something that can differ you also have
the<00:03:05.830> interpolator<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.820> can<00:03:07.030> change<00:03:07.300> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
the interpolator you can change the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.660 
the interpolator you can change the
duration<00:03:07.780> which<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.560> can<00:03:08.830> normally<00:03:09.100> do<00:03:09.550> on

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
duration which you can normally do on

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.670 
duration which you can normally do on
custom<00:03:10.060> rooms<00:03:10.209> there<00:03:10.420> are<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.600> few<00:03:11.020> real<00:03:11.410> ones

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
custom rooms there are a few real ones

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.350 
custom rooms there are a few real ones
that<00:03:11.830> have<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.160> but<00:03:12.670> otherwise<00:03:13.000> mostly

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
that have it but otherwise mostly

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.479 
that have it but otherwise mostly
doesn't<00:03:13.780> work<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.260> can<00:03:14.470> also<00:03:14.650> always<00:03:15.100> test

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
doesn't work you can also always test

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.610 
doesn't work you can also always test
the<00:03:15.670> animation<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.690> don't<00:03:17.019> have<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.350> enter

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
the animation so you don't have to enter

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.320 
the animation so you don't have to enter
an<00:03:17.739> app<00:03:17.890> just<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.340> test<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:18.850> is<00:03:19.000> no

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
an app just to test it this is no

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.900 
an app just to test it this is no
problem<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.840> can<00:03:19.959> blacklist<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.680> apps<00:03:20.910> then

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
problem you can blacklist the apps then

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.330 
problem you can blacklist the apps then
you<00:03:22.030> can<00:03:22.180> also<00:03:22.360> change<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.019> IME<00:03:23.799> animations

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
for all the animations if you use all

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.940 
for all the animations if you use all
those<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.450> can<00:03:49.660> customize<00:03:50.410> your<00:03:50.440> system

completely<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.000> make<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.420> unique

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
completely and make it a unique

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.199

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
experience just for you and I think this

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.030 
experience just for you and I think this
is<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.450> really<00:03:55.630> powerful<00:03:55.840> tool<00:03:56.230> because<00:03:56.320> it

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
is a really powerful tool because it

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.580 
is a really powerful tool because it
just<00:03:57.370> enhances<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.299> overall<00:03:58.450> experience<00:03:59.200> of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
just enhances the overall experience of

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.610 
just enhances the overall experience of
Android<00:04:00.370> everything<00:04:01.330> seems<00:04:01.630> just<00:04:01.720> nicer<00:04:02.470> and

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
Android everything seems just nicer and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.080 
Android everything seems just nicer and
different<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.670> think<00:04:03.880> that's<00:04:04.030> a

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
different and and I think that's a

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.270 
different and and I think that's a
really<00:04:04.299> nice<00:04:04.480> thing<00:04:04.890> most<00:04:05.890> of<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.130> people

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
really nice thing most of the people

really nice thing most of the people
wanted<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.670> know<00:04:06.760> how<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.120> do<00:04:07.269> this<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.720> usually

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
wanted to know how I do this I usually

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.550 
wanted to know how I do this I usually
use<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:09.610> custom<00:04:10.000> room<00:04:10.120> features<00:04:10.480> but<00:04:10.720> if<00:04:11.260> I'm

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
use the custom room features but if I'm

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.410

lazy<00:04:11.799> I<00:04:11.950> just<00:04:12.250> used<00:04:12.430> exposed<00:04:12.790> framer<00:04:13.090> because

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
lazy I just used exposed framer because

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.110 
lazy I just used exposed framer because
since<00:04:14.320> I<00:04:14.440> already<00:04:14.590> Titanium<00:04:15.430> Backup<00:04:15.459> all<00:04:16.000> the

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
since I already Titanium Backup all the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.789 
since I already Titanium Backup all the
infos<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.750> don't<00:04:16.989> need<00:04:17.140> to<00:04:17.229> change<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.530> every

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
infos I don't need to change this every

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.370 
infos I don't need to change this every
time<00:04:17.950> but<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:18.940> that's<00:04:19.269> for<00:04:19.510> this<00:04:19.660> if<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.290> have

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
time but so that's for this if you have

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.800 
time but so that's for this if you have
any<00:04:20.500> questions<00:04:21.280> about<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:22.150> installation<00:04:22.419> if

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
any questions about the installation if

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.750 
any questions about the installation if

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
you didn't know how to do it I think it

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.100 
you didn't know how to do it I think it
was<00:04:24.910> pretty<00:04:25.210> easy

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
was pretty easy

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.320 
was pretty easy
