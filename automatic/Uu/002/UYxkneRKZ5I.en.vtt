00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.650
 What you will play Mexico is night 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.510
 write and in this video that you 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.700
 also that because the points then round 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.550
 or what good wave basically this is a 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.980
 ministry could be said to be for 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.050
 get the game the new animation of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 to knife blades that is like 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.770
 our knuckles were 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.360
 galvanized or something like that but this time 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.669
 origin if what we do is that we're going to 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.310
 hit with our fists in a way 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.160
 brutal that's why the fists are broken 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.020
 in which is the war cry but 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.969
 good guys to get them what is it 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.690
 what we have to do but basically 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.579
 this is part of the achievement of winner in 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.280
 the one that we have to fill the four 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.820
 chests with the souls these four chests 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.289
 I'm showing you where more than anything 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 They find that they have to make 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.940
 Well, basically, it's killing a lot 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 zombies once we are near the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.559
 chests in the area that is close to the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.660
 chests you have to kill enough 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.450
 number of zombies until the chest is 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.970
 fill and go how many zombies are going to 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.610
 kill does not have a specific number of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.750
 zombies I do not know counted or not using 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.510
 as for what 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.700
 the zombies but good more or less if you 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.040
 it takes two waves as a wave 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 each box or so that's a 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.820
 relationship that I can give you this and what 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.830
 only one thing to do as I say 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.800
 is to fill the chests with the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.410
 souls of the zombies until this is 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.330
 chest then decide that it is already full and 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.800
 go as you can see here the only thing 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.780
 you decide to show them what is being 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.360
 how the chests are already filling 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.830
 the whole game this is only where 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.410
 it looked like that coffer in the distance 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.850
 reaches to go and only one more box is missing 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.560
 is in fact the four that are 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.620
 around the map this is the last one 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.320
 is near the church this one 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.840
 here they almost knocked me down but he was good 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.880
 epic that game but do not dare tell them 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.980
 kids is nothing more than that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.810
 fill the four chests the four 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.730
 chests with the souls of the zombies and a 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.920
 done this once they are already 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.170
 done that will give us a stamp on the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.000
 part of our where are the rounds 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.040
 up a big stamp will appear 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.530
 this big seal indicates that we can 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.240
 claim the reward the reward 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.880
 As I tell you, this is this new 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.900
 animation the fists fuzz broken that what 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.870
 The only thing we have to do is go to 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.690
 chest that is at the beginning of the map and there 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.190
 press x on the little symbol that we 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.020
 it appears the same symbols in right it 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 we will remove that symbol and with this 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.070
 and we will have new animation now 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.070
 I have to tell you something chaux these 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.720
 Cuffs are very useful for low rounds 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.120
 it's the same almost almost like knots 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.420
 hailed these fists yield up 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.090
 round 19 if I'm not wrong round 19 of 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.120
 one stroke from the 20 already 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.250
 needs more than one hit obviously is 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.630
 are two strokes from round 20 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.340
 but good what I can assure you 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.110
 is that from round 20 you need 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.010
 two strokes of agreement if I'm wrong with 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.750
 the respect to 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.909
 in which it stops working so much 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.560
 those fists well let me know in the 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.390
 comments if you liked this video by

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.840

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.349
