00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 They were born in Pakistan in Caucasus 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.220
 and her family is in the confused 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.860
 civil war there they had to go 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.179
 they are fleeing as an eleven-year-old girl 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.190
 came to Germany 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.220
 they did when they came here 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.750
 felt safe 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.539
 in that I was a child eleven years 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.310
 I did not know how old that was 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.510
 like the situation of the refugees 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.160
 here in germany is 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.660
 I did not know it was something like that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.010
 Residency obligation there are vouchers here 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.359
 It's not like that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.180
 Really heard and then me 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.950
 I became aware of myself 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.480
 not allowed to travel i may join 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.520
 my friends to hanover or after 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.629
 drive Brunswick 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.670
 I am at any time from the deportation 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.870
 threatened and I had refugees 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.030
 are not safe in germany 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.800
 have your classmates and the teachers 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.360
 actually heard in what for 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.950
 Conditions they lived first 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.680
 Of course not I do not have you 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.670
 Told by a reason we had 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 So the first day of school was first 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.940
 teaching we had politics and that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.770
 topic was asylum 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.629
 the teacher has the word on the board 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.739
 written asylum and we should just 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.229
 what to say 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.210
 and every student in turn said yes 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.159
 They come here to pay my parents 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 Do not work for the deg 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.119
 we do not need here and although 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.650
 who do not really know that we 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.729
 refugees or tolerated here in 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.369
 Germany should not work at all 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.049
 are now 23 live so shown twelve 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.860
 in germany they always fear 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.220
 still the deportation 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.439
 I'm still threatened with deportation 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.259
 For twelve years, so to speak, I have 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.520
 a condolence last year has the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.680
 Foreigners would leave 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.579
 prompt us and then 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.229
 We have a request at the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.729
 hardcopy commission and so on 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 long time of hardship commission not 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.320
 decided that we are actually here 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 stay but if the request is negative 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.020
 Then I have to go to the country 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.360
 leave 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.049
 I believe that people to 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.640
 human dignity would also be the one of 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.409
 Self-reliance also the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.060
 Freedom of movement belongs in ours 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.490
 Grundgesetz stands this wonderful sentence 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.380
 Human dignity is inviolable 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.759
 and there is not that would be the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.649
 europeans or germany 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.079
 inviolable but that is true 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.240
 unrestricted for all people 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.300
 which nation 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.670
 if we always dignity as 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.200
 stifle the death strike argument 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.020
 we political discussions or that 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.180
 necessary for that reason we mean we 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.950
 should operate appropriate policies 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.070
 and we should completely ask 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.040
 how do we accommodate asylum seekers? 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.820
 we provide you with the medical 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.640
 We give them care 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.310
 We will start with money 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.490
 or in the sense with factual content 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.410
 also pick up the vv foreigner 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.210
 maybe that's just right 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.950
 really speeds up the process 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.430
 People quickly know what they are talking about 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.530
 are 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.530
 But the basic restrictions 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.940
 insist that is absolutely correct 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.130
 I find the resident residence obligation 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.230
 was created to the refugees 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.090
 to deter those around the show 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.400
 refugees are not in germany 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.620
 welcome to say if you are 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.660
 You do not have a good life here 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.250
 you live in refugee camps for years 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.960
 you may work for me you are from the 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.640
 Residenzpflicht affected you have one 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.750
 residence pad you have to spend years 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.910
 living a refugee camp 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.780
 I see no other explanation for it 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.780
 come as relegation
