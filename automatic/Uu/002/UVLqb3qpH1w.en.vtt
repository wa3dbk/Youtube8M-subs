00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.910
 Look, I 'm the boy from London 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.400
 of hare does not show the englishman times 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.410
 what modern headball game is and because 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.090
 that does not happen that often that I do 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.830
 Close headed goal I let myself 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.740
 Now celebrate properly and get along 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.960
 by mertesacker captain today great 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.570
 header to the 1 0 for the German 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.310
 team in the 39 minute but 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.990
 I prefer not to leave 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.980
 what you just formulated that about the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.580
 English football 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.590
 why do you think he is so simple 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.270
 First of all, our under 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 team makes it really neat 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.170
 So I recognize many things again 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.270
 even if there are different players 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.850
 that's alright but that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.020
 English football and that's why 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.399
 I have your glasses leyen there 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.480
 really nothing to recognize so 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.000
 neither a game setup 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.649
 if the two defenders in the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.680
 play construction are delivered then 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 stop the ball knocking it forward 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.510
 is not even the use since the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.879
 one of them knows audience they catch 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.260
 Not a pleasant audience either 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.199
 because everyone is a little bit different 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.060
 Overall, yes, not even more 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.170
 English virtues and the greatest find 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.110
 I 'll get you then, too 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.700
 two more standard situations against him 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.770
 and two times come german players 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.930
 free to head once a goal and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.210
 Once she actually stops where she has 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.000
 but even the standard we can 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.770
 We did not have such a thing in the past 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.630
 recount earlier but slightly but 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.119
 then had trouble in the penalty area 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.990
 the Englishman survive let alone 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.250
 to come to the ball 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.509
 Now we are watching again as metal 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.369
 Singer did that, there was 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.850
 a ball confused that saw already 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.549
 good 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.229
 super horny max kruse in the second and then 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.850
 the German team stayed ahead 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.110
 a little bit of that has allowed itself to be 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.549
 celebrate a bit 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.200
 the needs that also had 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.790
 Self-confidence so and now 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.530
 Westermann comes next 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.920
 that's not the way it is 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.509
 bad read good head back there with 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.310
 the skills that has now look 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.460
 Let's face it that you can see how 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:03.640
 exemplary there 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:05.770
 the flank directly mertesacker comes 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.220
 relatively free good he always runs well 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.220
 opposite 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.330
 that is the domain of the english always 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.190
 been and she seems so a bit 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.860
 dying out of the air 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.239
 he was unthinkable in the past 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.709
 we do not profit that way anymore 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.120
 Think a lot about English football 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.500
 We move forward in the second half 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.080
 in that the german team 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 maybe if the English like that 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.530
 simply comes then perhaps one 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.430
 can do a little more there they come 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.019
 the german players 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.200
 That is reason enough for us that we 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.489
 be quiet now if you want it yes 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.690
 We were told by the right one 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.019
 you have now we have the word 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.019
 come get 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.500
 It's a pity that I'm so beautiful 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.360
 device he liked to listen to but with him 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.110
 coco if you already have to write off 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.110
 the rooneys and co
