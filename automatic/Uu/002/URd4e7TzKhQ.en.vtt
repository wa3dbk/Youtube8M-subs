00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.600 
I did is actually wired in to the
computer<00:01:46.790> took<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.970> one<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> pins<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
computer took out one of the pins and

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.830 
computer took out one of the pins and
wired<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.970> specific<00:01:51.840> pin<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:53.820> pin<00:01:54.000> 41<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> can

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
wired a specific pin to pin 41 you can

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.590 
wired a specific pin to pin 41 you can
see<00:01:54.990> with<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> little<00:01:55.439> heat<00:01:55.920> shrink<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.340> there

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
see with a little heat shrink on there

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.109 
see with a little heat shrink on there
so<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:57.719> tuner<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.200> add<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.740> custom<00:01:59.340> tune<00:01:59.850> that

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
so my tuner can add a custom tune that

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.030 
so my tuner can add a custom tune that
turns<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.600> fan<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.200> off<00:02:01.439> at<00:02:01.680> certain

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
turns the fan on and off at certain

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.100 
turns the fan on and off at certain
temperatures<00:02:02.490> which<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.820> cold<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.360> didn't<00:02:03.960> want

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
temperatures which is cold I didn't want

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
temperatures which is cold I didn't want
to<00:02:04.200> go<00:02:04.320> through<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.710> these<00:02:04.829> DCC<00:02:05.670> fan

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
to go through one of these DCC fan

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.969 
to go through one of these DCC fan
controllers<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.079> mount<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.500> somewhere<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
controllers and mount it somewhere and

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.469 
controllers and mount it somewhere and
have<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.160> deal<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.330> using

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
have to deal all that so I'm just using

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.040 
have to deal all that so I'm just using
a<00:02:09.690> relay

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
a relay

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.480 
a relay
with<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.290> fans<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.920> wire<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
with the fans that wire it to the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.900 
with the fans that wire it to the
battery<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:12.910> then<00:02:13.090> tie<00:02:13.960> right<00:02:14.200> into<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
battery and then tie right into the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.520 
battery and then tie right into the
computer<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.480> can<00:02:16.750> have<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.900> turn<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
computer so I can have it turn on and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.020 
computer so I can have it turn on and
off<00:02:17.590> exactly<00:02:17.890> what<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.310> wanted<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:18.880> like

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
off exactly what I wanted to just like

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.800 
off exactly what I wanted to just like
you<00:02:19.510> know<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.620> more<00:02:20.770> modern<00:02:21.070> cars<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.630> that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
you know the more modern cars to do that

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.470 
you know the more modern cars to do that
I<00:02:23.590> tapped<00:02:24.100> into<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.520> wire<00:02:24.790> right<00:02:25.060> here<00:02:25.330> this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
I tapped into this wire right here this

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.990 
I tapped into this wire right here this
comes<00:02:25.750> off<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.200> emissions<00:02:26.620> plug<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.820> one

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
comes off of the emissions plug this one

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.080 
comes off of the emissions plug this one
here<00:02:28.270> went<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.570> like<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.960> think<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.260> was<00:02:29.820> 35<00:02:30.820> or

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
here went to like I think it was 35 or

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.190 
here went to like I think it was 35 or
something<00:02:31.330> like<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.750> white<00:02:31.930> with<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
something like this the white with the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.290 
something like this the white with the
green<00:02:32.410> tracer<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.430> then<00:02:33.940> right<00:02:34.120> next

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
green tracer on it and then right next

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.150 
green tracer on it and then right next
to<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.780> red<00:02:35.050> one<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.380> hot<00:02:35.620> with<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
to it this red one is hot with the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.130 
to it this red one is hot with the
ignition<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.940> I'll<00:02:37.060> use<00:02:37.240> that<00:02:37.390> as<00:02:37.570> power<00:02:37.780> for

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
ignition so I'll use that as power for

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.180 
ignition so I'll use that as power for
the<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:39.310> ignition<00:02:39.700> source<00:02:39.970> other<00:02:40.570> than<00:02:40.720> that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the the ignition source other than that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.170 
the the ignition source other than that
you<00:02:42.190> know<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.490> said<00:02:42.550> haven't<00:02:42.880> gotten<00:02:43.030> to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
you know like I said haven't gotten to

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.250 
you know like I said haven't gotten to
the<00:02:43.270> dyno<00:02:43.480> don't<00:02:43.750> really<00:02:43.960> know<00:02:44.050> how<00:02:44.140> much

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the dyno don't really know how much

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.510 
the dyno don't really know how much
power<00:02:44.500> it's<00:02:44.680> gonna<00:02:44.800> make<00:02:45.010> I'm<00:02:45.160> hoping<00:02:45.370> for

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
power it's gonna make I'm hoping for

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.190 
power it's gonna make I'm hoping for
like<00:02:45.670> 4<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.030> 450<00:02:46.570> somewhere<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:46.930> there<00:02:47.050> at<00:02:47.110> the

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
like 4 to 450 somewhere in there at the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.630 
like 4 to 450 somewhere in there at the
rear<00:02:47.350> wheels<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:47.800> I'm<00:02:48.010> not<00:02:48.100> gonna<00:02:48.250> push<00:02:48.490> this
