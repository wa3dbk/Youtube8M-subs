00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
this book a 3.5 and I felt the beginning

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.140 
this book a 3.5 and I felt the beginning
of<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:23.189> almost<00:01:24.979> uneventful<00:01:26.030> thought<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
of it was almost uneventful thought the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.679 
of it was almost uneventful thought the
plot<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.450> pretty<00:01:27.900> predictable<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.119> I<00:01:30.119> didn't

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
plot was pretty predictable and I didn't

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.149 
plot was pretty predictable and I didn't
really<00:01:30.780> connect<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.350> SIA<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.040> much<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:34.159> like

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
really connect with SIA that much I like

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
really connect with SIA that much I like
to<00:01:35.369> see<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.880> character<00:01:36.299> she's<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> strong

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
to see as a character she's a strong

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
to see as a character she's a strong
female<00:01:37.380> character<00:01:37.979> which<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.310> always<00:01:38.520> great

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
female character which is always great

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.880 
female character which is always great
but<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.720> couldn't<00:01:39.930> connect<00:01:40.439> with<00:01:40.590> her<00:01:40.710> she

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
but I just couldn't connect with her she

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.719 
but I just couldn't connect with her she
was<00:01:41.009> almost<00:01:41.430> too<00:01:42.240> perfect<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:43.110> connect<00:01:43.500> with

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
was almost too perfect to connect with

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.460 
was almost too perfect to connect with
as<00:01:44.729> far<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> plot<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.780> was<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.320> know

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
as far as the plot it was you know

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.230 
as far as the plot it was you know
exciting<00:01:47.070> action-packed<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
exciting action-packed and all of that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.899 
exciting action-packed and all of that
but<00:01:48.560> when<00:01:49.560> something<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:49.979> happen<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.670> see

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
but when something would happen and see

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
but when something would happen and see
it<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.479> oh<00:01:51.750> my<00:01:51.869> gosh<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.290> didn't

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it would be like oh my gosh I didn't

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.319 
it would be like oh my gosh I didn't
think<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.890> was<00:01:52.979> gonna<00:01:53.070> happen<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:54.119> kind

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
think that was gonna happen I was kind

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.749 
think that was gonna happen I was kind
of<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.479> yeah<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.500> definitely<00:01:55.649> saw<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.579> one

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
of like yeah I definitely saw that one

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.990 
of like yeah I definitely saw that one
coming<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.079> was<00:01:58.229> kind<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.619> predictable<00:01:59.159> but

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
coming so it was kind of predictable but

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.639 
coming so it was kind of predictable but
I<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> biggest<00:02:00.600> thing<00:02:00.869> here<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
I think the biggest thing here is that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.090 
I think the biggest thing here is that
it<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.430> very<00:02:03.290> similar<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.770> Hunger<00:02:05.070> Games

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
it is very similar to the Hunger Games

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.479 
it is very similar to the Hunger Games
but<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.450> good<00:02:06.659> um<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:08.459> are

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
but not as good um I think there are

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.430 
but not as good um I think there are
rumors<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:08.879> around<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.899> similar<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
rumors going around that it's similar to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.140 
rumors going around that it's similar to
the<00:02:10.590> Hunger<00:02:10.860> Games<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.370> those<00:02:11.489> are<00:02:11.730> very<00:02:11.849> very

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the Hunger Games and those are very very

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.250 
the Hunger Games and those are very very
true<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.720> picked<00:02:13.020> out

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
true I picked out

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.619 
true I picked out
pizza's<00:02:13.830> here<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.310> they're<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.670> wow<00:02:14.849> that

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
pizza's here and they're like wow that

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.850 
pizza's here and they're like wow that
pretty<00:02:16.019> much<00:02:16.140> happened<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> hunger<00:02:16.709> games

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
pretty much happened in the hunger games

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.710 
pretty much happened in the hunger games
of<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.579> happened<00:02:17.909> in<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.090> hunger<00:02:18.329> games<00:02:18.360> too

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
of that happened in the hunger games too

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.009 
of that happened in the hunger games too
so<00:02:19.439> uh<00:02:20.189> yeah<00:02:20.909> you<00:02:20.970> hadn't<00:02:21.299> get<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> same<00:02:21.689> feel

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
so uh yeah you hadn't get the same feel

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.660 
so uh yeah you hadn't get the same feel
as<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.319> hunger<00:02:22.560> games<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> hunger

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
as the hunger games so I like the hunger

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.789 
as the hunger games so I like the hunger
games<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:24.060> lot<00:02:24.090> better<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:25.110> don't<00:02:25.560> think<00:02:25.590> this

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
games a lot better I don't think this

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.440 
games a lot better I don't think this
book<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.040> stealing<00:02:26.700> anything<00:02:26.970> from<00:02:27.209> The

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
book is stealing anything from The

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.899 
book is stealing anything from The
Hunger<00:02:27.569> Games<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.049> not<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.590> bad<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.549> is

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
Hunger Games it's not that bad but it is

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.330 
Hunger Games it's not that bad but it is
very<00:02:29.940> reminiscent<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.560> Hunger<00:02:31.799> Games<00:02:31.829> I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
very reminiscent of the Hunger Games I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.460 
very reminiscent of the Hunger Games I
like<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.940> whole<00:02:33.090> idea<00:02:33.299> about<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.870> testing

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
like the whole idea about the testing

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.199 
like the whole idea about the testing
you<00:02:34.680> know<00:02:34.829> it<00:02:35.069> was<00:02:35.220> pretty<00:02:35.280> unique<00:02:35.909> and

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
you know it was pretty unique and

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.390 
you know it was pretty unique and
interesting<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.900> intriguing<00:02:37.260> overall<00:02:38.040> I

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
interesting and intriguing overall I

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.220 
interesting and intriguing overall I
just<00:02:39.150> don't<00:02:39.329> know<00:02:39.390> why<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.569> just<00:02:39.989> wasn't

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
just don't know why I just wasn't

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.130 
just don't know why I just wasn't
totally<00:02:40.790> pulled<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.209> engaged<00:02:42.569> into<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
totally pulled and engaged into the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.530 
totally pulled and engaged into the
story<00:02:43.439> I<00:02:43.590> for<00:02:44.579> some<00:02:44.730> reason<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.060> didn't

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540

really care about a lot of the
characters<00:02:47.159> I<00:02:47.760> was<00:02:47.909> kind<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.150> like<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.540> there

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
characters I was kind of like and there

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.830 
characters I was kind of like and there
is<00:02:49.590> sort<00:02:49.859> of<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.010> romance<00:02:50.459> introduced<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.569> I

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
is sort of a romance introduced and I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.809 
is sort of a romance introduced and I
was<00:02:52.019> just<00:02:52.109> kind<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.319> ant<00:02:52.560> about<00:02:52.859> it<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.670> I

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
was just kind of ant about it I just I

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.280

don't<00:02:53.879> know<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.180> didn't<00:02:54.750> really<00:02:55.109> care

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
don't know I just didn't really care

don't know I just didn't really care
that<00:02:55.349> much<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.250> when<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.489> came<00:02:56.639> to<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.940> ending

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
that much but when it came to the ending

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.780 
that much but when it came to the ending
I<00:02:57.659> really<00:02:58.139> not<00:02:58.709> giving<00:02:58.920> any<00:02:59.159> spoilers<00:02:59.400> but

you like action packed books and you

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.910 
you like action packed books and you

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
like The Hunger Games you like divergent

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.860 
like The Hunger Games you like divergent
or<00:03:08.040> dystopian<00:03:08.609> stories<00:03:09.030> where<00:03:09.239> they<00:03:09.510> create

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
or dystopian stories where they create

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.140 
or dystopian stories where they create
this<00:03:10.049> new<00:03:10.109> sort<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.040> society<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.909> rules

this new sort of society and rules

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.569 
this new sort of society and rules
definitely<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.230> know<00:03:13.349> give<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> try<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.370> i

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
definitely you know give it a try but i

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.020 
definitely you know give it a try but i
would<00:03:14.760> say<00:03:14.940> don't<00:03:15.180> expect<00:03:15.750> anything

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
would say don't expect anything

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.890 
would say don't expect anything
fantastic<00:03:18.030> but<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.510> ending<00:03:18.959> was<00:03:19.230> very<00:03:19.290> a

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
fantastic but the ending was very a

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.110 
fantastic but the ending was very a
mind-blowing<00:03:21.900> almost<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:23.160> guess<00:03:23.639> I<00:03:23.819> kind<00:03:24.060> of

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
mind-blowing almost it I guess I kind of

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.960 
mind-blowing almost it I guess I kind of
saw<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.299> coming<00:03:24.419> but<00:03:24.959> then<00:03:25.470> again<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:26.609> was<00:03:26.790> hard

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
saw it coming but then again it was hard

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.280 
saw it coming but then again it was hard
to<00:03:27.030> conceptualize<00:03:27.419> what<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.109> ramifications

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
to conceptualize what the ramifications

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.069 
to conceptualize what the ramifications
would<00:03:29.069> be<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.609> once<00:03:30.419> you<00:03:30.540> kind<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.750> entered
