of<00:02:12.710> their<00:02:12.890> parties<00:02:13.510> really<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.720> potential<00:02:15.200> of

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
of their parties really the potential of

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.750 
of their parties really the potential of
the<00:02:15.560> country<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.010> huge

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
the country is huge

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.810 
the country is huge
because<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.940> have<00:02:20.120> about<00:02:20.480> 10<00:02:21.260> million<00:02:21.820> the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
because you have about 10 million the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:32.080 
because you have about 10 million the
colonies<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:30.140> potential<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.880> can

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
colonies and this potential you can

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.750 
colonies and this potential you can
produce<00:02:32.360> like<00:02:32.990> five<00:02:33.470> hundred<00:02:33.650> thousand<00:02:34.370> tons

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
produce like five hundred thousand tons

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:46.570 
produce like five hundred thousand tons
of<00:02:35.260> honey<00:02:36.260> with<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:45.170> works<00:02:45.410> much<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.459> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
of honey with this works much of the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.640 
of honey with this works much of the
country's<00:02:46.970> honey<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:47.600> sold<00:02:47.990> on<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.350> local
