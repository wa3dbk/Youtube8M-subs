00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
in Omaha used to say that he looked

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.700 
in Omaha used to say that he looked
through<00:00:22.830> three<00:00:23.820> things<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.600> hiring<00:00:25.590> people

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
through three things and hiring people

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
look for integrity intelligence and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.070 
look for integrity intelligence and
energy<00:00:28.950> and<00:00:29.520> he<00:00:29.670> said<00:00:29.850> if<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.420> person<00:00:30.870> didn't

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
energy and he said if that person didn't

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.569 
energy and he said if that person didn't
have<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:31.289> first<00:00:31.560> two<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.039> the<00:00:32.129> latter<00:00:32.340> two

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
have the first two that the latter two

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.430 
have the first two that the latter two
would<00:00:32.759> kill<00:00:33.000> him<00:00:33.120> because<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.170> they<00:00:34.260> don't

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
would kill him because if they don't

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.290 
would kill him because if they don't
have<00:00:34.590> integrity<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.700> want<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.940> dumb<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.270> lazy

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the most initiative but you're going to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.420 
the most initiative but you're going to
start<00:01:39.630> looking<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.140> qualitative<00:01:40.799> factors<00:01:41.010> in

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
start looking for qualitative factors in

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.830 
start looking for qualitative factors in
addition<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:42.060> everybody's<00:01:42.479> got<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> up

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
addition because everybody's got it up

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.880 
addition because everybody's got it up
right

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
right

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.889 
right
and<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.939> would<00:01:46.119> say<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.570> if<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:46.750> thought

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
and I would say that if you thought

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.600 
and I would say that if you thought
about<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.320> for<00:01:47.439> an<00:01:47.560> hour<00:01:47.649> decided<00:01:48.430> who<00:01:48.520> you're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
about it for an hour decided who you're

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.690 
behaving like them and similarly he did
the<00:05:00.960> same<00:05:01.140> thing<00:05:01.350> on<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.950> reverse<00:05:02.250> side<00:05:02.460> in

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
the same thing on the reverse side in

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.670 
the same thing on the reverse side in
terms<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:03.060> getting<00:05:03.750> rid<00:05:03.990> of<00:05:04.050> those<00:05:04.169> qualities

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
terms of getting rid of those qualities

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.279 
terms of getting rid of those qualities
so<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.250> would<00:05:05.910> suggest<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.660> if<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.110> write

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
so I would suggest that if you write

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.630 
so I would suggest that if you write
those<00:05:07.500> qualities<00:05:07.919> down<00:05:08.100> and<00:05:08.280> think<00:05:08.430> about

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
those qualities down and think about

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.500 
those qualities down and think about
them<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.789> little<00:05:08.880> while<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.300> make<00:05:09.390> them

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
them a little while and make them

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.450 
them a little while and make them
habitual<00:05:09.930> you<00:05:10.620> will<00:05:10.830> be<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.070> one<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.340> you

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
habitual you will be the one that you

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.710 
habitual you will be the one that you
want<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.640> buy<00:05:11.760> ten<00:05:12.000> percent<00:05:12.330> on<00:05:12.390> when<00:05:12.510> you<00:05:12.600> get

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
want to buy ten percent on when you get

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.760 
want to buy ten percent on when you get
all<00:05:12.840> through<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:13.200> the<00:05:13.260> beauty<00:05:13.470> of<00:05:13.500> it<00:05:13.650> is<00:05:13.740> you

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
all through and the beauty of it is you

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.230 
all through and the beauty of it is you
already<00:05:13.979> hold<00:05:14.220> 100<00:05:14.520> percent<00:05:14.850> you're<00:05:15.060> stuck

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
already hold 100 percent you're stuck

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.909 
already hold 100 percent you're stuck
with<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.539> so<00:05:15.570> you<00:05:16.169> might<00:05:16.320> as<00:05:16.380> well<00:05:16.530> might<00:05:16.770> as

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
with it so you might as well might as

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.140 
with it so you might as well might as
well<00:05:17.070> be<00:05:17.280> that<00:05:17.490> person<00:05:17.940> somebody<00:05:18.599> else<00:05:18.930> will
