00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
if someone's climbing it's quite

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.670 
if someone's climbing it's quite
difficult<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:17.030> get<00:02:17.720> really<00:02:18.140> close<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.410> them

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
difficult to get really close to them

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.490 
difficult to get really close to them
with<00:02:18.799> a<00:02:18.830> camera<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.489> not<00:02:19.730> get<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.030> their<00:02:20.209> way

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
with a camera and not get in their way

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.809 
with a camera and not get in their way
especially<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:22.010> what<00:02:22.190> they're<00:02:22.340> doing<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.790> a

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
especially if what they're doing is a

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.600 
especially if what they're doing is a
little<00:02:23.000> bit<00:02:23.239> scary<00:02:23.600> or<00:02:24.280> particularly<00:02:25.280> hard

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
little bit scary or particularly hard

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.150 
little bit scary or particularly hard
it's<00:02:26.600> quite<00:02:26.870> difficult<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.500> film<00:02:27.830> them<00:02:28.099> and

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
it's quite difficult to film them and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.280 
it's quite difficult to film them and
not<00:02:28.370> distract<00:02:28.880> them<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:30.519> which<00:02:31.519> means<00:02:31.760> that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
not distract them and which means that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.560 
not distract them and which means that
when<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.470> do<00:02:33.680> make<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> climbing<00:02:34.459> film<00:02:34.700> you

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
when you do make a climbing film you

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.650 
when you do make a climbing film you
often<00:02:36.160> film<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.370> climbing<00:02:37.880> as<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.209> happens

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
often film the climbing as it happens

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.530 
often film the climbing as it happens
but<00:02:39.470> then<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.739> go<00:02:39.980> back<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.579> you<00:02:40.910> reshoot

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
but then you go back and you reshoot

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.800 
but then you go back and you reshoot
certain<00:02:42.079> things<00:02:42.400> everything<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:43.670> saying<00:02:43.910> but

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
certain things everything is saying but

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.140 
certain things everything is saying but
instead<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.350> filming<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.250> whole<00:02:46.519> body<00:02:46.730> from<00:02:46.970> a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
instead of filming a whole body from a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.360 
instead of filming a whole body from a
distance<00:02:47.600> they<00:02:48.230> get<00:02:48.470> really<00:02:48.859> close<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.340> our

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
distance they get really close to our

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.940 
distance they get really close to our
hands<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.910> feet<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.420> do<00:02:50.600> close-up<00:02:51.109> shots<00:02:51.350> and

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
hands and feet and do close-up shots and

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.039 
hands and feet and do close-up shots and
you<00:02:52.040> actually<00:02:52.370> come<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.700> watch<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:53.000> film<00:02:53.269> they

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
you actually come to watch the film they

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:12.600 
you actually come to watch the film they
cut<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.500> such<00:02:54.739> a<00:02:54.769> way<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.459> just<00:02:55.489> looks

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.860 

so<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.640> lot<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.880> people<00:03:14.210> think<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.570> on<00:03:14.720> these

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
so a lot of people think that on these

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.810 
so a lot of people think that on these
trips<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:15.650> go<00:03:15.830> climbing<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.670> there's

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
trips you just go climbing and there's

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.140 
trips you just go climbing and there's
some<00:03:17.060> camera<00:03:17.600> hidden<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:17.990> the<00:03:18.350> corner<00:03:18.800> and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
some camera hidden in the corner and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.180 
some camera hidden in the corner and
filming<00:03:20.150> everything<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.720> happens<00:03:21.110> but<00:03:21.950> just

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
filming everything that happens but just

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.160 
filming everything that happens but just
make<00:03:22.400> films<00:03:22.820> as<00:03:22.940> good<00:03:23.090> as<00:03:23.210> real<00:03:23.390> rocky<00:03:23.750> you

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
make films as good as real rocky you

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.640 
make films as good as real rocky you
have<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.500> put<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:24.770> a<00:03:24.860> bit<00:03:25.010> more<00:03:25.190> work<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:27.500> know

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
have to put in a bit more work you know

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.100 
have to put in a bit more work you know
one<00:03:27.950> walk<00:03:28.250> into<00:03:28.730> tag<00:03:28.910> year<00:03:29.120> for<00:03:29.360> example<00:03:29.450> we

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
one walk into tag year for example we

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.740 
one walk into tag year for example we
would<00:03:30.350> stop<00:03:30.710> and<00:03:31.070> we<00:03:31.340> would<00:03:31.550> reward<00:03:32.060> sections

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
would stop and we would reward sections

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.350 
would stop and we would reward sections
so<00:03:33.530> there's<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:33.800> lot<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.160> work<00:03:34.490> that<00:03:34.520> goes<00:03:35.030> into

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
so there's a lot of work that goes into

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.600 
so there's a lot of work that goes into
getting<00:03:35.540> all<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.200> shots<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.740> you<00:03:36.860> need<00:03:37.100> to

getting all the shots that you need to

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.930 
getting all the shots that you need to
make<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.820> story<00:03:38.950> because<00:03:39.950> cameramen<00:03:40.490> have<00:03:40.760> to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
make a story because cameramen have to

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.970 
make a story because cameramen have to

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:44.179 
spectrum is all opposing we did

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:47.079 
spectrum is all opposing we did
afterwards<00:05:44.839> and<00:05:45.019> the<00:05:45.079> interviews<00:05:45.679> and<00:05:46.249> the

certain rules and certain sections that

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:54.669 
certain rules and certain sections that
was<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:52.819> work<00:05:53.029> part<00:05:53.419> I<00:05:53.719> think<00:05:54.259> as<00:05:54.649> a

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:54.679 
was the work part I think as a

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:56.469 
was the work part I think as a
professional<00:05:55.219> climber<00:05:55.399> it's<00:05:55.819> pretty<00:05:55.999> good<00:05:56.269> to

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
professional climber it's pretty good to

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.169 
professional climber it's pretty good to
like<00:05:56.629> separate<00:05:57.379> those<00:05:57.589> two<00:05:57.619> things<00:05:58.059> so<00:05:59.059> you

00:05:59.169 --> 00:05:59.179 
like separate those two things so you

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.079 
riggers that have to put these ropes
down<00:06:11.629> the<00:06:11.809> wall<00:06:11.989> and<00:06:12.409> then<00:06:13.339> sit<00:06:13.639> in<00:06:13.789> a<00:06:13.849> harness

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:14.089 
down the wall and then sit in a harness

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:17.499 
down the wall and then sit in a harness
for<00:06:14.689> like<00:06:15.039> 10<00:06:16.039> hours<00:06:16.069> or<00:06:16.610> something<00:06:17.029> and<00:06:17.239> film

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
for like 10 hours or something and film

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:23.270 
for like 10 hours or something and film
us

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:30.360 

looks<00:06:24.280> like<00:06:24.460> a<00:06:24.490> nice

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.790 

and<00:06:31.090> then<00:06:31.419> imagine<00:06:31.870> holding<00:06:32.050> a<00:06:32.380> really<00:06:32.620> big

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
and then imagine holding a really big

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.740 
and then imagine holding a really big
heavy<00:06:33.010> camera<00:06:33.400> and<00:06:33.820> pointing<00:06:34.270> it<00:06:34.360> in<00:06:34.480> the<00:06:34.570> same

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
heavy camera and pointing it in the same

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.450 
heavy camera and pointing it in the same
direction<00:06:34.990> for<00:06:35.620> hours<00:06:35.919> on<00:06:36.010> end

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
direction for hours on end

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.290 
direction for hours on end
it's<00:06:37.090> really<00:06:37.660> difficult<00:06:38.110> job
