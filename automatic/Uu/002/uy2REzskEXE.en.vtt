00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
guessing the tier 2 set because it's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
guessing the tier 2 set because it's
like<00:01:05.070> sort<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> reddish<00:01:05.729> darkish<00:01:06.150> black<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
like sort of reddish darkish black and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.620 
like sort of reddish darkish black and
then<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> middle<00:01:08.010> set<00:01:08.220> I'm<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:08.460> say<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.119> on

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
then the middle set I'm gonna say is on

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.170 
then the middle set I'm gonna say is on
a<00:01:09.689> set<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.040> bottom<00:01:11.810> probably<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
a set with the bottom probably as the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.690 
a set with the bottom probably as the
conquest<00:01:15.180> point<00:01:15.509> set<00:01:16.110> tier<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.830> that's<00:01:17.549> my

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
conquest point set tier one that's my

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330
