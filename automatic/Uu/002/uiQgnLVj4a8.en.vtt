to<00:05:17.410> you<00:05:18.410> know<00:05:18.530> I<00:05:18.770> don't<00:05:19.280> know<00:05:19.370> this<00:05:19.520> is

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
to you know I don't know this is

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.339 
to you know I don't know this is
something<00:05:19.940> about<00:05:20.090> Booker<00:05:20.510> T<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:20.870> just<00:05:21.080> seems

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
something about Booker T it just seems

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.850 
something about Booker T it just seems
like<00:05:21.590> he's<00:05:21.919> being<00:05:22.729> too<00:05:23.240> professional<00:05:23.930> I<00:05:24.349> think

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
like he's being too professional I think

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.529 
like he's being too professional I think
he<00:05:24.979> needs<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.400> let<00:05:25.520> his<00:05:25.580> guard<00:05:25.910> down<00:05:26.030> only<00:05:26.300> well

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
he needs to let his guard down only well

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.990 
he needs to let his guard down only well
or<00:05:26.840> mm<00:05:27.199> he<00:05:27.289> needs<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.680> allow<00:05:28.039> him<00:05:28.370> to<00:05:28.639> let<00:05:28.849> his

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
or mm he needs to allow him to let his

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.250 
or mm he needs to allow him to let his
guard<00:05:29.210> down<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.509> little<00:05:29.660> bit<00:05:29.990> so<00:05:31.000> don't<00:05:32.000> know

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
guard down a little bit so don't know

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.099 
guard down a little bit so don't know
it's<00:05:33.260> pretty<00:05:33.440> much<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.889> so
