first<00:03:07.530> iPad<00:03:08.510> unboxing<00:03:09.510> review<00:03:09.540> thing<00:03:10.200> on<00:03:10.410> this

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
first iPad unboxing review thing on this

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.840 
first iPad unboxing review thing on this
channel<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.510> that's<00:03:12.630> pretty<00:03:13.049> snazzy<00:03:13.850> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
channel so that's pretty snazzy the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.309 
channel so that's pretty snazzy the
rubber<00:03:15.269> bands<00:03:15.569> go<00:03:15.810> around<00:03:16.049> like<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.739> and

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
rubber bands go around like so and

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.620 
rubber bands go around like so and
that's<00:03:19.319> pretty<00:03:19.560> much<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:20.160> think<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:21.480> doesn't

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
that's pretty much I think it doesn't

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.110 
that's pretty much I think it doesn't
really<00:03:21.810> look<00:03:22.200> right<00:03:22.470> but<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.340> think<00:03:23.760> that's<00:03:23.940> how

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
really look right but I think that's how

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.199 
really look right but I think that's how
the<00:03:24.180> case<00:03:24.690> goes<00:03:24.959> in<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.410> then<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:26.220> your<00:03:26.790> Apple

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
the case goes in and then the your Apple

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.030 
the case goes in and then the your Apple
wireless<00:03:27.660> bluetooth<00:03:28.079> keyboard<00:03:28.500> goes<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.829> here

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
wireless bluetooth keyboard goes in here

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.099 
wireless bluetooth keyboard goes in here
and<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.250> don't<00:03:29.280> know<00:03:29.579> why<00:03:29.790> there's<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.120> cloth<00:03:30.450> but

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
and I don't know why there's a cloth but

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.250 
and I don't know why there's a cloth but
then<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.350> just<00:03:31.380> closes<00:03:31.859> up<00:03:32.280> like<00:03:32.639> so<00:03:33.090> with<00:03:33.989> this

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
then it just closes up like so with this

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.380 
then it just closes up like so with this
button

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
button

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.850 
button
and<00:03:36.100> then<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.400> think<00:03:37.460> these<00:03:38.620> yeah<00:03:39.620> they<00:03:39.830> just

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
and then I think these yeah they just

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.490 
and then I think these yeah they just
come<00:03:40.280> off<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.820> can<00:03:41.090> replace<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.290> can

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
come off and you can replace it you can

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.680 
come off and you can replace it you can
do<00:03:42.980> different<00:03:43.190> designs<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:43.970> everything<00:03:44.450> and

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
do different designs and everything and

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.930 
do different designs and everything and
I<00:03:45.260> actually<00:03:45.410> like<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.010> denim<00:03:46.340> better<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:46.850> I

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
I actually like the denim better and I

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.380 
I actually like the denim better and I
miss<00:03:47.390> mixes<00:03:48.260> match<00:03:48.560> these<00:03:49.040> cool<00:03:49.880> snazzy

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.420 
miss mixes match these cool snazzy
