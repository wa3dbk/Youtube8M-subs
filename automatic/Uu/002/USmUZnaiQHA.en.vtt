00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.799
 We often have ladies and gentlemen at this point and listeners 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.180
 France vs Ireland is currently not in the game, it will be 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.170
 Often at this point, of course, the connecting character of the sport 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.869
 spoken now we have the counterexample that 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.019
 took place a few days ago at the game one he is now against 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.199
 Algeria there were heavy riots riots some even spoke of football 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.109
 get all four wheels 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.779
 but understand that there are the pictures of before the game 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.980
 the Algerian national team was attacked and percent of one 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.350
 Criminal players see them in part seriously injured some 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.530
 be negotiated 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.990
 It was indeed the decision that the game should definitely be 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.220
 Algeria has come for this and so far had to come 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.620
 Lost with 0 to 2 and then there is now in this qualification 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.310
 the tie between Egypt and Algeria both reached the points 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.780
 as well as the goals and therefore today had a playoff ago 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.310
 That was then transferred to Sudan after Canton that is the country that still 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.610
 This year a few years ago in the atrium to the civil war 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.200
 faced if there could be a regular game just today 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 we now learn from Mark Webber 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.590
 15,000 police officers and allegedly 5,000 soldiers around the whole day 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.750
 Stadium strives to ensure safety 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 all for a football game that starts with football 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760
 had nothing to do 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.830
 the last minute and the first hectic Egypt in red Algeria in white 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.830
 and all together in great excitement 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.070
 an argument but without consequences served cause 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.070
 this one who needed Latifah 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.100
 Both teams are so nervous after 20 minutes a little game culture 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.390
 offered 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.950
 from Aldi 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.330
 farewell to Isabel h 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.000
 and El Hadari Egypt keeper attacks by the number of for 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.270
 Pretty yellow got the action exemplary of the level of this 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.760
 game 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.520
 the acting Africa champion rarely trusted his technical skills 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.949
 potential 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.949
 many users turn off Muhamadi and drama 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.600
 Algeria first-choice goalkeeper locked for today his replacement passes the first 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 proving ground 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.179
 the Algerians with two national champions representatives in the start eleven with 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:28.689
 Wolfsburg's Ianni 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.269
 Subtenant Bochums Anthar Yahia this is the 1 0 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
 the more active team takes the lead 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.620
 Anthar Yahia from VfL Bochum after a recovery from a hamstring injury 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.660
 Fit a perfect shot of beauty 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.660
 without flourishes 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:57.029
 his time 1 both the situation altogether so calms an international understanding 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.069
 you would have wished in the past few days 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.459
 actually the game also after the break quite for without big vs 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.939
 all we only programmed on counter 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.939
 GE Salon de La Torre 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.219
 the people are now giving thanks to Borussia Dortmund 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.379
 substitute 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.939
 Mohamed Zidan they stated with the 28th 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.319
 Insecurity in their first international match with the members parade 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.319
 a little bit 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.719
 the final phase was not only in the back 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.899
 Aboutrika 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.349
 April canceled as desired 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.529
 but many took only one you have to remember 72 07 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.219
 Algeria's replacement keeper is the instance 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
 despairing in Egypt 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.759
 Tiger is now paying her the wm participation for all the rebounds 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.699
 because the measure 1 0 win VC Tirol they are here under GPL and are at the 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.699
 World Cup here 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.979
 Celebrate the seemingly peaceful atmosphere over riots 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:10.830
 provisionally 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.830
 nothing has become known 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.150
 and this is next to an exciting game the best news of the evening 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.290
 from this patient one that the first one 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.550
 Game gives me whether took place there is already a curious story 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.350
 if that explains the FIFA so you should write very quickly my 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.200
 in March probably will not let more happen later 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.700
 occur
