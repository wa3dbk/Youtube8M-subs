inside the window and just to give you
an<00:02:40.989> idea<00:02:41.080> just<00:02:41.530> how<00:02:41.680> bright<00:02:42.040> they<00:02:42.370> are<00:02:42.989> we<00:02:43.989> can

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
an idea just how bright they are we can

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.070 
an idea just how bright they are we can
open<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.560> up<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.000> can<00:02:46.150> actually<00:02:46.660> see

open it up and then you can actually see

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.400 
open it up and then you can actually see
more<00:02:47.680> distinctly<00:02:48.160> how<00:02:48.910> bright<00:02:49.209> they<00:02:49.360> are<00:02:49.410> I'm

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
more distinctly how bright they are I'm

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.630

waiting<00:02:50.769> on<00:02:50.830> my<00:02:50.890> highway<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:51.400> they're

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
waiting on my highway so they're

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.860 
waiting on my highway so they're
supposed<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.880> be<00:02:52.000> blue<00:02:52.180> here<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.690> next

supposed to be blue here in the next
couple<00:02:53.019> days<00:02:53.230> I'll<00:02:53.650> probably<00:02:53.680> make<00:02:54.010> another

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
couple days I'll probably make another

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.100 
couple days I'll probably make another
video<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.209> meantime<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.630> just<00:02:55.780> wanted

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
video but in the meantime I just wanted

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.009 
video but in the meantime I just wanted
to<00:02:56.200> show<00:02:56.350> CPS<00:02:56.769> Authority<00:02:57.130> what<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.760> have<00:02:58.000> now

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019
