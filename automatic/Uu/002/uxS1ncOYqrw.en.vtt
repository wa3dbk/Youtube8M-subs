however<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:49.800> looks<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.969> pixelated<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
however it looks pretty pixelated I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.010 
however it looks pretty pixelated I
don't<00:00:52.020> know<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> guys<00:00:52.410> could<00:00:52.649> tell<00:00:54.020> but

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
don't know if you guys could tell but

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080 
don't know if you guys could tell but
it's<00:00:55.140> definitely<00:00:55.399> pixelated<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.520> look<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
it's definitely pixelated and look and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.279 
it's definitely pixelated and look and
to<00:00:57.180> tell<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> truth<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.870> looks<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.140> lot

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to tell you the truth it looks a lot

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.330 
to tell you the truth it looks a lot
better<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.820> PSP<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.949> doesn't<00:01:02.309> look

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
better on the PSP it just doesn't look

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
better on the PSP it just doesn't look
pixelated<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.690> obviously<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
pixelated like this obviously like it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.780 
pixelated like this obviously like it
zoom<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> takes<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> full

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
zoom in a little so it takes up the full

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.149 
zoom in a little so it takes up the full
screen<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:12.990> kind<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.290> disappointing<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
screen so it's kind of disappointing I

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.990 
screen so it's kind of disappointing I
guess<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.460> didn't<00:01:14.670> know<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> expect<00:01:15.600> but

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
guess I didn't know what to expect but

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.470 
guess I didn't know what to expect but
it<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:19.189> pixelated

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.540 

and<00:01:23.480> it<00:01:23.630> looks<00:01:23.810> significantly<00:01:24.650> crisper<00:01:25.310> and

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
and it looks significantly crisper and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.700 
and it looks significantly crisper and
clearer<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.770> PSP<00:01:28.100> itself<00:01:28.730> so<00:01:29.710> imagining

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
clearer on the PSP itself so imagining

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.670 
clearer on the PSP itself so imagining
that<00:01:30.800> when<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.040> output<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:32.450> ufd<00:01:32.930> movies<00:01:33.350> it's

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
that when you output the ufd movies it's

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.100 
that when you output the ufd movies it's
going<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:33.980> probably<00:01:34.640> look<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.300> same<00:01:36.370> I<00:01:38.110> don't

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
going to probably look the same I don't

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.200 
going to probably look the same I don't
know<00:01:39.230> I<00:01:39.500> guess<00:01:39.770> I'd<00:01:39.980> expected<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.820> be<00:01:41.000> more

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
know I guess I'd expected it to be more

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.300 
know I guess I'd expected it to be more
better<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.050> am<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.320> little<00:01:42.440> disappointed

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
better so I am a little disappointed

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.210 
better so I am a little disappointed

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
PSP once again it looks a lot better I

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.670 
PSP once again it looks a lot better I
think<00:04:11.459> on<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.360> PSP<00:04:12.660> itself<00:04:15.260> overall<00:04:16.260> kind<00:04:16.620> of

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
think on the PSP itself overall kind of

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.210 
think on the PSP itself overall kind of
disappointed<00:04:17.310> with<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.579> whole<00:04:17.760> out<00:04:18.090> putting

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
disappointed with the whole out putting

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.790 
disappointed with the whole out putting
stuff<00:04:20.220> onto<00:04:20.639> your<00:04:23.360> PSP<00:04:24.410> it's<00:04:25.410> kind<00:04:25.710> of

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
stuff onto your PSP it's kind of

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.190 
stuff onto your PSP it's kind of
disappointing<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:28.320> say<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.560> least<00:04:29.870> but<00:04:30.870> that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
disappointing to say the least but that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.370 
disappointing to say the least but that
was<00:04:31.350> just<00:04:31.910> another<00:04:32.910> example<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.750> what<00:04:34.200> you'll

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
was just another example of what you'll

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.310 
was just another example of what you'll
find<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:35.340> your<00:04:36.000> PSP<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.810> what<00:04:36.960> it's<00:04:37.110> going<00:04:37.169> to

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
find on your PSP and what it's going to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.830 
find on your PSP and what it's going to
look<00:04:37.470> like<00:04:37.530> outputting<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.639> your<00:04:38.760> TV

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.700 

overall<00:04:42.840> I'm<00:04:42.990> going<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.169> give<00:04:43.289> it<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.470> thumbs

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
overall I'm going to give it a thumbs

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.029 
overall I'm going to give it a thumbs
down<00:04:43.860> just<00:04:44.520> because<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:45.349> was<00:04:46.349> really<00:04:46.650> expecting

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
down just because I was really expecting

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.170 
down just because I was really expecting
it<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:48.020> take<00:04:49.020> up<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.380> full<00:04:49.560> screen<00:04:50.090> for<00:04:51.090> the

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
it to take up the full screen for the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.050 
it to take up the full screen for the
comic<00:04:51.630> even<00:04:52.050> -<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.860> doesn't<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.820> just

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
comic even - and it doesn't and it just

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.170 
comic even - and it doesn't and it just
looks<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.750> pixelated<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.770> know<00:04:56.520> apply<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.000> you

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
looks so pixelated I know apply it you

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.420 
looks so pixelated I know apply it you
probably<00:04:57.419> can't<00:04:57.810> tell<00:04:57.930> on<00:04:58.830> my<00:04:59.550> camera<00:04:59.849> but<00:05:01.430> it

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
probably can't tell on my camera but it

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.969 
probably can't tell on my camera but it
looks<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.270> lot<00:05:03.419> better<00:05:03.479> on<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.050> PSP<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.620> think

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
looks a lot better on the PSP I think

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.040 
looks a lot better on the PSP I think
maybe<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.400> should<00:05:05.460> try<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:08.389> do<00:05:09.389> it<00:05:09.599> here<00:05:09.810> for

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
maybe I should try and do it here for

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:18.070 
maybe I should try and do it here for
you<00:05:10.200> guys<00:05:12.289> real<00:05:13.289> quick

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080
