okay<00:04:24.090> now<00:04:24.480> in<00:04:25.260> order<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.890> maximize<00:04:26.520> amount<00:04:26.820> of

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
okay now in order to maximize amount of

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.790 
okay now in order to maximize amount of
space<00:04:27.000> on<00:04:27.060> crane<00:04:27.420> when<00:04:27.750> why<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:27.990> do<00:04:28.170> is<00:04:28.470> speed

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
space on crane when why I do is speed

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.600 
space on crane when why I do is speed
what's<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:31.890> going<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.040> make<00:04:32.160> him<00:04:32.280> do<00:04:32.430> get

getting people get slice if I move
really<00:04:35.040> quickly<00:04:35.220> chances<00:04:35.760> are<00:04:35.910> he's<00:04:36.090> not

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
really quickly chances are he's not

to swing some more technical detail try

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.600 
to swing some more technical detail try
and<00:04:45.060> try<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.920> maximize<00:04:46.920> your<00:04:47.040> efficiency<00:04:47.130> to

in there but this is my front foot now
is<00:04:51.360> it<00:04:51.420> viable<00:04:51.870> for<00:04:52.200> me<00:04:52.290> to<00:04:52.410> push<00:04:52.620> off<00:04:52.770> this

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
is it viable for me to push off this

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.640 
is it viable for me to push off this
foot<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.340> spit<00:04:53.580> yeah<00:04:53.940> yes<00:04:54.360> why<00:04:54.960> then<00:04:55.140> make

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
foot and spit yeah yes why then make

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.440 
foot and spit yeah yes why then make
another<00:04:55.890> step<00:04:56.220> not<00:04:56.700> only<00:04:56.880> have<00:04:57.030> I<00:04:57.120> brought<00:04:57.360> my

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
another step not only have I brought my

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.210 
another step not only have I brought my
shoulder<00:04:57.780> for<00:04:57.960> when<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.500> numbers<00:04:58.770> swing<00:04:59.130> the

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
shoulder for when the numbers swing the

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.220 
shoulder for when the numbers swing the
whole<00:04:59.370> way<00:04:59.490> around<00:04:59.580> see<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.390> same<00:05:00.570> so

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
a couple of Issus head of a detail

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.910 
a couple of Issus head of a detail
number<00:05:02.850> one<00:05:03.030> nice<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:03.660> slow<00:05:03.870> number<00:05:04.530> two<00:05:04.710> bang

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
number one nice and slow number two bang

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.070 
number one nice and slow number two bang
up<00:05:05.040> this<00:05:05.160> book<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:06.000> then<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.210> got<00:05:06.360> see<00:05:06.990> I'm

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
up this book and then you got see I'm

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.570 
up this book and then you got see I'm
saying<00:05:07.350> and<00:05:07.710> those<00:05:07.860> little<00:05:08.160> differences

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
saying and those little differences

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.790 
saying and those little differences
might<00:05:08.820> be<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.750> i'm<00:05:09.900> going<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.140> get<00:05:10.290> past<00:05:10.500> them

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
might be that i'm going to get past them

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.860 
might be that i'm going to get past them
so<00:05:11.340> there's<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.550> change<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.180> speed<00:05:12.450> there's<00:05:12.780> a

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
so there's a change of speed there's a

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.570 
so there's a change of speed there's a
change<00:05:13.140> of<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.350> writ<00:05:13.470> do<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.070> all<00:05:14.130> understand

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
change of the writ do you all understand

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.480 
change of the writ do you all understand
that<00:05:14.730> yes<00:05:15.660> yeah<00:05:16.200> now<00:05:16.800> next<00:05:17.100> move<00:05:17.310> it<00:05:17.400> across

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
that yes yeah now next move it across

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.909 
that yes yeah now next move it across
italy<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.600> though<00:05:18.750> i<00:05:18.780> know<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.169> splay<00:05:19.710> when<00:05:19.890> I

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
italy and though i know I splay when I

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.950 
italy and though i know I splay when I
splay<00:05:20.220> wide<00:05:20.250> eyes<00:05:20.760> on<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.000> same<00:05:21.180> problem<00:05:21.450> if

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
splay wide eyes on the same problem if

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.240 
splay wide eyes on the same problem if
you're<00:05:22.080> cool<00:05:22.200> with<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.380> balls<00:05:22.560> on<00:05:22.710> that<00:05:22.830> to

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
you're cool with the balls on that to

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.010 
you're cool with the balls on that to
eat<00:05:23.400> first<00:05:23.610> times<00:05:23.850> in<00:05:23.970> it<00:05:24.090> while<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:24.720> wanted<00:05:24.960> to

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
eat first times in it while I wanted to

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.990 
eat first times in it while I wanted to
try<00:05:25.200> and<00:05:25.260> do<00:05:25.470> is<00:05:25.980> as<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.370> balls<00:05:26.550> traveling<00:05:26.910> to

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
try and do is as the balls traveling to

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.650 
try and do is as the balls traveling to
you

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
you

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.110 
you
always<00:05:28.530> that<00:05:28.680> worry<00:05:28.800> is<00:05:29.040> so<00:05:29.310> not<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:29.850> boards

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
always that worry is so not the boards

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.790 
always that worry is so not the boards
of<00:05:30.150> space<00:05:30.360> Nate<00:05:30.570> so<00:05:31.140> as<00:05:31.260> its<00:05:31.440> traveling<00:05:31.560> I've

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
of space Nate so as its traveling I've

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.990 
of space Nate so as its traveling I've
got<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.010> opportunity<00:05:32.130> to<00:05:32.400> do<00:05:32.460> that<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:32.880> you're

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
got the opportunity to do that so you're

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.670 
got the opportunity to do that so you're
saying<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.750> then<00:05:33.960> ultimately<00:05:34.200> you're<00:05:34.590> gonna

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
saying and then ultimately you're gonna

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.470 
saying and then ultimately you're gonna
have<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.010> look<00:05:35.100> at<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.280> hall<00:05:35.460> well<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.210> really

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
have to look at the hall well I really

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.580 
have to look at the hall well I really
want<00:05:36.630> to<00:05:36.720> concentrate<00:05:36.810> on<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.320> watch<00:05:37.440> these

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
want to concentrate on to watch these

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.140 
want to concentrate on to watch these
scans<00:05:37.890> are<00:05:38.130> we<00:05:38.190> going<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:38.400> go<00:05:38.520> quite<00:05:39.120> a

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
scans are we going to go quite a

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.200 
scans are we going to go quite a
communal<00:05:40.110> in<00:05:41.070> it<00:05:41.220> I'm<00:05:41.430> though<00:05:41.640> we're<00:05:41.790> gonna<00:05:41.940> go

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.550
