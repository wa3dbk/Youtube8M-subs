00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.420 
off of old series and continuations and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
such like the Teen Titans they're

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.979 
such like the Teen Titans they're
getting<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.730> new<00:03:11.760> show<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.720> going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.870> be

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
getting a new show it's going to be

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.070 
getting a new show it's going to be
called<00:03:13.140> Teen<00:03:13.410> Titans<00:03:13.770> go<00:03:13.880> which<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:16.050> know

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
called Teen Titans go which is you know

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.920 
called Teen Titans go which is you know
it's<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:17.640> makes<00:03:17.880> sense<00:03:18.180> but<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:18.660> kind<00:03:18.870> of

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
it's it makes sense but it's kind of

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.240 
it's it makes sense but it's kind of
redundant<00:03:19.200> because<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.769> was<00:03:19.890> always<00:03:20.100> pretty

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
redundant because that was always pretty

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.729 
redundant because that was always pretty
much<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:21.090> theme<00:03:21.299> song<00:03:21.330> for<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.750> show<00:03:21.989> Teen

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
much the theme song for the show Teen

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.580 
much the theme song for the show Teen
Titans<00:03:22.890> gone<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.510> guess<00:03:25.440> they're<00:03:25.560> just

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
Titans gone and I guess they're just

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.110 
Titans gone and I guess they're just
gonna<00:03:25.739> use<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.100> same<00:03:26.250> theme<00:03:26.459> song<00:03:26.640> which

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
gonna use the same theme song which

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.680 
gonna use the same theme song which
isn't<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.660> bad<00:03:27.690> thing<00:03:27.840> but<00:03:28.670> yeah<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:30.209> kind<00:03:30.660> of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
isn't a bad thing but yeah I kind of

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.610 
isn't a bad thing but yeah I kind of
feel<00:03:30.810> like<00:03:30.870> they<00:03:31.049> could<00:03:31.170> have<00:03:31.290> given<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
feel like they could have given it a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.500 
feel like they could have given it a
better<00:03:31.769> name<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.519> works<00:03:32.670> I'm<00:03:33.120> excited
