replacing the line of shoes that have
been<00:01:17.870> more<00:01:18.020> traditional<00:01:18.560> but<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.400> 11pro<00:01:19.850> kind

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
of takes on a role that's more similar

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.680 
of takes on a role that's more similar
to<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.070> adizero<00:01:22.490> which<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.210> why<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.390> really

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
to the adizero which is why I really

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.020 
to the adizero which is why I really
compare<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.230> 11pro<00:01:24.620> Morris<00:01:25.010> to<00:01:25.160> like<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.340> more

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
compare the 11pro Morris to like a more

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.380 
compare the 11pro Morris to like a more
solid<00:01:26.510> feeling<00:01:27.130> kind<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.520> little<00:01:29.180> bit

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
solid feeling kind of a little bit

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.750 
solid feeling kind of a little bit
tougher<00:01:30.170> version<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:32.140> adizero<00:01:33.140> leather

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
tougher version of the adizero leather

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.030 
tougher version of the adizero leather
so<00:01:34.760> it's<00:01:35.540> not<00:01:35.780> if<00:01:36.470> you're<00:01:36.620> looking<00:01:36.830> for<00:01:36.980> that

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
so it's not if you're looking for that

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.560 
so it's not if you're looking for that
kind<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.340> classic<00:01:37.610> feel<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.450> you've

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
kind of classic feel that you've

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.750 
kind of classic feel that you've
probably<00:01:38.810> got<00:01:39.110> from<00:01:39.410> maybe<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.130> legend<00:01:40.610> or<00:01:40.730> a

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
probably got from maybe a legend or a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.030 
probably got from maybe a legend or a

something<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:45.800> is<00:01:45.950> reminiscent<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.610> the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
something that is reminiscent to the

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.500 
something that is reminiscent to the

i-20 line which is very popular the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.570 
i-20 line which is very popular the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
reason for being for the for the lack of

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.400 
reason for being for the for the lack of
kind<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.090> classic<00:01:53.480> feel<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.990> really<00:01:54.230> because

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
kind of classic feel is really because

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.360 
kind of classic feel is really because
you<00:01:54.500> don't<00:01:54.680> have<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.890> kangaroo<00:01:55.100> leather

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
a shoe that really is lightweight which

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.100 
a shoe that really is lightweight which
is<00:02:52.160> why<00:02:52.280> you've<00:02:52.460> seen<00:02:52.580> all<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.880> idz<00:02:53.210> Adidas

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
is why you've seen all the idz Adidas

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.370 
is why you've seen all the idz Adidas
shoes<00:02:54.290> go<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.770> lightweight<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.020> basically

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
shoes go so lightweight it's a basically

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.920 
shoes go so lightweight it's a basically
a<00:02:57.470> thin<00:02:57.680> more<00:02:57.920> flexible<00:02:58.340> plastic<00:02:58.930> definitely

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
a thin more flexible plastic definitely

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.830 
a thin more flexible plastic definitely
a<00:02:59.960> little<00:03:00.110> bit<00:03:00.200> different<00:03:00.530> from<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:01.840> adizero

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
a little bit different from the adizero

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.000 
a little bit different from the adizero
simply<00:03:03.200> because<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.530> plastic<00:03:03.860> is<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:03.980> little

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
simply because the plastic is a little

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.440 
simply because the plastic is a little
bit<00:03:04.220> thicker<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.490> little<00:03:04.700> bit<00:03:04.790> more<00:03:04.910> flexible

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
bit thicker a little bit more flexible

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.170 
bit thicker a little bit more flexible
it's<00:03:05.900> not<00:03:05.990> that<00:03:06.140> same<00:03:06.350> rigid<00:03:06.770> plastic<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:08.060> you

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
it's not that same rigid plastic and you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.520 
it's not that same rigid plastic and you
have<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.420> also<00:03:08.570> have<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:08.900> kind<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.140> little<00:03:09.350> X

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
have to also have this kind of little X

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.140 
have to also have this kind of little X
pattern<00:03:09.740> here<00:03:10.040> which<00:03:10.130> allows<00:03:10.370> for<00:03:10.400> it's

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
pattern here which allows for it's

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.610 
pattern here which allows for it's
basically<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.570> thinned<00:03:11.930> out<00:03:12.080> section<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.530> this

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
basically a thinned out section of this

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.170 
basically a thinned out section of this
whole<00:03:12.770> plate<00:03:12.980> allowing<00:03:13.760> for<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.910> little<00:03:14.090> bit

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
whole plate allowing for a little bit

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.460 
whole plate allowing for a little bit
more<00:03:14.300> flexibility<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:14.960> a<00:03:15.020> little<00:03:15.260> bit<00:03:15.350> more

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
more flexibility and a little bit more

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.330 
more flexibility and a little bit more
stability<00:03:17.140> while<00:03:18.140> that's<00:03:18.350> kind<00:03:18.740> of<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.190> little

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
stability while that's kind of a little

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.700 
stability while that's kind of a little
bit<00:03:19.490> gimmicky<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.120> find<00:03:20.660> if<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.500> are<00:03:21.620> going

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
bit gimmicky and I find if you are going

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.470 
bit gimmicky and I find if you are going
to<00:03:21.800> be<00:03:21.890> using<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.220> shoe<00:03:22.460> on<00:03:22.520> turf<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.090> may

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
to be using this shoe on turf it may

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.030 
to be using this shoe on turf it may
lead<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.750> some<00:03:24.020> stop<00:03:24.200> pressure<00:03:24.410> issues<00:03:24.770> simply

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
lead to some stop pressure issues simply

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.040 
lead to some stop pressure issues simply
because<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.370> stud<00:03:25.580> pattern<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:26.030> so<00:03:26.900> much

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
because the stud pattern is so much

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.580 
because the stud pattern is so much
thinner<00:03:27.320> under<00:03:27.680> these<00:03:27.860> two<00:03:28.100> studs<00:03:29.410> again<00:03:30.410> this

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
thinner under these two studs again this

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.140 
thinner under these two studs again this
type<00:03:30.740> pattern<00:03:31.070> on<00:03:31.160> here<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.520> a<00:03:31.550> conical

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
type pattern on here is a conical

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.240 
type pattern on here is a conical
version<00:03:32.570> of<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.870> zero<00:03:33.290> stud<00:03:33.500> pattern<00:03:33.650> so

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
version of the I zero stud pattern so

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.320 
version of the I zero stud pattern so
instead<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:34.580> triangles<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.060> have<00:03:35.210> these

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
instead of the triangles you have these

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.480 
instead of the triangles you have these
rounded<00:03:35.720> out<00:03:35.870> studs<00:03:36.170> again<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:36.950> overall<00:03:37.250> feel

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
rounded out studs again the overall feel

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.710 
rounded out studs again the overall feel
of<00:03:37.670> them<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:37.880> pretty<00:03:38.090> much<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.330> same<00:03:38.480> and

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
of them is pretty much the same and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.940 
of them is pretty much the same and
they're<00:03:39.110> pretty<00:03:39.260> much<00:03:39.470> still<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.770> same

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
they're pretty much still the same

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.110 
they're pretty much still the same
length<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:40.370> if<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.520> are<00:03:40.580> gonna<00:03:40.700> be<00:03:40.850> using<00:03:40.970> this

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
length so if you are gonna be using this

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.540 
length so if you are gonna be using this
shoe<00:03:41.270> on<00:03:41.420> turf<00:03:41.630> predominantly<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.740> may<00:03:43.040> not<00:03:43.280> be

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
shoe on turf predominantly it may not be

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.070 
shoe on turf predominantly it may not be
the<00:03:43.730> best<00:03:43.910> choice<00:03:44.150> simply<00:03:44.450> because<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.840> studs

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
the best choice simply because the studs

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.990 
the best choice simply because the studs
are<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.350> little<00:03:45.620> bit<00:03:45.710> longer<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.640> may<00:03:46.820> run

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
are a little bit longer and you may run

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.120 
are a little bit longer and you may run
into<00:03:47.210> some<00:03:47.390> stud<00:03:48.080> pressure<00:03:48.290> issues<00:03:48.710> but

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
into some stud pressure issues but

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.410 
into some stud pressure issues but
you're<00:03:49.250> gonna<00:03:49.370> be<00:03:49.490> using<00:03:49.610> these<00:03:49.790> on<00:03:50.000> grass<00:03:50.240> so

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
you're gonna be using these on grass so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.880 
you're gonna be using these on grass so
you<00:03:50.450> get<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.630> little<00:03:50.720> bit<00:03:50.870> softer<00:03:51.260> ground<00:03:51.470> this

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
you get a little bit softer ground this

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.080 
you get a little bit softer ground this
is<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.070> stud<00:03:52.310> pattern<00:03:52.460> that's<00:03:52.760> really<00:03:53.000> gonna

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
is a stud pattern that's really gonna

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.220 
is a stud pattern that's really gonna
work<00:03:53.270> well<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.660> you're<00:03:53.780> probably<00:03:53.870> going<00:03:54.140> to

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
work well and you're probably going to

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.080 
work well and you're probably going to
really<00:03:54.380> like<00:03:54.560> but<00:03:55.400> basically<00:03:55.490> this<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:55.880> the
