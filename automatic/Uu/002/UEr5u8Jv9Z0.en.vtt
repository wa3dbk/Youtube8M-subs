hi<00:00:03.590> YouTube<00:00:04.130> so<00:00:04.609> I<00:00:04.640> was<00:00:05.000> gonna<00:00:05.149> do<00:00:05.270> a<00:00:05.330> video<00:00:05.510> on

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:05.630 
hi YouTube so I was gonna do a video on

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.860 
hi YouTube so I was gonna do a video on
making<00:00:06.440> the<00:00:06.529> big<00:00:06.680> cage<00:00:06.980> completely<00:00:07.610> but<00:00:08.000> it

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
making the big cage completely but it

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.820 
making the big cage completely but it
took<00:00:09.260> forever

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
took forever

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.669 
took forever
and<00:00:10.240> it<00:00:11.240> was<00:00:11.480> actually<00:00:11.840> harder<00:00:12.500> than<00:00:12.530> I

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
and it was actually harder than I

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.190 
and it was actually harder than I
thought<00:00:13.040> so<00:00:13.460> I<00:00:13.639> decided<00:00:14.000> I<00:00:14.179> decided<00:00:14.960> I'd

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
thought so I decided I decided I'd

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.290 
thought so I decided I decided I'd
explain<00:00:15.620> how<00:00:15.860> I<00:00:15.889> did<00:00:16.130> it<00:00:16.279> so<00:00:16.910> this<00:00:17.150> isn't

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
explain how I did it so this isn't

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.040 
explain how I did it so this isn't
finished

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
finished

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.940 
finished
so<00:00:18.470> I've<00:00:18.739> cut<00:00:19.509> the<00:00:20.509> box<00:00:20.750> out<00:00:21.079> all<00:00:21.919> along<00:00:22.610> here

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
so I've cut the box out all along here

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.819 
so I've cut the box out all along here
down<00:00:24.950> here<00:00:25.029> yeah<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:26.960> then<00:00:27.259> I've<00:00:27.410> stuck<00:00:27.680> the

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
down here yeah and then I've stuck the

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.190 
down here yeah and then I've stuck the
mesh<00:00:28.009> um<00:00:28.390> cutting<00:00:29.390> it<00:00:29.480> wise<00:00:29.630> you<00:00:29.809> can<00:00:29.960> cut<00:00:30.110> it

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
mesh um cutting it wise you can cut it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.139 
mesh um cutting it wise you can cut it
those<00:00:30.439> different<00:00:30.890> ways<00:00:31.009> I<00:00:31.399> cut<00:00:31.939> it<00:00:32.029> with<00:00:32.059> a

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
those different ways I cut it with a

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.069 
those different ways I cut it with a
soldiering<00:00:32.570> iron<00:00:33.789> so<00:00:34.789> I<00:00:35.059> just<00:00:35.239> soldered<00:00:35.690> all

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
soldiering iron so I just soldered all

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.150 
soldiering iron so I just soldered all
along<00:00:36.530> it<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.219> then<00:00:37.429> just<00:00:37.730> sanded<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.390> down

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
along it and then just sanded it down

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.569 
along it and then just sanded it down
and<00:00:40.160> then<00:00:41.000> I<00:00:41.030> just<00:00:41.329> fixed<00:00:41.750> these<00:00:42.170> um<00:00:42.579> turn

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
and then I just fixed these um turn

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.049 
and then I just fixed these um turn
around<00:00:43.850> just<00:00:44.750> like<00:00:44.870> this<00:00:45.160> and<00:00:46.160> I<00:00:46.519> did<00:00:46.670> crack<00:00:46.910> it

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
around just like this and I did crack it

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.619 
around just like this and I did crack it
a<00:00:47.089> few<00:00:47.269> times<00:00:47.480> there's<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:48.050> little<00:00:48.379> crack<00:00:48.559> here

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
a few times there's a little crack here

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.380 
a few times there's a little crack here
but<00:00:50.629> they<00:00:50.719> just<00:00:50.749> got<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.050> window<00:00:51.289> just<00:00:51.320> there

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
but they just got a window just there

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.849 
but they just got a window just there
and<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.570> window<00:00:53.870> just<00:00:54.079> there<00:00:56.379> it<00:00:57.379> doesn't<00:00:57.679> take

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
and I window just there it doesn't take

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.720 
and I window just there it doesn't take
too<00:00:58.190> long<00:00:58.449> the<00:01:00.550> longest<00:01:02.800> bit<00:01:03.800> really<00:01:04.370> is

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
too long the longest bit really is

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.719 
too long the longest bit really is
cutting<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.720> out<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.110> then<00:01:06.799> cutting<00:01:07.520> all<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
cutting it out and then cutting all the

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.870 
cutting it out and then cutting all the
holes<00:01:07.939> for<00:01:08.390> or<00:01:08.869> drilling<00:01:09.380> we<00:01:09.670> did<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.700> little

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
holes for or drilling we did a little

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.219 
holes for or drilling we did a little
mark<00:01:11.060> with<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.270> soldering<00:01:11.630> iron<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.079> then

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
mark with a soldering iron and then

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.499 
mark with a soldering iron and then
drilled<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.619> rest<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.850> then<00:01:14.000> put<00:01:14.180> all<00:01:14.210> these

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
drilled the rest and then put all these

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.429 
drilled the rest and then put all these
through<00:01:14.750> took<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.049> bit<00:01:15.229> more<00:01:15.380> time<00:01:15.909> overall<00:01:17.439> to

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
through took a bit more time overall to

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.810 
through took a bit more time overall to
make<00:01:18.649> -<00:01:19.340> because<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:19.850> made<00:01:20.060> -<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:21.649> took<00:01:21.979> probably

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
make - because I made - it took probably

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.480 
make - because I made - it took probably
around<00:01:23.240> about<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:23.750> total<00:01:26.560> about<00:01:27.560> four<00:01:27.950> four

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
around about in total about four four

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.190 
around about in total about four four
and<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.610> half<00:01:28.640> hours<00:01:29.210> after<00:01:29.630> you've<00:01:29.960> kind<00:01:30.110> of

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
and a half hours after you've kind of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.899 
and a half hours after you've kind of
like<00:01:30.350> marked<00:01:30.710> everything<00:01:30.950> up<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:31.430> cut<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.789> all

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
like marked everything up and cut it all

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:32.709 
like marked everything up and cut it all
and<00:01:32.149> everything<00:01:32.240> else

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
and everything else

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.029 
and everything else
luckily<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:34.369> ones<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:35.210> hang<00:01:36.140> around<00:01:36.259> the

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
luckily the ones that hang around the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.139 
luckily the ones that hang around the
ones<00:01:37.280> from<00:01:38.259> walk<00:01:39.259> house<00:01:39.670> make<00:01:40.670> things<00:01:41.000> a

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
ones from walk house make things a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.590 
ones from walk house make things a
little<00:01:41.270> bit<00:01:41.479> easier<00:01:41.649> because<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:44.090> just<00:01:44.329> cut

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
little bit easier because we just cut

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.770 
little bit easier because we just cut
out<00:01:44.780> what's<00:01:45.289> already<00:01:45.680> like<00:01:46.130> here<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.850> then<00:01:47.750> I

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
out what's already like here and then I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.179 
out what's already like here and then I
don't<00:01:48.109> think<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.380> gonna<00:01:48.469> show<00:01:48.680> up<00:01:48.799> on<00:01:48.920> camera

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
don't think it's gonna show up on camera

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.740 
don't think it's gonna show up on camera
but<00:01:49.490> there<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:49.789> just<00:01:49.939> I<00:01:50.450> don't<00:01:50.509> if<00:01:50.659> you<00:01:50.689> can

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
but there it is just I don't if you can

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.950 
but there it is just I don't if you can
hear<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.109> a<00:01:52.359> little<00:01:53.359> kind<00:01:53.570> of<00:01:53.659> line<00:01:53.810> that

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
hear this a little kind of line that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.569 
hear this a little kind of line that
moans<00:01:54.200> all<00:01:54.469> along<00:01:55.159> here<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.979> literally<00:01:58.310> we

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
moans all along here and so literally we

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.609 
moans all along here and so literally we
just<00:01:58.759> cut<00:01:59.000> like<00:01:59.780> this<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:00.259> out<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.500> makes

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
just cut like this but out and it makes

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.859 
just cut like this but out and it makes
actually<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:04.009> decent<00:02:04.549> size<00:02:04.759> window<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.539> it's

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
actually a decent size window and it's

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.929 
actually a decent size window and it's
not<00:02:05.990> bad<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.409> end<00:02:06.439> so<00:02:07.280> now<00:02:07.579> I'm<00:02:07.729> going<00:02:07.880> to

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
not bad in the end so now I'm going to

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.680 
not bad in the end so now I'm going to
show<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.179> where<00:02:08.750> they're<00:02:08.990> already<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:09.770> set<00:02:10.039> up

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
show you where they're already in set up

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.390 
show you where they're already in set up
for<00:02:11.690> fidget

okay<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.329> I've<00:02:15.450> had<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.569> bit<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.810> things<00:02:16.049> fidgets

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
okay so I've had a bit of things fidgets
