00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
beginning of the record and then we see

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.080

that<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.890> line<00:02:05.070> continues<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.939> move<00:02:06.030> forward

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
that the line continues to move forward

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.789 
that the line continues to move forward

that we're now in relative mode what
ends<00:02:20.310> up<00:02:20.370> happening<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.060> torque<00:02:21.570> only

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
ends up happening is that torque only

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
ends up happening is that torque only
follows<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.590> movement<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> record

follows the movement of the record

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.510 
follows the movement of the record
forward<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.660> backward<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.740> you're<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.310> lift

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
forward and backward if you're to lift

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.070 
forward and backward if you're to lift
the<00:02:26.670> needle<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.120> put<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.750> different

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
the needle and put it in a different

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.400 
the needle and put it in a different
location<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:29.490> music<00:02:29.940> restarts<00:02:30.810> from<00:02:31.230> where

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
location the music restarts from where

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.860 
location the music restarts from where
it<00:02:31.500> left<00:02:31.560> off<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.120> nice<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.660> needle

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it left off so this is nice and a needle

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.360 
it left off so this is nice and a needle
happens<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.440> skip<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:34.830> anything<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.310> that

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
happens to skip or anything like that

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.060 
happens to skip or anything like that
your<00:02:36.060> music<00:02:36.150> will<00:02:36.420> stay<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.810> same<00:02:36.960> place

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.600 

just<00:02:41.070> like<00:02:41.190> that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
just like that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.280 
just like that
and<00:02:41.940> then<00:02:42.030> switching<00:02:42.300> back<00:02:42.570> into<00:02:42.900> absolute

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and then switching back into absolute

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.170 
and then switching back into absolute
mode<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:44.100> make<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.400> music<00:02:44.610> jump<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
mode will make the music jump to the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.650 
mode will make the music jump to the
current<00:02:45.450> location<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.050> needle<00:02:47.480> now<00:02:48.480> there

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
current location of the needle now there

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.210 
current location of the needle now there
are<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> couple<00:02:48.900> times<00:02:49.260> when<00:02:49.590> using<00:02:49.770> torque

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
are a couple times when using torque

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.490 
are a couple times when using torque
that<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.820> mode<00:02:51.060> will<00:02:51.240> switch<00:02:51.540> automatically

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
that the mode will switch automatically

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.160 
that the mode will switch automatically
into<00:02:53.280> relative<00:02:53.730> mode<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.660> will<00:02:54.870> occur

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
into relative mode and that will occur

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.900 
into relative mode and that will occur
anytime<00:02:55.470> you're<00:02:55.830> jumping<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.490> new<00:02:56.670> location

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
anytime you're jumping to a new location

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.150 
anytime you're jumping to a new location
and<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.540> song<00:02:57.750> or<00:02:58.230> doing<00:02:58.650> anything<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
and the song or doing anything that

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.280 
and the song or doing anything that
breaks<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.760> location<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> music<00:03:01.170> from

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
breaks the location of the music from

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.140 
breaks the location of the music from
where<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> needle<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.280> record<00:03:02.460> an

where the needle is on the record an

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.990 
where the needle is on the record an
example<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.200> creating<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.860> loop<00:03:05.040> when

example of that is creating a loop when

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.780 
example of that is creating a loop when
I<00:03:06.030> create<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> loop<00:03:06.660> here<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:08.310> music<00:03:08.640> is

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
I create a loop here the music is

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.370 
I create a loop here the music is
looping<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.540> needle<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.020> still<00:03:10.230> moving

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
another feature that we've built in here

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.350 
another feature that we've built in here
is<00:04:10.930> run<00:04:11.440> out<00:04:11.590> protection<00:04:12.010> in<00:04:12.790> case<00:04:13.090> your

record the music will continue to play

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.960 
record the music will continue to play
and<00:04:23.530> you'll<00:04:23.920> be<00:04:24.040> free<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.310> lift<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.700> needle

and you'll be free to lift the needle

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.490 
and you'll be free to lift the needle
move<00:04:25.420> it<00:04:25.540> back<00:04:25.690> near<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:25.990> beginning<00:04:26.170> of<00:04:26.440> the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
move it back near the beginning of the

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.620 
move it back near the beginning of the
record<00:04:26.710> again<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.340> then<00:04:27.790> regain<00:04:28.180> control<00:04:28.390> of

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
record again and then regain control of

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.040 
record again and then regain control of
the<00:04:28.840> music<00:04:29.280> for<00:04:30.280> example<00:04:32.400> lift<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.520> needle

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
the music for example lift the needle

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.000 
the music for example lift the needle
place<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.260> near<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.500> beginning<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.890> the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
place it near the beginning of the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.340 
place it near the beginning of the
record<00:04:36.210> let<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.300> sit<00:04:37.510> there<00:04:37.630> for<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.870> moment<00:04:38.050> and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
record let it sit there for a moment and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.800 
record let it sit there for a moment and
then<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.430> get<00:04:39.580> control<00:04:39.880> of<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.210> music<00:04:40.330> again

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
then you get control of the music again

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.410 
then you get control of the music again
so<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.620> can<00:04:41.830> keep<00:04:42.010> doing<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.490> over<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.120> over

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
so you can keep doing that over and over

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.450 
so you can keep doing that over and over
again<00:04:43.540> running<00:04:44.410> to<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.710> middle<00:04:44.950> moving<00:04:45.370> it

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
again running to the middle moving it

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.040 
again running to the middle moving it
back<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.820> beginning<00:04:46.180> again<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.660> music

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
back to the beginning again and music

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.680 
back to the beginning again and music
will<00:04:47.170> never<00:04:47.350> stop
