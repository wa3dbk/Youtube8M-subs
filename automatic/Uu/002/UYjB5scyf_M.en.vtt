00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.300 
turrets only i added shields and a bit
hull<00:02:55.879> to<00:02:56.209> sort<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.569> spicing<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.500> up<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.890> inside

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
hull to sort of spicing it up the inside

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.839 
hull to sort of spicing it up the inside
there<00:02:58.670> it's<00:02:58.879> just<00:02:59.060> basically<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.660> long

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
there it's just basically a long

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.369 
there it's just basically a long
Thunderdome<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.359> mean<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.720> didn't<00:03:03.230> use

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
Thunderdome I mean I didn't use

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.229 
Thunderdome I mean I didn't use
that<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.650> got<00:03:04.129> that<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.400> got<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.760> fight<00:03:04.970> last

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
third I'd bit I didn't use this design I

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.710 
third I'd bit I didn't use this design I
should<00:03:13.099> have<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.430> ran<00:03:13.730> out<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:13.970> time<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.420> had<00:03:14.569> to

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
Russia what I used to building in a time

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.050 
Russia what I used to building in a time
zone<00:03:18.049> it's<00:03:18.349> two<00:03:18.590> minutes<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:19.159> get<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.549> build<00:03:19.790> I

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
zone it's two minutes you get to build I

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.289 
zone it's two minutes you get to build I
think<00:03:20.890> sometimes<00:03:21.890> bring<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:22.879> was<00:03:23.120> not

but<00:03:48.110> yeah<00:03:49.360> so<00:03:50.360> nuclear<00:03:51.019> pulse<00:03:51.290> powered

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
but yeah so nuclear pulse powered

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.770 
but yeah so nuclear pulse powered
weapons<00:03:52.549> platform

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.510

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.420 
so I will look at some of the damage and
head<00:03:57.700> over<00:03:57.790> here<00:03:58.290> see<00:03:59.290> it's<00:03:59.800> good<00:04:00.010> enough<00:04:00.220> it's

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
head over here see it's good enough it's

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.370 
head over here see it's good enough it's
got<00:04:00.880> maneuver<00:04:01.360> it<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.569> know<00:04:01.690> it's<00:04:01.959> got<00:04:02.110> enough

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
got maneuver it you know it's got enough

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.410 
got maneuver it you know it's got enough
thrusters<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:03.069> maneuver<00:04:03.520> anyway<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:04.390> be

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
thrusters to maneuver anyway to be

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.790 
thrusters to maneuver anyway to be
honest<00:04:04.950> because<00:04:05.950> I'm<00:04:06.130> moving<00:04:06.459> on<00:04:06.520> thrust<00:04:06.910> now

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
honest because I'm moving on thrust now

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.110 
honest because I'm moving on thrust now
but<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:10.090> can<00:04:10.240> use<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.630> pulse<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:11.230> as<00:04:11.440> a

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
but you can use the pulse just as a

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.720 
but you can use the pulse just as a
additional<00:04:13.120> boom<00:04:14.100> no<00:04:15.419> three<00:04:16.419> two<00:04:16.720> one<00:04:17.730> right

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
additional boom no three two one right

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.060 
additional boom no three two one right
so<00:04:19.090> now<00:04:19.450> we<00:04:19.510> get<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.900> check<00:04:20.139> out<00:04:20.290> what<00:04:20.650> we<00:04:20.950> have
