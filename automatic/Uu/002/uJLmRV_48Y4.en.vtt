thing<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.900> take<00:01:09.900> all<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
thing you're going to do is take all the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.730 
thing you're going to do is take all the
tires<00:01:10.830> off<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.780> access<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
tires off so you have access to the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.990 
tires off so you have access to the
calipers<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.979> will<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.369> part<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
calipers this will be part of the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.620 
calipers this will be part of the
bleeding<00:01:18.420> procedure<00:01:20.210> next<00:01:21.210> thing<00:01:21.509> we're

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
bleeding procedure next thing we're

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
bleeding procedure next thing we're
going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> snap<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:23.130> tire<00:01:23.369> out

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
going to do is snap that little tire out

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.280 
going to do is snap that little tire out
there<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.380> remove<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.450> mass<00:01:27.869> plug

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
there so you can remove the mass plug

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.569 
there so you can remove the mass plug
onto<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.729> SBC<00:01:30.509> control<00:01:31.079> module<00:01:31.590> we're<00:01:32.549> going

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
onto the SBC control module we're going

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.410 
onto the SBC control module we're going
to<00:01:32.700> break<00:01:32.970> loose<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.299> brake<00:01:34.259> lines<00:01:35.150> make<00:01:36.150> sure

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to break loose the brake lines make sure

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.450 
to break loose the brake lines make sure
that<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> appropriate<00:01:37.770> line

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that you have the appropriate line

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.700 
that you have the appropriate line
wrenches<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.270> break<00:01:39.509> these<00:01:39.750> lines<00:01:40.110> loose<00:01:40.500> if
