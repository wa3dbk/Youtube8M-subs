00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.830
 It was personal today, let's talk a little bit about Asshole Ax. 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.210
 quim machado de assis was a genius of Brazilian literature I think everyone 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.639
 we know it's not true the world to realism in Brazil with the publication 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.130
 of posthumous memories of brass vats in the year 1881 at the end of the century 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.359
 I'm going to stay 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.839
 then Ax of Assis is a realist writer. 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.320
 and realism is that school that took the principles of 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.599
 objectivity 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.250
 of a clear coaches and third person language of a vision mode 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.950
 more intense 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.449
 The most materialist lilica is that we already speak here 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.630
 about portugal and spain the past past as long as you have a peek 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.240
 meanwhile ax of assis is a writer so peculiarly are 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.020
 peculiar 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.290
 that I would say that I 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.160
 before being realistic he is 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.630
 Machado de Assis 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.120
 that is 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.589
 luli is interesting to use the principles of the realistic school 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.249
 it uses and has 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.719
 and it is not interesting for his narrative following the realistic principles what 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.030
 that he does abandon these principles to his freedom is so exact 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.150
 because it is quite peculiar 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.050
 the first point on which the ax of action departs from realism is exactly 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.230
 when he wanted 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.119
 metaphysical why would these characters be 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.050
 characters that are 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.320
 within the physical plane characters that are not material 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.030
 the pre-premiere realism that preferred eccentric scientist character that the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.760
 materials ax of assis my roots 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.940
 brás cubas for example is the character who have already died 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.820
 and nothing else to pray meditate 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.260
 his memories so he is no longer on this physical plane, this is the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.870
 creating a character challenges this point of view is quite interesting 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.300
 because bras vats exactly because they are dead no longer depends on the judgment 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.840
 edilma casei of social action 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 which makes companies with works extremely 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.409
 clinton let people be honest 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.469
 payments of their true intentions 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.209
 with the depot criticizing society 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.389
 there is an ax point of assis and dilma the glory talk with food we 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:14.970
 We know this is not possible. 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.079
 the physical world in the world with material 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.669
 however in this tale of ax of assis these characters come to life 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.850
 exactly to discuss 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.249
 which would be more important the woman or someone 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:32.950
 then ax of assis can not be arrested realistic school recipes 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.770
 a second feature that is quite common in his works is exactly the 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.489
 existence of short chapters its four major novels memories 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.070
 posthouses of brás cubas quincas borba 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.459
 dom casmurro and we agree 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.049
 all of them were more than 100 chapters which was not uncommon 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.209
 until the existence of ax of assis 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.969
 even the chapters are pretty short you'll realize this 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.529
 when reading about star 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:00.499
 a third characteristic is precisely the use of psychological time 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:02.779
 psychiatric psychology 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:04.180
 is the time that 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.190
 The story is told 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.579
 according to the memory 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.549
 the character 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.350
 this way it breaks alinne arid 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.890
 rodrigo lived this is also novelty realism worked as tiles 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.059
 injunction 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:23.399
 the beginning ne-yo efe ax of assis mixes all this creating a true 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:24.749
 mosaic 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:25.869
 in the narration 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:30.689
 but a feature the romanticism reference note that realism is 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.739
 a school that is part of the pantic arctic circle 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.750
 so it goes the mapping of fighting AIDS is totally but 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.760
 The ax of assis in many moments in these narratives makes reference to the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.129
 cuba said 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.639
 even if it is a pioneer, but it does 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.040
 that the characteristics are not over but the decision is a 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:56.029
 writer who presents strong then ironic of débora this same of 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:57.990
 critical to this society 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.639
 It's Friday the 13th. 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.480
 and to his view it is extremely pessimistic to certify successful 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.859
 a man and society 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.689
 man has no way society is corrupt and nothing will improve 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.449
 realism did not see things this way realism still believed in a 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.789
 social solidarity does not believe it, okay? 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.379
 the ax narrators of first-person senators 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:28.289
 that makes your narrative more partial agrees with me 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.159
 when the third-person narrator 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.480
 it becomes more impartial expertise 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.110
 make that reality 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.129
 and at least theoretically has a more objective view 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.129
 if the narrator is that narrator who participates in the story that is the 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.869
 character of the story it is clear that their point of view will be told of 

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.680
 way easier 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.400
 for this reason Machado language is an ambiguous language that allows more 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.419
 of an interpretation 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.120
 under this point of view, it is not 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.310
 as the realistic school proposes. 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.520
 and finally boys and girls we can not fail to mention 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.259
 the tour marks 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.559
 for ax of assis what is digression the digression is exactly 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:14.990
 when I stop telling my story and completely changed course 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.089
 of my narrative 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.769
 then the books Ax of Assisi tells his stories of his narrators 

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:22.749
 they are counting and suddenly they stopped telling stories 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:26.379
 this tour and they bumped from beads to to do two things 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.570
 or to talk to the reader marking the interlocution then he says 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.590
 reader caught were laid out the side portista commented piglet note that 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.660
 will happen 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.740
 in the next days he marks him talk with the reader 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.249
 and he also stops telling the story 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:47.600
 the narrative itself 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.229
 For example, when your book starts you can tell us that you were 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.020
 very good life on how to start a book if it started counting went to 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.819
 the beginning of his life or the end of his life so he 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.620
 us and reference 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.120
 the narrative itself 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.199
 the narrator share with us 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.700
 the technique of the child 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.330
 are 10 such characteristics are peculiar to the ax of assis 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.250
 one more time I remembered 6 ax of assis 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.659
 is realistic but first of all he is 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.139
 Machado de Assis 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.659
 remember that boys and girls I suggest you watch our 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:28.960
 next class we will review the commander gave a new gas and these 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.949
 characteristics will be more expensive still good sixth
