00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.320
 I bring you some kind of 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.210
 minecraft a tip that I did not know until yesterday 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.800
 that is, it has not occurred to me 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.300
 that happened through my mind until yesterday that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.239
 a subscriber is talking on Skype a 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.270
 server and he told me he used a trick 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.640
 to go more secure minecraft and that's why 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.250
 I'll put the title of this video will 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.710
 I will put bodyguards in minecraft good 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.339
 as you know and here I present you 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.230
 they all know how to score goals and that 's for the 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:48.980
 who do not know about goals of plasters is that 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.880
 so be it like this one 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.899
 and then the head of the internal one on 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.970
 seen good and the same as when I eat 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.600
 in the way that is set here 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.480
 that when he went there at night 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.030
 he always had a better bodyguard and 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.580
 I was surprised as bodyguard 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.100
 same as always champion takes goals 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.730
 of iron and he takes it that way I can 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.450
 see and separate pots from my sword 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.450
 a sword 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.030
 and so it goes 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.119
 and how can you see the goal is god do not 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.429
 let alone continues to be night pass 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.880
 put together a party heart lawyers and chicken 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.490
 at least the two bodyguards have 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.359
 for me we are going to put it at night 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.359
 modern man 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.840
 I'm going to put myself in mode 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.850

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.310
 about how we can do at night 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.280
 night night night night 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.630
 the night is going to turn on fuckin lights it 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.630

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.510

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.709
 protect can not see 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.390
 there are business 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.680
 it's a way to wear bodyguards 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.680
 because a shot is dropped 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.060

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.299
