"Tiny Guide Of Multimedia Collector"

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:28.460
The Lord Of The Rings Collection - Part 1

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.460
Hello! This is the first video i'm making for the series

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.160
"Tiny Guide Of Multimedia Collector"

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.420
I'm making this video to be used as a reference for collectors of films, music

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.500
and even comic books.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.600
A lot of people do it on the internet and i'm willing to give my contribution too.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.340
On this first video i will start with the first part of my collection of Lord Of The Rings movies.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.420
Begining with the first movie of the trilogy

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.080
The Fellowship Of The Ring.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.760
I have the Collector's Editions

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.180
that are editions that came out only on the USA, we don't have brazilians editions.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.900
They came with the extended editions of the movies

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.860
with more than an hour in addition to the movie.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.634
There are four DVD's.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.440
Two with the movie and two with some extras like making-of and etc.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.000
And exclusively on this box came and extra DVD with a National Geographic Documentary.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.780
Also includes miniature statues of the "Argonath".

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.600
For those who have watched the movie, this are two statues that are

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.480
on a river.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.060
Two giant statues.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.520
I will open the box.

00:02:14.193 --> 00:02:16.193
These are the statues.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800
For those who have watched the movie.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.360
You can remember the scene that they pass between this two statues.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.920
It's cool that the statues are made of stone.

00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:37.234
It's not plastic, it's stone.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.100
These are very special editions.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.080
Made for this box.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.800
The bonus DVD.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.360
That is the documentary in DVD from National Geographic in New Zealand.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.000
It was made during the

00:03:04.054 --> 00:03:06.054
production of the movie.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.100
It shows some of the geology of

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.140
New Zealand.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.980
Where was the most part of the locations of the movie.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.180
The box comes with three cards for the Lord Of The Rings RPG game.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.100
Full colored cards.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.220
Lots of collours as you can see.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.320
An special offer to buy a litograph drawed by Alan Lee.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.640
Who is one of the guys responsible for the art conception of the movie.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.960
And a mini-magazine.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.120
From the film fan club.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.500
A demonstration of the fan club magazine.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.120
It was published during the making of the movie.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.520
The trilogy was showed during three years.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.980
A lot of things.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.240
Then it comes the box with the four extended edition DVD's.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.480
This box can be bought alone.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.800
All this I bought at amazon.com.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.620
You have the option to buy the Collector's Edition with the statues and the bonus DVD.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.240
Or just this box.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:55.260
I think today only this is available, the other there is no new one available, only used.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.300
The box came with a thick paper.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.980
The art is pretty done.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.340
It imitates a book, as the movie was based on books from Tolkien.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.760
So, each box imitates books.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.980
The inside.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.480
In digipack.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.120
Imitating a book.

00:05:27.014 --> 00:05:29.014
There is the DVD's.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.240
The four DVD's on the box.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.180
Two for the movie and two for extras.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.940
And a folder in a pretty cool paper.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.760
It is beautiful, with art from the movie, concept drawings.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.940
And with a map of the DVD content.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.880
The DVD's comes with English subtitles

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.860
There is no audio in another languages.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.200
It is for collectors only (on Brazil).

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.720
It is a pretty good piece, very well produced that we don't find on Brazil.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.600
There is nothing like this on Brazil.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.660
Well, this was the first part

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.480
of the Lord Of The Rings collection.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.920
See you later!
