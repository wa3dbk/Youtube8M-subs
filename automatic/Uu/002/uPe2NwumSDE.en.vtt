00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.330
 i 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.330
 here 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.760
 another myth another hoax 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:21.070
 the cardio empties the muscle and consumes you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.240
 muscularly the cardiovascular is to say 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.240
 treadmill 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.519
 the steps the static bicycle or be already 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.590
 run 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.309
 simply down the street is not 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.960
 advisable because it consumes you consumes you 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.110
 muscle 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.730
 so you do not have to do cardio to 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.570
 have a maximum muscle and error 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.880
 we have explained many times 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.480
 do not confuse you do not have to 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.910
 confuse 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.010
 do cardio correctly to do 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.510
 cardio incorrectly and that is wants 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.300
 correctly say logically 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.730
 we present to the course two bombs that is the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.559
 race of firefighters made Catalan 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.879
 race of the firemen that here in 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.360
 cantabria very typical the race of the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.360
 firefighters 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.390
 the prize of sant jordi of the 100 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.790
 meters thousand meters three thousand meters and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.250
 let's practice let's run because 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.600
 the goal is to find the speed and 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.400
 resistance 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.799
 what we want is to do the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.670
 cardiovascular with the aim of losing 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.830
 fat grease 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.140
 to lose fat and improve our 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.049
 our muscle tone we have already said 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 30,000 times you have to make a 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.470
 cardiovascular average intensity 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.760
 and that does not destroy muscle because at last 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.220
 and after 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.170
 what we would do would be to preserve the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.730
 muscle glycogen and make our 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.700
 body had enough time to 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.400
 dispose of the fat reserves of the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.440
 of the adipose tissue of our body 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.900
 and the formula to apply is always the 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.740
 same 220 that gives a heart before a 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.680
 cardiac arrest 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.210
 we subtract our age and apply the 60 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.490
 percent that's the ideal formula for 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.649
 know what pulsations we should go to 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.379
 do a cardio that does not consume glycogen 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.239
 in this case if it would be what the 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.860
 myth the empty cardio to the muscle you 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.019
 consume muscularly we select 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.489
 correctly we would just lose fat and 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.079
 we will keep the muscle glycogen egg 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.459
 and our muscle tone would increase 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.590
 because we could do with a lot 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.000
 ease thing that another way not 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.620
 we would lose almost fat and only 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.750
 we would lose glycogen and water 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.879
 intramuscular because the glycogen every 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.400
 gram of glycogen retains 2.8 grams of 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.470
 intramuscular water mind every gram of 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.520
 glycogen retains 28 grams of water 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.950
 intramuscular mind 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.770
 really that would be the explanation of 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.380
 why do a cardio at an intensity 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.130
 higher than our body we 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.380
 lets make us lose water 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.410
 intramuscular and therefore glycogen 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.410
 muscular 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.300
 as we see everything has 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.490
 his way of understanding it and seeing it from 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.590
 one perspective or another one has to be 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.140
 successful in the prospects in the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.110
 which we observe things in function 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.690
 that what our goal and 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.580
 function of that let's do things what 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.990
 best possible for our goal 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.040
 you get 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.160
 logically I'm not smarter than 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.160
 no one 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.760
 I do not have the truth either 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.970
 as my property 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.760
 but it is true 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.460
 that if we look at things always with 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.580
 logical and coherent arguments looking 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.850
 why we will find the key 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.350
 with the philosopher's stone with the secret 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.240
 that we often look for and do not know 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.160
 find in a miraculous product 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.850
 and in a miraculous chemical that 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.230
 sell for those strange pages but in 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.590
 do things well for a long time 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.590
 weather 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.340
 be sacrificed and perpetuated in the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.200
 tried 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.270
 but without brain 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.500
 without a brain you will never get 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.500
 your goals is to say 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.570
 if you lose brain fat instead 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.709
 of losing her body 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.940
 bear in mind that the brain almost a 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.940
 ninety-odd percent fat 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.600
 then you have to get some nuggets 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.670
 the pigs that apparently 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.740
 is what 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.680
 it is more usual in society that 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.680
 we live where the information proliferates 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.550
 but the information easy to believe that 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.889
 any computer 26 mobile computer 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.080
 with computer with internet 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.210
 information 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.800
 to see so much information ninety and 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.650
 peak percent is flawed and it's 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.240
 erroneous or interested information 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.620
 interested in the sense that it 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.090
 they want to promote a series of things 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.090
 a series of products 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.870
 that in the background they always hide a 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.009
 interest 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.499
 sometimes not even that 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:13.370
 they are only sentences that someone writes 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:17.260
 is attributed a knowledge that does not have 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.840
 therefore if you follow the one-eyed 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:24.270
 as blind 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:28.350
 you will end up thrown to a precipice 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.860
 I hope you liked this topic 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.400
 and I wait for you 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.889
 questions, worries 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.530
 as always because you at last, 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.880
 you are the engine of the program this 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.810
 program started a long time ago and what 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.810
 only I want with him 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.090
 is that you do not fall into the error of believing 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.440
 feet 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.570
 to people 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.570
 that with a mere school certificate 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.920
 schooling is to say without having obtained 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.900
 not even the school graduate 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.580
 dare to speak of things so 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.060
 complex like dietetics nutrition 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.060
 chemical kinesiology and so on 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.020
 we follow
