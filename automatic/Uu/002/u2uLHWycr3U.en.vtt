we've been pretty successful with the
Seahawks<00:00:59.430> these<00:00:59.760> past<00:00:59.969> few<00:01:00.180> years<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.440> I'm

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
Seahawks these past few years so I'm

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.130 
Seahawks these past few years so I'm
looking<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.789> at<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> walk<00:01:03.300> for

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
looking that's going to be at a walk for

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.390 
looking that's going to be at a walk for
the<00:01:04.199> record<00:01:04.350> none<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:04.949> games<00:01:05.129> are

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the record none of these games are

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.969 
the record none of these games are
mostly<00:01:05.750> when<00:01:06.750> knowing<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> Dallas<00:01:07.560> Cowboys

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
mostly when knowing the Dallas Cowboys

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.160 
mostly when knowing the Dallas Cowboys
none<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> our<00:01:08.670> games<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:08.970> easy<00:01:09.150> wins<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
none of our games are easy wins but I

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.000 
none of our games are easy wins but I
think<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> should<00:01:11.250> win<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.729> game<00:01:11.880> week<00:01:12.600> 3<00:01:13.010> we

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
think you should win that game week 3 we

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.460 
think you should win that game week 3 we
faced<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> Buccaneers<00:01:14.850> again<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.689> should<00:01:15.990> win

faced the Buccaneers again we should win

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
faced the Buccaneers again we should win

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
not going to happen again we don't

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.710 
not going to happen again we don't
repeat<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> same<00:01:27.000> performance<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.540> same

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
repeat the same performance of the same

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.060 
repeat the same performance of the same
team<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.110> than<00:01:28.229> once<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.710> doesn't<00:01:28.920> work

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
team more than once this doesn't work

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.020 
team more than once this doesn't work
that<00:01:29.220> way<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:30.920> last<00:01:31.920> game<00:01:32.220> before<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.670> bye<00:01:33.000> week

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that way a last game before the bye week

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.160 
that way a last game before the bye week
is<00:01:33.450> against<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> bears<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.619> home<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> think

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
is against the bears at home I think

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.660

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
another tough game Falcons now I think

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.220 
another tough game Falcons now I think
that<00:02:51.060> we<00:02:51.120> face<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.390> Falcons<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.990> in

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that we face the Falcons at the in

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.370 
that we face the Falcons at the in
Atlanta<00:02:53.180> I'm<00:02:54.180> excited<00:02:54.690> for<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.810> game<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.290> it

Atlanta I'm excited for that game to it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.500 
Atlanta I'm excited for that game to it
because<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.920> think<00:02:56.490> that<00:02:56.670> when<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.300> play<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
because I think that when we play the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.120 
because I think that when we play the
Falcons<00:02:57.960> we<00:02:58.050> usually<00:02:58.350> play<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.920> thought

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
Falcons we usually play the thought

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.830 
Falcons we usually play the thought

point<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.400> knowing<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.940> Dallas<00:03:33.239> Cowboys

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
point but knowing the Dallas Cowboys

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.090 
point but knowing the Dallas Cowboys
defense<00:03:33.930> they<00:03:34.050> make<00:03:34.200> any<00:03:34.290> offense<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.860> great

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100
