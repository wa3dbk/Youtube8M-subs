00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.610
 Welcome back in the game 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.750
 on the seventh and last part of the second chapter of Pilz of Monkey Island 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.059
 We stopped in the middle of the conversation and then still ninth on 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.210
 To be honest, there is something 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.919
 I'm in a sense responsible for these rides and I need them 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.119
 the s-Bahn-traffic to bring this back to order 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.429
 especially now 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.479
 n 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.849
 but who is that? 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.020
 the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.580
 since the 11th 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.200
 I have the artifacts 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.620
 Do you want for me are seven models Vito Art Forum the legendary sea 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.810
 Summon creatures that take me there 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.960
 unfortunately 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.190
 You are now the owner of Summon Cultivate Stands 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.400
 so you're the one who has to use it too 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.890
 come here and spend billions of francs 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.890
 I will teach the words of the ritual 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.120
 next to the 1 and is as with all afterwards makes into the sea 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.920
 then these words speak 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.530
 Orior pay of many countries 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.470
 Hermann Maier as creatures 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.570
 the answer to the management you want the fnp-probeabo 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 thus on the girl Euro episode 1 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.620
 These are the words for the program were logged 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.430
 that's how it is written 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.560
 When you are ready then they will push you to the right place 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.440
 unfortunately again, not Freeport 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 and all the best for the journey 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 we would have that 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.820
 Let's get this Swabians and then nothing like home 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.340
 I just have to turn back to the right 14 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.870
 indeed, worse presented Brand, thank you for being responsible 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.590
 Slowly I find that economy as the second station in which one is the smaller 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.870
 was bad 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.259
 maybe that's how it is 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.439
 others swear like the great sea creatures 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:25.149
 the Bielers 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.019
 yes this soon as far as it goes into the sea 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.589
 throw 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.189
 when emotions are cheating 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.859
 then we go 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.869
 the annual bonus you 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.869
 WS 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.039
 Ork got goosebumps 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.519
 Captain Schwegler 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.539
 MB lose western bids 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.539
 So it can start 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.119
 I'm still waiting for the length of this stupid Latakia to appear 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:11.659
 I think it was about Hofmann 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.539
 Roses 70 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:18.609
 Hospital we see there you are yes let's go let's go the chart I was let 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.979
 Hope to see you again, the Manchester runs in your sense I 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.159
 I have a wife I had to bring home and had a discussion 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.159
 stay later than I will not come with you 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:31.539
 it's rain he left open I need support around the poor little one 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:35.329
 Being able to bring boys back to their homeland always depends 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.140
 were negotiated by the community 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.669
 so you do not need me 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:43.149
 Also, I think it's better to use it to keep in mind 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.569
 Alright 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.310
 do it for me too 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.310
 certainly Absence was going to take care of her 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.219
 I will not say in the team that too the Brit cautiously a leader 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.019
 and me you can someone tell me 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.019
 that the Mainzer whether they follow this purpose of doing 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.499
 the hard ones 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.769
 Again with Kate I like the power 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.729
 forget the card now I thought in a small stream 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.729
 they make us a mockery now they are laying off I was right 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.219
 the four years 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.219
 also to the s-Bahn contract percent 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.550
 We also 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.580
 Now it's time for tennis to get away from the trade 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:32.740
 4 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.020
 we are not far there you have to say 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.639
 I'm not sure Captain Schmidt was 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.330
 I just wanted the small group this year, no idea where we want to go 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.289
 honestly 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.330
 I'm not sure if I'm going to do that now 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.150
 that suits you, that's what you want 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.150
 Just load it on course 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.580
 AR which wonderful animal life 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.979
 really let go if he then with a solid ships and blackmailed 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.360
 Crew looking for self-assessment of the world 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.919
 In our case, coincidentally, a huge hat swam on the open sea 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.480
 can one ever wish for more there? 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.039
 Investors should 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.919
 Minister Banzer around 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.370
 the US is likely to experience it in Amiens 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.479
 not really 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.259
 Apparently Maxi does not want to be satisfied with one hand alone 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.259
 He wants the whole package 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.740
 So now I'm going to take command of this ship and not after 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.650
 after an outer one 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.199
 he does not seek any tricks 5 that the little one to players 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.990
 March software update i 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.759
 but the morning is missing 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.529
 to Rome must be here a movie 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.770
 do not panic she will not do that 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.139
 she just has the instruction not to capture her he would kill 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.319
 bring no profit 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.599
 I have to give you the right answer 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.379
 an essential point of the PiratenjÃ¤ger honor code louder TCC none for the 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.360
 who is not paid so I just will not get stuck Geyer Brasch and you 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.819
 Do you think he really likes to pay him if you have a corpse in him? 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.819
 Running in this area is completely worthless 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:21.469
 Why do not you stop it all? 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:22.779
 finally more 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.969
 Together we are aiming to get to know the world through the seas only you and me 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.930
 have jointly given pillage and plunder we like 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.990
 That's how you always dreamed it 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.639
 that may sound like the industry 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.629
 I have a job to do 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.819
 besides, he is married to him 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.759
 yes, but she never lets me plunder and rob me 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.099
 of the world 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:50.529
 captain 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:53.529
 something is with the first Autorun 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.059
 you have neither the skills nor the mind Gaddafi threatens to defeat 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:04.069
 I do not need repartee for a bloody yet pushed against his chest 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.300
 the people at all 

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:13.699
 I do not have that right now 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.699
 but you should be the best 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.259
 believe something 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:39.080
 yes, atone for it 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.939
 the second chapter 

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:42.349
 already over 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:45.699
 I hope we see each other again on my next let's play 

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:50.100
 in the third chapter among the companies concerned would have a
