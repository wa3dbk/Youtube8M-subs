slow<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.300> all<00:00:21.480> get<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.960> mean<00:00:22.050> slow<00:00:22.380> changes

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
slow we all get this I mean slow changes

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.810 
slow we all get this I mean slow changes
over<00:00:23.220> time<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.529> anything<00:00:25.529> right<00:00:26.369> even<00:00:26.699> like

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
over time and anything right even like

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.339 
over time and anything right even like
you<00:00:26.970> know<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.420> least<00:00:27.630> losing<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.109> tire

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
you know the least losing of tire

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.750 
you know the least losing of tire
pressure<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:28.920> vehicle<00:00:29.250> over<00:00:29.340> time<00:00:29.609> you

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
pressure in your vehicle over time you

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.189 
pressure in your vehicle over time you
just<00:00:29.910> don't<00:00:30.119> really<00:00:30.330> notice<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.810> until<00:00:30.900> your

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
just don't really notice it until your

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.660 
just don't really notice it until your
tires<00:00:31.500> flat<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:34.500> know<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.340> great

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
tires flat but you know that's a great

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.260 
tires flat but you know that's a great
theory<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.450> methodology<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.320> an<00:00:37.380> aging<00:00:37.770> wife

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
theory and methodology for an aging wife

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.190 
theory and methodology for an aging wife
but<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.540> very<00:00:39.719> enough<00:00:39.960> when<00:00:40.110> we're

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
but it's not very enough when we're

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.990 
but it's not very enough when we're
talking<00:00:40.469> about<00:00:40.559> children<00:00:40.890> right<00:00:41.820> whose

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
talking about children right whose

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.990 
talking about children right whose
parents<00:00:42.450> aren't<00:00:42.629> noticing<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.320> they<00:00:43.530> are

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
parents aren't noticing that they are

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
parents aren't noticing that they are
obese<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.860> guess<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> makes<00:00:47.340> matters<00:00:47.550> even

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
obese and I guess it makes matters even

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.470 
obese and I guess it makes matters even
worse<00:00:47.940> because<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:50.280> factors<00:00:50.760> become<00:00:51.059> more<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
worse because as factors become more and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.350 
worse because as factors become more and
more<00:00:51.600> invisible<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> their<00:00:52.440> parents<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:54.239> know

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
more invisible to their parents you know

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.990 
more invisible to their parents you know
weight<00:00:54.660> gain<00:00:54.960> has<00:00:55.350> gradually<00:00:55.980> increased<00:00:56.640> um

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
weight gain has gradually increased um

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200 
weight gain has gradually increased um
you<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.190> know<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
you know and it's a you know the in the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
you know and it's a you know the in the
ideal<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> because<00:01:01.170> America<00:01:01.770> also<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.399> just

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
ideal and because America also is just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.230
