know<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:28.910> much<00:02:29.150> better<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.870> hand<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.440> me

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
know just much better in the hand to me

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.379 
know just much better in the hand to me
then<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.269> 920<00:02:33.049> did<00:02:34.060> we're<00:02:35.060> going<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.239> go

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
then the the 920 did we're going to go

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.879 
then the the 920 did we're going to go
and<00:02:35.510> get<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:35.720> power<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:36.109> up<00:02:36.260> but<00:02:36.530> as<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.769> can

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
and get this power it up but as you can

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:42.099 
and get this power it up but as you can
see<00:02:38.950> there's<00:02:39.950> your<00:02:40.069> SIM<00:02:40.430> card<00:02:40.730> tray<00:02:41.049> so<00:02:42.049> I

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
see there's your SIM card tray so I

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.629 
see there's your SIM card tray so I
guess<00:02:42.170> at<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.530> stage<00:02:42.829> then<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.190> got<00:02:43.310> two<00:02:43.430> SIM

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
guess at this stage then you got two SIM

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.789 
guess at this stage then you got two SIM
card<00:02:43.880> tray<00:02:43.940> at<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.810> top<00:02:45.170> along<00:02:45.530> with<00:02:45.650> your

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
card tray at the top along with your

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.210 
card tray at the top along with your
micro<00:02:46.930> USB<00:02:47.930> port<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.440> your<00:02:48.680> three-and-a-half

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
micro USB port and your three-and-a-half

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.039 
micro USB port and your three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:02:49.459> jack<00:02:49.730> now<00:02:50.660> that's<00:02:50.810> kind<00:02:51.019> of

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
millimeter jack now that's kind of

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.140 
millimeter jack now that's kind of
different<00:02:51.230> because<00:02:51.440> compared<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
different because compared to the the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.610 
different because compared to the the
920<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:56.150> know<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.599> only<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:57.079> doesn't<00:02:57.470> have

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
920 you know that only it doesn't have

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.009 
920 you know that only it doesn't have
the<00:02:57.859> microUSB<00:02:58.639> at<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.389> top<00:02:59.599> it's<00:02:59.780> on<00:02:59.900> the

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
the microUSB at the top it's on the

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.629 
the microUSB at the top it's on the
bottom<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.530> night<00:03:00.709> went<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.280> bottom

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
bottom of the night went on the bottom

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.629 
bottom of the night went on the bottom
of<00:03:01.760> this<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:02.090> don't<00:03:02.209> have<00:03:02.359> anything<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.639> then

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
of this you don't have anything and then

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.940 
of this you don't have anything and then
on<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.910> left<00:03:05.150> side<00:03:05.419> right<00:03:05.840> side<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.440> do<00:03:06.799> have

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
on the left side right side you do have

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.530 
on the left side right side you do have
the<00:03:06.980> camera<00:03:07.400> button<00:03:07.609> the<00:03:07.790> volume<00:03:08.120> rocker<00:03:08.150> and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
the camera button the volume rocker and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.860 
the camera button the volume rocker and
in<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.780> power<00:03:09.049> button<00:03:09.290> so<00:03:10.630> let's<00:03:11.630> get<00:03:11.750> this

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
in the power button so let's get this

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.449 
in the power button so let's get this
powered<00:03:12.260> up<00:03:12.380> some<00:03:12.650> juice<00:03:12.919> and<00:03:12.950> see<00:03:13.250> how<00:03:13.340> this

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
powered up some juice and see how this

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.759 
powered up some juice and see how this
goes<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.750> main<00:03:14.989> thing<00:03:15.019> with<00:03:15.349> this<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.650> has

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
goes but the main thing with this it has

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.690 
goes but the main thing with this it has
a<00:03:15.829> xenon<00:03:16.310> flash<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:16.940> back<00:03:18.340> which<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.489> lot<00:03:19.669> of

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
um with the 920 also compared let's

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.580 
um with the 920 also compared let's
compare<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.420> some<00:03:37.510> other<00:03:37.630> newer<00:03:37.930> devices<00:03:38.200> here

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
compare to some other newer devices here

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.380 
compare to some other newer devices here
it<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.770> compared<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.510> HTC<00:03:40.510> One<00:03:42.180> yeah<00:03:43.180> it's
