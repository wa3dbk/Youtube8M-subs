00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.350
 a very special design 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.510
 we have not seen that before 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.369
 see that philips often this kind of 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.090

 say with the inside to the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.870
 Make holder fixed in the charger and, in this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.190
 Also this case, base station 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.649
 see the black version a bit 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 mattig is finished with matt plastic and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.450
 the white version is really completely up 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.730
 shiny shiny plastic that so much something 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.829
 more fingerprint are more sensitive 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 well if then look at the and beyond 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.559
 look at the black versions are further 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.610
 consort the teak to each other at the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.620

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.969
 they both have the same display will 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.379
 the buttons only the colors that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.850
 differences 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.500
 yes then we actually see that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.609
 has several options 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.619
 of course you can just normal 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.990
 spoken type and a telephone number 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.430
 you can also call 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.650
 about various things like one 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.960
 phonebook to the approximately 50 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.930
 numbers can you save it you have 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.180
 then various services 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.710
 You can also use different settings 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.450
 do regarding the sound like 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.960
 you are calling or when you receive a call 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.240
 is becoming 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.920
 and in addition you also have the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.590
 eco mode which means less 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.799
 emits radiation to the environment 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 so then it adjusts the radiation to the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.220
 amount how far that say from it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.509
 base station itself is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.799
 at very far from base station is also 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.329
 of course have to send harder 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.009
 but usually if your phone is still in the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.530
 near base station and yes you have to 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.970
 he didn't map all those signals around 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.189
 so send that hence that mode there 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.990

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.979
