00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
I will be using the profile 26:26

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390 
I will be using the profile 26:26
alright<00:01:12.390> after<00:01:12.840> you've<00:01:13.350> selected<00:01:13.560> your<00:01:13.950> 8

alright after you've selected your 8
input<00:01:14.820> audio<00:01:15.090> interface<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.080> want<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.409> make

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
input audio interface you want to make

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.600 
input audio interface you want to make
sure<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.100> using<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.490> correct

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
sure that you're using the correct

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.270 
sure that you're using the correct
number<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.720> tracks<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.610> inputs<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.840> that

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
number of tracks or inputs so to do that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.440 
number of tracks or inputs so to do that
we<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.430> change<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> number<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.150> because<00:01:24.240> we

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
we can change the number here because we

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.740 
we can change the number here because we
don't<00:01:24.570> want<00:01:24.780> stereo<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.500> said<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:25.950> 8

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
don't want stereo like I said we want 8

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.920 
don't want stereo like I said we want 8
so<00:01:27.750> let's<00:01:27.900> zoom<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> bit<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> select<00:01:29.100> 8

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
so let's zoom out a bit and select 8

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.630 
so let's zoom out a bit and select 8
perfect<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> select<00:01:32.400> our

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
perfect now we want to select our

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.660 
perfect now we want to select our
outputs<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.950> over<00:01:35.189> here<00:01:35.549> in

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
outputs so we can do that over here in

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.560 
outputs so we can do that over here in
this<00:01:36.299> section<00:01:36.950> look<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.460> speaker<00:01:39.420> icon

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
this section look for the speaker icon

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.600 
this section look for the speaker icon
and<00:01:40.070> again<00:01:41.070> choose<00:01:41.700> from<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> following<00:01:42.509> and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
and again choose from the following and

and again choose from the following and
basically<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.850> choose<00:01:45.360> whatever<00:01:45.570> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
basically you can choose whatever you

want
again<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> go<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.470> audio

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
again I want to go out of the the audio

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.620 
again I want to go out of the the audio
interface<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.759> using<00:01:50.939> before<00:01:51.060> which

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
interface that I was using before which

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
interface that I was using before which
is<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.899> profile<00:01:52.320> 26:26<00:01:53.189> let's<00:01:53.939> zoom<00:01:54.180> out<00:01:55.159> ok

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
is the profile 26:26 let's zoom out ok

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.999 
is the profile 26:26 let's zoom out ok
now<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.020> set<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.829> start

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
now that that is set up we can start

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.580 
now that that is set up we can start
recording<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.700> simply<00:02:00.600> record<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.560> can

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
recording and simply record we can

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.399 
recording and simply record we can
cruise<00:02:02.009> up<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.719> upper<00:02:03.719> left-hand<00:02:04.229> corner

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
cruise up to the upper left-hand corner
