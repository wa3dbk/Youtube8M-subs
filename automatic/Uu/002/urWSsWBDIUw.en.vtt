we<00:00:05.490> need<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:06.060> review<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.600> multiplication

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
we need to review the multiplication

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.370 
we need to review the multiplication
properties<00:00:08.030> yeah<00:00:09.090> not<00:00:09.780> again

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
properties yeah not again

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.549 
properties yeah not again
I<00:00:10.410> just<00:00:10.950> don't<00:00:11.219> understand<00:00:11.910> them<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:13.259> need<00:00:13.500> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
I just don't understand them you need to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.670 
I just don't understand them you need to
know<00:00:13.799> them<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.099> let's<00:00:14.549> start<00:00:15.000> our<00:00:15.210> review<00:00:15.680> so

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
know them so let's start our review so

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.700 
know them so let's start our review so
what<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.310> first<00:00:17.550> property<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:19.080> identity

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
what is the first property the identity

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.460 
what is the first property the identity
property<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.090> explain<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.779> identity

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
property can you explain the identity

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.519 
property can you explain the identity
property<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.220> me<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
property to me I just know it has the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.830 
property to me I just know it has the
word<00:00:25.710> identity<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.480> my<00:00:27.660> own

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
word identity in it I have my own

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.700 
word identity in it I have my own
identity<00:00:28.640> yes<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.470> your

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
identity yes you do and just like your

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.870 
identity yes you do and just like your
own<00:00:31.920> identity

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
own identity

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.220 
own identity
it<00:00:33.059> doesn't<00:00:33.540> change<00:00:34.070> huh<00:00:35.090> for<00:00:36.090> example<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:36.870> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
it doesn't change huh for example if you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.440 
it doesn't change huh for example if you
put<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.950> hat<00:00:38.219> has<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> changed<00:00:38.910> who<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
put on one hat has that changed who you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.740 
put on one hat has that changed who you
are<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.500> changed<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:41.040> identity<00:00:41.719> no<00:00:42.719> I

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
are have you changed your identity no I

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.010 
are have you changed your identity no I
have<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.350> changed<00:00:43.860> my<00:00:43.920> identity<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.780> look

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
have not changed my identity I just look

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.979 
have not changed my identity I just look
cool<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.559> my<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:46.920> hat<00:00:47.270> what<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.570> put<00:00:48.809> on

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
cool in my one hat what if you put on

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.950 
cool in my one hat what if you put on
one<00:00:49.289> pair<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.829> sunglasses<00:00:50.420> have<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> changed

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
one pair of sunglasses have you changed

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100 
one pair of sunglasses have you changed
your<00:00:52.079> identity<00:00:52.850> no<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.180> would<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.629> be

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
your identity no I would just be

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350 
your identity no I would just be
sporting<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> cool<00:00:55.920> pair<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.460> shades<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
sporting a cool pair of shades but I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.590 
sporting a cool pair of shades but I
have<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.809> changed<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.410> identity<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
have not changed my identity so if you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.950 
have not changed my identity so if you
take<00:01:00.870> 25<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.649> multiply<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.579> by<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
take 25 and multiply it by one as the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640 
take 25 and multiply it by one as the
product<00:01:04.379> changed<00:01:05.030> what's<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> product<00:01:06.650> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
product changed what's the product the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.830 
product changed what's the product the
product<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.700> call<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.180> answer<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
product is what we call the answer in a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.550 
product is what we call the answer in a
multiplication<00:01:10.530> problem<00:01:10.740> oh<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> what<00:01:13.290> was

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
multiplication problem oh so what was

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.480 
multiplication problem oh so what was
the<00:01:13.710> question<00:01:14.010> again

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the question again

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.260 
the question again
if<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.630> take<00:01:15.930> 25<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.680> multiply<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.640> by<00:01:18.030> one

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
if you take 25 and multiply it by one

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.010 
if you take 25 and multiply it by one
what<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> product<00:01:19.820> 25<00:01:20.820> multiplied<00:01:21.479> by<00:01:21.750> one

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
what is the product 25 multiplied by one

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
what is the product 25 multiplied by one
is<00:01:22.259> 25<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:24.150> did<00:01:24.479> multiplying<00:01:25.049> 25<00:01:25.890> by<00:01:26.220> one

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
is 25 so did multiplying 25 by one

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.319 
is 25 so did multiplying 25 by one
change<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.090> 25<00:01:27.920> no<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.490> multiplied<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
change the 25 no when you multiplied it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.050 
change the 25 no when you multiplied it
by<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> did<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.229> change<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> 25<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.670> 25

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
by one it did not change the 25 to 25

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.100 
by one it did not change the 25 to 25
State<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.990> 25<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.329> when<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.720> put<00:01:36.960> on

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
State of 25 so just like when you put on

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.460 
State of 25 so just like when you put on
one<00:01:37.439> hat<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.189> pair<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.640> glasses<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:40.259> did

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
one hat or one pair of glasses you did

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
one hat or one pair of glasses you did
not<00:01:40.680> change<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.310> identity

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
not change your identity

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.039 
not change your identity
no<00:01:42.930> those<00:01:43.170> did<00:01:43.439> not<00:01:43.619> change<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.250> identity<00:01:45.049> so

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
no those did not change my identity so

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.319 
no those did not change my identity so
when<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.380> multiply<00:01:46.530> any<00:01:47.220> number<00:01:47.369> by<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
when you multiply any number by one the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.170 
when you multiply any number by one the
product<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.140> number<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> mean<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
product is that number do you mean to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240 
product is that number do you mean to
say<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> identity<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.619> number<00:01:52.979> stays

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
say that the identity of a number stays

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.670 
say that the identity of a number stays
the<00:01:53.280> same<00:01:53.640> no<00:01:54.149> matter<00:01:54.930> what<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the same no matter what when you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.609 
the same no matter what when you
multiply<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.219> by<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:57.020> yes<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
multiply it by one yes that is what I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.850 
multiply it by one yes that is what I
mean<00:01:59.180> well<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.509> why<00:02:00.750> didn't<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.560> say

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
mean well then why didn't you just say

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.980 
mean well then why didn't you just say
that<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> identity<00:02:03.270> property<00:02:03.570> of

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
that was the identity property of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.800 
that was the identity property of
multiplication<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.880> easy<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.479> remember

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
multiplication it's easy to remember

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.919 
multiplication it's easy to remember
that<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.500> may<00:02:08.459> need<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.000> run<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.390> Starbuck

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
that I may need to run to Starbuck

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.330 
that I may need to run to Starbuck
before<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.500> start<00:02:10.890> reviewing<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.819> next

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
before we start reviewing the next

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:22.490 
before we start reviewing the next
property

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.560
