00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
setting up to be a Djinn lock so this is

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.550 
setting up to be a Djinn lock so this is
what<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.549> mean<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> essentially<00:01:55.170> why

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
what you mean this is essentially why

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
what you mean this is essentially why
you<00:01:55.619> play<00:01:55.979> Aaron<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.729> avoid<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.180> so

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
you play Aaron to like avoid that so

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.810 
you play Aaron to like avoid that so
that<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.710> more<00:01:58.920> outs<00:01:59.130> than<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.670> your

has<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> preparation<00:02:03.869> right<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.649> he<00:02:04.740> gets<00:02:04.950> his

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
has a preparation right so he gets his

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.710 
has a preparation right so he gets his
what's<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> called<00:02:06.750> back<00:02:06.930> he<00:02:07.200> gets<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> is

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
what's it called back he gets is a is

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.460 
what's it called back he gets is a is
necros<00:02:09.720> of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
necros of

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.190 
necros of
I<00:02:10.500> mean<00:02:10.680> his<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> kaleidoscope<00:02:11.580> back<00:02:12.200> it's

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
I mean his a kaleidoscope back it's

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.020 
I mean his a kaleidoscope back it's
interesting<00:02:13.590> brio<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.460> plummeting<00:02:14.970> in

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
interesting brio is just plummeting in

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.600 
interesting brio is just plummeting in
price<00:02:15.500> okay<00:02:16.500> or<00:02:16.740> he<00:02:16.950> might<00:02:17.130> not<00:02:17.310> get<00:02:17.520> his

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
price okay or he might not get his

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.880 
price okay or he might not get his
ritual<00:02:17.940> spell<00:02:18.120> back<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.870> guess<00:02:19.410> he's<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.650> like

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
ritual spell back I guess he's just like

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.280 
ritual spell back I guess he's just like
I<00:02:20.040> don't<00:02:20.100> need<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.670> come<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.240> I'm<00:02:21.510> 2g<00:02:21.930> for<00:02:22.140> that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
I don't need it come on I'm 2g for that

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.680 
I don't need it come on I'm 2g for that
so<00:02:22.950> instead<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.430> getting<00:02:23.670> kaleidoscope<00:02:24.480> back

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
so instead of getting kaleidoscope back

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.260 
so instead of getting kaleidoscope back
he<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.170> gets<00:02:25.860> brio<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.490> then<00:02:26.610> gets<00:02:26.790> unicorn

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
he just gets brio and then gets unicorn

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.350 
he just gets brio and then gets unicorn
and<00:02:27.450> then<00:02:27.540> adds<00:02:27.780> brio<00:02:28.140> back<00:02:29.180> I've<00:02:30.180> never

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
and then adds brio back I've never

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.390 
and then adds brio back I've never
understood<00:02:30.660> why<00:02:31.140> people<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:31.950> ok

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
understood why people do that but ok

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.690 
understood why people do that but ok
whatever<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.660> he's<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.050> activate<00:02:34.700> cycle

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
whatever so he's going to activate cycle

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.650 
awful and now i guess i'll go for
digestive<00:02:42.720> Emeril<00:02:43.459> cuz<00:02:44.459> lavabo<00:02:45.270> chain<00:02:45.510> is

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
digestive Emeril cuz lavabo chain is

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.030 
digestive Emeril cuz lavabo chain is
kind<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:47.090> like<00:02:48.090> its<00:02:48.480> expended<00:02:49.050> its<00:02:49.170> usefulness

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
kind of like its expended its usefulness

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.000 
kind of like its expended its usefulness

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
now so put everything except the gin

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.190 
now so put everything except the gin
probably<00:02:53.610> back<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.030> deck<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.480> mean<00:02:55.050> why

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
probably back in the deck I mean why

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.510 
probably back in the deck I mean why
