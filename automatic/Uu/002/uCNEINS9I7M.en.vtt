some some drawbacks in this

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.470 
some some drawbacks in this
configuration<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.770> add<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.480> pelvis

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
configuration when you add the pelvis

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.479 
configuration when you add the pelvis

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
piece here it makes this leg extremely

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.049

he<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.600> fall<00:00:57.899> over<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.289> he<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.780> essentially<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
he will fall over so he is essentially a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.590 
he will fall over so he is essentially a
display<00:01:01.590> piece<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:06.330> new<00:01:06.510> head<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.080> nice<00:01:08.600> it's
