00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.570
 me 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.980
 Buch 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.980
 Hmm 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.730
 photoshop 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:29.170
 Describes how to process raw data from your screen 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:35.320
 In this case from the file file is how to open the file file open 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.920
 And since the picture is contained in my picture in the Edo library, I open this picture 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.500
 I will 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.570
 Click the a icon and if it is a file of shelts file raw data 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.290
 Mr. nail does not appear here 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.640
 So please check the image below to come out of the corpse here 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.640
 Then open this 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:01.250
 The image you open is like this I will be in full screen mode here 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:06.909
 In this case, it is necessary to trim by black pinging. 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.909
 First of all we will do the trimming we would like to say from the trimming location 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.170
 The image at the time of shooting is yeah 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.840
 Actually it feels like this 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.399
 So this is about 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.399
 I will trim it 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:43.100
 We will from now on the processing of the image 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:48.610
 What you should not meet is not so much more than starting to get rid of this basic correction 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:53.710
 First of all, my hobbies are here I will open this camera calibration 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:57.280
 This is a photoshop screen, so there are many icons for correction 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.549
 In the case of the elements, there is almost nothing here . 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.440
 It has become a basic correction and camera calibration 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:09.670
 This time I will finish from the camera calibration 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:13.630
 There's no need to worry too much about camera calibration 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.110
 Basically, from that camera landscape is good and you'll choose 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.250
 I think that it is often the standard adobe standard in the initial state 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.050
 Because 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:28.420
 Camera Standard or Member Landscape 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.880
 Basically, if it is landscape scenery, landscape temples are good 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.390
 I think 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.620
 I chose a landscape with a child and 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:42.040
 Return to basic correction First of all in the basics 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.000
 Where is the point 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.730
 In the case of landscape photography 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.570
 Say how much the proper exposure or confusing have color mix as in the case of a night view 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.720
 In case 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.240
 Let's put out the white balance 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.560
 Or Toka to the balance toward the manual 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:06.000
 There is also a way to choose the white balance which is here, but of course the color 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.350
 There is also a way to adjust the temperature, but this time using a dropper that can be done with one click 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.290
 Click here to use this white balance tool Click here and 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.230
 Well, where it's suitable for white balance, it's likely to be an 18% reflected trajectory 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.370
 Choose a place 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.410
 I It is in the 100% 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.270
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:33.370
 Hereabouts Hen of the gray point of it I think is good around here 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:35.240
 Because it becomes easier to select partially if you zoom in like this 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.900
 You expanded 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.900
 I have chosen 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:50.030
 You may try to choose a few times in this 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:55.130
 If you choose something like this is appropriate 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.850
 You Kitaichi changes redness by I place a little place choose is to say 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.850
 It looks like this 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.540
 is not it 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:08.400
 I feel this about is I think the most image and Nanami if well and feeling 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.400
 So here as ok 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:17.049
 I look at the whole according to u size It will be an image like this 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:23.050
 The color of that cherry blossoms also comes out beautifully 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:27.240
 The texture of the 3 trees also seems to be closer to the actual image 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.240
 I think it would be nice to be in this state 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 wh 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.939
 1 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.919
 me 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.919
