00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:16.219
 Warm air low pressure coating machine to uncover from now 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:22.510
 Use the 91 standard set of sg 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:27.480
 I would like to explain the paintings of louvers and shapes of shutters including demonstrations. 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.460
 First of all, it is the material to be used, but now it is here 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.190
 Weak solvent one-component urethane 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.329
 At first glance the nozzle used in 5mm 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:41.269
 About dilution 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:44.200
 If you use this opportunity more than a regular spray gun song, dilution will be more 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:53.760
 For example, Nippe 's fine urethane 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:53.760
 In the case of a weak solvent city ​​station, the nozzle used at 25-30% dilution is 1.5 mm 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.870
 In the case of profit 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.730
 Here is about 15% dilution 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.860
 Although 1.5 mm is recommended for the nozzle used 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.030
 If you want to finish the skin clean 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.960
 The nozzle used at a dilution of 20% is 1.2 mm 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.880
 I think this is better for your skin 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.649
 About blowing 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.490
 First of all, the volume of the main unit is always the largest 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.150
 We recommend this 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.530
 When you drop the volume 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.470
 Since the particles will be rough because you fell the pressure and flow rate 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.270
 It becomes easy to become Yuzu skin 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:40.329
 About original distance 15 cm from the surface 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.240
 Good working efficiency but less is the best and the day 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.030
 I think it is a point 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.000
 How to paint, but usually 2 times 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.380
 The first time 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.440
 From a little lower direction 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.770
 Aiming at the corner 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.880
 Blow you once 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:03.560
 Set the drying time and slightly slant the second time 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:08.410
 Or in the vertical state with the horizontal magic castle 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.590
 It means that it is finished aiming at a broad side and blowing 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.690
 If it is a dress that suppresses the scattering even a little 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:20.069
 It is a minute useless lump with internal corner of both ends only here 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.930
 In this kind of wind pattern 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.080
 Aim with the weapon 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.590
 After wiping both sides 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.730
 You can control the sideways stroke and forgiveness . 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 of course 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.780
 Shake his head 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.500
 It from the portion overruns in one Kippanashi the Mogi's using any eye 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:48.850
 Because there will be more 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.180
 In the always original cut the finger end use in mind is around the old things like that vertically against the surface 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.400
 Please give me 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.400
 Then let's actually blow it 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:18.420
 Let's do the second painting 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:23.160
 The second time is here Enter how many numbers are written before painting the turtle here 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.850
 The number is put in an easy- to- understand manner, and it is painted the fifth time how long this disappears 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.520
 Go 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:33.490
 The just now scattered you jump is around scattered It is whether the scattering of course not a zero 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.449
 Not flying around so much of was how to solve, such as reduced as much as possible 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.969
 not 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:43.270
 The second time I mentioned the awful woman from the top slightly as I mentioned earlier 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:46.319
 And the Fill like that go touting in order to give luster 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.319
 Let's try painting
