well as really good backgrounds and I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.289 
well as really good backgrounds and I
like<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.600> full<00:01:28.080> nail<00:01:28.909> designs<00:01:29.909> more

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
like to use the full nail designs more

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
like to use the full nail designs more
than<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> individual<00:01:31.380> ones<00:01:31.590> for

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
than I do the individual ones for

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.770 
than I do the individual ones for
everyday<00:01:32.549> manicures<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.540> you're<00:01:33.630> going

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
everyday manicures but if you're going

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
everyday manicures but if you're going
to<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.900> doing<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> skittle<00:01:34.799> manicure

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to be doing like a skittle manicure

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.950 
to be doing like a skittle manicure
skittle<00:01:35.729> meaning<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.180> each<00:01:36.420> nail<00:01:36.810> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
skittle meaning that each nail is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.999 
skittle meaning that each nail is
something<00:01:37.259> different<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> more

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
something different I think the more

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
something different I think the more
Holliday<00:01:41.009> centric<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:42.360> specific

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
Holliday centric or more specific

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
Holliday centric or more specific
designs<00:01:43.140> were<00:01:43.350> great<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.159> I'm<00:01:44.340> just

the<00:02:52.739> manicure<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.430> created<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.150> but

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
the manicure that I created with it but

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.030 
the manicure that I created with it but
I<00:02:54.540> think<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.200> worked<00:02:55.380> out<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.680> really<00:02:55.800> well

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
I think it worked out really really well

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.340 
I think it worked out really really well
especially<00:02:56.580> for<00:02:56.790> being<00:02:57.120> such<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> solid<00:02:58.140> image

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
especially for being such a solid image

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.280 
especially for being such a solid image
and<00:02:58.770> solid<00:02:59.430> images<00:02:59.790> are<00:03:00.060> notorious<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.810> not

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
and solid images are notorious for not

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.229 
and solid images are notorious for not
transferring<00:03:02.010> well<00:03:02.190> because<00:03:02.520> as<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.880> scrape

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
transferring well because as you scrape

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.170 
transferring well because as you scrape
them<00:03:03.590> sometimes<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:05.130> scraper<00:03:05.580> can<00:03:05.880> dip<00:03:06.090> a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
them sometimes the scraper can dip a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.670 
them sometimes the scraper can dip a
little<00:03:06.209> bit<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.750> then<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.989> takes<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.560> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
little bit and then it takes out the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.100 
little bit and then it takes out the
polish<00:03:07.980> from<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.250> center<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.270> image<00:03:09.360> but

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
polish from the center of the image but

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.240 
polish from the center of the image but
this<00:03:10.230> worked<00:03:10.470> out<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:10.650> really<00:03:10.890> great<00:03:11.220> I

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
this worked out really really great I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.940 
this worked out really really great I
was<00:03:11.459> impressed<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.209> some<00:03:13.110> more<00:03:13.290> fun<00:03:13.560> ones<00:03:13.770> that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
was impressed so some more fun ones that

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.740 
was impressed so some more fun ones that

heart<00:03:16.140> mustache<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.310> funny<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:18.390> here's

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
heart mustache it's so funny and here's

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.720 
heart mustache it's so funny and here's
one<00:03:18.989> another<00:03:19.290> one<00:03:19.440> that's<00:03:19.590> more<00:03:19.830> solid<00:03:20.489> I

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
one another one that's more solid I

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.180 
one another one that's more solid I
think<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.420> one<00:03:21.600> might<00:03:21.840> be<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:22.080> challenge<00:03:22.590> to

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
think that one might be a challenge to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.340 
think that one might be a challenge to
stamp<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.670> haven't<00:03:24.000> tried<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.269> myself<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:25.290> I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
stamp I haven't tried it myself but I

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.860 
stamp I haven't tried it myself but I
just<00:03:25.590> imagine<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.130> might<00:03:26.459> be<00:03:26.700> however<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.660> is

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
just imagine it might be however it is

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.660 
just imagine it might be however it is
the<00:03:28.080> reverse<00:03:28.680> image<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.580> think

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
the reverse image of this so I think

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.220 
the reverse image of this so I think
it'd<00:03:29.820> be<00:03:29.850> kind<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.120> fun<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.330> do<00:03:30.630> all<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:30.959> your

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.740 
it'd be kind of fun to do all of your
nails<00:03:31.610> except<00:03:32.610> for<00:03:32.850> your<00:03:33.030> ring<00:03:33.330> finger<00:03:33.720> and

nails except for your ring finger and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.870 
nails except for your ring finger and
have<00:03:34.200> their<00:03:34.380> accent<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.250> ring<00:03:35.580> finger<00:03:35.850> and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
have their accent on the ring finger and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
have their accent on the ring finger and
how<00:03:36.000> it'd<00:03:36.120> be<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.360> one<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> think<00:03:36.630> it'd<00:03:36.810> be

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
how it'd be that one I think it'd be

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.729 
how it'd be that one I think it'd be
kind<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.140> fun<00:03:37.350> for<00:03:37.590> an<00:03:38.220> alternate<00:03:38.730> idea

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
kind of fun for an alternate idea

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.840 
kind of fun for an alternate idea

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
received the Estonia scraper and I tried

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.100 
received the Estonia scraper and I tried
it<00:03:51.060> but<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.209> couldn't<00:03:51.420> get<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.660> hang<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:51.989> and

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
it but I couldn't get the hang of it and

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.720 
it but I couldn't get the hang of it and
I<00:03:52.140> think<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.440> might<00:03:52.560> be<00:03:52.590> user<00:03:52.920> error<00:03:53.220> I'm<00:03:53.489> not

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
I think it might be user error I'm not

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.280 
I think it might be user error I'm not
sure<00:03:53.910> because<00:03:54.510> there<00:03:54.840> are<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> lot<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.110> other

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
sure because there are a lot of other

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.080 
sure because there are a lot of other
people<00:03:55.530> who<00:03:55.620> really<00:03:55.769> love<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.130> so<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.580> didn't

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
people who really love it so I didn't

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.570 
people who really love it so I didn't
want<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.620> discount<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.769> or<00:03:59.070> tell<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.430> guys
