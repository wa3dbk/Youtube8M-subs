00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.400
 in terms of economy 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.410
 I am curious if there is today on the 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.360
 show floor actually notice they have it 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.700

 oliviera is indeed 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.550
 smaller, more compact and, in particular, very much 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.550
 more economical 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.660
 among these ants hop behind me 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.080
 Then this is the biggest news of 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.210
 this show the corvette c7 stingray 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.770
 it's so busy now and I'll be back later 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.040
 and then you see the second video all of it 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.440

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.770
 you name it we asked button 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.840
 that was there to do or show lower 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.979
 today a chevrolet stands up 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.979
 really so retro this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.430
 after the SR-24 version of the DOS Dark 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.810
 may be america for a moment 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.860
 keep whistling and that's what they do 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.140
 massive 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.790
 hence this gt is also a thick version 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.310
 least optical because it is all 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 cheated impression it is just a 186 hp 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.119
 strong four-cylinder with a bit wider 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.070
 wheels with beautiful track that they 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.670
 things more but yes you seem nice anyway 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.670

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.640
 two months ago I was driving on mallorca 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.350

 with the cooper s version 184 hp that this is 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.060
 the superlative 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.190
 218 hp for the john cooper works great 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.410
 fat car 280 new to be measured rené 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.429
 overboosts 300 meters to date 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.429

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.810

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.290
