you can see where the plastic shell will
lay<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.760> silicone<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.689> thinner<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
lay the silicone is thinner and

everywhere else the silicone is quite

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.429 
everywhere else the silicone is quite
thick<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.740> does<00:01:14.070> add<00:01:14.280> added<00:01:14.970> bulk<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:16.170> also

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
thick so it does add added bulk but also

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.399 
thick so it does add added bulk but also
that<00:01:16.799> much<00:01:16.979> more<00:01:17.189> extra<00:01:17.580> protection<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.270> well

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
that much more extra protection as well

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.410 
that much more extra protection as well
the<00:01:19.409> case<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.979> also<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.549> found<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> variety

your<00:01:28.890> device<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.760> case<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.360> quite<00:01:30.660> easy

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
your device into the case is quite easy

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.020 
your device into the case is quite easy
simply<00:01:31.950> slide<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.430> phone<00:01:32.640> into<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
silicone portion the silicone is

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.950 
silicone portion the silicone is
stretchy<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.930> fairly<00:01:37.380> easy<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:38.160> insert

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
stretchy so it is fairly easy to insert

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
stretchy so it is fairly easy to insert
secondly<00:01:39.960> take<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.440> hard<00:01:40.800> shell<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.460> fit<00:01:42.300> it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
secondly take the hard shell and fit it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.820 
secondly take the hard shell and fit it
into<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.960> given<00:01:43.409> area<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.530> again

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
into the given area so you can see again

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.370 
into the given area so you can see again
it<00:01:47.070> has<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> very<00:01:47.640> unique<00:01:47.820> looking<00:01:48.690> design<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it has a very unique looking design and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.470 
it has a very unique looking design and
of<00:01:49.500> course<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.040> key<00:01:50.280> feature<00:01:50.580> of<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.150> case

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
of course the key feature of this case

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.780 
of course the key feature of this case
is<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.780> ability<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.770> provide<00:01:53.070> protection

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
is the ability to provide protection

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.980 
is the ability to provide protection
without<00:01:54.530> sacrificing<00:01:55.530> looks<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.659> does

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
without sacrificing looks it also does

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.830 
without sacrificing looks it also does
feel<00:01:58.320> quite<00:01:58.680> bulky<00:01:59.010> in<00:01:59.370> my<00:01:59.550> hand<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.090> mine<00:02:00.540> are

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
feel quite bulky in my hand as mine are

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.530 
feel quite bulky in my hand as mine are
quite<00:02:01.170> small<00:02:01.620> so<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.670> does<00:02:02.850> take<00:02:03.120> some<00:02:03.270> effort

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
quite small so it does take some effort

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.810 
quite small so it does take some effort
for<00:02:03.900> me<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> grip<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> case<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.070> trying<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
for me to grip the case and trying to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
for me to grip the case and trying to
put<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.120> in<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.420> fitted<00:02:06.840> jeans<00:02:07.110> pockets<00:02:07.770> aren't

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
put it in my fitted jeans pockets aren't

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.360 
put it in my fitted jeans pockets aren't
the<00:02:08.220> most<00:02:08.369> flattering<00:02:08.989> however<00:02:09.989> if
