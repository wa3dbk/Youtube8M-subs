let's<00:02:45.160> start<00:02:45.700> showing<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.209> how<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.600> do<00:02:46.810> this

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
let's start showing you how to do this

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.930 
let's start showing you how to do this
ok<00:02:49.570> before<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.830> actually<00:02:51.160> put<00:02:51.670> everything

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
ok before you actually put everything

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.990 
ok before you actually put everything
together<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.480> want<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.780> show<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.080> few<00:02:53.320> things

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
together I want to show you a few things

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.990 
together I want to show you a few things
these<00:02:55.000> are<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.540> connections<00:02:56.459> let's<00:02:57.459> see<00:02:57.700> this

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
these are the connections let's see this

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.830 
these are the connections let's see this
is<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.600> inside<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:59.940> your<00:03:00.940> garage<00:03:01.450> door<00:03:01.570> opener

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
is the inside of your garage door opener

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.759 
is the inside of your garage door opener
if<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:02.980> flip<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:04.420> these<00:03:05.380> are<00:03:05.650> the

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
if you flip it up and these are the

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.479 
if you flip it up and these are the
switches<00:03:06.600> which<00:03:07.709> control<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.739> garage<00:03:09.220> doors

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489

switches which control the garage doors
function

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.690 

where<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.020> saw<00:03:13.170> everything<00:03:13.380> together<00:03:13.800> take<00:03:14.460> a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
where you saw everything together take a

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.330 
where you saw everything together take a
length<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.660> wire<00:03:16.430> or<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.700> switch<00:03:17.970> itself<00:03:18.180> and

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
length of wire or the switch itself and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.270 
length of wire or the switch itself and
just<00:03:20.450> play<00:03:21.450> around<00:03:21.600> take<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.010> know<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
just play around take you know the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.150 
just play around take you know the
exposed<00:03:23.670> ends<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.210> touch<00:03:24.720> two<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:27.450> these

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
exposed ends and touch two of these

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.050 
exposed ends and touch two of these
connections<00:03:29.210> together<00:03:30.210> and<00:03:31.850> that<00:03:32.850> should

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
connections together and that should

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.520 
connections together and that should
complete<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> circuit<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.870> way<00:03:34.080> you<00:03:34.140> can<00:03:34.350> tell

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
complete a circuit that way you can tell

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.880 
complete a circuit that way you can tell
which<00:03:34.770> one<00:03:35.040> will<00:03:36.530> actually<00:03:37.530> complete<00:03:37.860> the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
which one will actually complete the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.460 
which one will actually complete the
circuit<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.550> open<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.300> garage<00:03:39.390> door<00:03:39.510> most

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.440 
circuit and open the garage door most
witches<00:03:40.740> are<00:03:41.190> very<00:03:41.370> simple<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.180> just

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
witches are very simple and you just

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.530 
witches are very simple and you just
need<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.840> actually<00:03:43.170> touch<00:03:43.650> two<00:03:43.920> ends<00:03:44.100> together

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.260 

so<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> case<00:03:49.020> of<00:03:49.080> mine<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:50.610> really<00:03:50.910> doesn't

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
so in the case of mine it really doesn't

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.820 
so in the case of mine it really doesn't
matter<00:03:51.420> as<00:03:51.660> long<00:03:51.690> as<00:03:51.960> the<00:03:52.080> buttons<00:03:52.320> programmed

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
matter as long as the buttons programmed

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.250 
matter as long as the buttons programmed
for<00:03:53.820> this<00:03:54.150> actually<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.810> work<00:03:54.990> though<00:03:55.200> you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
for this actually to work though you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.970 
for this actually to work though you
need<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.860> battery<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:57.780> be<00:03:57.930> installed<00:03:58.470> mine<00:03:58.830> is

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
need the battery to be installed mine is

don't<00:05:22.540> recommend<00:05:23.910> doing<00:05:24.910> it<00:05:25.270> with<00:05:25.540> just

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
don't recommend doing it with just

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.020 
don't recommend doing it with just
tacking<00:05:28.920> also<00:05:29.920> use<00:05:30.100> a<00:05:30.130> clean<00:05:30.400> soldering<00:05:30.790> iron

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
tacking also use a clean soldering iron

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.410 
tacking also use a clean soldering iron
it<00:05:31.240> makes<00:05:31.420> it<00:05:31.510> a<00:05:31.570> lot<00:05:31.720> easier<00:05:32.730> okay<00:05:33.730> this<00:05:34.150> is

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
it makes it a lot easier okay this is

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.600 
it makes it a lot easier okay this is
the<00:05:34.840> finished<00:05:35.140> product<00:05:35.800> as<00:05:35.980> far<00:05:36.220> as<00:05:36.460> the

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
the finished product as far as the

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.610 
the finished product as far as the
soldering<00:05:36.970> goes<00:05:37.620> just<00:05:38.620> you<00:05:39.520> know<00:05:40.590> make<00:05:41.590> sure

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
soldering goes just you know make sure

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.290 
soldering goes just you know make sure
you<00:05:41.980> solder<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.430> right<00:05:42.550> connections<00:05:43.060> it

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
you solder the right connections it

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.610 
you solder the right connections it
doesn't<00:05:43.630> really<00:05:43.720> matter<00:05:43.900> which<00:05:44.170> is<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.350> power

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
doesn't really matter which is a power

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.760 
doesn't really matter which is a power
which<00:05:44.800> is<00:05:44.950> a<00:05:44.980> ground<00:05:45.250> because<00:05:46.380> it's<00:05:47.380> a<00:05:47.530> switch

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
which is a ground because it's a switch

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.530 
which is a ground because it's a switch
it's<00:05:47.980> a<00:05:48.100> simple<00:05:48.430> switch<00:05:48.580> as<00:05:48.970> long<00:05:49.300> as<00:05:49.450> I

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
it's a simple switch as long as I

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.500 
it's a simple switch as long as I
circuit<00:05:49.870> is<00:05:49.930> completed<00:05:50.230> its<00:05:50.620> happy<00:05:51.150> if<00:05:52.150> you

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
circuit is completed its happy if you

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.720 
circuit is completed its happy if you
really<00:05:53.200> want<00:05:53.410> to<00:05:53.530> be<00:05:54.060> you<00:05:55.060> know<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:56.890> T<00:05:57.070> you

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
really want to be you know to the T you

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.220 
really want to be you know to the T you
can<00:05:58.090> just<00:05:58.600> you<00:05:59.470> know<00:05:59.530> use<00:05:59.860> the<00:05:59.890> multimeter<00:06:00.520> and

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
can just you know use the multimeter and

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.990 
can just you know use the multimeter and
defy<00:06:02.230> the<00:06:02.290> power<00:06:02.590> find<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:02.920> ground<00:06:03.160> either

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
defy the power find the ground either

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.880 
defy the power find the ground either
way<00:06:04.210> it's<00:06:04.660> a<00:06:04.780> loop<00:06:04.960> it<00:06:05.230> just<00:06:05.470> needs<00:06:05.650> to<00:06:05.770> be

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
way it's a loop it just needs to be

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.290 
way it's a loop it just needs to be
completed<00:06:06.280> and<00:06:06.520> it<00:06:06.730> will<00:06:06.850> complete<00:06:07.180> the

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
completed and it will complete the

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.760 
completed and it will complete the
circuit<00:06:07.660> go<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:10.870> two<00:06:11.140> connections<00:06:11.620> are

circuit go the two connections are
soldered<00:06:12.190> I<00:06:12.460> left<00:06:12.760> some<00:06:13.630> length<00:06:13.900> so<00:06:14.710> you<00:06:14.800> can

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
soldered I left some length so you can

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.840 
soldered I left some length so you can
pull<00:06:15.190> it<00:06:15.280> apart<00:06:15.370> if<00:06:15.850> you<00:06:16.240> need<00:06:16.420> to<00:06:17.310> and<00:06:18.310> we<00:06:18.820> just

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
pull it apart if you need to and we just

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.570 
pull it apart if you need to and we just
button<00:06:19.690> it<00:06:19.750> up<00:06:19.810> and<00:06:20.200> stick<00:06:20.890> it<00:06:20.920> back<00:06:21.250> in<00:06:21.310> the
