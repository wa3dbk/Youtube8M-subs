the<00:00:23.920> right<00:00:23.980> software<00:00:24.310> I<00:00:24.940> don't<00:00:25.180> know<00:00:25.240> so<00:00:25.510> what

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
the right software I don't know so what

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.300 
the right software I don't know so what
this<00:00:25.870> is<00:00:25.930> is<00:00:26.520> it's<00:00:27.520> a<00:00:27.670> bit<00:00:27.820> of<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:27.970> flash

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
this is is it's a bit of a flash

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.100 
this is is it's a bit of a flash
manipulating<00:00:30.310> layers<00:00:30.580> and<00:00:31.090> changing<00:00:31.900> things

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
manipulating layers and changing things

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.349 
manipulating layers and changing things
around<00:00:32.200> to<00:00:32.529> show<00:00:32.739> you<00:00:32.800> how<00:00:33.129> I<00:00:33.430> did<00:00:33.969> draw<00:00:34.210> this

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
around to show you how I did draw this

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.950 
around to show you how I did draw this
image<00:00:34.690> but<00:00:35.320> it<00:00:35.769> isn't<00:00:35.949> done<00:00:36.249> through<00:00:36.550> a<00:00:36.960> screen

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
image but it isn't done through a screen

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.500 
image but it isn't done through a screen
capture<00:00:38.199> so<00:00:38.710> it's<00:00:38.859> kind<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.039> like<00:00:39.219> a<00:00:39.510> fake

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
capture so it's kind of like a fake

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.470 
capture so it's kind of like a fake
speed<00:00:41.260> drawing<00:00:41.469> so<00:00:42.309> if<00:00:42.460> there<00:00:42.609> is<00:00:42.699> some<00:00:42.999> screen

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
speed drawing so if there is some screen

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.299 
speed drawing so if there is some screen
capturing<00:00:43.690> software<00:00:44.050> that<00:00:44.499> you<00:00:44.739> like<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.100> use

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
capturing software that you like to use

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.059 
capturing software that you like to use
or<00:00:45.760> you<00:00:45.850> recommend<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:47.440> really<00:00:47.649> handy<00:00:47.829> for

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
really out of the ordinary that I

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.999 
really out of the ordinary that I
haven't<00:01:37.420> shown<00:01:37.689> you<00:01:37.750> guys<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.619> way<00:01:38.859> I<00:01:38.890> do

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
haven't shown you guys the way I do

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.459 
haven't shown you guys the way I do
things<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:40.090> only<00:01:40.509> thing<00:01:40.780> that<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.170> might

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
things the only thing that you might

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.760 
things the only thing that you might
notice<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:42.009> that<00:01:42.070> I'm<00:01:42.369> creating<00:01:43.649> content<00:01:44.649> that

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
notice is that I'm creating content that

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.880 
notice is that I'm creating content that
flops<00:01:45.280> over<00:01:45.520> top<00:01:46.090> of<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.390> artwork<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:46.960> then<00:01:47.619> I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
flops over top of the artwork and then I

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.919 
flops over top of the artwork and then I
place<00:01:48.429> an<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.789> piece<00:01:49.329> of<00:01:49.359> artwork<00:01:49.719> from

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
place an a piece of artwork from

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.770 
place an a piece of artwork from
underneath<00:01:50.259> on<00:01:50.619> top<00:01:50.829> and<00:01:51.070> then<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.609> chop<00:01:52.509> it<00:01:52.689> out

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
underneath on top and then I chop it out

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.510 
underneath on top and then I chop it out
and<00:01:53.079> this<00:01:53.740> is<00:01:53.859> just<00:01:54.039> done<00:01:54.250> through<00:01:54.460> the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
and this is just done through the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.730 
and this is just done through the
intersect<00:01:55.270> tool<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.020> what<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:56.350> do<00:01:56.469> is<00:01:56.500> you

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
intersect tool so what you do is you

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.289 
intersect tool so what you do is you
just<00:01:56.770> give<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.219> to<00:01:57.340> pieces<00:01:57.549> of<00:01:57.759> geometry<00:01:57.939> and

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
just give it to pieces of geometry and

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.340 
just give it to pieces of geometry and
you<00:01:58.420> tell<00:01:58.570> them<00:01:58.659> that<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:58.899> want<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.109> use<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
you tell them that you want to use the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.200 
you tell them that you want to use the
difference<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.579> it's<00:02:00.789> just<00:02:00.939> a<00:02:00.999> fun<00:02:01.179> little

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
difference and it's just a fun little

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.359 
difference and it's just a fun little
trick<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.780> use<00:02:02.049> probably<00:02:02.890> go<00:02:02.979> into<00:02:03.249> it<00:02:03.310> a

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
trick that I use probably go into it a

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.950 
trick that I use probably go into it a
little<00:02:03.490> bit<00:02:03.579> more<00:02:03.820> d<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.210> detail<00:02:04.539> or<00:02:04.780> not<00:02:04.929> a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
little bit more d in detail or not a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.959 
little bit more d in detail or not a
future<00:02:05.289> tutorial<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:06.460> other<00:02:06.609> than<00:02:06.759> that<00:02:06.850> I

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
future tutorial but other than that I

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.150 
future tutorial but other than that I
