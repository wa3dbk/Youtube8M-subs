threw up and then direct directed away
from<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.920> hole<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:36.000> don't<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.329> water

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570

as a result what has happened is when
water<00:00:56.390> comes<00:00:56.480> off<00:00:56.870> of<00:00:57.050> that<00:00:57.140> roof<00:00:57.470> we<00:00:57.740> just<00:00:57.920> had

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
water comes off of that roof we just had

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.330 
water comes off of that roof we just had
a<00:00:58.130> lot<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.400> rings<00:00:58.700> i<00:00:59.410> hain't<00:01:00.410> seen<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:00.890> when

water comes off the roof it's actually
created<00:01:05.210> kind<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.900> a<00:01:06.020> gibbet<00:01:06.800> a<00:01:06.980> trench<00:01:07.310> in<00:01:07.490> the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
created kind of a gibbet a trench in the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.880 
created kind of a gibbet a trench in the
ground<00:01:07.850> here<00:01:09.430> until<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:10.580> water<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:10.940> not<00:01:11.150> a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
ground here until that water is not a

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.340 
ground here until that water is not a
foundation<00:01:12.890> in<00:01:13.420> addition<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.480> that<00:01:14.660> person<00:01:15.200> if

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
foundation in addition to that person if

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.230 
foundation in addition to that person if
they're<00:01:15.560> locals<00:01:15.950> contributing<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.910> poor

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
they're locals contributing to poor

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.630 
they're locals contributing to poor
drainage<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.530> fact<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.130> ground<00:01:19.400> out

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
drainage is the fact that the ground out

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.850 
drainage is the fact that the ground out
here<00:01:20.150> is<00:01:20.900> higher<00:01:22.330> than<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.390> ground<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:24.590> so

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
here is higher than the ground and so

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.500 
here is higher than the ground and so
Congress<00:01:25.100> that's<00:01:25.460> gonna<00:01:25.670> direct<00:01:26.000> any<00:01:26.240> water

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
Congress that's gonna direct any water

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.350 
Congress that's gonna direct any water
that<00:01:26.630> does<00:01:26.960> top<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.500> our<00:01:27.619> world<00:01:27.910> back<00:01:28.910> toward

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
that does top of our world back toward

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.469 
that does top of our world back toward
right<00:01:29.570> foundation<00:01:30.670> where<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.790> can<00:01:31.970> seep<00:01:32.270> in

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
right foundation where it can seep in

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.200 
right foundation where it can seep in
and<00:01:32.780> lead<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.530> other<00:01:33.740> types<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.220> problems<00:01:34.430> will

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
and lead to other types of problems will

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.770 
and lead to other types of problems will
get<00:01:35.300> into<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.750> another

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
get into it another

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
get into it another
but<00:01:37.350> what<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.619> need<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.670> need

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
but what we need to do here is we need

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.740 
but what we need to do here is we need
install<00:01:39.770> proper<00:01:40.770> guttering<00:01:41.220> what<00:01:42.060> downspout

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
install proper guttering what downspout

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.780 
install proper guttering what downspout
that's<00:01:43.440> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> direct<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.100> water<00:01:44.460> away

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that's going to direct that water away

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.890 
that's going to direct that water away
from<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.450> law<00:01:45.770> another<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:46.979> idea<00:01:47.159> might<00:01:47.670> be

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
from this law another good idea might be

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.109 
from this law another good idea might be
to<00:01:48.900> maybe<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.440> of<00:01:49.680> doing<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.759> little<00:01:50.940> bit<00:01:51.090> of

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to maybe think of doing a little bit of

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.840 
to maybe think of doing a little bit of
really<00:01:51.920> try<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.950> create<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:55.070> raw<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.640> will

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
really try to create a raw if you will

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.219 
really try to create a raw if you will
that's<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> direct<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.810> water<00:01:58.140> out

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
that's going to direct that water out

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.050 
that's going to direct that water out
away<00:01:58.530> from<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.830> house<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:58.979> keep<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.970> away

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
away from the house and keep it away

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.499 
away from the house and keep it away
from<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.420> house<00:02:00.799> by<00:02:01.799> comparison<00:02:02.430> let's<00:02:03.360> look

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
from the house by comparison let's look

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.820 
from the house by comparison let's look
at<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.810> section<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.320> work<00:02:04.500> over<00:02:04.799> here

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
at this section of the work over here

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.270 
at this section of the work over here
over<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.780> gutters<00:02:07.290> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
over here you see we do have gutters and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.040 
over here you see we do have gutters and
downspouts<00:02:10.009> also<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.160> can<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.580> from<00:02:11.760> in

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
downspouts also you can see from in

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.290 
downspouts also you can see from in

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
such a manner that tilting out this way
