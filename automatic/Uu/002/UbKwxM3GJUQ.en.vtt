00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.220
 I wanted to draw is and I knew 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.380
 This very early I was sure that I 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.039
 It was a drawing and it was going to be a designer. 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.650

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.600
 of State 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.280
 so I only had bandits I only had none 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.400
 that no one has any school 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.920
 I accepted my father's father's grandfather and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.270
 he was a blacksmith he made those 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:20.120
 gates on the flight who was at the premiere of 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:23.450
 the car of old cars 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.690
 these things then, that was it 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.750
 the beginning of what the family began to 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.440
 relatives who drew my 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.120
 father I remember my father doing exchange is 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.240
 do a school job of mine and 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.060
 my sister 's life is with that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.270
 little penny that was drawing a 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.500
 wolf or an animal such and I was 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.000
 watching my dad do that and I had 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.900
 true passion even for this moment 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.780
 to see him sit down and take the paper 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.159
 black was a black cardboard and draw 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.020
 the animals that had to 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.860
 I figured there in my job. 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.599
 sister and such and it is one of the first things 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.369
 that I had a little money on my hand was 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.190
 buy a mosquito feather 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.319
 I thought that was where it was the beginning 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.319
 It's all about having a mosquito feather. 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:37.220
 it was in 1968 that the pasquim appeared and there is a 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.950
 friend of mine bought and with the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.860
 of the first editions the pasquim and is 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.780
 or when it was and April to lampoon 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.180
 I was delighted it's haunted one 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.670
 drawing brings the other drawing brings the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.770
 another had the spell for 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.770
 reviewed the cruise that had 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.760
 who signed several with several 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.340
 First names 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.520
 is it fills the magazine then pif paf 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.960
 was the barber's camera room that 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.950
 had the pif paf to read and then the 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.100
 pasquim 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:18.500
 joining all this is the pasquim and pif 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:21.650
 paf is was the start button for the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.500

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.700
 drawings for the pasquim is not gone 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.730

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.830
 ideas ideas so that you do not 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.920
 held right 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.240
 until the first drawing came out on the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.760
 card section 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.920
 This is an audition, do not you have to leave? 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.660
 of the letters section or because it 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.830
 in the cards section is because you are not 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.010

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.670
 jaguar wrote badly for the 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.800
 letters he wrote for him looks at the 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.640
 and there was no comma. 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.880
 horrible thing and there until I once 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.250
 I personally met Jaguar and passed away. 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.790

 he said I do not understand that 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.280

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.370
 I told him why he said it so I 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.109
 I even thought I was a foreigner and 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.109
 bad written that was right 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.880
 I remember that it is one of those times for me was 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.620
 so the heart beat in her that I was 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.530
 talking to a movie showing my 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.640
 I work my asses there pro 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.460
 finally got better in the room 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.670

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:00.370
 great big the communist cartoonist is not 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:03.470
 and to this day he is the greatest, right? 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.350
 and then when he took one of mine 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.320

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.810

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:19.280
 only he improved the drawing and threw it there. 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.620
 I went to the cup and I sent so much and I started to 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.720
 to understand better how was the 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.970

 it was glory in glory you have a 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.990
