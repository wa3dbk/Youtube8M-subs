00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so it's a very interesting concept but

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
so it's a very interesting concept but
you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.860> looking<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.339> its<00:01:05.489> tentacles<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.090> can

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you can looking at its tentacles I can

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
you can looking at its tentacles I can
see<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.689> being<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> case<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:08.040> also<00:01:08.159> see

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
see that being the case I can also see

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
see that being the case I can also see
it<00:01:08.580> being<00:01:08.820> impossible<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:10.140> shake<00:01:10.350> loose<00:01:10.590> of

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it being impossible to shake loose of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.649 
it being impossible to shake loose of
one<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.070> these<00:01:11.159> guys<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.790> grabs<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.330> I'm

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
assuming it's either kill or be killed

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.270 
assuming it's either kill or be killed
and<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> lot<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> other<00:01:15.630> options<00:01:16.280> because

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and not a lot of other options because

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580 
and not a lot of other options because
this<00:01:17.490> thing<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:18.080> aggressive<00:01:19.080> its

this thing is very aggressive its
carnivorous<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.390> something<00:01:21.720> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
carnivorous and it's not something you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.080 
carnivorous and it's not something you
naturally<00:01:22.320> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> mess<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> think

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
naturally want to mess with now I think

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.730 
naturally want to mess with now I think
if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:24.960> please<00:01:25.229> Esau<00:01:25.560> or

if you have that you know please Esau or
Megalodon<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> won't<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.360> much

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
Megalodon I think it won't be much

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.800 
Megalodon I think it won't be much
trouble<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:29.009> -<00:01:29.250> anything<00:01:29.610> else<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
trouble at all but - anything else you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.679 
trouble at all but - anything else you
might<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> tough<00:01:31.380> time<00:01:31.970> -<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.150> -<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
might have a tough time - so - this is a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.810 
might have a tough time - so - this is a
terrifying<00:01:34.140> opponent<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:34.950> several<00:01:35.369> reasons

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
terrifying opponent for several reasons

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.719 
terrifying opponent for several reasons
firstly<00:01:36.270> its<00:01:37.049> crabs<00:01:37.409> slowly<00:01:37.950> renders<00:01:38.579> its

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
firstly its crabs slowly renders its

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.240 
firstly its crabs slowly renders its
victim<00:01:39.090> unconscious<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> death<00:01:40.920> isn't

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
victim unconscious so the death isn't

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.539 
victim unconscious so the death isn't
the<00:01:41.430> first<00:01:41.729> concern<00:01:42.409> secondly<00:01:43.409> its<00:01:43.890> vampiric

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the first concern secondly its vampiric

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.969 
the first concern secondly its vampiric
blood<00:01:44.880> drained<00:01:45.240> instantly<00:01:45.990> revitalizes<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
blood drained instantly revitalizes it

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.660 
blood drained instantly revitalizes it
even<00:01:47.430> during<00:01:47.640> combat<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.600> finally<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.770> -<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.520> -

the major benefits of taming to

institute this is harvesting its ink

institute this is harvesting its ink
unlike<00:02:20.550> normal<00:02:20.819> ink<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.810> very<00:02:22.020> oily<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
unlike normal ink this is very oily and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.250 
unlike normal ink this is very oily and
can<00:02:23.250> be<00:02:23.340> refined<00:02:23.850> into<00:02:24.270> fuels<00:02:24.630> such<00:02:25.230> as

two--this<00:02:28.770> distinctive<00:02:29.610> combat<00:02:30.060> abilities

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
two--this distinctive combat abilities

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.140 
two--this distinctive combat abilities
it<00:02:30.840> makes<00:02:31.500> for<00:02:31.709> an<00:02:31.830> excellent<00:02:32.310> aquatic<00:02:32.910> tame

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
it makes for an excellent aquatic tame

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.990 
it makes for an excellent aquatic tame
despite<00:02:33.870> its<00:02:34.080> low<00:02:34.290> swimming<00:02:34.680> speed<00:02:34.950> all<00:02:35.610> right

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
despite its low swimming speed all right

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.180 
despite its low swimming speed all right
so<00:02:36.180> there<00:02:36.330> we<00:02:36.450> see<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.630> weakness<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.650> has<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> slow

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
so there we see a weakness it has a slow

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.590 
so there we see a weakness it has a slow
speed<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.550> I'm<00:02:38.819> assuming<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.300> not<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
speed and I'm assuming it's not the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.770 
speed and I'm assuming it's not the
tanky<00:02:39.989> astir<00:02:40.230> creatures<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:41.550> it's<00:02:41.820> very<00:02:42.180> you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
tanky astir creatures but it's very you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.090 
tanky astir creatures but it's very you
know<00:02:42.810> powerful<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.890> good<00:02:44.070> for

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
know powerful and it's good for

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.430 
know powerful and it's good for
resources<00:02:44.790> I'm<00:02:45.480> probably<00:02:45.840> gonna<00:02:46.019> have<00:02:46.230> some

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
resources I'm probably gonna have some

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.870 
resources I'm probably gonna have some
time<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.070> don't<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.489> go<00:02:47.580> out<00:02:47.730> on

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
time just so I don't have to go out on

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.300 
time just so I don't have to go out on
so<00:02:48.030> many<00:02:48.090> oil<00:02:48.420> runs<00:02:48.750> although<00:02:49.230> oil<00:02:49.769> runs<00:02:50.100> are

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
so many oil runs although oil runs are

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.699 
so many oil runs although oil runs are
pretty<00:02:50.519> easy<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.110> wouldn't<00:02:52.650> necessarily

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
pretty easy so it wouldn't necessarily

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.699 
pretty easy so it wouldn't necessarily
be<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.550> toughest<00:02:53.970> thing<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:55.350> know<00:02:55.470> just

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
be the toughest thing to you know just

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.250 
be the toughest thing to you know just
avoid<00:02:56.040> these<00:02:56.280> guys<00:02:56.519> altogether<00:02:57.300> but<00:02:57.930> come<00:02:58.230> on

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
you got a name it calamari and it's just

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.850 
you got a name it calamari and it's just
gonna<00:03:01.110> be<00:03:01.320> great
