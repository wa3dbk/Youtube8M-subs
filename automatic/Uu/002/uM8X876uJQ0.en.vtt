with Simpson tricks today we're talking
about<00:00:15.530> a<00:00:15.710> technique<00:00:16.190> that<00:00:16.219> I<00:00:16.550> admittedly<00:00:17.270> use

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
about a technique that I admittedly use

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.220 
about a technique that I admittedly use
fairly<00:00:18.020> sparingly<00:00:18.619> but<00:00:19.070> it<00:00:19.220> is<00:00:19.369> effective<00:00:19.970> to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
fairly sparingly but it is effective to

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.019 
fairly sparingly but it is effective to
execute<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.380> heel<00:00:21.619> toe<00:00:21.860> technique<00:00:22.369> we<00:00:22.820> want

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
execute the heel toe technique we want

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.580 
execute the heel toe technique we want

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590

evolution<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.510> technique<00:00:47.989> is<00:00:48.229> a<00:00:48.260> bit

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
evolution of the technique is a bit

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.369 
evolution of the technique is a bit
weird<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:49.120> execute<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.299> heel<00:00:50.570> toe<00:00:50.809> technique

as a double kick pattern
I<00:00:52.820> work<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.720> right-left<00:00:54.260> right-left

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.490 

it<00:01:21.700> looks<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.120> bit<00:01:22.150> weird<00:01:22.540> but<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:22.870> works<00:01:23.050> for<00:01:23.350> me

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
it looks a bit weird but it works for me

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.830 
it looks a bit weird but it works for me
I<00:01:23.800> use<00:01:24.340> single<00:01:24.700> strokes<00:01:25.000> for<00:01:25.180> everything<00:01:25.570> else

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
I use single strokes for everything else

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.600 
I use single strokes for everything else
because<00:01:26.260> I<00:01:26.290> feel<00:01:26.620> I<00:01:26.650> can<00:01:26.980> get<00:01:27.130> more<00:01:27.310> power

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
because I feel I can get more power

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.780
