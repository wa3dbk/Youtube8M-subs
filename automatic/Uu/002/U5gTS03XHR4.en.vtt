this<00:03:02.760> thing<00:03:02.940> looks<00:03:03.150> awesome<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.750> think<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.020> is

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
this thing looks awesome I think this is

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.180 
this thing looks awesome I think this is
one<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> better<00:03:04.410> looking<00:03:04.500> cars<00:03:04.890> ever<00:03:05.100> made

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
one of the better looking cars ever made

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.040 
one of the better looking cars ever made
I<00:03:05.580> think<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.000> what<00:03:06.120> they<00:03:06.209> base<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> 590

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
I think this is what they base the 590

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.140 
I think this is what they base the 590
off<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.610> little<00:03:08.790> too<00:03:08.910> glossy

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
off of it is it's a little too glossy

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.780 
off of it is it's a little too glossy
though<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.780> think<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:10.950> awesome<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.640> only

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
though I think it's awesome the only

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.430 
though I think it's awesome the only
thing<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.000> don't<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.300> about<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
thing I don't like about it is that the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.190 
thing I don't like about it is that the
back<00:03:13.620> plates<00:03:13.890> partial<00:03:14.720> why<00:03:15.720> would<00:03:15.930> they<00:03:16.019> do

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
back plates partial why would they do

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.850 
back plates partial why would they do
that

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
that

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.009 
that
it<00:03:17.250> takes<00:03:17.459> an<00:03:17.610> 8<00:03:17.760> pin<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.330> 6<00:03:18.540> pin<00:03:18.780> and

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
it takes an 8 pin and a 6 pin and

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.930 
it takes an 8 pin and a 6 pin and
there's<00:03:19.140> an<00:03:19.230> S<00:03:19.350> lie<00:03:19.530> finger<00:03:19.890> over<00:03:20.100> there<00:03:20.310> so

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
there's an S lie finger over there so

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.270 
there's an S lie finger over there so
you<00:03:21.030> can't<00:03:21.360> run<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.810> Quad<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:22.920> this<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.250> a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.940 
on but like this little light right here
no<00:04:12.090> just<00:04:12.390> let<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.630> know<00:04:12.720> what's<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:12.989> them<00:04:13.140> but

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
no just let you know what's on them but

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.349 
no just let you know what's on them but
yeah<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.310> think<00:04:14.430> that's<00:04:14.700> pretty<00:04:14.820> much<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:15.060> for

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
yeah I think that's pretty much it for

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.960 
yeah I think that's pretty much it for
the<00:04:15.750> unboxing<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:16.290> beauty

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
the unboxing of beauty

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.360 
the unboxing of beauty
I<00:04:17.000> also<00:04:17.870> have<00:04:18.200> another<00:04:18.320> one<00:04:18.500> over<00:04:19.100> here<00:04:19.280> the

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
I also have another one over here the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.810 
I also have another one over here the
tech<00:04:19.549> bench<00:04:19.820> but<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.660> is<00:04:20.950> may<00:04:21.950> or<00:04:22.010> may<00:04:22.340> not<00:04:22.370> be

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
tech bench but it is may or may not be

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.360 
tech bench but it is may or may not be
dead<00:04:23.030> yeah<00:04:23.450> it's<00:04:24.050> not<00:04:24.230> playing<00:04:24.470> nice<00:04:24.800> with<00:04:24.860> us

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
dead yeah it's not playing nice with us

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.510 
dead yeah it's not playing nice with us
so<00:04:25.790> we're<00:04:26.150> gonna<00:04:26.570> keep<00:04:26.900> trying<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.770> but<00:04:28.070> in<00:04:28.400> all

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
so we're gonna keep trying it but in all

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.250 
so we're gonna keep trying it but in all
likelihood<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:29.180> dead<00:04:29.360> now<00:04:29.390> after<00:04:29.870> turn<00:04:30.110> both

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
likelihood it's dead now after turn both

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.670 
likelihood it's dead now after turn both
of<00:04:30.320> these<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:31.750> reviews<00:04:32.750> probably<00:04:33.170> not<00:04:33.320> coming

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
of these so reviews probably not coming

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.380 
of these so reviews probably not coming
and<00:04:33.980> this<00:04:34.100> is<00:04:34.160> retro<00:04:34.460> anyway<00:04:34.730> this<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.120> kind<00:04:35.330> of

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
and this is retro anyway this is kind of

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.600 
and this is retro anyway this is kind of
kind<00:04:35.540> of<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.750> goof-off<00:04:36.110> video<00:04:36.560> there's<00:04:37.280> how<00:04:37.430> are

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
kind of a goof-off video there's how are

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.230 
kind of a goof-off video there's how are
you<00:04:38.290> it'll<00:04:39.290> play<00:04:39.380> your<00:04:39.590> games<00:04:39.800> cuz<00:04:40.100> my<00:04:40.250> 1906<00:04:41.060> to

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.180 
you it'll play your games cuz my 1906 to
it'll<00:04:41.570> still<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:41.900> already<00:04:42.170> played<00:04:42.410> EverQuest

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
it'll still I already played EverQuest

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.160 
it'll still I already played EverQuest
to<00:04:43.370> only<00:04:43.730> on<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.630> plays<00:04:44.780> just<00:04:44.960> as

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
to only on that and it plays just as

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.550 
to only on that and it plays just as
well<00:04:45.350> as<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.830> six<00:04:46.160> or<00:04:46.250> CT<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.580> so<00:04:47.180> I<00:04:47.720> mean<00:04:48.170> yeah<00:04:48.350> it

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
well as a six or CT I so I mean yeah it

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.440 
well as a six or CT I so I mean yeah it
uses<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.860> lot<00:04:49.040> more<00:04:49.280> usage<00:04:49.730> but<00:04:49.970> still<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.390> still

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
uses a lot more usage but still it still

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.070 
uses a lot more usage but still it still
does<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:51.430> don't<00:04:52.430> buy<00:04:52.580> one<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.480> think<00:04:53.930> that

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
does it don't buy one and I think that

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.240 
does it don't buy one and I think that
