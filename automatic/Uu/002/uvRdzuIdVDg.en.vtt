will look here on the side you'll see
there's<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.859> line<00:00:48.129> this<00:00:48.969> line<00:00:49.300> needs<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.719> be

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
there's a line this line needs to be

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.680 
there's a line this line needs to be
parallel<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.679> ground<00:00:51.359> 45-degree<00:00:52.359> angle

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
parallel to the ground 45-degree angle

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.259 
parallel to the ground 45-degree angle
is<00:00:52.780> right<00:00:53.050> about<00:00:53.320> there<00:00:53.589> so<00:00:53.890> if<00:00:54.609> you<00:00:54.940> need<00:00:55.239> to

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
at a 45 degree angle that's okay

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.970 
at a 45 degree angle that's okay
there's<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.269> couple<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.659> options<00:01:01.809> you<00:01:02.289> go<00:01:02.920> to
