so what I'm gonna show you is just a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.430 
so what I'm gonna show you is just a
simple<00:00:10.440> trip<00:00:10.650> wire<00:00:10.800> trap<00:00:11.400> using<00:00:11.849> TNT<00:00:12.440> which

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
simple trip wire trap using TNT which

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.620 
simple trip wire trap using TNT which
will<00:00:13.590> kill<00:00:14.130> anybody<00:00:14.340> really<00:00:14.790> probably<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.570> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
will kill anybody really probably on a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.230 
will kill anybody really probably on a
server<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.279> what<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:17.609> here<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.029> just

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
server so what of what like here is just

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.099 
server so what of what like here is just
say<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.510> was<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> cave<00:00:19.460> kind<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.720> in<00:00:21.720> just

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
say it was in the cave kind of in just

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.689 
say it was in the cave kind of in just
like<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.439> don't<00:00:22.650> know<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.890> could<00:00:22.980> be<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.430> little

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
like I don't know it could be a little

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.519 
like I don't know it could be a little
room<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.420> something<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:24.930> where<00:00:25.230> somebody

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
room or something like where somebody

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.599 
room or something like where somebody
could<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.800> walking<00:00:25.949> freeze<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
could just be walking freeze and have to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.890 
could just be walking freeze and have to
be<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.820> big<00:00:27.029> or<00:00:27.150> anything<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.570> but

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
be this big or anything like that but

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.359 
be this big or anything like that but
I'm<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.140> using<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.619> made<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.890> big<00:00:29.099> just

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
I'm just using it made it this big just

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.939 
I'm just using it made it this big just
for<00:00:29.460> an<00:00:29.670> example<00:00:30.170> reason<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.439> made<00:00:31.619> only

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
for an example reason I have made only

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.090 
for an example reason I have made only
too<00:00:32.219> high<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.899> tripwire<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.770> can

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
too high is because the tripwire you can

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.000 
too high is because the tripwire you can
jump<00:00:35.399> over<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:37.860> only

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
jump over it so as you can see it's only

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.229 
jump over it so as you can see it's only
two<00:00:38.190> height<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.640> won't<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.879> able<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.210> over

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
two height you won't be able to get over

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.500 
two height you won't be able to get over
it<00:00:39.480> at<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.820> make<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> tripwire

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it at all so to make a tripwire

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.979 
it at all so to make a tripwire
it's<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.770> simple<00:00:44.480> I'll<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.690> quickly

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it's really simple I'll just quickly

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.520 
it's really simple I'll just quickly
grab<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:47.780> crafting<00:00:48.780> table<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:50.840> show<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.899> so

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
grab a crafting table and show you so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.889 
grab a crafting table and show you so
what<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.860> need<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:54.260> one<00:00:55.260> stick<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:56.280> plank<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
what you need is one stick one plank and

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.610 
what you need is one stick one plank and
also<00:00:57.899> an<00:00:58.170> iron<00:00:58.559> bar<00:00:59.460> ingor<00:01:00.440> barring<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
also an iron bar ingor barring it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.130 
also an iron bar ingor barring it
whatever<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.390> I'm<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.570> find<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:06.049> here<00:01:07.049> we

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
whatever it is I'm just find it here we

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.310 
whatever it is I'm just find it here we
go<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:07.890> iron<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.790> top<00:01:11.510> boom<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.200> get

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
go so then iron at the top boom you get

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.050 
go so then iron at the top boom you get
two<00:01:13.560> tripwire<00:01:13.950> hooks<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.610> exactly<00:01:14.939> what

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
two tripwire hooks which is exactly what

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.109 
two tripwire hooks which is exactly what
you<00:01:15.119> need<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> trap<00:01:16.890> using<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> tripwire

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you need to make a trap using a tripwire

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
you need to make a trap using a tripwire
so<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.290> -<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.710> also<00:01:19.860> need

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so what you want to do - you also need

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.200 
so what you want to do - you also need
to<00:01:20.130> string<00:01:20.430> obviously<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.000> one

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
to string obviously for this one

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.149 
to string obviously for this one
obviously<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.080> need<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> string<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
obviously but you do need to string you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.990 
obviously but you do need to string you
can<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> from<00:01:23.729> cobwebs<00:01:24.540> or<00:01:25.049> spiders<00:01:25.650> or

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
can get it from cobwebs or spiders or

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.640 
can get it from cobwebs or spiders or
things<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.299> if<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.229> should<00:01:28.409> there's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
lots different ways to do it with your

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.330 
lots different ways to do it with your
notable<00:01:30.299> work<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:31.350> sorry<00:01:31.530> different<00:01:32.220> ways

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
notable work if I'm sorry different ways

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.679 
notable work if I'm sorry different ways
so<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> do<00:01:33.240> first<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> always

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so what you want to do first of always

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.690 
so what you want to do first of always
place<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.200> trip<00:01:34.470> wire<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.890> each<00:01:35.070> block<00:01:35.520> make

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
place one trip wire on each block make

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
place one trip wire on each block make
sure<00:01:35.850> they're<00:01:35.970> exactly<00:01:36.170> opposite<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
sure they're exactly opposite so as you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.420 
sure they're exactly opposite so as you
saw<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.130> kind<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.780> measured<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.430> yeah

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
saw I kind of measured it out and yeah

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.219 
saw I kind of measured it out and yeah
so<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.299> what<00:01:42.479> you're<00:01:42.570> also<00:01:42.720> gonna<00:01:42.869> need<00:01:42.930> now

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
so then what you're also gonna need now

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.830 
so then what you're also gonna need now
is<00:01:43.500> strength<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.270> haven't<00:01:45.509> noticed

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
is strength and if you haven't noticed

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.510 
is strength and if you haven't noticed
the<00:01:46.020> string<00:01:46.320> now<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.829> placed<00:01:47.100> along<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the string now can be placed along the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.170 
the string now can be placed along the
floor<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.000> see<00:01:48.890> like<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.939> what<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
floor so you can see like so so what you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270 
floor so you can see like so so what you
want<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> link<00:01:52.590> these<00:01:52.829> two

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
want to do is you want to link these two

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.969 
want to do is you want to link these two
up<00:01:53.430> using<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.909> strength<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.590> place<00:01:55.770> them

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
up using the strength so just place them

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
up using the strength so just place them
all<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.399> middle<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:57.299> they'll

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
all in the middle and then they'll

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.749 
all in the middle and then they'll
automatically<00:01:58.079> lock<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.640> way

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
automatically lock up so then the way

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.889 
automatically lock up so then the way
you<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.000> test<00:02:00.210> make<00:02:00.360> sure<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.509> works<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
you just test make sure it works is you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.819 
you just test make sure it works is you
cross<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> they'll<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.740> down<00:02:02.329> like<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> then

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
cross it they'll go down like so so then

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.160 
cross it they'll go down like so so then
now<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.189> fine<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.939> will<00:02:06.149> work<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:07.020> what

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
now that's fine that will work but what

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.300 
now that's fine that will work but what
you<00:02:07.259> want<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.680> let's<00:02:07.860> go<00:02:08.009> let's<00:02:08.280> just

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you want to do is let's go let's just

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.790 
you want to do is let's go let's just
quickly<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.670> TNT

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
quickly get TNT

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.890 
quickly get TNT
okay<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.300> we're<00:02:13.420> going<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.570> want<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.810> do

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
okay so what we're going to want to do

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.030 
okay so what we're going to want to do
is<00:02:13.990> we<00:02:14.110> need<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.290> make<00:02:14.470> sure<00:02:14.620> we<00:02:14.740> know<00:02:14.890> which

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
is we need to make sure we know which

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.690 
is we need to make sure we know which
block<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.460> is<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:15.850> it's<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.210> third<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.660> down

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
block this is so it's the third one down

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.700 
block this is so it's the third one down
one<00:02:18.700> two<00:02:19.030> three<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:19.750> run<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.290> Redstone

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
one two three and then run the Redstone

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.760 
one two three and then run the Redstone
out<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.160> back<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.900> then<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.200> can<00:02:23.350> link<00:02:23.560> it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
out of the back so then we can link it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.290 
out of the back so then we can link it
to<00:02:23.800> some<00:02:24.340> TNT<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.940> then<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> whole<00:02:25.270> thing

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
to some TNT and then the whole thing

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.640 
to some TNT and then the whole thing
will<00:02:25.540> blow<00:02:25.660> up<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.050> we'll<00:02:26.170> do<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.320> same<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.590> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
will blow up so we'll do the same on the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.380 
will blow up so we'll do the same on the
other<00:02:26.680> side

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
other side

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.890 
other side
third<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.370> will<00:02:30.670> link<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.540> under<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.840> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
third like so I will link it under in a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.960 
third like so I will link it under in a
minute<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.070> then<00:02:33.220> there<00:02:33.400> we<00:02:33.490> go<00:02:33.580> with<00:02:33.760> less

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
minute but so then there we go with less

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.130 
minute but so then there we go with less
we<00:02:34.150> can<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.420> walk<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.720> around<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> front

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
we can just walk it around the front

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.030 
we can just walk it around the front
just<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.350> test<00:02:35.590> just<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> make<00:02:35.920> sure<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.250> works

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
just to test just to make sure it works

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.470 
just to test just to make sure it works
so<00:02:39.040> let's<00:02:39.340> have<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.460> look<00:02:39.580> at<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.820> there<00:02:40.300> we<00:02:40.390> go

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
so let's have a look at it there we go

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.150 
so let's have a look at it there we go
you<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:40.630> see<00:02:40.780> red<00:02:41.230> Sun<00:02:41.440> lights<00:02:41.650> up<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:42.040> it

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
you can see red Sun lights up so it

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.870 
you can see red Sun lights up so it
definitely<00:02:42.310> works

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.150 

so<00:02:45.880> now<00:02:45.970> let's<00:02:46.210> when<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:47.350> do<00:02:47.470> next<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.860> kind<00:02:48.070> of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
so now let's when we do next is kind of

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.890 
so now let's when we do next is kind of
dig<00:02:48.730> up<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.630> floor<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.670> as<00:02:51.700> I'm<00:02:51.970> on<00:02:52.060> superflat

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
dig up the floor so as I'm on superflat

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.620 
dig up the floor so as I'm on superflat
I<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.350> only<00:02:53.470> get<00:02:53.770> like<00:02:54.010> one<00:02:54.580> under<00:02:54.730> but<00:02:55.450> then

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
I can only get like one under but then

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.850 
I can only get like one under but then
what<00:02:55.990> you're<00:02:56.080> gonna<00:02:56.170> want<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.440> do<00:02:56.620> is

so now what I recommend doing here is
just<00:03:20.140> literally<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.370> can<00:03:21.490> make<00:03:21.610> obviously

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
just literally you can make obviously

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.460 
just literally you can make obviously
put<00:03:22.150> more<00:03:22.300> TNT<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.780> stuff<00:03:22.959> down<00:03:23.110> but<00:03:23.290> just

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
put more TNT and stuff down but just

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.400 
put more TNT and stuff down but just
fill<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:23.980> with<00:03:24.100> TNT<00:03:24.540> if<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.660> this<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.050> all<00:03:26.170> full

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
fill it with TNT if you this is all full

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.100 
fill it with TNT if you this is all full
with<00:03:26.440> TNT<00:03:26.830> no<00:03:27.670> chance<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.330> anybody<00:03:28.870> gonna

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
with TNT no chance is anybody gonna

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.850 
with TNT no chance is anybody gonna
really<00:03:29.709> survive<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:32.260> then<00:03:32.380> that's<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.709> once

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
really survive it so then that's it once

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.680 
really survive it so then that's it once
it's<00:03:33.010> full<00:03:33.250> filled<00:03:33.550> with<00:03:33.670> TNT<00:03:36.360> didn't<00:03:37.360> have<00:03:37.540> to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
it's full filled with TNT didn't have to

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.480 
it's full filled with TNT didn't have to
be<00:03:37.780> stupidly<00:03:38.260> accurate<00:03:40.500> okay<00:03:44.160> there<00:03:45.160> yeah<00:03:45.280> and

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
be stupidly accurate okay there yeah and

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.480 
be stupidly accurate okay there yeah and
if<00:03:45.910> if<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:47.020> like<00:03:47.500> because<00:03:48.070> this

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
if if you have it like because this

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.550 
if if you have it like because this
would<00:03:48.670> be<00:03:48.760> like<00:03:48.970> inside<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.630> wall<00:03:49.810> they<00:03:50.320> won't

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
would be like inside of wall they won't

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.270 
would be like inside of wall they won't
be<00:03:50.620> able<00:03:50.740> to<00:03:50.890> see<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:53.440> what's<00:03:53.650> okay<00:03:53.890> what

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
be able to see it but what's okay what

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.740 
be able to see it but what's okay what
you'll<00:03:54.400> know<00:03:54.490> next<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:54.970> make<00:03:55.330> sure<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.540> block

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
you'll know next is make sure the block

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.910 
you'll know next is make sure the block
is<00:03:55.959> still<00:03:56.050> coming<00:03:56.290> out<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.500> side<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.709> then

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
is still coming out the side and then

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.530 
is still coming out the side and then
just<00:03:56.950> link<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.459> straight<00:03:57.760> under<00:03:58.120> into<00:03:58.510> the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
just link it straight under into the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.330 
just link it straight under into the
bottom<00:03:58.840> of<00:03:58.990> one<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.320> TNT<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.100> then<00:04:00.190> when

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
bottom of one of the TNT so then when

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.920 
bottom of one of the TNT so then when
this<00:04:00.459> one<00:04:00.610> explodes<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.270> will<00:04:01.330> set<00:04:01.630> all<00:04:01.780> of

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
this one explodes it will set all of

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.330 
this one explodes it will set all of
them<00:04:02.080> off<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.440> then<00:04:02.860> what<00:04:03.040> you'll<00:04:03.160> do<00:04:03.250> is

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
them off and then what you'll do is

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.190 
them off and then what you'll do is
exactly<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.970> same<00:04:04.150> on<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.360> other<00:04:04.420> side<00:04:04.540> so

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
exactly the same on the other side so

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.100 
exactly the same on the other side so
let's<00:04:05.350> go<00:04:05.500> around

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
let's go around

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.270 
let's go around
really

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
really

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.160 
really
just<00:04:10.280> there<00:04:10.880> we<00:04:10.940> go<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:11.480> can<00:04:11.599> go<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.810> any<00:04:12.050> of

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
just there we go so it can go to any of

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.160 
just there we go so it can go to any of
them<00:04:12.349> and<00:04:12.590> then<00:04:13.160> link<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:13.520> under<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.080> then

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
them and then link it under so and then

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.830 
them and then link it under so and then
now<00:04:15.380> this<00:04:16.340> is<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.880> your<00:04:17.090> trap<00:04:17.329> that's<00:04:17.600> what

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
now this is the your trap that's what

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.300 
now this is the your trap that's what
people<00:04:17.989> would<00:04:18.230> see<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.829> tunnel<00:04:19.160> and

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
people would see just the tunnel and

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.890 
people would see just the tunnel and
then<00:04:19.790> you<00:04:19.910> cannot<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.389> can<00:04:20.540> hide<00:04:20.750> the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
then you cannot you can hide the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.540 
then you cannot you can hide the
tripwires<00:04:21.320> further<00:04:21.680> under<00:04:22.010> I'll<00:04:22.160> show<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.400> on

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
tripwires further under I'll show you on

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.420 
tripwires further under I'll show you on
this<00:04:22.669> side<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.210> as<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.780> demonstration<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:25.250> can

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
this side and as a demonstration you can

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.909 
this side and as a demonstration you can
whack<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:26.330> tripwire<00:04:26.720> under<00:04:27.080> like<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.590> and

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
whack the tripwire under like that and

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.600 
whack the tripwire under like that and
then<00:04:28.580> it's<00:04:29.150> not<00:04:29.330> as<00:04:29.600> visible<00:04:29.750> so<00:04:30.610> they're

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
then it's not as visible so they're

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.330 
then it's not as visible so they're
going<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.880> set<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.180> off<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.510> then<00:04:33.290> in<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.950> second

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
going to set it off and then in a second

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.700 
going to set it off and then in a second
it<00:04:34.550> would<00:04:34.639> explode<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.139> that's<00:04:36.410> how<00:04:36.560> much

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
it would explode so that that's how much

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.470 
it would explode so that that's how much
damage<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:37.070> do<00:04:37.220> nobody<00:04:37.520> would<00:04:38.120> be<00:04:38.210> able<00:04:38.240> to

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
damage I do nobody would be able to

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.200 
damage I do nobody would be able to
survive<00:04:38.720> that<00:04:38.960> TNT<00:04:39.350> trap<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.550> as<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.090> can<00:04:41.150> see

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
survive that TNT trap and as you can see

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.780 
survive that TNT trap and as you can see
you<00:04:42.110> turn<00:04:42.710> over<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:43.040> part<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.490> might<00:04:43.580> want<00:04:43.760> to

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
you turn over the part you might want to

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.460 
you turn over the part you might want to
be<00:04:43.880> careful<00:04:44.060> because<00:04:44.750> you<00:04:44.930> don't<00:04:45.080> just<00:04:45.380> throw

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
be careful because you don't just throw

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.379 
be careful because you don't just throw
your<00:04:45.620> own<00:04:45.740> stuff<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.340> kind<00:04:46.970> of<00:04:47.030> put<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.240> in<00:04:47.330> a

your own stuff so I kind of put it in a

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.520 
your own stuff so I kind of put it in a

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
mine or something then you'll get all

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.560 
mine or something then you'll get all
the<00:04:48.620> resources<00:04:48.710> from<00:04:49.130> anyway<00:04:49.550> but<00:04:49.850> yeah<00:04:50.389> be
