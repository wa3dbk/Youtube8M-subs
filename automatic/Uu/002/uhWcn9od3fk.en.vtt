00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
well these guys are doing but this is if

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.210 
well these guys are doing but this is if
you<00:06:07.690> go<00:06:07.810> lower<00:06:08.050> couple<00:06:08.770> these<00:06:08.860> things<00:06:09.040> are<00:06:09.190> a

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
you go lower couple these things are a

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.970 
you go lower couple these things are a
little<00:06:09.400> bit<00:06:09.580> out<00:06:09.730> of<00:06:09.760> place<00:06:10.620> this<00:06:11.620> is<00:06:11.800> like<00:06:11.950> a

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
little bit out of place this is like a

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.610 
little bit out of place this is like a
Tupac<00:06:12.400> thing<00:06:12.670> don't<00:06:13.540> know<00:06:13.660> why<00:06:13.780> that's<00:06:14.290> there

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
this one says The Supremes I guess it's

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.790
