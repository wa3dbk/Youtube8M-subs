00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello to all good girls in this video 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.540
 today I'm going to talk a little bit about 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.340
 products that I use for hair that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.680
 I can not miss and my tools 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.289
 of work that the same thing I will start 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.470
 for the shampoo first I usually use a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.210
 neutral shampoo almost always and maybe 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 I usually alternate with another I do not have 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.010
 valuable is that one for curly hair 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.260
 but the ones that I could not miss 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.200
 Neutral hair shampoo and especially this 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.390
 of candle that is a shampoo is soothing 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 for sensitive scalp back 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.160
 I teach you already know that I always like 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.350
 we use that if conditioner is that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.570
 if the here that if you dominate the leather 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.129
 scalp is sometimes irritated according to 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.260
 as we have each one to me usually 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.270
 spend a little bit the area of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.649
 what is of the forehead and then when 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.210
 I see that I am using too many 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.620
 things and also that I like a lot 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.629
 test and others that things go well I 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.370
 and other times I do not do well is like 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.570
 everything but come on I have to try it for 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.460
 to know and to say so this is the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.729
 chapu is the sensible scalp 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.790
 Calman candle is the calming me 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.590
 great drag me well does not dry me and 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.020
 It is very soft very oily and has a smell 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.540
 very very nice and makes a lot of foam 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.490
 neither do you need to use much 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.050
 because I already tell you drag super super 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.600
 well all that waste that 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.310
 we have in the hair and apart that 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.619
 Leave the pure hair for calm comes out 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.140
 soft and especially elastic does not stay 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.880
 brace of so much power so much alcohol 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.800
 many times it's your turn so with only 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.500
 move it when the scalp 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.450
 leave it as I like suavecito 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.000
 elastic and I like it a lot later too 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.619
 Well, they gave me to try a brand 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.940
 that is called bio stratus I do not know if 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.580
 better I think that in some video we have 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.319
 talked about them and is particularly 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.620
 it's for curly hair it's called nutri 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.670
 chubs 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.230
 I love it leaves me the lovely curl 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.100
 super dense, very dense 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.080
 does not drop a drop and is fabulous already 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.290
 you know that always curly hair 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.910
 they are drier more frizzy because with 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.190
 this leaves me the ideal hair is super as 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.890
 a hand cream I love that 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.230
 it's not like very gelatinous I do not know but not 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.060
 less dripping or nothing is super good 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.680
 the masks you already know they have a 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.810
 exposure time if you are going to 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.790
 use as a cream forget about the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.970
 masks have to have them so 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.200
 less than 20 minutes and up I put 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.879
 many times as he did not leave me that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 time what we see that did not apply them 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.379
 at night with dry hair I take it what 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.239
 which is a pigtail and from means to ends 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.890
 I measured the whole mask and there was skin and 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.750
 I sleep I'm lame or what a bun is 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.239
 clamp and I sleep with her and day 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.980
 next I wash it and leave the curl 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.409
 super hydrated and elastic 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.030
 I love our same that you try it 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.640
 because I say it is especially 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.099
 I'm going great there's more but this is a 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.440
 of my favorites 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.950
 then use to give me what is a touch 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.340
 with the dryer a ghd gelatin is 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:15.510
 this is tourism the option is a 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.280
 gelatin does not stain I will not teach 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.930
 I take off the moisture well with the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.000
 towel when my hair is wet I 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.190
 I take it well that it does not rain 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.010
 it's a jelly 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.780
 the deal is that it is good for 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.030
 do not remain vomiting, distribute them if 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.340
 I distribute them like this with wet hair and I 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.630
 can you for all my love as such and 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.550
 then it starts to get every hour 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.830
 I do not use when I put this jelly on 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.350
 I use nothing more or foam is nothing 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.610
 It serves is a conditioner but also 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.680
 has a little bit of protector for the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.480
 iron and then after the dryer 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.400
 you are a little bit of a touch of iron 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.970
 It goes very well because it does as well as a 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.470
 protector of what I tell you of iron and 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.440
 Then when I put on my shampoo 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.540
 the mask me what is the adoption and 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.190
 others ended up with the final touch that 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.510
 I can not miss from my 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.989
 it is these excellent favorites 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.879
 One pass I put it as a final touch 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.250
 of serum to give me shine with the 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.360
 wet hair so that the tip follows me 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.049
 that many times you know that the cuticle 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.959
 it opens is an equal cuticle sealer 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.750
 look 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.370
 I love it, it's like it's an oil 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.169
 but what but good that has the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.630
 style and that does not stain if you put it with 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.430
 dry hair gives a touch of serum but 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.349
 do not stain I do not know about fat neither do you put 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.970
 a lot with a few droplets and what 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.410
 applies is the same me too when 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.660
 some experts who stay here more 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.430
 open more so raise and toxo curly 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.800
 I put it like this for the super root 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.190
 superficial is a little bit soft and I do not 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.689
 I put my whole hand so it does not stain 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.909
 and well, I loved it 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.040
 I also recommend you and then my 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.830
 tools 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.889
 to untangle eurostat pulse east 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.499
 shovel brush one pass 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.819
 there are several sizes this is the big one and 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.259
 There is another one that is smaller but to me 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.629
 I like this one more because I also use it 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.939
 to dry when I'm drying to 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:08.159
 Smooth polish very well with a lock 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:11.159
 big and I polish with it I love it 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:13.490
 it's a wonder this pepillo then 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:16.880
 I also use to mark 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.220
 no superfavorite determine I do not 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.020
 I use wood brushes too 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.000
 but I like the technicians more because 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.250
 the time when I'm drying how it 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.620
 They warm me up too, usually 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.729
 they help more to mark and they are a pass 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.849
 I always 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.270
 and then what this tool for me 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.520
 super is the dryer 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.580
 and for those who can not, it is transcendent. 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.700
 used lots of dryers that each 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.800
 it weighs a little because it has a lot of motor and 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.670
 but it's a dry pass a mane 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.100
 good in 5 minutes and I tell you my father 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.610
 always goes with me we go you can not 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.940
 missing in my briefcase and then then the 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.040
 I have also used many more iron 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.320
 but good I'll take the model 4 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.440
 of gh 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.790
 I like it because of the size of the plate 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.490
 because it is in the new one is the problem 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.200
 cloth very well with this model I have 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.910
 had always and besides I have it done 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.090
 a lot of time is going great is the spoiled 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.490
 or anything and used model 4 of ghd and 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.610
 I love that also one of my 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:24.160
 favorite tools good girls so 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.410
