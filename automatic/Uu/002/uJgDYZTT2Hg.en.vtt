 emphasize just the new and quality 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.890
 extraordinary of these images 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.530
 image that tells us all about it 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.119
 feminine sensuality 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.860
 we see the danae lying on the bed 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.520
 the young god who is scared by the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.569
 divine golden rain coming down

 and above all there is something new 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:47.390
 the breath of colors is intensely different 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.780
 what michelangelo also admired 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.330
 once the work arrives in the city 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.840

 of tiziano to tell us through 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.429
 the atmosphere this atmosphere charged

 almost saturated with golden dust 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:09.129
 this all the time of intercourse this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:14.810
 very high and extraordinary moment in which 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:17.420
 the scene itself is wrapped in a light 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.860
 new this light that softened 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.319
 the contours gives us the image 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.150
 of female opulence of opulence 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.160
 sixteenth century of that imaginary that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.340
 will become the starting point of the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.400
 great painting by pieter paul rubens e 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.680
 of all the seventeenth-century generation in 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.160
 a work like this from a poem e 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.130
 mythological like this we have the acme 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.980
 of the Titian production of the years 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.489
 40 for large Italian courts ed 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.069
 European 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.660
 and we understand why Titian has become the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.660
 prince of painters
