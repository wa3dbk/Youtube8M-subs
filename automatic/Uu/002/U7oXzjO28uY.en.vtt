think<00:01:59.610> those<00:01:59.970> are<00:02:00.000> two<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:02.400> know<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.700> two

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
think those are two you know the two

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.450 
think those are two you know the two
weights<00:02:03.090> where<00:02:03.330> we<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:04.340> probably<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> know

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
weights where we have probably you know

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.370 
weights where we have probably you know
the<00:02:05.610> most<00:02:05.850> depth<00:02:06.119> where<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.540> would<00:02:07.200> feel

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the most depth where we would feel

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
part of last year we had I think we were

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.660 
part of last year we had I think we were
third<00:02:50.400> at<00:02:50.519> 57<00:02:51.209> first<00:02:51.450> 65<00:02:52.080> first<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.620> 74<00:02:53.130> second

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
third at 57 first 65 first and 74 second

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.220 
third at 57 first 65 first and 74 second
at<00:02:53.730> 84<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.330> know<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.480> mean<00:02:54.830> what<00:02:55.830> 49<00:02:56.250> first<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
at 84 you know I mean what 49 first and

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.080 
at 84 you know I mean what 49 first and
that's<00:02:58.230> because<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:59.580> attitude

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that's because of that that attitude

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.310 
that's because of that that attitude
that<00:03:00.120> they<00:03:00.450> bring<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.810> there<00:03:00.959> now<00:03:01.140> they're

one<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.230> year<00:03:07.470> two<00:03:07.650> certainly<00:03:08.310> looks<00:03:08.459> like

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
one to year two certainly looks like

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.280 
one to year two certainly looks like
Nico<00:03:08.910> megaludis<00:03:09.209> has<00:03:09.510> taken<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.930> big<00:03:10.260> step

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
Nico megaludis has taken a big step

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.090 
Nico megaludis has taken a big step
forward<00:03:10.920> not<00:03:11.760> necessarily<00:03:12.530> results<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.739> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
forward not necessarily results just the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.800 
forward not necessarily results just the
way<00:03:14.250> he<00:03:14.459> looks<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> mat<00:03:15.150> what's<00:03:15.540> been<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
way he looks on the mat what's been the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.960 
way he looks on the mat what's been the
biggest<00:03:15.900> difference<00:03:16.380> for<00:03:16.410> him<00:03:16.590> from<00:03:17.579> year<00:03:17.760> one

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
biggest difference for him from year one

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.199 
biggest difference for him from year one
to<00:03:18.000> year<00:03:18.180> two<00:03:18.329> uh<00:03:18.950> well<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:19.980> think<00:03:20.209> experience

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
to year two uh well I think experience

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.860 
to year two uh well I think experience
is<00:03:21.510> big<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.739> he's<00:03:23.329> he<00:03:24.329> knows<00:03:24.540> what<00:03:24.780> he<00:03:24.840> wants

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
is big but he's he knows what he wants

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.780 
is big but he's he knows what he wants
you<00:03:25.260> know<00:03:25.380> he's<00:03:25.620> very<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.430> very<00:03:26.640> clear

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
you know he's very is a very clear

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.930 
you know he's very is a very clear
purpose<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.600> he<00:03:28.440> did<00:03:28.590> last<00:03:28.860> year<00:03:29.010> even<00:03:29.579> if<00:03:29.730> if

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
purpose and he did last year even if if

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.190 
purpose and he did last year even if if
things<00:03:30.269> weren't<00:03:30.510> going<00:03:30.720> as<00:03:31.620> as<00:03:32.660> ideal<00:03:33.660> or<00:03:33.959> as
