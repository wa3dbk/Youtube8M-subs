00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.100
 hello good today we are here in a new 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.560
 video a special video just goes to 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.190
 serve the people who have 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.690
 the playstation 4 touch pad because it's 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.920
 what I'm going to explain what functions 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.650
 he has the touch pad in this 9 to 2 14 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.289
 the only thing where we can use it is in 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.250
 the game 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.500
 inside d 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.150
 of a game the menus and that does not 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.630
 we can scroll through the touch pad 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.750
 and for example if when we are attacking 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.450
 come on we put the finger and move it towards 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.780
 the right we will ask the play will go the 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.550
 low post as we see the players then 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.190
 they would have to start there ask 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.460
 for the low post the play lack of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.260
 splitter and now let's do the other 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.410
 option that we have that is to slide the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.090
 finger to the left we will pass it 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.670
 to lebron james we go to the left 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.800
 and is supposed to ask us for a clarified 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.140
 fast we see how bosch opens towards the 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.540
 outside we throw with him and let's see 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.940
 Defensive defensive options 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.530
 if we move to the right we see how 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.530
 it marks us an area 2-3 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.820
 and if we move it to the left we 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.940
 Mark a 1-3-1 area is a fast way 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.220
 to choose the plays instead of now in 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.250
 defense we will have to give to 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.970
 to the left and mark them in case of 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.970
 Attack plays 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.360
 I think they would be 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.610
 right now I do not remember or how 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.920
 ask for the plays because I usually do 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.990
 the quick play the one that marks the best 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.020
 played and that 's it but I think it was 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.079
 doing thus marking and as you see then 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.450
 we have a lot of plays that many 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.549
 Sometimes we do not know how they are then 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.820
 if we want to make a very fast play 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.649
 such as the rinsing or the post 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.479
 low then just move the joystick towards 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.219
 right or left 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.939
 put the touch to take advantage of this 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.629
 point 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.799
 and for something they have put it on us and 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:18.410
 defense therefore the same area 32 or zone 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.910
 1-3-1 to the left and hungry 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.860
 it would be good if they had implemented 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.190
 also up and down 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.120
 take advantage of some things for example if 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.650
 in attack we click the gesture and click 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.430
 The touch pad does not do absolutely 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.849
 nothing and we will see in defense but in 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.000
 defense to see if we click the touch pad 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:45.630
 because it does absolutely nothing 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.820
 Well, a few characteristics that 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.920
 have added in this year at least have 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.690
 added something that in some games is 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.180
 emplease and they are four you have the touch 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.160
 bad but you can not use it because 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.450
 does absolutely nothing but in this 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.700
 yes yes that is truly true 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.520
 well useful in case especially since it has 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.780
 quick rinse and there you can do your 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.970
 played and not depend on being marked 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.090
 if the best move is such a rinse or 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.310
 have to read art to give him one not 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.860
 I know that then the other so you have your 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.060
 quick rinse because nothing this was the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.220
 video that I wanted to show as a small 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.830
 tutorial so of the options that it has 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.150
 the touch pad only works towards the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.489
 right to the left has some 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.060
 functions in the defense a few functions 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.860
 in attack to the right in defense 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.130
 we have zone 32 towards the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.890
 left we have the 131 and in attack 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.840
 to the right we have the post 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.360
 low and to the left the rinse 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.280
 fast I hope you liked it 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.940
 like to give you like favorites and if you want
