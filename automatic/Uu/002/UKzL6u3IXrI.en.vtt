the cases because I like a little bit

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.010 
the cases because I like a little bit
more<00:00:12.420> slim<00:00:12.929> design<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.940> I<00:00:14.940> got<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.929> just

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020

regular<00:00:19.680> iPhone<00:00:19.830> 6<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:21.560> we'll<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.680> reviewing

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
regular iPhone 6 and we'll be reviewing

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.250 
regular iPhone 6 and we'll be reviewing
these<00:00:23.220> two<00:00:23.460> cases<00:00:23.670> one<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.210> Sahara<00:00:24.630> brand<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
these two cases one is Sahara brand and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.810 
these two cases one is Sahara brand and
the<00:00:25.859> other<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:27.949> spigen<00:00:28.949> or<00:00:29.130> spigen<00:00:29.550> I'm

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the other one is spigen or spigen I'm

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.009 
the other one is spigen or spigen I'm
not<00:00:29.970> sure<00:00:30.150> how<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.300> pronounce<00:00:30.539> correctly

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
not sure how to pronounce correctly

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.920 
not sure how to pronounce correctly
maybe<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.769> read<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> right<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:33.390> by

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
maybe you can read it right here it's by

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.479 
maybe you can read it right here it's by
spigen<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:38.570> first<00:00:39.570> we'll<00:00:40.230> put<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> spike

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
spigen so first we'll put on the spike

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.790 
spigen so first we'll put on the spike
in<00:00:41.640> case<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.239> we'll<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:43.050> over<00:00:43.170> its<00:00:43.410> features

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
in case and we'll go over its features

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.549 
in case and we'll go over its features
and<00:00:44.070> how<00:00:44.820> easy<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.450> put<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
and how easy it is to put on and as you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.520 
and how easy it is to put on and as you
can<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.219> case<00:00:47.489> has<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> clear<00:00:48.270> back<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
can see this case has a clear back in a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.420 
can see this case has a clear back in a
rubber<00:00:50.309> TPU<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> little<00:00:51.899> bit<00:00:52.020> hard<00:00:52.890> it's

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
rubber TPU that's a little bit hard it's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.330 
rubber TPU that's a little bit hard it's
not<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.760> flimsy<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:55.469> we'll<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.039> put<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
not as flimsy and we'll just put the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.189 
not as flimsy and we'll just put the
song<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.910> we'll<00:00:57.570> review<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.399> easy<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.820> to

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
song and we'll review how easy it is to

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.529 
song and we'll review how easy it is to
click<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.469> buttons<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.359> its

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
click on the buttons and and all its

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.010 
click on the buttons and and all its
other<00:01:03.690> features<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.939> as<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
other features so as you can see I just

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.649 
other features so as you can see I just
put<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.320> case<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.250> fairly<00:01:09.000> easy

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
put this case on and it was fairly easy

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.399 
put this case on and it was fairly easy
to<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> plus

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
to put on and you can see that the plus

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.950 
to put on and you can see that the plus
and<00:01:13.710> minus<00:01:13.979> sign<00:01:14.189> are<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.270> volume<00:01:15.659> buttons

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and minus sign are the volume buttons

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
and minus sign are the volume buttons
are<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> vibrate<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.939> here

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
are here and then the vibrate is here

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.899 
are here and then the vibrate is here
and<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.720> power<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.530> they<00:01:20.189> are<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and then the power is here they are the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.280 
and then the power is here they are the
disadvantage<00:01:21.479> about<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.810> case<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
disadvantage about this case that I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.990 
disadvantage about this case that I
found<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.770> every<00:01:23.040> time<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.250> try<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.490> press<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
found is every time I try to press the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.330 
found is every time I try to press the
power<00:01:24.240> button<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.590> hard<00:01:25.830> time<00:01:26.009> because

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
power button I have a hard time because

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
power button I have a hard time because
sometimes<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.970> press<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.720> plus<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> minus

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
sometimes I press the plus or the minus

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.850 
sometimes I press the plus or the minus
at<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> same<00:01:30.689> time<00:01:30.960> when<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:31.350> trying<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> turn

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
at the same time when I'm trying to turn

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.679 
at the same time when I'm trying to turn
off<00:01:32.070> my<00:01:32.100> display<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:35.360> sometimes<00:01:36.360> hard<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
off my display so it's sometimes hard to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
off my display so it's sometimes hard to
press<00:01:37.020> press<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> button<00:01:38.369> or<00:01:38.490> turn<00:01:38.700> off<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
press press the button or turn off the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.319 
press press the button or turn off the
display<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.829> as<00:01:40.829> far<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> feel<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:42.090> does

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
display so as far as the feel it does

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.690 
display so as far as the feel it does
feel<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.659> bit<00:01:42.840> bulky<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.460> bulky

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
feel a little bit bulky but not as bulky

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
feel a little bit bulky but not as bulky
but<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> design<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.710> it's

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
but the design as you can see it's

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.100 
but the design as you can see it's
pretty<00:01:47.520> good<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> whole<00:01:48.899> back

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
pretty good you can see the whole back

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.280 
pretty good you can see the whole back
in<00:01:49.409> which<00:01:50.299> sometimes<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.450> want<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> phone<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
in which sometimes you want the phone to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.090 
in which sometimes you want the phone to
look<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> Apple<00:01:53.909> branded<00:01:54.270> phone

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
look like it's the Apple branded phone

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.030 
look like it's the Apple branded phone
but<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> case<00:01:58.649> by

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
but as you can see this is the case by

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.060 
but as you can see this is the case by
spiking<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.270> we're<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> take<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.930> off

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.510 

and<00:02:05.720> cases<00:02:06.720> should<00:02:06.900> be<00:02:06.960> somewhere<00:02:07.520> somewhat

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
and cases should be somewhere somewhat

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.790 
and cases should be somewhere somewhat
difficult<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.179> off<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:10.440> they're<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
difficult to take off so they're a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.830 
difficult to take off so they're a

go Sahara over the spy in case it just

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.539
