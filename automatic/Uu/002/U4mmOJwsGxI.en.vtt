00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.780
 for the people welcome once more 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.660
 just for all of us today we will be 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.450
 teaching another mega challenge in which 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.340
 we will be using two bottles of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.720
 these little chiquititas of glass and in this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.520
 game you're not just going to be putting 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.400
 your ingenuity but you're also going to put 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.510
 at stake your skill this challenge consists 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.610
 in the following I will explain 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.949
 have to take two bottles and we're going 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.080
 to join peak with peak in this way what 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 let's take with one hand this 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.470
 way and now the goal is the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.649
 next we're going to have to take the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.840
 two bottles with one hand without 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.790
 support it nowhere we can not do 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.079
 trap we can not help with anything and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.980
 we have to move from this position to 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.420
 this position with only one hand in this 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.280
 case it has to be the hand that is 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.320
 holding the bottles can not 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.059
 support bottles no where not 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.039
 can be helped with any other object 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.750
 the only thing they can use is their hand 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.019
 right or the hand that you are using to 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.119
 hold the bottles and if they cheer up 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.610
 then look for the return to return 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:07.100
 again to the initial position of this 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.830
 position we go back to this 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.720
 position and there are already some cracks are 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.490
 some geniuses so good he left them 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.679
 thinking I'm going to take a little longer to go up 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.780
 the solution because everyone is already 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.190
 goes to the solution directly and if 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.230

 in the channel we have another challenge that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.650
 It is also so good to make your 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.830
 friends are challenges that really go to 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.780
 break your head and there is one who has a 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.000
 little of this what is skill but 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.860
 that is also a bit of technique that is 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.450
 the challenge of how to start a guide 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.070
 telephone with your own hands 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.050
 I'm going to leave here below and what is 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.120
 good is that which is not force but 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.220
 technique and it's a good challenge to do 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.020
 to the people and if I do not leave you another here 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.750
 above that we recorded it ago 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.310
 time already and it's the challenge of the tape what 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.170
 can see how a challenge can see it 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.050
 like a magic trick and is very good 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.600
 is one that you are tied to a thread in 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.450
 both hands and put a ribbon in shape 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.820
 circular hoop and the challenge of 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.800
 to get it out without loosening the knot 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.050
 great to go through that video and good without 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.430
