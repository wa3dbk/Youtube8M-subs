buttons<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.720> need<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.860> still<00:02:49.190> need<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.490> figure

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
buttons I need to still need to figure

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.560 
buttons I need to still need to figure
out<00:02:49.910> which<00:02:50.210> buttons<00:02:50.980> pushed<00:02:52.180> programs<00:02:53.180> up<00:02:53.390> and

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
out which buttons pushed programs up and

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.090 
out which buttons pushed programs up and
down<00:02:53.770> here<00:02:54.770> you<00:02:54.920> can<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.370> switch<00:02:55.760> and

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
down here you can have a switch and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.300 
down here you can have a switch and
basically<00:02:58.990> that's<00:02:59.990> it<00:03:00.260> here<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.040> can<00:03:01.220> switch

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
basically that's it here you can switch

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.220 
basically that's it here you can switch
within<00:03:01.880> TV<00:03:02.210> and<00:03:02.420> video<00:03:02.840> or<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.770> ER<00:03:04.100> or<00:03:04.960> DVD<00:03:05.960> as

you enter 1174 and you can get a PDF for
any<00:03:48.350> watch<00:03:48.770> you<00:03:49.100> got<00:03:49.370> on<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.510> just<00:03:50.900> need<00:03:51.200> to

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
any watch you got on so just need to

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.010

find<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.800> module<00:03:52.310> number<00:03:52.640> in<00:03:52.790> your<00:03:52.940> watch<00:03:53.120> in<00:03:53.510> a

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
find a module number in your watch in a

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.840 
find a module number in your watch in a
circled<00:03:54.740> part<00:03:55.640> here<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:57.200> that's<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.370> here<00:03:58.640> you

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
circled part here and that's it here you

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.260 
circled part here and that's it here you
have<00:03:58.880> an<00:03:59.240> easy<00:03:59.440> ir<00:04:00.440> stuff<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.760> it's<00:04:02.120> really

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
have an easy ir stuff and it's really

cool watch off

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.790 
cool watch off
so<00:04:06.520> cooler<00:04:07.520> than<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.150> anticipated<00:04:08.750> because<00:04:09.380> I

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
so cooler than I anticipated because I

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.280 
so cooler than I anticipated because I
wasn't<00:04:10.550> really<00:04:10.730> expecting<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.390> remote

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
wasn't really expecting that remote

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.100 
wasn't really expecting that remote
control<00:04:12.710> over<00:04:12.740> it<00:04:13.220> but<00:04:13.510> here<00:04:14.510> we<00:04:14.630> go

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
control over it but here we go

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.420 
control over it but here we go
you<00:04:15.230> saw<00:04:15.500> it<00:04:15.910> again<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.180> said<00:04:17.390> it<00:04:18.070> was<00:04:19.070> hard<00:04:19.340> to

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
you saw it again I said it was hard to

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.750 
you saw it again I said it was hard to
me<00:04:19.880> too<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.330> was<00:04:20.630> unprepared<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.500> had<00:04:21.709> no<00:04:21.890> no<00:04:22.520> one

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
here to help me I had poor washing and

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.380 
here to help me I had poor washing and
it's<00:04:26.840> harder<00:04:27.350> than<00:04:27.860> I<00:04:27.980> anticipated<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.910> make

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
it's harder than I anticipated to make

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
it's harder than I anticipated to make
up<00:04:29.660> footage<00:04:30.290> um<00:04:31.180> remoting<00:04:32.180> despot<00:04:32.690> works<00:04:33.140> and

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
up footage um remoting despot works and

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.120 
up footage um remoting despot works and
I'm<00:04:34.010> happy<00:04:34.400> with<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.700> so<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:36.080> was<00:04:36.350> my

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
I'm happy with that so that was my

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.320 
I'm happy with that so that was my

calculator so um you enter here in a

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.760 
calculator so um you enter here in a
mock<00:04:50.450> calculator<00:04:51.110> mode<00:04:51.380> see<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.490> just

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
mock calculator mode see and just

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.180 
mock calculator mode see and just
calculate<00:04:54.770> stuff<00:04:55.730> and<00:04:56.120> blah<00:04:56.360> blah<00:04:56.390> blah<00:04:56.860> but<00:04:57.860> I

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.140 
calculate stuff and blah blah blah but I
don't<00:04:58.430> like<00:04:58.550> math<00:04:58.850> so<00:04:59.860> anyways<00:05:00.860> that's<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.820> and

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
don't like math so anyways that's it and

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.310 
don't like math so anyways that's it and
she's<00:05:02.360> gonna<00:05:02.540> give<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:02.900> a<00:05:02.930> quick<00:05:03.140> question
