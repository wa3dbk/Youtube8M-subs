taper dead end it gives you a finish on

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.270 
taper dead end it gives you a finish on
the<00:00:12.460> end<00:00:12.670> that<00:00:12.969> is<00:00:13.750> tapered<00:00:14.230> out<00:00:14.380> and<00:00:14.650> very

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
the end that is tapered out and very

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.730 
the end that is tapered out and very
smooth<00:00:15.720> the<00:00:16.720> first<00:00:16.960> thing<00:00:17.200> we're<00:00:17.349> going<00:00:17.439> to<00:00:17.500> do

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
smooth the first thing we're going to do

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.040 
smooth the first thing we're going to do
is<00:00:18.010> we're<00:00:18.460> going<00:00:18.490> to<00:00:18.610> move<00:00:18.790> our<00:00:18.939> saw<00:00:19.210> over<00:00:19.869> to

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
is we're going to move our saw over to

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.630 
is we're going to move our saw over to
the<00:00:20.140> right<00:00:20.880> 22<00:00:21.880> and<00:00:22.180> 1/2<00:00:22.270> degrees<00:00:23.490> we're<00:00:24.490> going

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
the right 22 and 1/2 degrees we're going

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.160 
the right 22 and 1/2 degrees we're going
to<00:00:24.699> put<00:00:24.850> our<00:00:24.940> molding<00:00:25.300> up<00:00:25.420> against<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.900> fence

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
to put our molding up against the fence

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.620 
to put our molding up against the fence
this<00:00:26.800> would<00:00:27.010> be<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.279> top<00:00:27.460> this<00:00:28.270> would<00:00:28.510> be

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
this would be the top this would be

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.670 
this would be the top this would be
towards<00:00:28.990> the<00:00:29.080> floor

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
towards the floor

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.390 
towards the floor
we're<00:00:30.039> going<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.220> make<00:00:30.340> our<00:00:30.490> first<00:00:30.730> cut<00:00:35.400> this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
we're going to make our first cut this

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.060 
we're going to make our first cut this
is<00:00:36.580> a<00:00:36.670> 22<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.360> a<00:00:37.420> half<00:00:37.449> degree<00:00:38.019> cut<00:00:38.320> we're

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
is a 22 and a half degree cut we're

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.579 
is a 22 and a half degree cut we're
going<00:00:39.100> to<00:00:39.280> take<00:00:39.460> our<00:00:39.610> next<00:00:39.940> piece<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.589> we're

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
going to take our next piece and we're

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.130 
going to take our next piece and we're
going<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.769> flip<00:00:41.949> it<00:00:42.010> upside<00:00:42.280> down<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.930> would

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
going to flip it upside down this would

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.689 
going to flip it upside down this would
be<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.470> ceiling<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.070> this<00:00:45.309> would<00:00:45.489> be<00:00:45.610> the

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
be the ceiling and this would be the

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.299 
be the ceiling and this would be the
floor<00:00:46.000> molding

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
floor molding

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.060 
floor molding
put<00:00:48.309> it<00:00:48.400> flat<00:00:48.549> up<00:00:48.790> against<00:00:49.089> the<00:00:49.210> back<00:00:53.070> make

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
put it flat up against the back make

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.180 
put it flat up against the back make
another<00:00:54.400> 22<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.180> a<00:00:55.210> half<00:00:55.360> degree<00:00:55.690> corner<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
another 22 and a half degree corner so

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.539 
another 22 and a half degree corner so
now<00:00:57.370> what<00:00:57.610> we<00:00:57.729> have<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:58.180> we<00:00:58.659> have<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:59.140> 45<00:01:00.100> degree

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
now what we have is we have a 45 degree

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:01.789 
now what we have is we have a 45 degree
corner

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
corner

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.520 
corner
so<00:01:02.799> what<00:01:02.979> we<00:01:03.100> need<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.369> do<00:01:03.519> now<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:04.750> take<00:01:05.170> and

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
so what we need to do now is take and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
so what we need to do now is take and
move<00:01:05.920> our<00:01:06.130> saw<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.690> left<00:01:09.390> 45<00:01:10.390> degrees<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
move our saw to the left 45 degrees and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.090 
move our saw to the left 45 degrees and
right<00:01:13.090> here<00:01:13.270> at<00:01:13.359> this<00:01:13.479> very<00:01:13.539> point<00:01:14.100> we're

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
right here at this very point we're

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.349 
right here at this very point we're
going<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.369> take<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:16.149> align<00:01:16.270> our<00:01:16.810> saw<00:01:17.200> blade<00:01:17.530> up

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
going to take and align our saw blade up

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:27.599 
going to take and align our saw blade up
with<00:01:19.359> that<00:01:19.570> edge<00:01:23.280> make<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.579> cut<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.979> now<00:01:27.189> what

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
with that edge make that cut so now what

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.020 
with that edge make that cut so now what
we<00:01:27.729> have<00:01:27.969> is<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.570> 22<00:01:29.289> and<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.439> half<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.920> 22<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:30.969> a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
we have is a 22 and a half a 22 and a

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.740 
we have is a 22 and a half a 22 and a
half<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:32.320> 45<00:01:32.920> degree<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.479> what<00:01:34.630> we're

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
half and a 45 degree and what we're

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.109 
half and a 45 degree and what we're
going<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.899> do<00:01:35.109> is<00:01:35.409> take<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.799> little<00:01:35.979> hot<00:01:36.189> glue<00:01:36.219> on

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
going to do is take a little hot glue on

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.849 
going to do is take a little hot glue on
the<00:01:37.270> end<00:01:37.859> take<00:01:38.859> our<00:01:39.039> small<00:01:39.340> piece<00:01:40.499> line<00:01:41.499> it<00:01:41.679> up

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
the end take our small piece line it up

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.830 
the end take our small piece line it up
and<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.899> have<00:01:44.049> made<00:01:44.320> right<00:01:45.070> hand<00:01:45.460> taper<00:01:46.420> dead

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
and we have made right hand taper dead

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.309 
and we have made right hand taper dead
end<00:01:47.109> now<00:01:48.039> to<00:01:48.100> make<00:01:48.429> a<00:01:48.460> left<00:01:48.759> hand<00:01:49.149> all<00:01:49.390> we<00:01:49.719> do<00:01:50.049> is

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
end now to make a left hand all we do is

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.849 
end now to make a left hand all we do is
cut<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.219> opposite<00:01:51.789> end<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.259> long<00:01:53.560> piece

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
cut the opposite end with a long piece

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.789 
cut the opposite end with a long piece
and<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.219> small<00:01:54.520> piece
