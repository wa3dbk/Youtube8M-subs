across<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.379> piece<00:01:03.559> I<00:01:03.799> think<00:01:04.220> well<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:04.580> robust

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000

health what we're going to do now is get
you<00:01:07.070> guys<00:01:07.220> out<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.520> way<00:01:07.640> get<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.540> Machine

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
you guys out of the way get the Machine

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.330 
you guys out of the way get the Machine
through<00:01:08.990> here<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.619> get<00:01:09.890> on<00:01:10.040> our<00:01:10.070> way<00:01:10.280> to

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
through here and get on our way to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.640 
through here and get on our way to
finally<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.960> last<00:01:12.140> couple<00:01:12.439> of<00:01:12.470> hours

finally and the last couple of hours

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.940 
finally and the last couple of hours
before<00:01:12.950> we<00:01:13.189> we<00:01:13.729> break<00:01:13.970> through<00:01:14.590> we<00:01:15.590> take<00:01:15.830> the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
before we we break through we take the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.160 
before we we break through we take the
pressure<00:01:16.159> off<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.759> machine<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.780> machine<00:01:18.049> is

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
pressure off the machine the machine is

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.770 
pressure off the machine the machine is
running<00:01:18.409> in<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:19.009> an<00:01:19.100> EPB<00:01:19.490> mode<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:20.600> take

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
running in a and an EPB mode so we take

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.330 
running in a and an EPB mode so we take
the<00:01:20.899> pressure<00:01:21.079> off<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:21.619> we<00:01:21.740> break<00:01:22.009> through<00:01:22.219> on

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
the pressure off and we break through on

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.039 
the pressure off and we break through on
that<00:01:22.460> mysteric<00:01:22.999> condition<00:01:23.509> because<00:01:23.780> we<00:01:23.899> don't

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
that mysteric condition because we don't

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.469 
that mysteric condition because we don't
want<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.289> influence<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.549> structure<00:01:25.969> you<00:01:26.119> will
