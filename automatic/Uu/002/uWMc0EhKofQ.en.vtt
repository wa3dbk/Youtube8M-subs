00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 and talking about cars see new ford f-150 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.529
 a giant that lavishes chrome and 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.529
 striking visual 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.310
 Ford presented with 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.490
 enthusiasm the new generation of pickup truck 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.420
 f-150 during the detroit hall in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.420
 January this year 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.540
 the market- leading pickup truck for more 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.010
 a decade 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.250
 the model was reformulated 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.620
 complete and brought the 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.550
 bodywork with various parts made in 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.210
 aluminum 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.879
 the result was a reduction in weight of 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.629
 320 pounds and significant improvements in 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.180
 consumption 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.850
 the robust appearance remained together 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.019
 with protruding wheel arches and please 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.019
 carved in the front 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.930
 now the headlights and taillights 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.330
 are led 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.120
 the pickup truck has on the American market five 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.150
 versions and there is still an off road package 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.790
 called fx 4 which brings locking 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.650
 electronic rear axle protectors and 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.650
 shock absorbers for off - road use 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 very comfortable inside space beyond 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.850
 a sophisticated finish the interior of the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.510
 f-150 is one of the trumps of the model and 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.510
 much praised by its owners 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.210
 unfortunately there are no concrete forecasts 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.120
 of this giant on wheels to be imported 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.270
 To Brazil though the Ford does not discard 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:01.080
 this possibility would be very good indeed 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.080
 it was a f150 running through our wetland
