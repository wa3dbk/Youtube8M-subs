00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.620 
with all these different types of laws
but<00:02:56.110> I'm<00:02:56.260> pretty<00:02:56.530> sure<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:57.280> fine<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.330> play

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
but I'm pretty sure it's fine to play

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.990 
but I'm pretty sure it's fine to play
Angry<00:02:58.930> Birds<00:02:59.230> music<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.100> as<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.519> have<00:03:00.790> the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
Angry Birds music and as I have the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.850 
Angry Birds music and as I have the
Angry<00:03:01.299> Birds<00:03:01.510> Mini<00:03:02.040> I'll<00:03:03.040> use<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.580> as<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:04.000> test

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
Angry Birds Mini I'll use that as a test

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.690 
Angry Birds Mini I'll use that as a test
so<00:03:06.030> there's<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.630> volume<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.950> PSP<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.459> on

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
so there's the volume that the PSP is on

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.850 
so there's the volume that the PSP is on
you<00:03:09.880> can't<00:03:10.120> see<00:03:10.299> it<00:03:10.420> very<00:03:10.450> well<00:03:10.690> but

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
you can't see it very well but

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:26.460 
you can't see it very well but
and<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.900> turn<00:03:15.200> docking<00:03:15.830> station<00:03:16.220> up<00:03:21.670> base

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:44.680 

surround<00:03:31.330> both<00:03:32.330> off<00:03:35.800> both<00:03:36.800> on<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:44.120> as<00:03:44.360> you<00:03:44.540> can

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
surround both off both on so as you can

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.890 
surround both off both on so as you can
hear<00:03:44.750> obviously<00:03:45.680> your<00:03:46.040> hearing<00:03:46.550> obviously<00:03:47.450> a

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
hear obviously your hearing obviously a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.330 
hear obviously your hearing obviously a
very<00:03:48.140> different<00:03:48.500> quality<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:49.070> what<00:03:49.100> I'm

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
very different quality to what I'm

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.910 
very different quality to what I'm
hearing<00:03:49.790> but<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.750> can<00:03:50.930> kind<00:03:51.170> of<00:03:51.230> tell<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.740> is

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
hearing but you can kind of tell that is

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.680 
hearing but you can kind of tell that is
quite<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.250> big<00:03:52.520> difference<00:03:52.970> between<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.510> base

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
quite a big difference between the base

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.230 
quite a big difference between the base
and<00:03:53.930> surround<00:03:54.470> effects<00:03:55.370> on<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:55.970> there<00:03:56.150> are

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
and surround effects on so there are

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.970
