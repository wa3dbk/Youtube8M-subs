backwards compatibility there was not

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030 
backwards compatibility there was not
backwards<00:01:54.479> compatibility<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> 360<00:01:55.740> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
backwards compatibility for the 360 so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.219 
backwards compatibility for the 360 so
I'm<00:01:56.490> doubting<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.390> next<00:01:57.479> generation<00:01:57.750> so

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
