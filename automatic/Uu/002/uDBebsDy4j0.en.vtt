00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.800
 heart of emotions also the 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.960
 mother nature took the time to 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.970
 make flowers and these flowers that make 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.279
 apart from that they adorn nature 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.529

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.840
 I've heard a lot of them but to science 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.600

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.010

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.450

 will transfer the flowers of bach if the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.790
 discovered the doctor eduard back in the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.590
 thirties and he was allopathic doctor and 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.989
 it said good because I can not find 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.930
 really the solution to 500 study 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.610
 myopathy too and you want you do not have to 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.170
 have something that really covers the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.969
 people because he always claimed that 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.240
 behind each disease there is a 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:18.280
 negative emotion that caused it 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.829
 we have to deal with the emotions for 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.189
 can treat the disease then he 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.499
 was born in the wales forest england and 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.569
 then he came back after so many 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:30.130
 races he did and all he came back to 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.740
 Welsh forest to seek this remedy 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 wonderful of the bach flowers 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.380
 discovered 38 different remedies yes and of 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.929
 these remedies each one goes to emotions 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.600
 different then you make them a 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.819
 interview and then according to what's going 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.399
 in need you can get from 1 to 6 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.130
 remedies in a vial if in this 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.590
 little bottle let me propose from 1 to 6 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.600
 remedies and nothing else is taken 4 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.060
 droplets under the tongue four times 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.009
 a day then up to 10 times a day 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.539
 after the presentation of mint 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.040
 you have already given us there may also be 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.200
 other not the presentation is this appointment 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.020
 then these are the prescribed ones that 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.760
 they come from england and pack them only 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.800
 they continue to pack after seventy and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.620
 so many years that she died the doctor 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.290
 back are still happening and the essences and 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.680
 each one goes to a different emotion by 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.470
 example if there is a majoli flex that is 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.020
 the flower of love then the holy 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.910
 combat or gave anger jealousy envy 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.820
 because because if you're inundated with love, 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.890
 you feel all those negative emotions 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.230
 if we have flowers for fear flowers 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.209
 for depression but they are very 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.610
 specific let's say if you say I have 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.260
 fear of spiders is like a phobia yes 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.510
 clear then we are a flower that 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.670
 love and walls but if you say not that 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.709
 I'm scared I'm not afraid of everything 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.080
 I feel jump I turn I feel that something 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.150
 will happen is fear of the unknown is 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.709
 flame aspe then we put another flower 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.239
 different for children can reach 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.239
 being very affectionate to children is 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.670
 wonderful because we have this flowers 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.100
 special let's say if the child has a 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.200
 Little brother and he is very jealous 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.760
 Holly as we said it is for 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.130
 doing it we give her her flowers and she is not going to 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.950
 be jealous if the child is shy 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.780
 we give minutes if the child pees in 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.090
 the bed we give cherry plan with well 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.220
 it could be in the phase itch in bed 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.320
 you want to draw attention then you 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.239
 we give then yes because if then there is 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.890
 what to see because it can be out of fear 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.000
 Many times it's scary at night 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.100
 simple 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.410
 but it can be because of the little brother because 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.690
 they are giving too much to him 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.190
 we both give you already hole and you 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.350
 we give guys and that is to call the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.570
 attention then that's why a 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.760
 full evaluation and we decide which 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.890
 of the essences you need that gives them 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.200
 this bottle lasts approximately 15 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.209
 days and in those 15 days we are going to make a 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.400
 interview or in a month and then 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.380
 we asked and many of the emotions already 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.510
 they do not have them then how is it like 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.160
 peel an onion emotions are coming out 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.160
 that were lower and that not even 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.070
 we are aware that we had them 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.010
 but of children also in children and 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.989
 It does not hurt to give them these kinds of droplets 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.239
 for example this has no effect 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.040
 secondary does not conflict with any 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.739
 medicine you can give to a baby 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.769
 newborn and you can give it to a 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.230
 Aged people can only leave people in 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.760
 terminal stage it can give what 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.880
 be and it does not have any side effects 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.500
 nor does it contradict this does not replace 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.510
 medicines and can not get to 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.120
 complement some treatment because 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.400
 deals with emotions exactly but 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.449
 fixed that already trying this many 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.059
 Sometimes you do not need 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.710
 Of course we are not going to suspend them 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:40.409
 not if the person is taking certain 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.089
 medicines for something are left 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.979
 he gives them the flowers but little by little they go to 

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:46.139
 see that they no longer need so much I'm 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.029
 sure he's coming to see me and I'm watching 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.449
 that also serve for resentment 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:54.719
 or is direct resent with papers in 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.990
 place of the walk a carpet 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:00.089
 TomÃ¡s Flores, words, high-sounding 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.740
 method my flowers and I'll forget it 

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:03.930
 Well look what happens is that it accelerates 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.419
 that is, of courage, we all feel 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.490
 courage at a certain moment but already what 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.319
 you take out and already but the resentment is like 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.139
 a poison as well as the scorpion sting 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:15.270
 if it does not kill the picket but you 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.770
 kills in a bite but the poison that 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.749
 you are left after then if you are 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.539
 ruminating what they did 20 years ago 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:23.129
 you have the one who gets sick you the other 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.639
 and he forgot that he tells you he's 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:28.409
 then we use a next willow and very 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.389
 it does not help us get that resentment 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.610
 that we have because it is very easy that 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.860
 we go to courses and quimsa and forgive him yes 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.080
 yes you have to forgive if you visit then 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.819
 what did they do and feel like that again? 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.510
 not when he is beautiful wriggles 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.700
 giving nothing 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.440
 then this willow been to forgive 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.510
 to others but sometimes we do not 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.400
 we forgive ourselves we are the 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.320
 harder to forgive us all there is 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.790
 a flower called pain that serves us 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.810
 to criticize where we feel 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.600
 guilty of something 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.700
 and so when there is I tell you depression 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.560
 we also see what kind of depression 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.630
 let's say I talk with the person you choose 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.480
 well you feel depressed because 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.460
 Well, it did not suddenly stop all of a sudden 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.070
 it comes to me I do not identify because then 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.900
 we use a flexion has shown mustard 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.700
 but if you tell me not put first 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.139
 because they ran me from work or because 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.780
 my partner left me 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.550
 we are a flux image have demand 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.460
 not why because there is a reason for the 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.169
 depression then it is very specific and 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.290
 believe me, look at the flowers of bach han 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.060
 saved lives have saved marriage already 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.460
 they have made many people much happier 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.530
 oieregi you get to take it all 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.720
 all your life or are changing high 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.340
 emotions not necessarily no no is not 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.200
 by season, many of those 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.240
 you need them but there is a formula that 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.490
 it's called kirchner roles and that contains 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.620
 five flowers and that is for stress 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.300
 then the truth I tell you is therefore I 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.460
 I think we all need each other in return 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.320
 you can load it you 're calm 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.389
 right now in the interview and you 're not there 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.790
 Angers with the one who crosses you in the 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:56.410
 car and then you are if it would help us 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.900
 much for stress than all the others 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.060
 they are like I will tell you passenger are not 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.530
 emotions that already come out and you no longer have 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.509
 that returning to treat her better returns to 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.759
