driving game idiot for arcade or

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.840 
driving game idiot for arcade or
simulation<00:00:40.970> so<00:00:41.650> Ubisoft<00:00:42.650> decided<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.460> invest

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
simulation so Ubisoft decided to invest

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.280 
simulation so Ubisoft decided to invest
in<00:00:44.090> ivory<00:00:44.900> tower<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.470> in<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.100> crew<00:00:46.400> because

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
in ivory tower and in the crew because

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.619 
in ivory tower and in the crew because
it<00:00:48.290> was<00:00:48.500> such<00:00:48.739> an<00:00:48.890> inspiring<00:00:49.430> vision<00:00:49.910> of<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
it was such an inspiring vision of a

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.530 
it was such an inspiring vision of a
shared<00:00:50.989> world<00:00:51.379> when<00:00:52.100> driving<00:00:52.340> was<00:00:52.970> king<00:00:53.239> and

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
shared world when driving was king and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.900 
shared world when driving was king and
that<00:00:54.199> was<00:00:54.350> really<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.800> motor<00:00:55.250> behind<00:00:55.760> the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
that was really the motor behind the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.729 
that was really the motor behind the
decision<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.540> create<00:00:56.690> this<00:00:56.989> diamond<00:00:57.379> game<00:00:57.530> and

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
decision to create this diamond game and

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.450 
decision to create this diamond game and
is<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:59.260> handling<00:01:00.260> more<00:01:00.500> arcade<00:01:01.430> or

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
is the handling more arcade or

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.240 
is the handling more arcade or
simulation<00:01:02.210> is<00:01:02.660> definitely<00:01:03.500> more<00:01:03.739> arcade

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
simulation is definitely more arcade

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.820 
simulation is definitely more arcade
because<00:01:04.670> we're<00:01:05.059> an<00:01:05.239> action<00:01:05.600> driving<00:01:05.990> game<00:01:06.170> but

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
because we're an action driving game but

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.460 
because we're an action driving game but
if<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:07.369> turn<00:01:07.550> off<00:01:07.789> all<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.119> driving<00:01:08.899> assists

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
if you turn off all the driving assists

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.290 
if you turn off all the driving assists
then<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.070> have<00:01:10.220> a<00:01:10.250> much<00:01:10.460> more<00:01:10.610> technical

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
then you have a much more technical

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.290 
then you have a much more technical
driving<00:01:11.780> experience<00:01:12.380> expression<00:01:13.340> from<00:01:13.850> cheek

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
very big endeavor to but it's less about

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.010 
very big endeavor to but it's less about
the<00:01:27.020> size<00:01:27.289> more<00:01:27.860> about<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.310> variety<00:01:29.020> because

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
the size more about the variety because

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.779 
the size more about the variety because
we've<00:01:30.200> got<00:01:30.410> things<00:01:31.009> that<00:01:31.280> have<00:01:31.369> happened<00:01:31.700> in

we've got things that have happened in

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.200 
we've got things that have happened in
cities<00:01:32.270> in<00:01:32.869> marshes<00:01:33.710> in<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.700> countryside

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
cities in marshes in the countryside

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.999 
cities in marshes in the countryside
different<00:01:35.990> things<00:01:36.020> like<00:01:36.259> that<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.800> that's

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
different things like that and that's

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.039 
different things like that and that's
what<00:01:37.220> really<00:01:37.490> stands<00:01:37.820> out<00:01:38.060> but<00:01:38.660> if<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.869> want

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
in the group it's the structure of the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.690 
in the group it's the structure of the
game<00:04:12.320> it's<00:04:12.590> something<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.190> will<00:04:13.340> take<00:04:13.550> you

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
game it's something that will take you

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.210

map so it's something that I think is

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.860 
map so it's something that I think is
necessary<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.890> bring<00:04:19.160> some<00:04:19.519> sort<00:04:19.760> of<00:04:19.880> glue<00:04:20.540> to

necessary to bring some sort of glue to

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.170 
necessary to bring some sort of glue to
the<00:04:20.900> experience<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.680> how<00:04:22.640> is<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:22.880> crew
