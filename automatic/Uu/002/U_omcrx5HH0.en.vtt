to pick up some chances as well with the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.370 
to pick up some chances as well with the
front<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.420> art<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.689> hit<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> post<00:01:22.080> from<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
front of art we hit the post from a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.190 
front of art we hit the post from a
free-kick<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:24.000> i<00:01:24.030> win<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> 64th<00:01:25.140> minute

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
free-kick and then i win the 64th minute

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.410 
free-kick and then i win the 64th minute
and<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:25.950> ahead<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.700> Falcao<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and we get ahead of here with Falcao and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.700 
and we get ahead of here with Falcao and
I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.930> his<00:01:28.020> goalkeeper<00:01:28.439> should<00:01:28.590> have

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
I think that his goalkeeper should have

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.620 
I think that his goalkeeper should have

to a disk or the equalizer and it is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.050 
to a disk or the equalizer and it is
pretty<00:03:13.710> much<00:03:13.890> how<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.100> game<00:03:14.400> ended<00:03:14.670> as<00:03:14.850> well

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
pretty much how the game ended as well

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.180 
pretty much how the game ended as well
we<00:03:15.330> yeah<00:03:16.050> we<00:03:16.080> played<00:03:16.440> better<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.920> second

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
we yeah we played better in the second

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.440 
we yeah we played better in the second
half<00:03:17.220> maybe<00:03:17.580> could<00:03:17.910> have<00:03:17.970> won<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.270> game<00:03:18.300> in

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
half maybe could have won the game in

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.990 
half maybe could have won the game in
the<00:03:18.690> end<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:18.990> I<00:03:19.170> think<00:03:20.070> 22<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.580> fair<00:03:20.850> result

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the end but I think 22 is a fair result

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.850 
the end but I think 22 is a fair result
because<00:03:21.420> my<00:03:21.540> opponent<00:03:21.960> had<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:22.350> many<00:03:22.590> chances

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
because my opponent had so many chances

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.460 
because my opponent had so many chances
during<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.340> game<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.700> yeah<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:25.050> moved<00:03:25.290> on

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
during the game and yeah so we moved on

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.380 
during the game and yeah so we moved on
and<00:03:25.620> decided<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.100> pick<00:03:26.280> up<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.520> new<00:03:26.700> set<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.150> kits
