tell me about your grapes well most of
these<00:00:18.539> grapes<00:00:18.840> all<00:00:19.080> but<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.380> are<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> variety

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
these grapes all but one are a variety

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.430 
these grapes all but one are a variety
called<00:00:20.730> rashon<00:00:21.300> which<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.900> basically<00:00:22.290> a

France<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.370> happens<00:00:26.370> to<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.850> this<00:00:27.060> climate

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
France it happens to like this climate

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.240 
France it happens to like this climate
it<00:00:28.140> matches<00:00:28.530> pretty<00:00:28.650> well<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.070> negative

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it matches pretty well it's negative

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.540 
it matches pretty well it's negative
climate<00:00:29.850> there<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.500> pretty<00:00:32.189> expensive

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
climate there are a pretty expensive

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.549 
climate there are a pretty expensive
grape<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> thought<00:00:33.420> maybe<00:00:33.750> Oklahoma<00:00:34.290> might

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
grape so I thought maybe Oklahoma might

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.619 
grape so I thought maybe Oklahoma might
get<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> bandwagon<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.300> makes<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
get in on the bandwagon it makes the

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.739 
get in on the bandwagon it makes the
money<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:38.280> I've<00:00:38.370> been<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.640> doing<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:38.910> working

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
money so I've been to doing an working

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.500 
money so I've been to doing an working
with<00:00:39.870> him<00:00:39.989> since<00:00:40.230> oh<00:00:40.530> six<00:00:40.829> okay<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:42.179> an

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
with him since oh six okay and as an

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
with him since oh six okay and as an
experiment<00:00:43.019> and<00:00:43.379> I'm<00:00:43.620> also<00:00:43.859> using<00:00:44.039> them<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
experiment and I'm also using them to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.720 
experiment and I'm also using them to
develop<00:00:45.089> a<00:00:45.409> non-toxic<00:00:46.409> fungicide<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:47.699> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
develop a non-toxic fungicide because I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.149 
develop a non-toxic fungicide because I
don't<00:00:48.030> I'm<00:00:49.019> an<00:00:49.170> organic<00:00:49.620> gardener<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
don't I'm an organic gardener and I

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.979 
don't I'm an organic gardener and I
don't<00:00:50.339> like<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.609> idea<00:00:50.699> of<00:00:50.850> spring<00:00:51.210> anything

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
don't like the idea of spring anything

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.020 
don't like the idea of spring anything
I'm<00:00:52.109> gonna<00:00:52.289> eat<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:52.859> drink<00:00:53.280> after<00:00:53.579> with

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
I'm gonna eat or drink after with

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.319 
I'm gonna eat or drink after with
systemic<00:00:54.870> boxes<00:00:55.679> I've<00:00:56.670> been<00:00:56.760> working<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.089> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
systemic boxes I've been working on that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.660 
systemic boxes I've been working on that
it's<00:00:57.539> working<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:57.839> pretty<00:00:57.989> well<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.670> they

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
it's working out pretty well and they

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.719 
it's working out pretty well and they
seem<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.179> like<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.449> here<00:01:00.629> they're<00:01:01.229> a<00:01:01.829> picky

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
seem to like it here they're a picky

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.240 
seem to like it here they're a picky
finicky<00:01:03.179> grape<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.040> be

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
finicky grape they they have to be

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.850 
finicky grape they they have to be
harvested<00:01:05.519> by<00:01:05.820> hand<00:01:05.909> okay<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> bunch

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
harvested by hand okay they are a bunch

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.310 
harvested by hand okay they are a bunch
of<00:01:07.950> grape<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.820> means<00:01:09.090> they're<00:01:09.390> really

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
of grape which means they're really

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
of grape which means they're really
tightly<00:01:10.979> packed<00:01:11.340> into<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> bunch<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> so

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
tightly packed into the bunch and so

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.609 
tightly packed into the bunch and so
they're<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:12.570> susceptible<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.229> fungus

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
they're very susceptible to fungus

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.800 
they're very susceptible to fungus
they're<00:01:13.979> good<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> experiment<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
they're good one to experiment with and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.859 
they're good one to experiment with and
some<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.180> techniques<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.329> have<00:01:18.479> worked<00:01:18.689> out

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
some of the techniques I have worked out

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.770 
some of the techniques I have worked out
or<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.500> specific<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:20.219> like<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:21.600> they

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
or just specific to them like when they

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
or just specific to them like when they
go<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> flower<00:01:22.799> stage<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.789> grape

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
go from the flower stage to the grape

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.310 
go from the flower stage to the grape
stage<00:01:24.329> and<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:24.960> those<00:01:25.079> little

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
stage and they have all those little

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.630 
stage and they have all those little
fuzzy<00:01:25.590> sepals<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.219> need<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> come<00:01:26.579> off

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
fuzzy sepals that need to come off

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.459 
fuzzy sepals that need to come off
they're<00:01:27.149> so<00:01:27.329> tight<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> hard

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
they're so tight that they have a hard

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.160 
they're so tight that they have a hard
time<00:01:28.619> doing<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> shake<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> fend

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
time doing that so I shake them and fend

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.980 
time doing that so I shake them and fend
them<00:01:31.289> and<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.369> has<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:32.939> helped<00:01:33.360> oh<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.810> we

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
them and it has really helped oh so we

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.590 
them and it has really helped oh so we
work<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.320> different<00:01:34.799> techniques<00:01:35.390> for<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
work out different techniques for the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.209 
work out different techniques for the
different<00:01:36.869> grapes<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.320> other<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.950> only

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
different grapes the other the only

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.639 
different grapes the other the only
great<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.969> a<00:01:39.240> ruse<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:40.140> actually

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
great that is not a ruse on is actually

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.130 
great that is not a ruse on is actually
a<00:01:40.680> hybrid<00:01:40.920> group<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:41.490> was<00:01:41.729> designed<00:01:42.119> by<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
a hybrid group which was designed by the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.920 
a hybrid group which was designed by the
University<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.740> Florida<00:01:44.369> years<00:01:44.850> ago<00:01:45.149> for

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
University of Florida years ago for

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.740 
University of Florida years ago for
growth<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.530> Hawks<00:01:46.859> hot<00:01:47.219> humid<00:01:48.149> climates<00:01:48.630> like

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
growth in Hawks hot humid climates like

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.539 
growth in Hawks hot humid climates like
Texas<00:01:49.140> Florida<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.710> works<00:01:49.920> real<00:01:50.159> well<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.520> here

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
Texas Florida it works real well up here

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.480 
Texas Florida it works real well up here
because<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.990> hybrid<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:53.189> make<00:01:53.340> your

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
because it's a hybrid you can make your

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.099 
because it's a hybrid you can make your
own<00:01:53.520> vineyard<00:01:53.939> once<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.689> grape<00:01:54.899> vine

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
because the ponds in balance

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
because the ponds in balance
it's<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:21.130> we<00:05:22.130> don't<00:05:22.310> play<00:05:22.490> anything<00:05:22.850> in<00:05:23.030> pots

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
it's a we don't play anything in pots

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.300 
it's a we don't play anything in pots
everything<00:05:23.960> is<00:05:24.080> planted<00:05:24.500> directly<00:05:24.740> into<00:05:25.160> the

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
everything is planted directly into the

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.430 
everything is planted directly into the
gravel<00:05:25.520> which<00:05:26.240> means<00:05:26.510> every<00:05:26.840> fall<00:05:27.110> I've<00:05:27.260> got

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
gravel which means every fall I've got

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.200 
gravel which means every fall I've got
to<00:05:27.530> go<00:05:27.650> pull<00:05:27.920> a<00:05:27.950> bunch<00:05:28.160> of<00:05:28.280> stuff<00:05:28.430> out<00:05:28.790> of<00:05:29.060> the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
to go pull a bunch of stuff out of the

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.600 
to go pull a bunch of stuff out of the
plant<00:05:29.450> because<00:05:29.840> all<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.170> roots<00:05:30.430> will<00:05:31.430> grow

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
plant because all the roots will grow

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.020 
plant because all the roots will grow
across<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.510> mat<00:05:33.350> that's<00:05:33.830> down<00:05:34.040> there<00:05:34.250> and

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
across the mat that's down there and

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.570 
across the mat that's down there and
it'll<00:05:35.360> try<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:35.960> take<00:05:36.170> over<00:05:36.350> the<00:05:36.530> plant<00:05:36.770> but

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
it'll try to take over the plant but

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.150 
it'll try to take over the plant but
plants<00:05:38.240> use<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.810> nutrients<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.620> are<00:05:39.770> in<00:05:39.980> the

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
plants use the nutrients that are in the

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.300 
plants use the nutrients that are in the
gravel<00:05:40.820> right<00:05:41.330> so<00:05:41.690> they<00:05:41.870> don't<00:05:42.080> become<00:05:42.620> excess

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
gravel right so they don't become excess

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.030 
gravel right so they don't become excess
phosphates<00:05:43.850> and<00:05:44.060> excess<00:05:44.480> nitrites<00:05:44.990> in<00:05:45.230> we

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
phosphates and excess nitrites in we

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.920 
phosphates and excess nitrites in we
have<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.190> skimmer<00:05:46.670> filter<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:47.270> biological

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
have a skimmer filter and a biological

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.380 
have a skimmer filter and a biological
filter<00:05:48.290> we<00:05:49.130> keep<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.730> beneficial<00:05:50.240> bacteria

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
filter we keep the beneficial bacteria

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.680 
filter we keep the beneficial bacteria
levels<00:05:50.960> up<00:05:51.520> so<00:05:52.520> that<00:05:52.730> they<00:05:52.880> fight<00:05:53.210> against<00:05:53.510> the

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
levels up so that they fight against the

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:54.940 
levels up so that they fight against the
algae<00:05:54.020> and<00:05:54.080> that's<00:05:54.290> why<00:05:54.410> you<00:05:54.470> don't<00:05:54.620> see<00:05:54.800> any

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
algae and that's why you don't see any

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.490 
algae and that's why you don't see any
yeah<00:05:55.310> because<00:05:55.820> they're<00:05:56.120> up<00:05:56.270> and<00:05:56.540> the<00:05:57.230> skimmer

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
yeah because they're up and the skimmer

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.200 
yeah because they're up and the skimmer
filters<00:05:57.860> get<00:05:58.010> cleaned<00:05:58.250> every<00:05:58.550> day<00:05:58.700> so<00:05:58.760> the

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
filters get cleaned every day so the

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.290 
filters get cleaned every day so the
nitrate<00:05:59.990> levels<00:06:00.260> stay<00:06:00.410> down<00:06:00.640> so<00:06:01.640> what<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.120> see

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
nitrate levels stay down so what you see

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.870 
nitrate levels stay down so what you see
is<00:06:02.510> a<00:06:02.960> pond<00:06:03.230> that<00:06:03.560> supports<00:06:04.040> fish<00:06:04.510> supports

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
is a pond that supports fish supports

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.240 
is a pond that supports fish supports
frogs<00:06:07.880> we<00:06:08.780> do<00:06:08.990> have<00:06:09.170> a<00:06:09.200> snake<00:06:09.530> on<00:06:09.680> the<00:06:09.800> property

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
frogs we do have a snake on the property

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.310 
frogs we do have a snake on the property
that<00:06:10.300> runs<00:06:11.300> around<00:06:11.420> and<00:06:11.660> chases<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.080> frogs

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
that runs around and chases the frogs

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.280 
that runs around and chases the frogs
and<00:06:12.920> it<00:06:13.160> says<00:06:13.370> we<00:06:14.090> have<00:06:14.180> a<00:06:14.210> bat<00:06:14.660> house<00:06:14.870> up<00:06:15.080> there

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
and it says we have a bat house up there

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.670 
and it says we have a bat house up there
that<00:06:15.530> change<00:06:16.220> somebody<00:06:16.460> gets<00:06:16.610> occupied<00:06:17.680> it's

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
that change somebody gets occupied it's

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.980 
that change somebody gets occupied it's
just<00:06:19.010> a<00:06:19.130> whole<00:06:19.340> ecosystem<00:06:19.580> beautiful<00:06:20.480> it's

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
the trees since that's wide open sky and

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.750 
the trees since that's wide open sky and
water<00:06:36.140> in<00:06:36.320> a<00:06:36.410> stream<00:06:36.620> like<00:06:37.010> this<00:06:37.040> isn't<00:06:37.640> only

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
water in a stream like this isn't only

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.240 
water in a stream like this isn't only
about<00:06:37.910> survive<00:06:38.690> yeah<00:06:38.990> so<00:06:39.650> the<00:06:39.830> water<00:06:40.040> the

about survive yeah so the water the

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.960 
about survive yeah so the water the
sun's<00:06:40.610> rays<00:06:40.820> they'll<00:06:41.000> go<00:06:41.090> through<00:06:41.120> the<00:06:41.360> water

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
sun's rays they'll go through the water

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.810 
sun's rays they'll go through the water
and<00:06:42.510> create<00:06:42.810> algae<00:06:43.220> so<00:06:44.220> now<00:06:44.400> I<00:06:44.430> have<00:06:44.730> an

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
and create algae so now I have an

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.840 
and create algae so now I have an
umbrella<00:06:45.050> and<00:06:46.050> it's<00:06:46.200> natural<00:06:46.530> and<00:06:46.650> pretty

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
umbrella and it's natural and pretty

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.800 
umbrella and it's natural and pretty
absolutely<00:06:47.850> beautiful<00:06:48.240> and<00:06:48.300> it's<00:06:48.390> flowering
