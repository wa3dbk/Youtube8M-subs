00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
for the RPM to climb back up it is just

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.729 
for the RPM to climb back up it is just
annoying<00:02:31.880> ok<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:32.940> you're<00:02:33.239> probably<00:02:33.359> thinking

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
annoying ok so you're probably thinking

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.830 
annoying ok so you're probably thinking
well<00:02:34.739> if<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.400> run<00:02:35.579> a<00:02:35.639> 2<00:02:35.880> inch<00:02:36.060> catback<00:02:36.359> of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
well if you run a 2 inch catback of

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.110 
well if you run a 2 inch catback of
course<00:02:37.139> you<00:02:37.350> need<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:38.010> ECU<00:02:38.400> first<00:02:38.819> so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
course you need it to the ECU first so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.620 
course you need it to the ECU first so
we<00:02:39.239> can<00:02:39.389> get<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.989> low<00:02:40.109> rpm<00:02:40.620> back<00:02:41.060> yes<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.480> is

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
we can get the low rpm back yes that is

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.080 
we can get the low rpm back yes that is
true<00:02:42.989> however<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.069> cost<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.549> achieve<00:02:44.880> the

true however the cost to achieve the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.479 
true however the cost to achieve the
components<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.799> something<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.190> most

looks<00:05:01.510> very<00:05:01.780> similar<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.680> stock<00:05:02.979> do<00:05:03.220> tip

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
looks very similar to the stock do tip

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.060 
looks very similar to the stock do tip
except<00:05:04.090> when<00:05:04.389> I<00:05:04.599> had<00:05:04.810> to<00:05:04.960> measure<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.530> stromal

except when I had to measure the stromal

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.240 
except when I had to measure the stromal
tip<00:05:06.389> it's<00:05:07.389> one<00:05:07.930> inch<00:05:08.139> bigger<00:05:08.470> compared<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.159> the

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
tip it's one inch bigger compared to the

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.660 
tip it's one inch bigger compared to the
stock<00:05:09.580> one

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
stock one

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.670
