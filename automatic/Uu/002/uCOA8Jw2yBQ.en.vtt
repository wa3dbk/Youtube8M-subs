how<00:00:00.329> is<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.810> three<00:00:01.050> week<00:00:01.230> diet<00:00:01.260> so<00:00:02.040> different

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
how is the three week diet so different

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.490 
how is the three week diet so different
than<00:00:02.760> all<00:00:03.060> those<00:00:03.330> other<00:00:03.570> diet<00:00:03.929> plans<00:00:04.290> out

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
than all those other diet plans out

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.889 
than all those other diet plans out
there<00:00:04.710> well<00:00:05.520> first<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:05.940> all<00:00:06.060> most<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.690> diet

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
there well first of all most of the diet

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.629 
there well first of all most of the diet
plans<00:00:07.259> out<00:00:07.500> there<00:00:07.740> approach<00:00:08.099> weight<00:00:08.400> loss

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
plans out there approach weight loss

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.509 
plans out there approach weight loss
with<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:08.970> slow<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.660> sensible<00:00:10.200> approach<00:00:10.519> yes

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
with a slow and sensible approach yes

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.280 
with a slow and sensible approach yes
it's<00:00:11.820> true<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.360> if<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.660> eat<00:00:12.690> certain<00:00:13.110> foods

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
it's true that if you eat certain foods

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.530 
it's true that if you eat certain foods
and<00:00:13.830> work<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.190> really<00:00:14.460> hard<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:15.059> an<00:00:15.150> hour<00:00:15.269> or

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
and work out really hard for an hour or

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.200 
and work out really hard for an hour or
so<00:00:15.570> every<00:00:16.049> day<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.440> will<00:00:16.920> lose<00:00:17.100> weight<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
so every day you will lose weight the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.210 
so every day you will lose weight the
problem<00:00:18.660> however<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.680> weight<00:00:19.920> comes

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
problem however is that the weight comes

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.849 
problem however is that the weight comes
off<00:00:20.520> way<00:00:20.880> too<00:00:20.910> slowly<00:00:21.630> because<00:00:22.350> these<00:00:22.500> types

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
off way too slowly because these types

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.040 
off way too slowly because these types
of<00:00:23.039> diet<00:00:23.279> plans<00:00:23.609> don't<00:00:23.880> attack<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.570> stubborn

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
of diet plans don't attack the stubborn

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.880 
of diet plans don't attack the stubborn

to popular belief most of us actually do
burn<00:00:31.890> fat<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> couple<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.969> hours<00:00:33.090> each<00:00:33.450> day

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
burn fat for a couple of hours each day

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.590 
burn fat for a couple of hours each day
when<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.649> eat<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> meal<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.730> typically<00:00:36.210> get<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
when we eat a meal we typically get a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.049 
when we eat a meal we typically get a
bit<00:00:36.840> fatter<00:00:37.250> once<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.460> meal<00:00:38.700> has<00:00:38.910> been

bit fatter once that meal has been

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.760 
bit fatter once that meal has been

digested and those calories have

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.650

provided<00:00:41.160> us<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.520> bit<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> energy<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> few

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
provided us a bit of energy for a few

provided us a bit of energy for a few
hours<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.680> start<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.160> burn<00:00:44.340> off<00:00:44.550> fat<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
hours we then start to burn off fat and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.590 
hours we then start to burn off fat and
as<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> result<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.649> get<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.250> thinner<00:00:47.600> when

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
as a result we get a little thinner when

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.170 
as a result we get a little thinner when
we<00:00:48.809> eat<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.530> fat<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:50.010> consume<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.610> broken<00:00:51.000> down

we eat the fat we consume is broken down

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.049 
we eat the fat we consume is broken down

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
problems begin you see once those fatty

triglyceride in relative terms
triglycerides<00:01:25.979> are<00:01:26.189> very<00:01:26.670> big<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.360> because

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
triglycerides are very big and because

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.840 
triglycerides are very big and because

incredibly difficult to get rid of but

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.850 
incredibly difficult to get rid of but
here's<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.670> those<00:01:48.600> triglycerides<00:01:49.439> can

here's the thing those triglycerides can
be<00:01:50.100> targeted<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.790> they<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:52.079> broken<00:01:52.409> back

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
be targeted and they can be broken back

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.100 
be targeted and they can be broken back
down<00:01:53.130> into<00:01:53.490> those<00:01:53.640> fatty<00:01:53.939> acids<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.840> be

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
down into those fatty acids that can be

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 
down into those fatty acids that can be
burned<00:01:55.320> by<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.649> body<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.219> energy<00:01:56.600> when<00:01:57.600> we

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
burned by the body for energy when we

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
burned by the body for energy when we
break<00:01:58.020> down<00:01:58.079> those<00:01:58.469> triglycerides<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.700> kind

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
break down those triglycerides it's kind

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.969 
break down those triglycerides it's kind
of<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.329> dumping<00:02:00.840> rocket<00:02:01.350> fuel<00:02:01.590> into<00:02:01.950> your

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
of like dumping rocket fuel into your

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.490 
of like dumping rocket fuel into your
vehicle's<00:02:02.579> gas<00:02:02.790> tank<00:02:03.149> those<00:02:03.869> broken<00:02:04.320> down

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
vehicle's gas tank those broken down

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
vehicle's gas tank those broken down
triglycerides<00:02:05.369> flood<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.240> body<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
triglycerides flood the body with a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.510 
triglycerides flood the body with a
great<00:02:07.170> source<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.649> energy<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.340> actually

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
great source of energy that it actually

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.300 
great source of energy that it actually
loves<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.239> burn<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.259> only<00:02:10.560> when<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> body<00:02:11.039> has

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
loves to burn but only when the body has

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.360 
loves to burn but only when the body has
been<00:02:11.459> primed<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.180> burn<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.720> fat

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
been primed to burn that fat

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.309 
been primed to burn that fat
as<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:13.940> when<00:02:14.239> you're<00:02:14.420> following<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:15.049> three

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
as it is when you're following the three

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.979 
as it is when you're following the three
week<00:02:15.500> diet<00:02:15.610> now<00:02:16.610> again<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.299> problem<00:02:17.840> with

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
week diet now again the problem with

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.050 
week diet now again the problem with
most<00:02:18.230> diets<00:02:18.769> out<00:02:18.920> there<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.549> they<00:02:19.730> don't

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
most diets out there is that they don't

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.589 
most diets out there is that they don't
address<00:02:20.450> or<00:02:20.780> target<00:02:21.379> that<00:02:21.560> stored<00:02:21.950> body<00:02:22.220> fat

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
address or target that stored body fat

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.210 
address or target that stored body fat
instead<00:02:23.599> they<00:02:24.019> are<00:02:24.049> designed<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.769> burn<00:02:25.010> up

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
instead they are designed to burn up

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.220 
instead they are designed to burn up
only<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.790> fatty<00:02:26.030> acids<00:02:26.540> from<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:26.810> foods<00:02:27.049> we

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
only the fatty acids from the foods we

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.410 
only the fatty acids from the foods we
eat<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.739> preventing<00:02:28.610> them<00:02:28.879> from<00:02:28.909> turning

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
eat and preventing them from turning

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.380 
eat and preventing them from turning
into<00:02:29.690> triglycerides<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:30.950> first<00:02:31.190> place<00:02:31.400> so

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
into triglycerides in the first place so

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.360 
into triglycerides in the first place so
without<00:02:32.599> adding<00:02:33.200> additional<00:02:33.319> fat<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
without adding additional fat to the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.160 
without adding additional fat to the
body<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.940> by<00:02:35.209> forcing<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.989> participate

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
body and by forcing you to participate

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.220 
body and by forcing you to participate
in<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.769> very<00:02:36.980> strenuous<00:02:37.670> exercise<00:02:38.150> program<00:02:38.629> you

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
in a very strenuous exercise program you

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.680 
in a very strenuous exercise program you
can<00:02:39.470> effectively<00:02:39.980> still<00:02:40.489> lose<00:02:40.730> weight<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
can effectively still lose weight the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.569 
can effectively still lose weight the
problem<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.349> that<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.769> weight<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.250> comes

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
problem is that the weight just comes

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.750 
problem is that the weight just comes
off<00:02:43.790> very<00:02:44.299> very<00:02:44.510> slowly<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.579> what

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
off very very slowly and this is what

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.809 
off very very slowly and this is what
makes<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.239> three<00:02:47.510> week<00:02:47.690> diet<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.500> unique<00:02:48.980> the

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
makes the three week diet so unique the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.940 
makes the three week diet so unique the
three<00:02:50.090> week<00:02:50.269> diet<00:02:50.299> not<00:02:50.870> only<00:02:51.140> stops<00:02:51.470> your<00:02:51.620> body

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
three week diet not only stops your body

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.520 
three week diet not only stops your body
from<00:02:52.250> forming<00:02:52.760> new<00:02:52.970> triglycerides<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.319> also

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
from forming new triglycerides it also

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.830 
from forming new triglycerides it also
directly<00:02:55.250> targets<00:02:55.849> the<00:02:56.000> stubborn<00:02:56.450> body<00:02:56.660> fat

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
directly targets the stubborn body fat

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.649 
directly targets the stubborn body fat
that<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.319> already<00:02:57.650> have<00:02:58.159> while<00:02:59.000> forcing<00:02:59.359> your
