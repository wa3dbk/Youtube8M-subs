00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.639
 imagine of bush and the pst 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.230
 Noel is a layer for see 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.080
 home improvement with particularly high 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.730
 claims and there was me now times 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.820
 look at 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.480
 the pst 9 ps equipped with one 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:26.189
 Rated power of 6 120 watts and has one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 release power of 340 watts at that time 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.830
 already the good piece as each device of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.010
 bosch packed in a movie gong the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.809
 Jigsaw like me is 22 kilograms 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.360
 equipped with a low vibration 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.800
 Access the minimized decided the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.050
 vibration and offers a lot 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.850
 comfortable blessing with the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.840
 on-board electronics and the host 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.980
 certain they saw the speed 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.670
 In addition, we have a horn here 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.050
 preselection where you already in advance the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.699
 jigsaw to be machined 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.460
 can adjust material 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:08.040
 adjustable from level 1 to level six 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.930
 take and can so already the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.020
 set high speed on the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.290
 Card material The high number is in the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.430
 idle from 500 to 3000 over per 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.580
 minute and by that she glides through 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.600
 material as by butter 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:31.350
 Furthermore , we have a one-hand sds 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.220
 Ejection for effortless and safe 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.229
 Saw blade change in seconds 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.009
 without tools and now come on 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.899
 Saw blade is included in the delivery 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.610
 a saw blade that is here 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.509
 back to my this toolbox where 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.180
 another six saw blades fit in that way 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.579
 that you always have the right saw blades 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.939
 even if you do not have the bosch 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.570
 transported in the suitcase 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.340
 point number 1 in the scope of delivery 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.469
 Saw blade included is a huge one 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.319
 sail stays and it is advisable the same 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.610
 to buy more saw blades with 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.760
 I also have a set of ten right now 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.349
 piece taken 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:21.189
 and we want the saw blade now 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:24.870
 introduce to lock just like that 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.870
 remains until the weft insert 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.110
 he has heard this fail as me 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:37.569
 Tossed the saw blade is now fixed 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.450
 and to eject only this lever 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.250
 called up and already or saw blade 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.230
 So even with hot saw blades 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.209
 if you do not burn your fingers when 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.129
 you change the saw blade 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.940
 want 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:54.000
 so you can pretty fast the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.139
 change saw blades 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.359
 furthermore, the saw also has a 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:04.590
 Led light is always a good one 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:07.989
 to give work light to the material 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.120
 currency cut succeed with this 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.030
 sled also very nice adjustable 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.470
 up to 45 degrees with a ship's propeller 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.269
 Provide the only one where there is no tools 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.030
 goes according to my knowledge is still the 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:26.709
 number 1000 so the pst 1000 pl him 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.560
 but a little better is for 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:34.449
 My purposes are enough for the 900 already 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.829
 completely off it can also be switched on 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.690
 bubble function we have here 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.349
 the other side is like that 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.840
 turned cheapest here in front 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.730
 the sawdust away when you get back here 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.250
 want to use the suction device 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.579
 He recommends the loader 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.290
 off 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:56.949
 of course , the saw would also have an end 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.750
 Stroke in four stages at just for 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.819
 thicker material faster 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.389
 Of course, getting through also brings 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:08.370
 a clean cut the other 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.370
 look again his suitcase is 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.959
 of course we have such a game 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.220
 he recommends to stick village if 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.930
 to turn off the bubble device 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.650
 has used the suction device 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.740
 so the entire material is sucked off 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.419
 especially if you still won 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.780
 countertops and so on or one 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.389
 short cut only apartment in general and 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.289
 then you do not say the whole apartment 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:41.680
 I always want to forgo it 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.440
 a close look at the saw blades 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.370
 have while sawing 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.190
 of course we have here before a 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.310
 central point 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:56.110
 that tells me where the center is the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:59.620
 Another is at the pst one more 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.270
 so-called controller is this 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.199
 device that can be stuck here on 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:13.090
 so you can also outperformed 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:15.759
 pursue is also do times 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:20.199
 now slightly airier than when 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:22.240
 unmarried from set it is already fixed 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:27.669
 and we have another one 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:31.949
 display for a zero degree cut and 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:36.060
 for each 45 degrees right or left 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:40.289
 if we saw the saw blade 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.940
 Tilt down here to 45 degrees 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.060
 must be because the line to the right or left 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.060
 his 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.140
 Of course you can also if we have this 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.800
 controller does not have a pr in parallel 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:00.830
 I think it will continue in the 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.500
 accessories trade is so that should now 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.560
 first have been 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.680
 for the dry exercise of course I will 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.600
 also present the saw in action 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.600
 So bye next time
