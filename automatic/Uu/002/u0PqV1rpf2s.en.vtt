00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
I'm going to talk about they can

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.269 
I'm going to talk about they can
fine-tune<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:22.020> they<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.470> find<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.890> week<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
fine-tune it they can find a week a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.310 
fine-tune it they can find a week a
little<00:00:23.490> bit<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> make<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.850> even<00:00:24.029> better<00:00:24.320> you

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
little bit to make it even better you

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.220 
little bit to make it even better you
know<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.300> fine<00:00:27.300> line<00:00:27.330> between<00:00:27.750> you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
know it's it's a fine line between you

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.870 
know it's it's a fine line between you
know<00:00:28.260> making<00:00:28.560> an<00:00:28.710> open-ice<00:00:29.070> hit<00:00:29.310> or<00:00:29.490> hitting

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
know making an open-ice hit or hitting

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.150 
know making an open-ice hit or hitting
someone<00:00:30.210> by<00:00:30.480> decide<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.650> think<00:00:32.040> they

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
someone by decide so on so I think they

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
someone by decide so on so I think they
just<00:00:32.189> look<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.149> either<00:00:33.270> more<00:00:33.540> experienced

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
just look at either more experienced

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.540 
just look at either more experienced
what<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.559> should<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:35.070> done<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.430> they

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
what do you think should be done so they

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.370 
what do you think should be done so they
just<00:00:35.730> make<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.030> eliminate<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> gray<00:00:37.110> area

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
just make it eliminate the gray area

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.750 
just make it eliminate the gray area
just<00:00:37.530> say<00:00:37.710> any<00:00:37.829> hit<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> head<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
just say any hit to the head is a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.619 
just say any hit to the head is a
penalty<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:40.550> want<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:42.059> when<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> player<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
penalty I want to get when a player is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.779 
penalty I want to get when a player is
skating<00:00:43.280> straightforward<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.430> step<00:00:44.670> up

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
skating straightforward and you step up

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.790 
skating straightforward and you step up
on<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.210> think<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.320> hockey<00:00:46.500> play

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
on it I think it's that's a hockey play

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.010 
on it I think it's that's a hockey play
and<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.370> hard<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.420> don't<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> hit

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and it's hard to you don't want to hit

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.060 
and it's hard to you don't want to hit
him<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.230> head<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.559> everything

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
him in the head because everything

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.369 
him in the head because everything
happens<00:00:50.399> fast<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:50.940> try<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.239> try<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> stop

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
happens fast that you try to try to stop

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.900 
happens fast that you try to try to stop
from<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:53.129> skating<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.579> head<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.879> going

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
from your skating your head it's going

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.549 
from your skating your head it's going
to<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> person<00:00:54.449> you're<00:00:54.809> leaning<00:00:55.260> forward

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
to be the person you're leaning forward

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.080 
to be the person you're leaning forward
skating<00:00:55.949> anyway<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.730> hard<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
skating anyway so I think it's hard to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.720 
skating anyway so I think it's hard to
eliminate<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.440> think<00:00:59.399> they<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.609> be

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
eliminate that but I think they can be

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.189 
eliminate that but I think they can be
in<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.850> stricter<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.359> some<00:01:00.539> part<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> gray

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
in a stricter on some part of the gray

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.860 
in a stricter on some part of the gray
areas<00:01:01.530> free<00:01:01.920> area<00:01:02.280> hit<00:01:02.579> song<00:01:02.820> from<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.300> from

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
areas free area hit song from them from

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
areas free area hit song from them from
the<00:01:03.960> side<00:01:04.170> would<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.100> favor<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.489> just

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the side would you be in favor of just

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
the side would you be in favor of just
making<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> straight<00:01:06.869> penalty<00:01:07.200> any<00:01:07.320> contact

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
making it a straight penalty any contact

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.800 
making it a straight penalty any contact
to

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.620 
to
no<00:01:09.560> I<00:01:09.890> wouldn't<00:01:10.340> be<00:01:10.549> in<00:01:10.700> favor<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:11.509> I

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
no I wouldn't be in favor of that I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.679 
no I wouldn't be in favor of that I
think<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.680> think<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:13.549> can<00:01:13.700> eat<00:01:14.119> that<00:01:14.299> happens

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
think I think you can eat that happens

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.120 
think I think you can eat that happens
you<00:01:14.780> could<00:01:14.960> see<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.170> lot<00:01:15.290> of<00:01:15.320> guys<00:01:15.530> skating<00:01:15.979> with

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
you could see a lot of guys skating with

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.719 
you could see a lot of guys skating with
their<00:01:16.220> heads<00:01:16.340> down<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:17.289> be<00:01:18.289> worried<00:01:18.530> about

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
their heads down and be worried about

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.279 
their heads down and be worried about
Hitler<00:01:19.780> skating<00:01:20.780> with<00:01:20.869> their<00:01:20.960> heads<00:01:21.079> down<00:01:21.170> I

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
Hitler skating with their heads down I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.859 
Hitler skating with their heads down I
think<00:01:21.439> that's<00:01:21.680> something<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.280> don't<00:01:22.430> want

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
think that's something you don't want

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.940 
think that's something you don't want
traditionally<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:24.140> seems<00:01:24.409> like<00:01:24.619> this<00:01:24.799> the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
traditionally it seems like this the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.490 
traditionally it seems like this the
league<00:01:25.159> or<00:01:25.429> employers<00:01:25.970> are<00:01:26.630> partners<00:01:27.049> part<00:01:27.380> of

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
league or employers are partners part of

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.139 
league or employers are partners part of
it<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.950> have<00:01:28.159> been<00:01:28.310> a<00:01:28.340> little<00:01:28.670> bit<00:01:28.850> slow

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
it it have been a little bit slow

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.969 
it it have been a little bit slow
reacting<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.929> these<00:01:30.020> types<00:01:30.259> of<00:01:30.470> safety<00:01:30.830> issues

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
reacting to these types of safety issues

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.069 
reacting to these types of safety issues

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
and you've seen the helmets of them and

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.529 
and you've seen the helmets of them and

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
the visors and now there's why what do

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.899 
the visors and now there's why what do
you<00:01:35.600> think<00:01:35.869> cocky<00:01:36.229> has<00:01:36.619> been<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.100> conservative

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
you think cocky has been so conservative

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.410 
you think cocky has been so conservative
in<00:01:38.060> moving<00:01:38.270> on<00:01:38.479> this<00:01:38.600> sorts<00:01:38.929> of<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:40.850> seems<00:01:41.179> to

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
in moving on this sorts of it seems to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.719 
in moving on this sorts of it seems to
to<00:01:41.899> be<00:01:42.049> that<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:43.100> know<00:01:43.159> we<00:01:43.340> wait<00:01:43.520> until

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
to be that you know we wait until

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.999 
to be that you know we wait until
something<00:01:44.060> bad<00:01:44.509> happens<00:01:44.569> in<00:01:45.080> real<00:01:45.560> serious

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
something bad happens in real serious

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.190 
something bad happens in real serious
happens<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.549> then<00:01:46.700> we<00:01:47.360> kind<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:47.600> reacted<00:01:47.990> that

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
happens and then we kind of reacted that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.870 
happens and then we kind of reacted that
it<00:01:48.350> happens<00:01:48.649> more<00:01:48.709> and<00:01:49.009> more<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:49.399> more<00:01:49.429> often

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
it happens more and more and more often

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.190 
it happens more and more and more often
and<00:01:50.209> I<00:01:50.330> think<00:01:50.569> that's<00:01:50.780> when<00:01:50.929> you<00:01:51.020> see<00:01:51.170> a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
and I think that's when you see a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.309 
and I think that's when you see a
reaction<00:01:51.649> I<00:01:51.890> think<00:01:52.729> it's<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.179> know<00:01:53.539> you're

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
reaction I think it's you know you're

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.719 
reaction I think it's you know you're
looking<00:01:54.409> around<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.890> league<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.640> know

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
looking around the league and you know

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.429 
looking around the league and you know
how<00:01:55.909> we<00:01:56.330> play<00:01:56.569> for<00:01:56.599> so<00:01:56.899> many<00:01:56.990> years<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.380> think

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
how we play for so many years I think

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.679 
how we play for so many years I think
that's<00:01:57.679> why<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.099> the<00:01:59.060> tradition<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.569> the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
that's why it is the tradition to the

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.399 
that's why it is the tradition to the
game<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.020> starts<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:01.250> shake<00:02:01.580> off<00:02:01.729> on<00:02:02.140> your<00:02:03.140> more
