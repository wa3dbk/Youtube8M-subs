00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.070
 Hello, we are pleased to present you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.140
 The next issue of the transfer review we have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 many interesting projects have accumulated 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.189
 released on the android and ayos platforms 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.390
 so we offer do not delay 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.980
 let's get down to start immediately in loud 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.960
 hit 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 injustice gods and manas come out at the beginning 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.030
 this month on the ios platform 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.950
 the release has already taken place on consoles 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.530
 but let's take a closer look at 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.079
 mobile version gameplay essence 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 of course invariably injustice it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.910
 fighting game participates in battles widely 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.039
 famous heroes of the universe disi comics 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.410
 you have three players at your disposal 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.510
 who goes to fight against another 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 triples of rivals with time you 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.650
 open new characters and are free 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.369
 shuffle your dream team like you 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.159
 will like it 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.260
 well, then everything just hit 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.600
 try not to miss the enemy and 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
 sensible change your charges 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 don't forget to accumulate energy and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.130
 deliver special blows they have each 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.259
 hero of course their own 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.880
 generally went very solid fighting and 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.770
 here are just users here and there 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.170
 complain about the aftermath of free 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.869
 project over time enemies defeat everything 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.630
 harder while pumping your characters goes 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.909
 really very slowly by us alone 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.829
 noticed minus not always responsive 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.020
 block because of which a couple are skipped 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.829
 critical hits but despite everything 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.229
 the foregoing 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.790
 injustice gods among us you will 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.790
 should try it yourself 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.979
 but with the next project, not all 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.770
 so definitely 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.500
 last year's game do other right again 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.420
 appeared on the kickstarter where 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.910
 the developers tried to raise money for 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.099
 its creation unfortunately it is the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.750
 attempt failed but despite 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.000
 that was collected a little more than half 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.690
 the stated amount of the project after all 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.640
 appeared in the appstore and after almost a year 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.650
 the main characters here are pretty brothers 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.810
 very similar to those brothers 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.940
 Italian origin whose you are 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.430
 well know but as the name implies 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.980
 and Tiber I completely different 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.739
 and indeed the whole game is an attempt to return to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.140
 past and ponastalize as you see 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.269
 this is a retro style platformer which 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.340
 trying to get us back to gaming sources 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.250
 unfortunately it is not his 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.500
 very good at CJSC management 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.180
 brothers is one of the most important and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.260
 at the same time the most unfortunate 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.269
 components 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.459
 can't get pleasure from 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.269
 passing and dive into all the dumbass 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.459
 well, the atmosphere 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.019
 when the characters on the screen don't listen to you 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.750
 and forces again and again 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.130
 replay some moments with everything 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.950
 this game is not free 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.200
 so we seriously hesitate whether 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.209
 advise and and purchase though if 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.790
 you are super dexterous fingers and that thing 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.790
 important steel nerves then why not 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.090
 and 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.560
 but all of the above has no 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.480
 Relationships to the Sterk Slave First 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.700
 games cost quite funny and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.379
 secondly this amount is not at all a pity 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.719
 give for that kind of fun 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.489
 this game is for any age where in 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.829
 Basically, you donâ€™t need much 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.989
 strain but on the other hand and quite 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.810
 sit back, too, failed to 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.700
 leading role that is completely predictable 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.769
 favored mister crab is his task 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.349
 such climb up the level 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.720
 overcoming all obstacles but not 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.790
 only still have to collect small 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.459
 crab chik and try to bring them up 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.010
 vertices safe and sound if 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.500
 you make a mistake then the poor things get 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.750
 down and have to start the plot again 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.430
 in principle, you can spit on them but 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.169
 then you do not earn what you need 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.660
 number of stars and you can not 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.060
 unlock the next levels it's time for you 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.160
 will meet and bosses they of course 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.800
 symbolic but the reaction here is still 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.900
 need as you can see the gameplay here 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.750
 kind of simple but pretty 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.650
 a funny way of moving like 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.900
 would spiral 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.849
 the level itself is spinning and in the opposite 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.440
 side too and it makes gaming 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.440
 the process is extremely fascinating 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.070
 well, another game from which we 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.590
 We are delighted 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.870
 it is already more gloomy and perhaps not 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.580
 such a universal someone will consider it 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.780
 too depressive because of that 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.450
 original design 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.090
 but don't be in a hurry to chop off the shoulder 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.250
 blend once you definitely can't 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.710
 stop well or do it with 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.660
 extremely reluctant here harmoniously 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.800
 everything 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.810
 addictive and unusual gameplay 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.090
 fits perfectly with the picture and 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.520
 music in the background all this creates 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.110
 completely unique atmosphere honestly 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.840
 saying talk about the mechanics here 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.180
 nothing special you need to carry forward 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.210
 by level black round creature with 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.680
 out of the garbage 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.170
 This obstacles come across completely 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.750
 different but overcome them we will 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.330
 unequally our hand-eyed 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.120
 the hero will decrease increase 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.100
 accelerate multiply burst explode 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.530
 stuck and all that stuff 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.730
 and you need not to yawn and control 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.770
 all these metamorphoses 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.590
 so he got to the end of the level and 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.960
 by the way is not so much but with time 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.210
 the developer promises to add them this 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.360
 perhaps the hit of our today's release 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.010
 for such a game is not a pity and not give money 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.010
 Nice to pass the time for her 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:27.229
 as you probably noticed today our 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.000
 the release came out surprisingly apple but not 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.280
 I get upset with the owner of androids 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.800
 the likelihood that these projects will come out 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.900
 and on your platform is great too just 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.270
 it takes time, but for now we would 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.159
 would like to draw your attention to the fact that 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.199
 Two projects have been ported 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:44.810
 which we have already talked about earlier in 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:47.720
 our releases first this is a puzzle 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.849
 Zira since its release on ios 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.639
 the game has earned many awards and 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.009
 user recognition worldwide we 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:57.530
 guarantee you will be stuck in this for a long time 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.750
 beautiful silent and mysterious world 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.090
 really get ready for the game not 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.789
 free course will be served many Matchmaker 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.099
 tempt and tear her down but we call 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.719
 our viewers to consciousness for such 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.060
 the product really is not a pity to give 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.719
 money is all the more so insignificant 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.469
 amount 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:17.449
 and as for Ravenswood 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:19.849
 shadowlands then not everything is so 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:22.340
 uniquely many call the game with 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:25.219
 Karim for the poor well, in fact and 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.139
 there is no course if you are a fan of rpv 

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:29.090
 and you cannot live without them even somewhere in 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.940
 the road when not to play fully for 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.639
 stationary while then of course this one 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.159
 project for you though at close cost 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.740
 to an average price of 1000 games and not even 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:42.050
 we all know we told you that she 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.870
 now on android 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.000
 week whether or not it's up to you Well 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.789
 Well today we all look

 look forward to seeing you in the next issue to 

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:53.990
 again tell you about the most interesting 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.770
 games released on the android platforms and 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.490
 ios 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.490
 bye Bye
