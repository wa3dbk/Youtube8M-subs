00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.550
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.140
 you never know that one of the 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.969
 key players for the good step that 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.030
 is having the devils team 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.219
 reds of toluca is sinha this man is 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.900
 difficult granting an interview without 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.970
 However, fortunately, he granted 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.980
 for three string microphones 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.610
 sports and we go with the next 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.610
 report 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.200
 the silk days never get old with 36 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.210
 years and 27 tournaments in toluca antonio 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.160
 Naelson Sinha is the architect in 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.200
 midfield of the 'red devils' their 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.879
 vision of game allows you to supply 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.010
 an attack that looks like one of the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.170
 best of the championship and their effort has 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.730
 been a fundamental part in the good tournament 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.340
 that has the team of enrique meza 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.170
 Until now 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.030
 I try to lead by example with work 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.100
 with words 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.829
 because out there I think the leaders 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.070
 do not give for what he says but for what 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.810
 what does 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.350
 I try to talk as little as possible and 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.840
 work as much as you can 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.700
 the Mexican national prefers to avoid 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.040
 the compliments he gets thanks to his 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.690
 performance and prefers to point out the effect 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.970
 who had the return of enrique meza to 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.860
 toluca as well as explaining the factors 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.520
 they have the red team in the first 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.500
 post of the table 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.329
 the teacher has dealt with the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.920
 many additions I've been 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.620
 working with him he knows what he likes 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.980
 those of us here are some 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.470
 we go down with him we have the idea very clear 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.820
 we are trying to improve it and improve 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.350
 carry out what he asks us 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.640
 and has donated what one can contribute 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.600
 then a staff has been formed 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.340
 positive a campus that has accustomed 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.570
 in the championship because many that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.970
 they had already come out champion in 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.310
 other teams then I think that has 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.650
 it was important the conjunction of all 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.210
 of looking for the best for the team not 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.580
 look for personal achievements because that is 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.520
 give with a team do things well what 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.380
 individual will always come out 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.750
 he is one of the most veteran players 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.909
 of the Toluca campus despite its 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.649
 age rules out being a leader within the 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.019
 playing field to him always 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.729
 simply what motivates him is to play 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.580
 to football 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.170
 always done football is a motivation 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.750
 I think you have to look for motivation in 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.459
 nothing to enter a soccer field the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.430
 see your children also happy about 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.620
 all wife because more motivation wants 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.750
 many people you who 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.190
 details that motivate you I think that 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.739
 always made for football you have to 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.900
 be a motivation the veteran player 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.480
 recognizes that enrique meza is one of the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.250
 authors of the current success of the red team 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.220
 and describes that the coach's key 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.670
 Mexican is to keep the essence through 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.670
 of the years 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.320
 the teacher that I know him makes me 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.200
 that follows remains the same as a person 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.530
 obviously 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.420
 in the way they work all that 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.360
 gives the technology of 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.400
 to see things more accurately 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.050
 but if the essence they have or they do not have 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.910
 the same since I met him is a 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.790
 person who likes teamwork 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.400
 which encourages everyday work 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.390
 be a collective that everyone seeks 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.030
 they always had the necessary care 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.940
 what we mentioned a moment ago in 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.270
 his career and that I have it very 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.580
 present since I work
