be a flagpole and you know those of its
tough<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.210> get<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.570> first<00:04:12.840> degree<00:04:13.020> burn

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
tough and you get a first degree burn

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.979 
tough and you get a first degree burn
I<00:04:14.270> didn't<00:04:15.270> do<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.390> I<00:04:15.570> said<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.900> have

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
something over like my leg that was here

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.360 
something over like my leg that was here
about<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.000> material<00:04:18.480> so<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.440> went<00:04:19.830> there<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.250> I

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
about the material so I went there and I

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.490 
about the material so I went there and I
then<00:04:20.790> guarantee<00:04:21.239> put<00:04:21.419> one<00:04:21.600> fix<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.140> we<00:04:22.290> done

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
then guarantee put one fix that we done

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.159 
then guarantee put one fix that we done
and<00:04:22.680> stuff<00:04:23.040> they're<00:04:23.340> probably<00:04:23.990> they<00:04:24.990> are<00:04:25.080> to

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
and stuff they're probably they are to

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.780 
and stuff they're probably they are to
bring<00:04:25.350> hot<00:04:25.560> water<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:26.040> pour<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.460> get<00:04:26.640> me

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
bring hot water and pour it and get me

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.210 
bring hot water and pour it and get me
out<00:04:26.940> of<00:04:26.970> there<00:04:27.260> none<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.380> my<00:04:28.530> first<00:04:28.770> initiation

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
out of there none of my first initiation

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.000 
out of there none of my first initiation
to<00:04:29.550> Canada<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.270> its<00:04:30.930> tether<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.500> got<00:04:31.800> back

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
to Canada and its tether so I got back

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.270
