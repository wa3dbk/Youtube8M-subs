00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.899
 Hi, I'm Natalia Perez and I'm going to give you a 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.309
 tip more beauty for the planet in 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.440
 this time we are going to make some centers 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.300
 table for baby shower is going to be a 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.790
 baby shower as well as very nice very 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.050
 elegant and the father is that the people who 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.060
 go to your baby shower all your 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.530
 guests I'm sure they're going to 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.910
 love the home ornaments put the 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.220
 centerpiece that they will bring the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.199
 your house then that too 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.869
 father because they remember all the bis 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.360
 with something very nice, the first thing that 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.160
 let's do let's occupy rod 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.300
 decorative of the color that you are going to do 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.640
 your baby shower with little wood base 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.130
 deep decorative stone florat el 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.860
 hemp thread 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:50.170
 cutting tongs lighter scissors 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.540
 exact hot silicone and then 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.910
 obviously the good gun first what 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.740
 what we are going to do is put all 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.980
 our wands more or less at the same 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.980
 level 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.089
 obviously, the more you do, the more 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.189
 more super experience and this too 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.950
 is father because if right now he does not 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.869
 you have a job you can do this guy 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.049
 of crafts to earn a little money 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.580
 extra that is going to be very good little money 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.740
 let's measure more or less of what size 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.690
 we're going to want the idea is that they remain 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.790
 to unevenness this is an arrangement 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.980
 very nice minimalist 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.840
 good since we have our brand where 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.530
 let's cut we 're going to cut with the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.530
 cutting bags 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.990
 let's match all our wands 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.970
 since the spirits come together 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.920
 in this way with the table 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.140
 let's put some silicone 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.140
 hot on the tip 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.229
 then we put them back together and go 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.229
 to put 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.829
 and now he reminds you that flora covers 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.219
 loose your glue when you stretch it 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.219
 we stretch it 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.860
 and then we will measure up 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.860
 where does our protector have to arrive? 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.129
 Y 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.990
 the extent that you handle obviously 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.450
 It is according to the taste of everyone I 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.200
 I decided to go there because part 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.300
 will be inside the pebbles and the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.000
 background then good since I put my flower 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.800
 ate and it was already well-tailored to the extent 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.660
 what I wanted 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.660
 Now let's use the thread spout 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.410
 Thank you 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.819
 now let's put a tip 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.610
 hot silicone 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.760
 ah 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.900
 to begin to take hold 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.900
 our local 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.319
 Well what I did was go roll up and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.680
 rolling the hemp thread 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.980
 and gathering as much as possible each of 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.780
 the turns use white and white flower because 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.609
 he and what I am occupying is white 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.969
 so the idea is that it would be nice if 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.750
 to stay a little open do not notice 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.550
 so much 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.140
 the error 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.140
 the same is also very easy 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:41.430
 ready then short always colom and of 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.540
 the slats and the is good to give 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.540
 one who meditates 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.510
 good since we have it like that I'm going to put 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.340
 this now what we are going to do is 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.349
 use the background remember that the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.030
 bottom is made of fiberglass is 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.890
 very important that after crosses 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.540
 exact is very good hands and you the 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.090
 you know very well so you do not stay 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.700
 those micro glass bits and I'll 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.740
 go to pass in the face or in the eyes 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.020
 let's occupy the exact 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.460
 and we 're going to split it in half in this 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.460
 case because it is very high 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.419
 Now let's make some cubes 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.639
 where they fit their materials more or less 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.009
 let's measure it the same remember that this 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.050
 white part I more or less told him 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:30.819
 well more or less a good eye would be 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.819
 there and all leave them in the same size 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.860
 to 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.400
 this if you want you can paint them 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.350
 white since the stones are white 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.430
 so it does not look absolutely nothing 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.690
 you can leave them alone 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.820
 later I will put silicon 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.820
 hot in the center 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.250
 It is very easy 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.670
 ready since we have it so what are we going 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.670
 to put the pebbles 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.310
 I base the base with acrylic paint 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.930
 with a chocolate with sponge 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.720
 I recommend a lot then it is with fine 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.910
 brush because it is easier to paint wood 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.000
 an isr and all this kind of stuff with 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.810
 sponge and this milestone plan remains and 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.220
 better now let's put these well 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.890
 pebbles 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.930
 and we have a nice decoration for 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.540
 our minimalist centerpiece for 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.060
 a baby shower and also to decorate 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.610
 our house 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.600
 I'm Natalia Perez and this is a kind of 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.600
 beauty for plants
