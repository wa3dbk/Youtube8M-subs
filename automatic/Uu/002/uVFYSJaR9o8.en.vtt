00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.050
 surely 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.050
 pagÃ¨s reception 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.289
 the first time I went up on 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.969
 ronaldo i'm going i'm his ex 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.989
 owner who welcomed me for 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.909
 to train because I had no 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.799
 structure at that time and I had the 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.299
 chance to ride him eric in stroll and in 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.369
 step up on it I immediately 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.439
 knew he was a real champion 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:57.750
 recognizes the real stars in their 

00:00:55.439 --> 00:01:00.829
 pitch presentation was shocked and there 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.829
 it was really the case either him 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.080
 in competition to the test that stresses me 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.660
 moreover it really depends on the horses 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.820
 and even with the same horse it depends 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.560
 competitions and conditions in 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.420
 which one deals with the pump of the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 horse and from there you know the most 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.030
 difficult simply because we 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.680
 kill is to win so the older one 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 stress is beautiful it's harder is 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.040
 a part of the horse's decisions in the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.060
 cross which is more important than in 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.880
 the discipline wondered choice 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.120
 smart and it's a little less based 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.160
 on the pressing of the beast that the rest 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.380
 we are in a very balanced horse 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.550
 natural I went forward are 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.110
 very close to how we see a single 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.150
 moved to close and those coming from the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.229
 blow really has fun all 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.229
 both with good complicity 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.450
 me what i bring him to ronaldo 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.979
 it's pretty simple it's a benchmark is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.479
 someone who takes care of him and who 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.119
 wants him well and who protects us 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.390
 so he knows that what I ask him 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.740
 a priori it may be difficult where a 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.270
 challenge but it's not something 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.720
 which is worth at the expense of his 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.120
 welfare 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.580
 so I'm really the good father 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.510
 for him or the good friend I do not know 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.510
 will have to ask him 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.920
 it took a little time at first 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.660
 to get his confidence because he is 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.880
 difficult beginnings and that he does not know 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.830
 too found that these first riders 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.360
 and they were afraid of a lot of things 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.740
 that we could ask him what was 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.660
 do some pretty scary stuff 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.430
 still too much they need to have 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.430
 a lot of confidence in their riders 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.489
 admit that it's still a real 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.989
 privilege to ride a ferrari like that 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.070
 and that there are sensations seurre 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.580
 standard when we go up but if we do 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.190
 a lot of the same, but it must be said 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.769
 but there are moments on horseback when I 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.900
 the gallop across the slope not like 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.989
 that's it's going really fast they have 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:24.850
 the impression that they never tire 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:26.530
 really adorable be ronaldo way there 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.780
 the apprehended ordeal I want to say 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.489
 a bit like me because we comic 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.980
 much in emotion to his horse enough 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.580
 easily it stays below a lot 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.650
 better than a woman or khamsin 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.180
 but it's true that the box of departure 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.410
 at the cross often that makes them theirs 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.700
 the effect depends on the mood 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.110
 that about the contest and starts and 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.100
 obviously present but often the 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.360
 cross if they know and they hear and 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.670
 other horses galloped quickly 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.480
 leave and that's where we feel the heart 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.480
 good horse in the boots 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.590
