00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
series 27 inch blade on it I got

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.400 
series 27 inch blade on it I got
absolutely<00:00:13.969> frustrated<00:00:14.990> with<00:00:15.990> trying<00:00:16.020> to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
absolutely frustrated with trying to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.960 
absolutely frustrated with trying to
find<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.359> spark<00:00:18.359> plug<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.609> finally<00:00:20.609> figured

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
find a spark plug on it finally figured

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.840 
find a spark plug on it finally figured
it<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.590> so<00:00:22.590> I'm<00:00:22.650> hoping<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> create<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.550> demo

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
it out so I'm hoping to create a demo

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.150 
it out so I'm hoping to create a demo
for<00:00:24.380> somebody<00:00:25.380> else<00:00:26.119> find<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:27.560> as<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.890> turns

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
for somebody else find out as it turns

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.240 
for somebody else find out as it turns
out<00:00:29.660> we're<00:00:30.660> gonna<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.289> take<00:00:31.470> apart<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:32.040> few

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
out we're gonna have to take apart a few

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.790 
out we're gonna have to take apart a few
pieces<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.469> rid<00:00:34.680> of

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
pieces here and then have to get rid of

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:46.250 
pieces here and then have to get rid of
the<00:00:34.950> key<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:42.200> choke<00:00:43.200> ha<00:00:44.809> has<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.989> come<00:00:46.140> off

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the key and choke ha has to come off

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.010 
the key and choke ha has to come off
gently<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.070> plastic<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.750> pretty

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
gently it's just plastic so be pretty

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.520 
gently it's just plastic so be pretty
careful<00:00:49.730> with<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.820> guy<00:00:51.440> we're<00:00:52.440> gonna

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
careful with that guy we're gonna

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
careful with that guy we're gonna
replace<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.219> some<00:00:53.340> more<00:00:53.489> parts<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.750> we've<00:00:54.840> got

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
replace in some more parts so we've got

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.319 
replace in some more parts so we've got
that<00:00:55.170> guy<00:00:55.379> off<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:56.789> we've<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> ignition

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that guy off and we've got the ignition

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.220 
that guy off and we've got the ignition
key<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.800> away<00:00:59.219> i<00:00:59.489> pre<00:01:00.300> loosened<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.930> couple

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
key out and away i pre loosened a couple

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.390 
key out and away i pre loosened a couple
of<00:01:01.320> bolts<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.229> could<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.650> where

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
of bolts here so that we could see where

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.929 
of bolts here so that we could see where
the<00:01:05.610> spark<00:01:05.880> plug<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.340> take

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the spark plug is that in here and take

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.830 
the spark plug is that in here and take
out<00:01:09.119> those<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.360> bolts<00:01:09.869> there<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.600> rest

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
out those two bolts there and the rest

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.050 
out those two bolts there and the rest
is<00:01:13.020> pretty<00:01:13.140> easy<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.830> primer<00:01:14.340> button<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is pretty easy the primer button is

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.940 
is pretty easy the primer button is
attached<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.810> long<00:01:15.990> lead<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
attached on the long lead and so is the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.429 
attached on the long lead and so is the
ignition<00:01:17.820> key<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> long<00:01:18.750> lid<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
ignition key it's on a long lid so it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.190 
ignition key it's on a long lid so it
just<00:01:19.619> lifted<00:01:19.950> over<00:01:20.159> top<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.729> choke

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
just lifted over top of that choke

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.969 
just lifted over top of that choke
assembly<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:24.479> there<00:01:24.720> now

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
assembly and you can see in there now

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.070 
assembly and you can see in there now
we've<00:01:25.979> got<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> spark<00:01:26.640> plug<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.090> right<00:01:27.869> in

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
we've got the spark plug in right in

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.460 
we've got the spark plug in right in
here<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.400> even<00:01:29.640> got<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> little<00:01:29.880> tap<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:31.259> just

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
here it's even got a little tap you just

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.020 
here it's even got a little tap you just
squeeze<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.100> pull<00:01:32.340> out<00:01:32.369> away<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
squeeze on that pull out away and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.990 
squeeze on that pull out away and
there's<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.930> spark<00:01:34.290> plug<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.920> away<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.640> go

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
there's a spark plug and away you go

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.550 
there's a spark plug and away you go
with<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> change<00:01:37.070> as<00:01:38.070> required<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:42.090> have

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
with the change as required you have

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.999 
with the change as required you have
this<00:01:43.560> spark<00:01:43.890> plug<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.439> I

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
this spark plug in there and it's a I

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.630 
this spark plug in there and it's a I
can't<00:01:47.939> remember<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.450> five<00:01:48.659> eighths

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
can't remember I think it's five eighths

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.359 
can't remember I think it's five eighths
spark<00:01:50.640> plug<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.350> nice<00:01:52.560> grip<00:01:52.979> on

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
spark plug you can see this nice grip on

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.510 
spark plug you can see this nice grip on
this<00:01:54.329> thing<00:01:54.600> makes<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.770> easy<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.159> take<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this thing makes it easy to take it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.350 
this thing makes it easy to take it
apart<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.090> easy<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.259> put<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.500> back<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.860> again

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
apart and easy to put it back on again

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.870 
apart and easy to put it back on again
alright<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.040> little<00:02:02.159> note<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.729> was

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
alright and just a little note I was

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.280 
alright and just a little note I was
reading<00:02:03.180> through<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> manual<00:02:03.810> sounds<00:02:04.140> like

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
reading through the manual sounds like

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.709 
reading through the manual sounds like
it's<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.590> thirty<00:02:04.860> thirty<00:02:05.579> thousand<00:02:06.090> gapper<00:02:06.509> if

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
it's a thirty thirty thousand gapper if

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.020 
it's a thirty thirty thousand gapper if
you're<00:02:06.869> trying<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> gap<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.469> spark<00:02:07.770> plug<00:02:08.030> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
you're trying to gap the spark plug and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.510 
you're trying to gap the spark plug and
hopefully<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.629> helps<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.410> find<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
hopefully that helps you to find the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.920 
hopefully that helps you to find the
spark<00:02:11.819> plug

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
spark plug

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.149 
spark plug
on<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.470> Poulan<00:02:13.799> Pro<00:02:14.269> 1150<00:02:15.379> big<00:02:16.379> Skookum<00:02:16.950> thing

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
on the Poulan Pro 1150 big Skookum thing

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.490 
on the Poulan Pro 1150 big Skookum thing
but<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.370> can't<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:17.970> going<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.349> to

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
but I can't get it going and I have to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.480 
but I can't get it going and I have to
work<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.829> that<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.060> little<00:02:21.209> bit
