all about competitive which in my

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.820 
all about competitive which in my
opinion<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.010> won't<00:03:29.190> work<00:03:30.409> public<00:03:31.409> matches<00:03:31.560> are

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
opinion it won't work public matches are

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.140 
opinion it won't work public matches are
going<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.010> be<00:03:32.069> more<00:03:32.250> exciting<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.730> watch<00:03:32.849> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
going to be more exciting to watch the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.210 
going to be more exciting to watch the
competitive<00:03:33.690> matches<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.319> if<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.680> watch<00:03:35.069> any

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
of the bigger pro youtubers they're

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.220 
of the bigger pro youtubers they're
