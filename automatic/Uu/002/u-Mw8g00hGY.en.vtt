against<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> edge<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.970> don't<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.600> leave

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
against the edge I don't have to leave

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.099 
against the edge I don't have to leave
room<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> side<00:00:22.680> where<00:00:23.010> an<00:00:23.189> edge<00:00:23.400> exists<00:00:24.359> so

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
room on the side where an edge exists so

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.890 
room on the side where an edge exists so
these<00:00:25.380> brownies<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.699> put<00:00:26.910> right<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.750> the

these brownies I can put right up to the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.099 
these brownies I can put right up to the
edge<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:29.550> film<00:00:30.179> we've<00:00:30.630> been<00:00:30.750> eating<00:00:30.990> that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
edge of the film we've been eating that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.500 
edge of the film we've been eating that
every<00:00:31.380> time<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.679> unwrap<00:00:32.219> them<00:00:32.489> I've<00:00:33.360> been

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
every time I unwrap them I've been

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.510 
every time I unwrap them I've been
breaking<00:00:33.719> off<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> piece<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.680> we've<00:00:35.399> been

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
breaking off the piece and we've been

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.010 
breaking off the piece and we've been
eatin<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.149> can't<00:00:36.360> wait<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.840> at

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
eatin it so we can't wait to get at

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.819 
eatin it so we can't wait to get at
these<00:00:38.629> okay<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.690> yeah<00:00:40.079> I'm<00:00:40.200> positioning<00:00:40.710> them

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
these okay so yeah I'm positioning them

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.350 
these okay so yeah I'm positioning them
so<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.100> room<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:41.790> four<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
so I have room to do all four in a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.240 
so I have room to do all four in a
single<00:00:42.690> sleep<00:00:42.899> now<00:00:43.140> once<00:00:43.860> we're<00:00:44.100> comfortable

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
single sleep now once we're comfortable

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.479 
single sleep now once we're comfortable
wrapping<00:00:45.000> these<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.450> would<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.899> then<00:00:46.170> do

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
wrapping these we would just then do

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.260 
wrapping these we would just then do
three<00:00:47.489> more<00:00:47.940> rows<00:00:49.280> limited<00:00:50.280> by<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> width<00:00:51.059> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
three more rows limited by the width of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
three more rows limited by the width of
the<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.989> you'll<00:00:52.199> probably<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.770> four<00:00:53.219> rows

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the one so you'll probably get four rows

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.529 
the one so you'll probably get four rows
easily<00:00:54.030> maybe<00:00:54.239> five<00:00:54.660> columns<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:56.670> matters

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
easily maybe five columns but it matters

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.979 
easily maybe five columns but it matters
little<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.170> production<00:00:59.480> I'm<00:01:00.480> gonna<00:01:00.750> back

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
little to your production I'm gonna back

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.660 
little to your production I'm gonna back
off<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.219> against<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
off I'm not going right up against the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.939 
off I'm not going right up against the
edge<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.690> I'll<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.170> leave<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.710> bit<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
edge so I'll just leave a little bit of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.700 
edge so I'll just leave a little bit of
room<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.519> between<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.150> hold<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> wands<00:01:07.530> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
room here in between I hold the wands so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.149 
room here in between I hold the wands so
that<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> light<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.490> between<00:01:09.180> my<00:01:09.720> thumb<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and then I'm tilting I'm just gonna pull

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
and then I'm tilting I'm just gonna pull
this<00:01:51.810> away<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.259> an<00:01:52.409> angle<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.250> probably

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
this away at an angle and then probably

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.010 
this away at an angle and then probably
down<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> little<00:01:54.270> bit<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.780> it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
down a little bit just so it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.170 
down a little bit just so it's
completely<00:01:55.649> separated<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.850> I've

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
completely separated all right but I've

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.300 
completely separated all right but I've
got<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> perfect<00:01:57.899> sealer<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.860> were<00:01:59.009> doing

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
got a perfect sealer so if we were doing

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.600 
got a perfect sealer so if we were doing
another<00:01:59.610> row<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.969> brownies<00:02:00.630> again<00:02:01.469> push<00:02:01.890> tilt

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
another row of brownies again push tilt

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.899 
another row of brownies again push tilt
well<00:02:03.240> now<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.469> wrinkled<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:05.549> there's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
well now this wrinkled because there's

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.429 
well now this wrinkled because there's
nothing<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.329> there<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.600> weigh<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.899> down<00:02:07.140> but

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
nothing in there to weigh it down but

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.839 
nothing in there to weigh it down but
it's<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.129> same<00:02:08.459> thing

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
it's the same thing

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.360 
it's the same thing
now<00:02:09.209> don't<00:02:09.539> grab<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.379> film<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.819> middle

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
now don't grab the film in the middle

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.940 
now don't grab the film in the middle
and<00:02:12.459> pull<00:02:13.030> away<00:02:13.150> 18<00:02:13.810> inches<00:02:14.140> at<00:02:14.319> once<00:02:14.560> it's

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and pull away 18 inches at once it's

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.309 
and pull away 18 inches at once it's
just<00:02:15.040> making<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.730> harder<00:02:16.180> start<00:02:16.989> at<00:02:17.140> either

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
just making it harder start at either

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.229 
just making it harder start at either
corner<00:02:17.830> top<00:02:18.099> or<00:02:18.340> bottom<00:02:18.549> whichever<00:02:19.090> you

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
corner top or bottom whichever you

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.930 
corner top or bottom whichever you
prefer<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.750> pull<00:02:20.260> away<00:02:20.379> at<00:02:20.620> an<00:02:20.739> angle<00:02:21.159> like<00:02:21.909> a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
prefer and pull away at an angle like a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.809 
prefer and pull away at an angle like a
banana<00:02:22.209> peel<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.560> film<00:02:23.890> should<00:02:24.190> melt<00:02:24.519> so

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
banana peel and the film should melt so

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.740 
banana peel and the film should melt so
again<00:02:25.209> it's<00:02:25.510> push<00:02:26.010> tilt<00:02:27.010> pull<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.629> that's

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
again it's push tilt pull and that's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.259 
again it's push tilt pull and that's
that's<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.470> now<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:30.280> finish<00:02:30.610> these<00:02:30.790> up<00:02:30.849> your

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.130 
that's that now to finish these up your
problem<00:02:31.690> was<00:02:31.840> they<00:02:31.989> were<00:02:32.170> popping<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.840> we

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
problem was they were popping so we

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.600 
problem was they were popping so we
don't<00:02:35.290> have<00:02:35.409> to<00:02:35.500> turn<00:02:35.709> these<00:02:35.829> sideways<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:36.549> I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
don't have to turn these sideways but I

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.930 
don't have to turn these sideways but I
want<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.150> see<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.620> then<00:02:38.799> I'll<00:02:38.980> go<00:02:39.579> right<00:02:39.790> up

to the edge here give myself a little

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.339 
to the edge here give myself a little
rule<00:02:41.890> push<00:02:42.220> tilt<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.110> pull

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
rule push tilt and pull

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.589 
rule push tilt and pull
now<00:02:44.709> I'll<00:02:44.890> scooch<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.579> up<00:02:45.819> because<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.420> don't

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
enough so that the two layers of film

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.619 
enough so that the two layers of film
are<00:02:51.220> touching<00:02:51.870> push<00:02:52.870> tilt<00:02:53.430> pull<00:02:54.430> there's<00:02:55.420> the

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
are touching push tilt pull there's the

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.319 
are touching push tilt pull there's the
second<00:02:56.170> again<00:02:57.190> well<00:02:57.370> scoots<00:02:57.730> do<00:02:57.970> something

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
second again well scoots do something

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.910 
second again well scoots do something
now<00:02:58.420> if<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.599> had<00:02:58.780> four<00:02:59.049> rows<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.530> wouldn't<00:02:59.829> be

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
now if I had four rows I wouldn't be

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.349 
now if I had four rows I wouldn't be
holding<00:03:00.220> this<00:03:00.340> sideways<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.879> would<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.150> turn

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
holding this sideways I would just turn

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.330 
holding this sideways I would just turn
the<00:03:01.569> cutter<00:03:01.750> bar<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.200> way<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.680> cut<00:03:03.220> across

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
no holes so that it's trapped a little

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.020 
no holes so that it's trapped a little
air<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.379> I'm<00:03:41.470> just<00:03:41.620> gonna<00:03:41.739> purposely<00:03:42.609> pop<00:03:43.000> a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
little tiny hold in there with the heat

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.890 
little tiny hold in there with the heat

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
shrunk and all the seals are intact now

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.780 
shrunk and all the seals are intact now
we'll<00:03:52.989> do<00:03:53.169> the<00:03:53.199> same<00:03:53.349> it<00:03:53.859> will<00:03:54.010> take<00:03:54.190> two<00:03:54.459> here

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
we'll do the same it will take two here

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.920 
we'll do the same it will take two here
at<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.329> time

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
at a time

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.030 
at a time
do<00:03:56.560> these<00:03:56.799> two<00:03:57.150> look<00:03:58.440> well<00:03:59.440> there's<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.739> little

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
do these two look well there's a little

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.879 
do these two look well there's a little
hole<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.220> need<00:04:00.489> for<00:04:00.699> the<00:04:00.760> air<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.090> escape<00:04:01.120> and

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
hole I need for the air to escape and

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.390 
hole I need for the air to escape and
then<00:04:02.889> I<00:04:03.419> just<00:04:04.419> shrink<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.870> down<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:05.410> again

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
then I just shrink it down and again

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.309 
then I just shrink it down and again
besides<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.940> air<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.329> so<00:04:07.599> just<00:04:07.840> pop<00:04:08.109> the

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
besides the air in it so just pop the

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.289 
besides the air in it so just pop the
air<00:04:08.500> out<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:08.769> then<00:04:09.129> shrink<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.579> out<00:04:09.790> and

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
air out and then shrink it out and

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.730 
air out and then shrink it out and
there's<00:04:10.599> your<00:04:10.810> browning<00:04:11.379> and

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.640 

here's<00:04:14.740> this<00:04:15.130> one<00:04:15.840> as<00:04:16.840> long<00:04:17.140> as<00:04:17.260> you<00:04:17.350> keep<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
here's this one as long as you keep the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.440 
here's this one as long as you keep the
heat<00:04:17.829> gun<00:04:18.040> moving<00:04:18.280> this<00:04:18.579> is<00:04:18.760> heat<00:04:19.000> sensitive

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
heat gun moving this is heat sensitive

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.449 
heat gun moving this is heat sensitive
film<00:04:19.810> but<00:04:20.380> as<00:04:20.500> long<00:04:20.709> as<00:04:20.739> you<00:04:20.980> keep<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.310> heat

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
film but as long as you keep the heat

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.910 
film but as long as you keep the heat
gun<00:04:21.670> moving<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.690> really<00:04:23.020> won't<00:04:23.170> pop<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.470> lot<00:04:23.770> of

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
gun moving you really won't pop a lot of

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.010 
gun moving you really won't pop a lot of
holes<00:04:24.100> in<00:04:24.370> here<00:04:24.640> now<00:04:25.000> look<00:04:25.180> these<00:04:25.450> are<00:04:25.720> little

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
holes in here now look these are little

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.080 
holes in here now look these are little
chocolate<00:04:26.500> chips<00:04:26.770> on<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.190> top<00:04:27.370> here<00:04:27.580> exposed

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
chocolate chips on the top here exposed

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.690 
chocolate chips on the top here exposed
there's<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:28.990> lot<00:04:29.170> of<00:04:29.320> them<00:04:29.470> they<00:04:29.980> have<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.190> melted

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
there's a lot of them they have a melted

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.600 
there's a lot of them they have a melted
nor<00:04:31.270> would<00:04:31.510> I<00:04:31.540> expect<00:04:31.990> them<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.260> do<00:04:32.560> so<00:04:32.830> the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
nor would I expect them to do so the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.760 
nor would I expect them to do so the
film<00:04:33.940> is<00:04:34.150> absorbing<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.900> heat<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.290> that's

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
film is absorbing the heat and that's

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.230 
film is absorbing the heat and that's
how<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.070> shrinks<00:04:36.430> if<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:36.670> get<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:36.880> little

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
how it shrinks if you get a little

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.630 
how it shrinks if you get a little
corner<00:04:37.570> come<00:04:37.780> up<00:04:37.900> come<00:04:38.290> up<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.560> me<00:04:38.680> if<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.460> get

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
corner come up come up to me if you get

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.640 
corner come up come up to me if you get
a<00:04:39.670> little<00:04:40.060> corner<00:04:40.480> like<00:04:40.690> that<00:04:40.720> that's<00:04:41.170> popping

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
a little corner like that that's popping

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.800 
a little corner like that that's popping
up<00:04:41.830> if<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.640> pad<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:42.940> with<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.330> heat<00:04:43.510> gun<00:04:43.660> and

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
up if you pad it with the heat gun and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.560 
up if you pad it with the heat gun and
just<00:04:43.900> touch<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:44.560> it'll<00:04:44.980> yeah<00:04:45.940> let's<00:04:46.150> go<00:04:46.300> here

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
just touch it it'll yeah let's go here

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.910 
just touch it it'll yeah let's go here
see<00:04:46.750> like<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.050> little<00:04:47.110> corner<00:04:47.620> just<00:04:47.830> to

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
see like that little corner just to

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.560 
see like that little corner just to
touch<00:04:48.190> with<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.550> heat<00:04:48.700> gun<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:48.910> Pat<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.390> down

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
touch with the heat gun and Pat it down

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.430 
touch with the heat gun and Pat it down
and<00:04:49.930> then<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.710> corner<00:04:51.220> will<00:04:51.570> flatten<00:04:52.570> out<00:04:52.690> so

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
and then that corner will flatten out so

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.290 
and then that corner will flatten out so
if<00:04:53.620> you<00:04:53.770> ever<00:04:54.040> get<00:04:54.310> we<00:04:54.460> call<00:04:54.640> them<00:04:54.790> door<00:04:55.060> gears

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
if you ever get we call them door gears

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.820 
if you ever get we call them door gears
if<00:04:55.510> you<00:04:55.660> ever<00:04:55.780> get<00:04:55.990> dog<00:04:56.290> ears

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
if you ever get dog ears

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.020 
if you ever get dog ears
then<00:04:57.370> just<00:04:58.830> if<00:04:59.830> you<00:04:59.920> ever<00:05:00.040> get<00:05:00.220> dog<00:05:00.460> ears<00:05:00.730> just

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
then just if you ever get dog ears just

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.510 
then just if you ever get dog ears just
Pat<00:05:01.450> them<00:05:01.600> down<00:05:01.810> while<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.230> film<00:05:02.470> is<00:05:02.620> warm<00:05:02.890> but

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
Pat them down while the film is warm but

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.390 
Pat them down while the film is warm but
that's<00:05:03.760> basically<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:04.660> mean<00:05:04.810> they<00:05:04.960> wrapped

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
that's basically it I mean they wrapped

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.960 
that's basically it I mean they wrapped
they<00:05:06.400> wrapped<00:05:06.669> nicely<00:05:06.910> so<00:05:08.010> if<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.310> film<00:05:09.610> isn't

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
they wrapped nicely so if the film isn't

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.630 
they wrapped nicely so if the film isn't
holding<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.419> seal<00:05:10.750> an<00:05:11.590> issue<00:05:12.490> could<00:05:12.970> be<00:05:13.200> that<00:05:14.200> if

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
holding a seal an issue could be that if

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.750 
holding a seal an issue could be that if
a<00:05:15.640> roll<00:05:15.880> of<00:05:16.060> film<00:05:16.270> has<00:05:16.450> been<00:05:16.600> subject<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.200> heat

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
a roll of film has been subject to heat

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.490 
a roll of film has been subject to heat
it<00:05:18.760> often<00:05:19.150> won't<00:05:19.300> hold<00:05:19.480> a<00:05:19.690> seal<00:05:19.960> so<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.230> don't

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
it often won't hold a seal so I don't

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.230 
it often won't hold a seal so I don't
know<00:05:20.590> if<00:05:20.740> that's<00:05:20.980> the<00:05:21.100> case<00:05:21.340> here<00:05:21.610> or<00:05:22.000> possibly

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
know if that's the case here or possibly

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.630 
know if that's the case here or possibly
it<00:05:22.660> was<00:05:22.750> a<00:05:22.810> technique<00:05:23.320> thing<00:05:23.590> but<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:24.400> see

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
it was a technique thing but you see

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.670 
it was a technique thing but you see
what<00:05:24.790> I'm<00:05:24.820> doing<00:05:25.210> here<00:05:25.450> and<00:05:25.690> if<00:05:26.200> you<00:05:26.380> do<00:05:26.530> look

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
what I'm doing here and if you do look

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.290 
what I'm doing here and if you do look
at<00:05:26.830> it<00:05:26.950> you<00:05:27.040> should<00:05:27.220> have<00:05:27.430> good<00:05:27.820> results<00:05:28.180> just

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
at it you should have good results just
