tradable membership bond it is based on

tradable membership bond it is based on
the<00:01:18.810> GE<00:01:19.020> price<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.590> right<00:01:20.040> now<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.250> G<00:01:20.400> price

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the GE price and right now the G price

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.640 
the GE price and right now the G price
is<00:01:20.850> 1<00:01:21.150> point<00:01:21.270> 8<00:01:21.360> mil<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> actual<00:01:22.320> price<00:01:22.500> is

is 1 point 8 mil and the actual price is
1<00:01:22.799> mil<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.970> still<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.330> pay<00:01:24.450> almost

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
1 mil so you still have to pay almost

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.390 
1 mil so you still have to pay almost
200<00:01:25.140> K<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.890> convert<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:26.340> to

200 K to actually convert these to

200 K to actually convert these to
tradable<00:01:27.090> even<00:01:27.360> though<00:01:27.420> they're<00:01:27.570> only<00:01:27.659> worth

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
tradable even though they're only worth

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.899 
tradable even though they're only worth
about<00:01:27.930> 1<00:01:28.110> mil<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.250> G<00:01:29.520> price<00:01:29.759> is

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
about 1 mil but if the G price is

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
about 1 mil but if the G price is
actually<00:01:30.150> accurate<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.320> able<00:01:31.409> to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
actually accurate you would be able to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.310 
actually accurate you would be able to
just<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.850> 10%<00:01:33.090> value<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.140> just

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
just do it for the 10% value so just

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.870 
just do it for the 10% value so just
some<00:01:34.439> fun<00:01:34.619> facts<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.460> actually

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
just using this and just coming and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.630 
just using this and just coming and
claiming<00:02:15.510> your<00:02:15.630> battle<00:02:15.840> stabs<00:02:16.050> once<00:02:16.290> per<00:02:16.500> day

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.980 
spending like two to five minutes to do
that<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.430> basically<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.480> never<00:02:21.690> really

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
that so basically you never really

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.540 
that so basically you never really
should<00:02:22.230> spend<00:02:22.560> real<00:02:22.980> life<00:02:23.130> money<00:02:23.280> again

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
basically just check on it for like a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
basically just check on it for like a
couple<00:02:37.470> minutes<00:02:37.709> every<00:02:38.160> week<00:02:38.190> or<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.850> that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
couple minutes every week or so and that

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
there so it's really quite easy to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.770 
there so it's really quite easy to
actually<00:02:44.520> put<00:02:45.030> pay<00:02:45.239> for<00:02:45.420> your<00:02:45.510> accounts

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
old your membership is it can save you a

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.740 
old your membership is it can save you a
good<00:02:53.970> amount<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.180> money<00:02:54.330> for<00:02:54.480> me<00:02:54.600> my

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
good amount of money for me my

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.060 
good amount of money for me my
membership<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.170> five<00:02:55.350> dollars<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.650> month<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:55.980> I

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
membership is five dollars a month but I

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.710 
membership is five dollars a month but I
think<00:02:56.220> right<00:02:56.340> now<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.670> like<00:02:56.790> eight<00:02:57.480> or<00:02:57.510> nine

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
think right now it's like eight or nine

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.030 
think right now it's like eight or nine
dollars<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.200> month<00:02:58.380> if<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.709> start<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.010> new

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
dollars a month if you start a new

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.220 
dollars a month if you start a new
membership<00:02:59.550> so<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.450> can<00:03:00.630> save<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.959> decent

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
membership so it can save you a decent

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.420 
membership so it can save you a decent
amount<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.440> money<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.769> suppose<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.160> did<00:03:02.310> this

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
amount of money and suppose you did this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.900 
amount of money and suppose you did this
for<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> year

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
for a year

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.729 
for a year
it's<00:03:03.360> 24mm<00:03:03.900> for<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> year's<00:03:04.440> worth<00:03:04.620> of

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
it's 24mm for a year's worth of

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.590 
it's 24mm for a year's worth of
membership<00:03:05.160> versus<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.730> know<00:03:05.790> twelve<00:03:06.450> times

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
membership versus you know twelve times

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.960 
membership versus you know twelve times
eight<00:03:06.750> that's<00:03:06.959> 96<00:03:07.410> dollars<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.950> year<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.430> you're

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
eight that's 96 dollars a year so you're

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.310 
eight that's 96 dollars a year so you're
saving<00:03:09.300> yourself<00:03:09.360> almost<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> hundred<00:03:10.080> dollars

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
saving yourself almost a hundred dollars

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
worth it but if you actually think about

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.240 
worth it but if you actually think about
it<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.810> may<00:03:24.989> be<00:03:25.049> more<00:03:25.680> worth<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.040> than<00:03:26.190> you

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
it it's it may be more worth it than you

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.490 
it it's it may be more worth it than you
really<00:03:26.519> think<00:03:26.760> about<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.269> I'm<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.170> gonna<00:03:28.260> do

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
expect so at least in the United States

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.470 
expect so at least in the United States
the<00:03:34.410> minimum<00:03:34.680> wage<00:03:34.829> or<00:03:35.640> not<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.299> entire

night United States but in Massachusetts

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.229 
night United States but in Massachusetts
where<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.100> live<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.519> minimum<00:03:38.820> wage<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.090> nine

where I live the minimum wage is nine
dollars<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.690> think<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.959> lowest<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.530> anywhere

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
dollars I think the lowest is anywhere

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.160 
dollars I think the lowest is anywhere
is<00:03:41.160> like<00:03:41.310> seven<00:03:41.640> dollars<00:03:41.810> I'm<00:03:42.810> gonna<00:03:42.959> go<00:03:43.079> with

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
is like seven dollars I'm gonna go with

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.630 
is like seven dollars I'm gonna go with
nine<00:03:43.380> dollars<00:03:43.709> as<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.890> minimum<00:03:44.070> wage<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.459> nine

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
nine dollars as the minimum wage so nine

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.060 
nine dollars as the minimum wage so nine
dollars<00:03:44.880> an<00:03:44.970> hour<00:03:45.090> making<00:03:45.810> $9<00:03:46.380> an<00:03:46.410> hour<00:03:46.739> and

don't have minimum wages but I mean

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.070 
don't have minimum wages but I mean
that's<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:34.280> fairly<00:04:34.520> low<00:04:34.789> wage<00:04:35.030> at<00:04:35.870> least

full-time that's really not making that
much<00:04:42.979> money<00:04:43.220> but<00:04:43.340> suppose<00:04:43.639> suppose<00:04:44.300> you're<00:04:44.539> a

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
much money but suppose suppose you're a

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
you've gotten a somewhat decent job

you've gotten a somewhat decent job
maybe<00:04:50.030> it's<00:04:50.150> not<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.479> highest<00:04:50.930> pay<00:04:51.229> but

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:51.379 
maybe it's not the highest pay but

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.350 
maybe it's not the highest pay but
suppose<00:04:51.620> you're<00:04:51.770> making<00:04:51.949> $25<00:04:52.669> an<00:04:52.759> hour<00:04:52.849> and

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
suppose you're making $25 an hour and

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.700 
suppose you're making $25 an hour and
that's<00:04:53.509> enough<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:53.780> live<00:04:54.020> off<00:04:54.169> of<00:04:54.199> and<00:04:54.530> have<00:04:54.680> a

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
that's enough to live off of and have a

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.460 
that's enough to live off of and have a
decent<00:04:55.460> house<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.849> whatnot<00:04:56.120> so<00:04:56.330> define<00:04:57.020> 25

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
decent house and whatnot so define 25

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.529 
decent house and whatnot so define 25
divided<00:04:57.830> by<00:04:57.889> 6<00:04:58.220> you're<00:04:58.729> making<00:04:59.030> four<00:04:59.270> point

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
divided by 6 you're making four point

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.689 
divided by 6 you're making four point
one<00:04:59.690> six<00:04:59.990> bonds<00:05:00.530> per<00:05:00.710> hour<00:05:00.830> which<00:05:01.099> with<00:05:01.490> the

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
one six bonds per hour which with the

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.999 
one six bonds per hour which with the
convenient<00:05:02.270> one<00:05:02.810> mill<00:05:03.020> per<00:05:03.229> bond<00:05:03.440> is<00:05:03.620> exactly

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
convenient one mill per bond is exactly

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.110 
convenient one mill per bond is exactly
four<00:05:04.370> point<00:05:04.610> one<00:05:04.970> six<00:05:05.240> mil<00:05:05.630> per<00:05:06.440> hour<00:05:07.060> so<00:05:08.060> you

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
four point one six mil per hour so you

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.059 
four point one six mil per hour so you
know<00:05:08.419> you're<00:05:08.599> working<00:05:08.690> 40<00:05:09.139> hours<00:05:09.169> a<00:05:09.380> week<00:05:09.500> so

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
know you're working 40 hours a week so

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.710 
know you're working 40 hours a week so
that<00:05:10.669> forty<00:05:10.970> hours<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.180> week<00:05:11.210> is<00:05:11.389> full-time

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
that forty hours a week is full-time

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.029 
that forty hours a week is full-time
just<00:05:11.870> for<00:05:12.139> working<00:05:12.380> 40<00:05:12.740> hours<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.949> week

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
just for working 40 hours a week

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.960 
just for working 40 hours a week
multiply<00:05:13.940> that<00:05:14.090> by<00:05:14.150> 25<00:05:15.099> so<00:05:16.099> you're<00:05:16.460> making<00:05:16.759> a

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
multiply that by 25 so you're making a

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.890 
multiply that by 25 so you're making a
thousand<00:05:17.659> dollars<00:05:17.930> per<00:05:18.710> week<00:05:19.569> divide<00:05:20.569> that<00:05:20.750> by

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
thousand dollars per week divide that by

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.550 
thousand dollars per week divide that by
6<00:05:21.259> which<00:05:21.560> is<00:05:21.590> 166<00:05:22.520> bonds<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:23.270> that<00:05:24.259> means<00:05:24.440> that

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
6 which is 166 bonds and that means that

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.369 
6 which is 166 bonds and that means that
you<00:05:24.650> could<00:05:24.740> make<00:05:24.889> 166<00:05:25.699> Milic<00:05:26.360> by<00:05:26.960> working<00:05:27.259> your

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:27.379 
you could make 166 Milic by working your

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:28.869 
you could make 166 Milic by working your
job<00:05:27.409> now<00:05:27.830> obviously<00:05:28.190> a<00:05:28.430> lot<00:05:28.610> of<00:05:28.699> your<00:05:28.789> money

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 
job now obviously a lot of your money

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.629 
job now obviously a lot of your money

you're able to put away but this is for

you're able to put away but this is for

sort of an average person and you

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.839

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 
that by six dollars that's sixteen

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.200 
that by six dollars that's sixteen
thousand<00:06:23.360> six<00:06:23.539> hundred<00:06:23.599> sixty-six<00:06:24.259> bonds<00:06:24.979> and

thousand six hundred sixty-six bonds and

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.999 
thousand six hundred sixty-six bonds and
if<00:06:26.210> we<00:06:26.330> multiply<00:06:26.659> that<00:06:26.840> by<00:06:26.900> mil<00:06:27.319> that's

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
if we multiply that by mil that's

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.510 
if we multiply that by mil that's
sixteen<00:06:28.400> point<00:06:28.639> six<00:06:28.819> bill<00:06:30.069> so<00:06:31.069> that's<00:06:31.400> about

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
sixteen point six bill so that's about

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.980 
sixteen point six bill so that's about
enough<00:06:31.819> to<00:06:31.940> fund<00:06:32.180> two<00:06:32.360> accounts<00:06:32.779> to<00:06:32.900> two

enough to fund two accounts to two

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.040 
enough to fund two accounts to two
hundred<00:06:33.050> mil<00:06:33.289> on<00:06:33.349> skills<00:06:33.680> so<00:06:34.430> suppose<00:06:35.050> you

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
hundred mil on skills so suppose you

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.389 
hundred mil on skills so suppose you
spend<00:06:36.259> fifty<00:06:36.529> thousand<00:06:36.919> dollars<00:06:37.130> and<00:06:37.279> that's

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:37.399 
spend fifty thousand dollars and that's

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.040 
spend fifty thousand dollars and that's
about<00:06:37.550> enough<00:06:37.789> to<00:06:37.969> fund<00:06:38.360> an<00:06:38.539> account<00:06:38.810> to<00:06:38.960> two

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
about enough to fund an account to two

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.230 
about enough to fund an account to two
hundred<00:06:39.110> mil<00:06:39.349> on<00:06:39.409> skills<00:06:39.740> without<00:06:39.889> ever

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
hundred mil on skills without ever

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.330 
hundred mil on skills without ever
having<00:06:40.720> to<00:06:40.810> actually<00:06:41.110> make<00:06:41.229> any<00:06:41.380> money<00:06:41.530> cuz<00:06:42.250> it

having to actually make any money cuz it

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.680 
having to actually make any money cuz it
is<00:06:42.370> somewhere<00:06:42.639> on<00:06:42.699> like<00:06:43.000> eight<00:06:43.150> to<00:06:43.270> ten<00:06:43.449> bill<00:06:43.660> I

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
is somewhere on like eight to ten bill I

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.120 
is somewhere on like eight to ten bill I
believe<00:06:43.780> for<00:06:44.380> two<00:06:44.440> hundred<00:06:44.560> mill<00:06:44.740> on<00:06:44.830> skills

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
believe for two hundred mill on skills

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.370 
believe for two hundred mill on skills
so<00:06:45.849> if<00:06:46.000> you<00:06:46.090> want<00:06:46.240> to<00:06:46.330> evaluate<00:06:46.569> the<00:06:46.960> cost<00:06:47.139> of

so if you want to evaluate the cost of
to<00:06:48.009> enroll<00:06:48.220> on<00:06:48.340> skills<00:06:48.610> in<00:06:48.910> terms<00:06:49.599> of<00:06:49.810> real

interesting<00:07:06.729> I<00:07:07.000> think<00:07:07.449> that<00:07:07.900> after<00:07:08.199> my

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:08.349 
interesting I think that after my

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
current membership runs out I think I

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.950 
current membership runs out I think I
have<00:07:09.669> like<00:07:09.759> two<00:07:09.910> months<00:07:10.030> left<00:07:10.300> on<00:07:10.479> my<00:07:10.690> paid
