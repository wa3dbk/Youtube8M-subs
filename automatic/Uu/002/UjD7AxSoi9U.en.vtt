00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.190
 without thinkers 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.140
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.829
 I bring a new video 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.220
 and this time it's about how to put 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.520
 the snow effect on your videos for 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.149
 that as there is a more professional way and 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.220
 that is much better for example here 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.920
 I made a video with the snow and then 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.920
 so that they see it as they could be 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.290
 d 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.710
 the effects of the hyper audio spectrum 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.290
 and then tone the program that we are going to 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.649
 use to make this effect is after 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.229
 effects here is then to removed 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.789
 israel I have open then it's going to 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.299
 explain how to make this effect of the 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:28.080
 snow they go to this part they give you where 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.080
 they say new composition 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.960
 puts in the time they last the indiana 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.780
 accept we already have our composition 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.020
 we go to the bar below and from 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.680
 we sink new solid here 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.840
 with figure and lion den to accept 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.590
 well already once we have our 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.829
 solid lion today 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:02.070
 they select it and here they come up here 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.070
 where it says effect then lion den 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.810
 they join him and they will appear many 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.129
 options then what do you do 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.900
 is to go where it says simulation here in the 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.000
 that is in English, not the one in 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.390
 Spanish because if it does not help then 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.989
 they go here where it says simulation and it 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.920
 they go where ss snow says this what 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.970
 does is create a snow simulator 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.110
 so 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.720
 then we sink 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.810
 and as you can see here is already our 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.620
 snow will fall in a slow way 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.110
 and weird way then you guys can here 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.019
 and change what you want for 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.040
 example how many white things want 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.850
 to appear 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.570
 then if they want 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.910
 that many appear then there while 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.680
 it will increase, they will appear more and 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.430
 they will fall more and more 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.870
 Here we can configure the form 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.379
 that is the speed at which the snow falls 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.640
 here I can put 06 and will fall more 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:20.780
 slow there you can see that it falls slower 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.800
 the real snow falls like I do not know 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.120
 these are more or less an example 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.040
 amplitude 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.600
 here what it does is increase the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.970
 amplitude is not a big deal 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.970
 but it also helps 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.080
 often what this does is that 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.540
 as long as the white dots fall , 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.050
 move then if you increased the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.100
 often they will move more 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.490
 there they are falling and if they are seeing more 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.520
 increase it more if they are going to move more 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.330
 well and they are moving more 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.750
 then I'm going to leave it 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.860
 and so I would say 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.200
 flex 6 this is the size of the codend 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.980
 snow for example there is increasing 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.350
 more and more then I can put it 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.910
 that's fine 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.850
 and only you mean 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.460
 also as part of the points 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.620
 how many want to appear then 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.830
 if I want it to appear like this it will look like this 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.830
 more or less it will go down to the snowflake 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:47.099
 and what to put will put more in opacity 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:49.710
 for citi and put it if it stops to be 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:52.340
 more transparent one then always 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.750
 put them in 100 you will see more 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.900
 gleaming and while they put it 0 not 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.910
 know then something like that would be 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.240
 best 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.240
 so I 'm going to remove some of this 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.400
 what to reduce the size a little 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.240
 and lowering the frequency remember that 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.229
 you are going to do this however you want 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.229
 it's up to you 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.260
 so 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.360
 you are the ones from 100 then yes 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.090
 they want our minds to fall for 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.700
 down but up you can put this 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.000
 at least in and out up such 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.000
 see here 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.200
 will put back like tonight 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.900
 and also can move it what can 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.940
 come back smaller so you can 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.220
 put it as you want and then if you want 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.130
 doing it on an image is very easy 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.050
 and they simply give you import file 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.630
 archive 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.880
 choose any 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.390
 any picture 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.330
 It's a pity that if they want to, they can already 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.310
 remove this black solid 1 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.540
 good 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.850
 they are not going 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.210
 what to eliminate ready here we already have the 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.210
 image 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:29.880
 then to put this effect in a 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.880
 image they do the same they give effect 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:37.409
 simulation csd snow and then they are going to 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:43.160
 have the effect of 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:46.460
 of the light snow that you choose 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.330
 and then there they will see how how the 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.810
 snow 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.990
 and there you are modifying it just 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.990
 falling down 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.420
 then it is already a matter of you 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.420
 okay 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.870
 Well I hope you have served this 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.960
 video 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.960
 Give him a like sign and until next time 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.960
 bye
