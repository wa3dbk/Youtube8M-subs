goes now you'll notice as I take this
second<00:00:28.740> palette<00:00:29.130> he<00:00:29.820> will<00:00:30.060> change<00:00:30.300> direction

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
second palette he will change direction

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.420 
second palette he will change direction
and<00:00:31.019> there's<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> 50-50<00:00:31.800> chance<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.189> he's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and there's a 50-50 chance that he's

right at the beginning now notice how
the<00:00:43.200> points<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.590> stacking<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.129> 3200<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the points are stacking up 3200 is the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
the points are stacking up 3200 is the
max<00:00:45.570> you're<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.800> want<00:00:46.950> to
