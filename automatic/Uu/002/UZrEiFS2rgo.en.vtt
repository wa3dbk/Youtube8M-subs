the backhand it's very useful that
sounds<00:00:08.670> like<00:00:08.929> 23<00:00:41.059> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> notice<00:00:42.530> my<00:00:43.530> right

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
sounds like 23 if you notice my right

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.639 
sounds like 23 if you notice my right
hand<00:00:43.980> I'm<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.670> 16<00:00:45.030> notes<00:00:45.300> ok<00:00:46.289> i'm<00:00:46.410> doing

hand I'm going on 16 notes ok i'm doing
a<00:00:46.739> certain<00:00:46.980> motion<00:00:47.340> ok<00:00:47.969> that's<00:00:48.149> called<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
a certain motion ok that's called a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.869 
a certain motion ok that's called a
backhand<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:49.649> happens<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> instead<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
backhand and what happens is instead of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.040 
backhand and what happens is instead of
striking<00:00:51.149> all<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> sixteenth<00:00:51.840> notes<00:00:53.960> let<00:00:54.960> me

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
striking all the sixteenth notes let me

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
striking all the sixteenth notes let me
do<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> hat<00:00:55.469> ok<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:58.129> go<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.390> quite

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
do on a hat ok and go this can get quite

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.000 
do on a hat ok and go this can get quite
tedious<00:01:03.840> after<00:01:04.049> some<00:01:04.260> time<00:01:04.379> ok<00:01:04.650> instead<00:01:04.890> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
tedious after some time ok instead of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.820 
tedious after some time ok instead of
doing<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.220> i'm<00:01:05.820> using<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.299> backhand<00:01:06.830> motion

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
doing that i'm using a backhand motion

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.420 
doing that i'm using a backhand motion
ok<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.400> happens<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.970> strike<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> first

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
ok what happens is I strike the first

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.850 
ok what happens is I strike the first
the<00:01:11.430> first<00:01:11.610> note<00:01:12.320> with<00:01:14.060> my<00:01:15.060> stick<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.560> my<00:01:16.560> hand

the first note with my stick and my hand
goes<00:01:17.490> downwards<00:01:18.060> after<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> hip<00:01:20.119> see<00:01:21.119> instead

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
goes downwards after the hip see instead

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.149 
goes downwards after the hip see instead
of<00:01:21.780> doing<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:23.250> doing<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:24.979> ok<00:01:25.979> just

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
of doing this I'm doing this ok just

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.560 
of doing this I'm doing this ok just
lending<00:01:26.520> down<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:28.670> one<00:01:29.670> motion<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:30.180> I'm

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
lending down this and one motion up I'm

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:40.640 
lending down this and one motion up I'm
flipping<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> second<00:01:31.650> stroke<00:01:32.509> no<00:01:33.509> time

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.730 

so<00:01:41.280> essentially<00:01:41.690> with<00:01:42.690> one<00:01:42.870> motion<00:01:43.050> down<00:01:43.500> up

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so essentially with one motion down up

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.860 
so essentially with one motion down up
I'm<00:01:44.130> getting<00:01:44.370> two<00:01:44.490> strokes<00:01:44.760> one<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.810> two

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
I'm getting two strokes one two one two

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.290 
I'm getting two strokes one two one two
instead<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.800> one<00:01:46.920> two<00:01:47.730> three<00:01:48.450> four<00:01:49.250> getting

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
instead of one two three four getting

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.630 
instead of one two three four getting
1234<00:01:51.300> 1234<00:01:52.460> that<00:01:53.480> save<00:01:54.480> half<00:01:55.250> your<00:01:56.250> effort

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
1234 1234 that save half your effort

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:30.860 
1234 1234 that save half your effort
okay<00:01:57.150> so<00:01:57.510> one<00:01:57.660> more<00:01:57.780> time<00:01:57.810> two<00:01:58.200> three<00:02:29.870> all

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
okay so one more time two three all

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.480 
okay so one more time two three all
