00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.420
 every so often the best flavors 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.750
 of the country of the four regions of the country 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.120
 together with the current king of now 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.790
 gather in a ritual to assign to the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.160
 new cut king how this is done 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.859
 Well, as I told you, the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.650
 the four of the four regions with the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.850
 current king and the current king begin a 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.560
 ritual of the next mÃ¡laga 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:32.740
 shows the deck a deck as a 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.610
 little back does not matter and then you 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.090
 says the three have the deck can 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.590
 handle it 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 they can do whatever they want at the end and 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.470
 cape 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.630
 you are the best tauris go 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:51.770
 then the one in the northern region cuts 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:55.190
 the re-election south cuts 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.960
 the one from the east region decides to lower a 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.960
 little more to mix in their tips 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.780
 and finally in the eastern region just 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.340
 he deigned to cut 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.520
 after the king 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.520
 distribute the entire deck between the 4 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.030
 you 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.030
 all 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.640
 and then he tells them that they must 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.390
 take the letter that is in the above 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.400
 your batteries and watch her pass a number of 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.400
 letters equal to the one I have 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.840
 the first one looks and has an ax 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.939
 then you must pass eight letters 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.939
 according to the instructions of the king hector 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
 1234 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.730
 and eight the next 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.830
 312 is one more 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.190
 and not 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.770
 the last one jota jota in this case 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.530
 it's worth 11 1 2 3 4 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.250
 5 6 7 8 9 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.590
 is 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.330
 concludes the first part of the ritual and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.090
 we are ready to designate the new 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.730
 King of the cut tells them the restaura with 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.700
 the letter that was left over will be 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.760
 which designates the new king of the court the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.690
 first sample says good I have cut 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.750
 in king therefore from winning the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.610
 next says he hopes that I think that 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.450
 I have also cut in a king 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.730
 the third 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.030
 well it's name is cut here there's a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.739
 triple tie the last says wait still 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.140
 There is a letter to prove and 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.580
 I show that it is a degree 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.160
 the current king says good I think this 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.500
 obviously we are going to show the letter that 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.600
 be at the bottom of your stack and the first 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.370
 he says he is good, surely I am the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.590
 new king of the cut because I have an ace 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.950
 the next one says good if you have 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.340
 some but I also have some the third 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.920
 says one I think about some 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.590
 finally fourth says the tie 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.620
 is said between us against 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.530
 then a king of the present does not know 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.879
 what to do and comments well for 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.879
 tie off we're going to do the following 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.010
 as none of you can decide from 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:54.220
 Who is the king of the cut I will continue 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.220
 being me the king one two three 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.830
 then shows that the letters 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:06.250
 is it so 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.940
 total 20 plays in order 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.940
 everyone 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.470
 and with this the king of the court defends 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.070
 actor title 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.070
 Thank you
