a<00:01:35.500> racket<00:01:35.830> today<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.580> give<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.209> racket

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
a racket today I give you the racket

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.480 
a racket today I give you the racket
tomorrow<00:01:37.810> there<00:01:38.289> is<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.470> loss<00:01:38.800> of<00:01:38.979> tension<00:01:39.369> we

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
tomorrow there is a loss of tension we

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.820 
tomorrow there is a loss of tension we
call<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.789> static<00:01:40.270> loss<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.840> then<00:01:41.259> as<00:01:41.530> soon

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
call that static loss and then as soon

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.100 
call that static loss and then as soon
as<00:01:41.979> you<00:01:42.099> start<00:01:42.429> playing<00:01:42.729> you<00:01:43.300> have<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.509> dynamic

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
as you start playing you have to dynamic

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.410 
as you start playing you have to dynamic
loss<00:01:44.289> which<00:01:44.619> is<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:45.190> string<00:01:45.489> absorb<00:01:46.179> energy

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
loss which is the string absorb energy

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.050 
loss which is the string absorb energy
restitution<00:01:47.259> energy<00:01:47.679> so<00:01:48.069> this<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.580> this<00:01:48.849> is

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
restitution energy so this is this is

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.240 
restitution energy so this is this is
the<00:01:49.209> second<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.170> second<00:01:50.530> way<00:01:50.679> of<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.979> string

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
the second the second way of the string

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.510 
the second the second way of the string
to<00:01:51.429> lose<00:01:51.700> tension<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.300> losing<00:01:53.229> tension<00:01:53.739> you

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
to lose tension and losing tension you

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.089 
to lose tension and losing tension you
are<00:01:54.550> losing<00:01:54.970> control<00:01:55.539> because<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.259> enhance

a difference and then and then when you
change<00:02:31.659> strings<00:02:32.500> change<00:02:33.459> one<00:02:33.939> parameter<00:02:34.360> at<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
change strings change one parameter at a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.119 
change strings change one parameter at a
time<00:02:35.230> means<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.909> change<00:02:37.180> racket<00:02:37.769> keep<00:02:38.769> the

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
time means you change racket keep the

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.580 
time means you change racket keep the
same<00:02:39.400> diameter<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.299> old<00:02:40.569> string<00:02:40.900> keep<00:02:41.409> the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
same diameter of the old string keep the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.160 
same diameter of the old string keep the
same<00:02:41.860> tension<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.640> then<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.480> change<00:02:43.870> only

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
same tension and then you change only

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.839 
same tension and then you change only
the<00:02:44.349> string<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.549> answer<00:02:45.819> of

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
the string and you have the answer of

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.789 
the string and you have the answer of
that<00:02:46.090> string<00:02:46.390> if<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.930> change<00:02:47.230> everything<00:02:47.530> at

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
that string if you change everything at

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.789 
that string if you change everything at
the<00:02:47.890> same<00:02:48.069> time<00:02:48.659> which<00:02:49.659> one<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.019> like<00:02:50.260> which

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
the same time which one you like which

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.470 
the same time which one you like which
one<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.099> don't<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.730> don't<00:02:51.940> know<00:02:52.120> you

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
one you don't like you don't know you

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.550 
one you don't like you don't know you
have<00:02:52.629> to<00:02:52.750> redo<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.019> again

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
have to redo it again

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.940 
have to redo it again
so<00:02:53.829> again<00:02:54.540> change<00:02:55.540> one<00:02:56.079> parameter<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.859> the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
so again change one parameter of the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.699 
so again change one parameter of the
time<00:02:57.159> and<00:02:57.400> bright<00:02:57.939> everything<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.599> do<00:02:58.750> secret

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
time and bright everything you do secret

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.489 
time and bright everything you do secret
from<00:02:59.890> competition
