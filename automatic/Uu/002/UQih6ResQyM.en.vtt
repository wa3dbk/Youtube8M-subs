00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.199 
you all need to go to 20 locations
because<00:02:33.380> each<00:02:33.860> location<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.610> actually<00:02:35.120> got

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
because each location that actually got

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.990 
because each location that actually got
two<00:02:35.570> parts<00:02:35.989> but<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.470> think<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.340> last<00:02:37.580> location

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
two parts but I think the last location

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.050 
two parts but I think the last location
had<00:02:38.360> flower<00:02:38.690> part<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:40.310> basically<00:02:40.550> what<00:02:40.940> you

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
had flower part and basically what you

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.130 
had flower part and basically what you
want<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.209> do<00:02:41.330> when<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.600> actually<00:02:41.750> get<00:02:42.110> to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
want to do when you actually get to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.380 
want to do when you actually get to
these<00:02:42.350> locations<00:02:42.850> you'll<00:02:43.850> actually<00:02:44.000> drive

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
these locations you'll actually drive

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.210 
these locations you'll actually drive
and<00:02:44.570> you'll<00:02:44.660> see<00:02:44.870> some<00:02:45.110> red<00:02:45.380> flashing<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:45.980> think

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
and you'll see some red flashing I think

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.530 
and you'll see some red flashing I think
I've<00:02:46.370> got<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.640> gameplay<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.150> I'll<00:02:47.270> show<00:02:47.480> you

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
I've got a gameplay so I'll show you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.240 
I've got a gameplay so I'll show you
that<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.900> screen<00:02:48.230> basically<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:49.040> some

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
that in the screen basically see some

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.190 
that in the screen basically see some
red<00:02:49.489> flashing<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:50.900> follow<00:02:51.050> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
red flashing and just follow the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.199 
red flashing and just follow the
highlighted<00:02:51.739> red<00:02:52.040> on<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.310> muck<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.820> then<00:02:53.120> you

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
highlighted red on the muck and then you

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.910 
highlighted red on the muck and then you
get<00:02:53.330> close<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.780> goes<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.110> yellow<00:02:54.380> then<00:02:54.800> it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
get close to it goes to yellow then it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.500 
get close to it goes to yellow then it
goes<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.070> green<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:55.940> bump<00:02:56.150> into<00:02:56.330> the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
goes to green and you just bump into the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.570 
goes to green and you just bump into the
car<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.560> actually<00:02:57.830> get<00:02:57.950> two<00:02:58.130> parts<00:02:58.459> from

car and you actually get two parts from
not<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.450> that's<00:02:59.630> basically<00:02:59.720> how<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.050> do<00:03:00.260> it

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
not so that's basically how you do it

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.539 
not so that's basically how you do it

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.830 

and<00:05:54.160> I'm<00:05:54.280> guessing<00:05:54.669> in<00:05:54.760> the<00:05:54.880> full<00:05:55.450> game<00:05:55.660> as

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
and I'm guessing in the full game as

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.170 
and I'm guessing in the full game as
well<00:05:55.960> they'll<00:05:56.260> be<00:05:56.639> market<00:05:57.639> kaossilator<00:05:58.060> can

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
well they'll be market kaossilator can

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.210 
well they'll be market kaossilator can
actually<00:05:58.450> find<00:05:58.660> cuz<00:05:59.530> all<00:05:59.650> of<00:05:59.680> these<00:05:59.919> parts

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
actually find cuz all of these parts

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.850 
actually find cuz all of these parts
were<00:06:00.310> just<00:06:00.520> in<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.669> Midwest<00:06:01.150> so<00:06:01.389> I'm<00:06:01.480> guessing

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
were just in the Midwest so I'm guessing

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.590 
were just in the Midwest so I'm guessing
each<00:06:02.860> region<00:06:03.490> has<00:06:03.520> actually<00:06:03.940> got<00:06:04.090> its<00:06:04.210> own<00:06:04.330> kit

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
each region has actually got its own kit

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.030 
each region has actually got its own kit
car<00:06:04.810> in<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.050> full<00:06:05.230> gear<00:06:05.470> which<00:06:05.740> is<00:06:05.860> going<00:06:05.980> to
