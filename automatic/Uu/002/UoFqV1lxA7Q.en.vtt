00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
today about the three principles -

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.940 
today about the three principles -
opening<00:00:11.519> strategies<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:13.080> when<00:00:13.380> we<00:00:13.500> get<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
opening strategies so when we get to the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.279 
opening strategies so when we get to the
game<00:00:14.190> we're<00:00:14.370> always<00:00:14.490> like<00:00:14.730> ah<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.690> do<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.870> do

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
game we're always like ah what do I do

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.779 
game we're always like ah what do I do
there's<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:16.710> many<00:00:16.800> pieces<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.400> don't<00:00:17.490> know<00:00:17.670> how

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
there's so many pieces I don't know how

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.429 
there's so many pieces I don't know how
to<00:00:17.850> start<00:00:18.150> well<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:18.750> gonna<00:00:18.869> give<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.199> three

to start well I'm gonna give you three

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.279 
to start well I'm gonna give you three
steps<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.730> gonna<00:00:20.820> help<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.270> create<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
steps that are gonna help you create a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.580 
steps that are gonna help you create a
strong<00:00:22.830> confident<00:00:23.670> opening<00:00:24.289> first<00:00:25.289> thing

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
strong confident opening first thing

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.009 
strong confident opening first thing
that<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:25.830> need<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.130> understand<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.939> these<00:00:27.660> four

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
that we need to understand is these four

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.320 
that we need to understand is these four
Center<00:00:28.500> squares<00:00:28.890> these<00:00:29.519> are<00:00:29.699> considered<00:00:30.119> our

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
Center squares these are considered our

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.690 
Center squares these are considered our
super<00:00:30.869> squares<00:00:31.170> because<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.949> where<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
super squares because this is where the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.549 
super squares because this is where the
center<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> board<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> control

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
center of the board is the control

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.670 
center of the board is the control
center<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.450> example<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.290> my<00:00:37.469> knight

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
center for example if I have my knight

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.069 
center for example if I have my knight
in<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.040> center<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> board<00:00:38.850> my<00:00:39.480> knight<00:00:39.719> can

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
in the center of the board my knight can

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.959 
in the center of the board my knight can
control<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> eight<00:00:41.100> different<00:00:41.430> squares

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
control up to eight different squares

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.430 
control up to eight different squares
one<00:00:42.840> two<00:00:43.680> three<00:00:44.520> four<00:00:45.420> five<00:00:46.320> six<00:00:47.190> seven<00:00:48.000> eight

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
one two three four five six seven eight
we<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> very<00:00:51.120> strong

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
we can see that this is a very strong

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.569 
we can see that this is a very strong
place<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.170> knight<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.250> my<00:00:53.399> knight

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
place for my knight if I have my knight

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.740 
place for my knight if I have my knight
on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.760> side<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.390> board

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
on the side of the board

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750 
on the side of the board
it<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.170> only<00:00:55.320> control<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.070> four<00:00:56.370> squares

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it can only control up to four squares

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.849 
it can only control up to four squares
one<00:00:57.420> two<00:00:58.350> three<00:00:59.340> four<00:01:00.260> therefore<00:01:01.260> my<00:01:01.559> knight

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
one two three four therefore my knight

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.340 
one two three four therefore my knight
is<00:01:02.160> stronger<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> center<00:01:03.449> whereas<00:01:03.989> most

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
is stronger in the center whereas most

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.080 
is stronger in the center whereas most
pieces<00:01:04.830> are<00:01:04.949> stronger<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> center<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
pieces are stronger in the center of the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
pieces are stronger in the center of the
board<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> beginning<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> game<00:01:08.430> we

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
board so at the beginning of the game we

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.050 
board so at the beginning of the game we
want<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.060> about<00:01:09.470> center<00:01:10.470> control<00:01:11.060> first

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
want to think about center control first

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
want to think about center control first
thing<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.049> try<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.740> our<00:01:13.860> pawns

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
thing we can do is try and get our pawns

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.510 
thing we can do is try and get our pawns
into<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> center<00:01:15.710> very<00:01:16.710> important<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> try

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
into the center very important to try

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.149 
into the center very important to try
and<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> pawn<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.270> control<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> center<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and get a pawn to control the center the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.859 
and get a pawn to control the center the
next<00:01:20.189> important<00:01:21.060> step<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.570> want<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
next important step that we want to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.280 
next important step that we want to
focus<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.530> piece<00:01:22.860> development<00:01:23.670> now<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.810> like

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
focus on is piece development now I like

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
focus on is piece development now I like
to<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.680> about<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.040> pieces<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.640> they<00:01:27.180> are

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
to think about my pieces is they are

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.270 
to think about my pieces is they are
working<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.320> want<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> give<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.040> pieces

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
working for me I want to give my pieces

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.310 
working for me I want to give my pieces
a<00:01:29.460> job<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.299> they're<00:01:30.780> sitting<00:01:30.990> back<00:01:31.290> here

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
a job if they're sitting back here

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960 
a job if they're sitting back here
they're<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.920> happy<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.400> they're<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.640> doing

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
they're not happy and they're not doing

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.080 
they're not happy and they're not doing
anything<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:34.110> my<00:01:34.439> next<00:01:34.950> step<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.700> bring<00:01:35.880> my

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
anything so my next step is to bring my

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
anything so my next step is to bring my
pieces<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.229> them<00:01:37.439> working<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:37.829> me

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
pieces out and have them working for me

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.399 
pieces out and have them working for me
usually<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.420> bring<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> nights<00:01:40.170> before

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
usually we bring up the nights before

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.160 
usually we bring up the nights before
the<00:01:40.619> bishops<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.509> bring<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.780> knight<00:01:42.990> to

I'm<00:01:46.530> bringing<00:01:46.860> them<00:01:47.250> towards<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.970> center

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I'm bringing them towards the center

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.660 
I'm bringing them towards the center
notice<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.290> did<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.799> bring<00:01:50.100> my<00:01:50.280> Knight<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
h3 that would not be a good choice

the<00:02:02.430> next<00:02:02.909> step<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.450> always<00:02:03.630> want<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the next step that we always want to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.550 
the next step that we always want to
consider<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.680> King<00:02:05.130> safety<00:02:05.850> very<00:02:06.750> important<00:02:07.350> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
consider is King safety very important I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.499 
consider is King safety very important I
like<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.310> consider<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.789> king<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> baby

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
like to consider the king like a baby

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.930 
like to consider the king like a baby
the<00:02:09.840> reason<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.590> consider<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.130> king<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.430> baby<00:02:11.640> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the reason I consider the king a baby is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
the reason I consider the king a baby is
because<00:02:12.270> we<00:02:12.420> always<00:02:12.630> want<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.990> protect<00:02:13.110> their
