 [Rage Quit intro jingle] 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.820
 Gavin: Hey, I thought I controlled the mouse. 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.200
 Michael: So, shit, look ahead, Gevin, so I can move! 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.480
 Gavin: Is that--? It's a fence. 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.940
 Michael: This is a stupid fence! Turn! 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.700
 Gavin: Wait, wait. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.300
 K-Who bent my torch ?! 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.540
 Michael: That's the battery-- That's- We're gonna start with that again! 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.940
 Gavin: It's not flashing! 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.740
 Michael: IT'S UP TO THE BATTLE! THAT WE WERE ALIEN IN ALIEN WAKE! 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 IT'S NOT A SURVIVED TREATMENT! 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.540
 Do you want to look around to be able to? 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.540
 Gavin: So there's something like a compass or- What direction is that? Is- 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.480
 Michael: I don't know how it's going! That's what the whole game is about! We have to find a stupid paper! 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.780
 Gavin: So, how did we get here? I haven't seen a car or anything else! 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.640
 Well, let's go between-- oop-- 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.220
 Well ... no. 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.740
 Michael: Damn wandering around the woods looking at the ground and looking for a stupid paper. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680
 Gavin: Oh, that was a cricket! Is it a guide? 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.780
 Michael: Dude, we'll find the paper somewhere. 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.880
 Gavin: Dude ... what do we do when we find them all eight? Read it? 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.140
 Maybe it's a flipbook! 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500
 Michael: Yeah, maybe there are pictures of me shooting you in the head. 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.720
 [Gevinu's laughter] 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.200
 Gavin: A little weird if it were. I'm glad I spent all night in the woods for that. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.720
 I know what we should do! Stop. 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.740
 Michael: Well? 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 Gavin: Let's wait twenty-four-- Let's wait twelve hours. 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.840
 Michael: Shut up, you idiot! 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.940
 Gavin: The sun will come out! 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.120
 Michael: THIS IS NOT A SKYRIMY BLB DEBILE 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.440
 Gavin: Look here is open space! We are approaching something. 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.700
 I guess because I control the mouse and the keyboard ... 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.200
 Michael: Well? 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.300
 so it is the same as if he wore me in the forest on his back. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.000
 [Strange Gevin's Sounds] 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.420
 Michael: Damn, I hate you. 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.720
 Michael: God, this would be a hell of a bang if we could find at least one stupid paper. 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.460
 Gavin: Should I look more? Or is it-- 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.740
 Michael: It's not in the TREE OF THE TREE. ARE ON TREES AS ON THE TREE OF THE TREE! 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.240
 Gavin: All right-- 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.080
 Michael: You can't climb trees! Gavine can only walk around in this game and watch around. 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 They won't be up in the trees! 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.400
 All right, relax. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 What's this? Aircraft? what is it? Is it a plane? 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.820
 Michael: This doesn't seem like a stupid plane to me. It looks like a tank or something. 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.580
 Gavin: It doesn't help that the sun is shining on the monitor and you have your fingerprints all over the screen. 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.980
 Michael: Stop fucking complaining about my-- AHHH 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.180
 [Excited shouting] 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.400
 Michael: Great, we got it! Good. Gavin: "Don't look or it ..." 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.980
 Gavin: That-- It's scary. 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.740
 Michael: Well, shut up and take it, nerd. It looks like you were drawing it, you pako. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.320
 Gavin: I can't stop watching it. Michael: Stupid doodles from a two-year-old kid. 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.660
 Gavin What am I supposed to do about it? Michael: Click it with the mouse, damn it, and take it 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.120
 Gavin: Aaa !! Michael: Oh, my God! And now out of here - 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.960
 [Deep booming sounds] Michael: Oh, damn it. Gavin: What was that? 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.920
 [Deep booming sounds continue] 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.680
 Gavin: What's that sound? Michael: This is a sinister sound, as-- 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.020
 AAAAA What should I do? 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.360
 Michael: You turned off that stupid flashlight. 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 Gavin: Oh! I didn't know it was. 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.760
 Gavin: Now it's a flashlight! Ohh-ohh! Blik! Michael: For God's sake ... 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.480
 Michael: SHE HAVE BEEN STOP! 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.880
 Gavin: We're back! Okay. Michael: Do you have a flashlight? 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.880
 [PIANO SHOOTING TONE] Gavin: AHH !! Michael: OHH !! What the hell was that? 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.760
 [Sounds of Grain] Gavin: What is--? 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.340
 [Both shout loudly] 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.480
 Michael: WALKING YOU IDIOTE !! [Gavin keeps yelling] 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.600
 Michael: Great job of running Gavine. 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.760
 Michael: We have one-- We have one sheet of paper ... Gavin: What?! 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.540
 Michael: ... it took us twelve fucking minutes. 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540
 Gavin: I don't want to play this! This is scary! 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.280
 Gavin [Giggling]: This is scary! Did you see it? 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.620
 Michael: Sure he saw !!! 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.440
 Gavin: Okay. 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.180
 God! 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.680
 My heart beats! 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.540
 So if we stand still, it will-- 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.420
 Michael: You've got to go! You were like, "OHH! THIS IS! WE'RE GOING TO STAY! Gavin [incredulous]: WHAT ?! 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.820
 Gavin: Why are you telling me to run ?! I'm just holding the torch! You have legs! 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.180
 Michael: You have to BUY in the direction we run Gevine! 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.400
 I can't run when you look at him and ask him if he goes to tea. 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.000
 [Gavin laughs] 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.220
 "Any obscure cup of tea under Big Ben?" 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.140
 Gavin: So, if I turn off the light when we see it, then we can just leave? 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.520
 Let's practice walking in the dark. 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.220
 Michael: You're looking at the tree. 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.660
 Gavin: Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Michael: Thanks 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940
 Michael: Wait, was that it? Right over there! Right! There. 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.880
 Gavin: All right, all right. 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.620
 Okay, let's do it this way. Stop. 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.040
 Michael: I'm standing! Prokrysta, come on! Gavin: Fine, fine, fine ... 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.680
 Gavin: So we set the butt in that direction, then I take it, and then I turn off the torch. 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 Gavin: All right, ready? Michael: It's a flashlight. Yes. 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.420
 Gavin: We can light it up if you want. Ready? 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.040
 Gavin: UTÍKEEEJ !! Michael: Go go go JDI JDI JDI! 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.500
 [Deep rumblings begin] Michael [giggles]: Why are you blinking with it? Gavin [giggles]: Disco! Disco! 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.840
 Michael: You look at the ground. Gavin: I don't want to look into his eyes. Therefore. 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.600
 Michael: It's over! Gavin: Really? 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.700
 Michael: Yeah, he'll always be behind you. Gavin: Oh! Hell, come on! 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.000
 Michael: Don't run over that thing that shines your eyes and wants to eat you? 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Gavin: Ah! Oh! Something turned me around! Will we turn around? 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Okay, it's scary when you put your ears in both headphones. I used only one. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.780
 Michael: Dude, I use one ear for half the time. 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.140
 Gavin: You use half your ears ... half your time? 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.820
 He's like-- If we stay, will he marry us? 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.160
 Michael: Probably. 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.200
 Gavin: Well, this is ... 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.760
 ... JDI! 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.440
 Michael: We found ONE page! OSM is here !! Damn! 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.360
 Gavin: Okay, we're going back here now. Michael: How the hell are you gonna find something? 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.600
 [PIANA SHOOTING TONE] [Michael and Gavin yelling] 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.200
 Michael: DO THIS !! 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.300
 Michael: UTÍÍÍKEEEJ !!!! Gavin: AAAHHHH !!!! 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.920
 Michael: JDI! JDI JDI JDI JDI !! 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.520
 Gavin: WHERE am I ?! AHHH !! Michael: MRS GOD !!! 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.160
 Gavin: I HAVE BEEN SEE !!! Michael: I HAD IT !!! 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.720
 [Another disjointed shout] 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.940
 Michael: GAVINE, STOP TAKING YOUR MOUSE !! 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.320
 Gavin: We got it. Michael: Damn it, as if she was breathing heavily because she would take her away. 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.940
 Michael: Dude! Gavin: UHH! 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.060
 [Deep booming sound continues] Gavin: Isn't that a giant? Why is- Why does he have such a big footprint? 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.620
 Michael: So fucking stop and ask him! 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.920
 [Silent grain sounds] 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.740
 [Sounds of grain] Michael: Oh, run. Run. This is a bad sound. Gavin: Yeah, that's a bad sound. 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.760
 Michael: Turn on the light. Run. 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.660
 Gavin [giggling]: It all began to grab. As if he was right here. 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.760
 Michael: You're as if you were in your place! 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760
 Gavin: Well, that's probably because I have to go big, and I don't want to overdo it. 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.580
 Michael: Well, you fucking up your pants. I hope to fuck POSEREŠ in this video. 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.540
 Gavin: Okay, let's-- Wait, get it up. Like, go back and look around because I don't want to turn-- 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.240
 Michael! 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.040
 Micool! 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.240
 Go in-more to find out-- Go back! 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 Michael: Ohh, it's there. Take it and run! Gavin: OHHH! OHHH !! 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 Michael: Run! UTÍKEJ !!! Gavin: Bozee-- !! 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.240
 Michael: Can you fucking quit ?! 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.100
 This is a flashing light, not a flashlight you idiot! 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.080
 Gavin: Are we coming over to him? 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.080
 Michael: I don't know! I see nothing! Look around! 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.080
 Gavin: What do you mean, look around ?! I don't want-- Michael: Look around and then-- 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.900
 [Sounds of Grain] Gavin: OHHHHH !!!! 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.280
 Michael: JESUS ​​!!! We're at the tree! 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.960
 Why did I give you that mouse? 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.440
 Why-- Why do you control where we're looking? 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.380
 Gavin: Uhh ... 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.000
 Michael: I think you should be tasked with controlling a pen or something like that. 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 [Gavin's laughter] 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Gavin: I should have the task of reading those pages. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.500
 I'm scared less. I feel-- So he's not looking at him? 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.100
 Michael: I mean-- Well, I don't know. 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.100
 Gavin: Or must he approach you first? 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.700
 Michael: I don't-- You-- Every time we see him you start, OHHH !! 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.360
 I just-- How do I know. 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.940
 Gavin: I just can't learn from the experience we have with him. 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.200
 Michael: We find complete shit. 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.860
 These stupid sites are miserable as Gavin's sex life. 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.300
 How the hell is this forest ?! WHORE! 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.300
 Damn-- Will you look around ?! 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.660
 You just look in front-- All I do is go, get to the fence, and then you turn left. 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.660
 This is what we did ten stupid minutes. 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.440
 Gavin: This is how you decipher the maze by always turning left. 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.100
 Michael: You have to go through the CENTER to find the stupid pages, not to dance around the perimeter ... 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.160
 ... stupid fence all fucking time! 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.380
 Gavin: Oh, that probably only works in dungeons and not forests. 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.620
 Michael: We'll definitely find all the stupid papers when you're staring right at the stupid earth-- 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.300
 Gavin: I'm sorry, but there are only trees in front of us! 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.140
 Michael: THERE ARE SITES !! 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.140
 Michael: They're in front of us! Gavin: We didn't find a single page in the tree, you donut! 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.920
 Michael: Well, we found them high in front of us-- 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.820
 Gavin: Well, I can't see because of your hand in the middle of the screen-- 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.180
 Michael: Well, I'll put my hand in front of your stupid xicht when I punch your fist in your throat ... 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.780
 Michael: ... and then shove your ass. Gavin: At least I'll see her when I have her in my throat. 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.620
 Gavin: Actually, your elbow would be in front of my eyes or not? It does not matter. 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.260
 Michael: What's this? Oh, these are tikis. Gavin: Oh, it looks-- It's the other forest. 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.500
 Michael: Like the New Game Plus. Gavin: Or totems.
