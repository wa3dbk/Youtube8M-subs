00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.210
 I'm going to talk about saying that a topic that 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.130

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.340

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.320
 about this topic is talking about 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.289
 that could bring if the former principal to the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.359
 campaign if the thefts to banks of a tlc 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.070
 of zombies etc but above all 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.630
 when will it come and in fact already 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.420

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.430
 I'm going to play other games and it's 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.920
 understandable guys does practically a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.870
 month that rockstar announced the delight of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.910
 special 'independence day' that was 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.829
 retired about a week ago 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.320
 and good apart from all this there have been 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.719
 Many rumors have also been many 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.360
 speculations theories and so on about 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.870
 what is it going to bring is tlc and when 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.180
 will get there 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.920
 however guys we did not have 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.660
 practically nothing confirmed not 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.149
 we had a line of codes not 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.129
 we had an ad for rockstar no 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.850
 we had an image with the name 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.830
 etc 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.590
 until practically a few days ago 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.960
 thanks to the xbox market country page 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.820
 which is where the developers of the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.700
 games put their content to download 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 this page is divided into two parts 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.729
 a part that is everyone 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.700
 can see either from a computer 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.920
 entering the xbox website 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.170
 marketplace and there you will be able to see games 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.720
 the downloadable content for games 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.000
 among other things and the other part of the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.860
 page is a play marketplace that is the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.720
 of the developers in this part 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.819
 guys only the people who are 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.740
 registered as developers are going to 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.840
 to enter and in it they will be able to see 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 content before it is announced in the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 part of him exo is live marketplace that 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.000
 all people can see and even if there is not 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.740
 much difference between a part and the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.750
 another because for example obviously not 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.119
 you will be able to see great eisai cars in 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.979
 the in the developer area before 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.720
 that comes out in the area where all the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.850
 people can see it at least you're not going to 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.530
 can see as is, but if you see the line 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.030
 of codes on the xbox live page 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.890
 marketplace in the area of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.289
 developers so you'll be able to see 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.030
 the line of codes for example 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.009
 great cars that some next 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.450
 update and laws this method guys 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.330
 the community of grand theft auto 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.000
 5 or online gta could discover before 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.129
 that the independent lcd came out and 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.780
 special or the dlc i'm not a hipster 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.730
 we could see the title a brief 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.650
 description and if I'm not wrong too 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.450
 we can see a date in which 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.069
 indicated when that d lc was going to come out 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.170
 but good the community of great defect 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.150
 discovered those codes and previously to 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.700
 the week after they were discovered 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.530
 those codes came out the respective dlc 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.780
 but hey getting a bit to the issue of 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.269

 we knew nothing about this lc roxa 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.030
 he had not announced anything we do not have 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.950
 codes we did not have names we did not have 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.049
 practically nothing but what is it 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.569
 happened on Thursday of last week is 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.610
 say on Thursday , August 7, 2014 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.769
 So thank you a gta user 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.930
 forums we could know a little more 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.730
 about the next grand theft dlc 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.799
 auto 5 and is that this user enters the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.380
 Developer area on the page 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.720
 xbox live marketplace got to see the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.150
 lines of code that make up the page 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.910
 from xbox live marketplace and it was found 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.110
 that rockstar had updated 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.900
 put new codes 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.430
 referring to a packet of tlc these 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.320
 lines of code the truth they do not say 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.210
 a lot about the next update 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.190
 of gta online but yes that can give us 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.500
 a little more information about 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.660
 this as I said the title says d 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.250
 lc so however guys this is not 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.800
 is the official title this puts it 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.900
 rockstar because as we discovered the 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.210
 two previous ones is is the same 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.070
 rockstar way not to fall again 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.500
 he only put him on ls for but 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.180
 surely when in a 7 lc change the 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.370
 name we can see that these lines of 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.250
 code were updated or the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.870
 Thursday August 7 , 2014 that is to say the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.580
 Thursday of last week in the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.680
 Content category says game 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.420
 content content and in the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.489
 product description the truth that 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.200
 does not say enough says please download 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.510
 this content but that's for the same 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.760
 guys like the two previous times that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.440
 refuse was going to announce a dlc the stuffing 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.989
 all the fields correctly is to say 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.520
 of title he gave the name of the times 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.560
 in the description put a description 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.870
 detailed what it was going to bring 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.850
 is tlc we could know practically everything 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.530
 of the two past laws before 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.990
 come out so that this time not 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.259
 the same thing happen rockstar simply 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.789
 inserted a very general text about the 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.340
 dlc so we can also give ourselves 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.770
 note that the last two dates are 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.840
 misplaced this is done on purpose 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.940
 for the same thing that I am commenting 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.300
 because obviously it 's tlc it's not going to 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.830
 leave in the year 2000 799 and this is what 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.870
 most important about these codes 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.940
 that were found in the xbox live 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.349
 marketplace of the developers area 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.060
 talking about the next 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.190
 update for online card or for 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.349
 great cars 5 and although honestly not 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.720
 it's practically nothing so it can 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.699
 give one more hope towards this 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.210
 next dlc or towards that next 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.009
 update 1.16 is already closer than 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.569
 never because as I already say the two 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.389
 previous times that of this same 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.340
 way we could see the last two of 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.770
 times a week more or less than it 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.300
 discover the respective one of ls rockstar what 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.090
 announced so you guys already know the 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.130
 television at 1.16 or the next dlc for 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.419
 big photo 5 for people online the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.860
 it's really close enough so 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.080
 do not worry you have to have patience 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.240
 as I already told in no direct 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.460
 no person here on youtube that 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.770
 work in rockstar games and nobody 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.310
 can give a fixed date on which we're going 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.710
 Let's see 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.600
 next dlc so you already know patience and 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.800
