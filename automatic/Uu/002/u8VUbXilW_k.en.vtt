00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
about the new tackling mechanism let me

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.889 
about the new tackling mechanism let me
know<00:01:39.640> what<00:01:39.789> you<00:01:39.939> think<00:01:40.180> but<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.509> think<00:01:40.810> the

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
know what you think but I think the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.010 
know what you think but I think the
first<00:01:41.080> thing<00:01:41.259> is<00:01:41.649> obvious<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.549> cone<00:01:43.020> one

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
first thing is obvious is the cone one

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.600 
first thing is obvious is the cone one
things<00:01:44.289> that<00:01:44.470> we<00:01:44.560> got<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.830> get<00:01:44.950> used<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.399> when

that just now showing it to us you know
in<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.920> UI<00:01:54.220> perspective<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:56.409> cone<00:01:56.679> is<00:01:56.710> on<00:01:57.310> by

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
in a UI perspective the cone is on by

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.410 
in a UI perspective the cone is on by
default<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:58.479> on<00:01:58.840> rookie<00:01:59.560> Pro<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.580> out<00:02:00.789> all<00:02:00.819> pro

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
default so on rookie Pro and out all pro

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.249 
default so on rookie Pro and out all pro
and<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:02.560> off<00:02:02.860> by<00:02:03.340> default<00:02:03.399> in<00:02:04.060> all<00:02:04.360> man<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:05.049> if

and it's off by default in all man so if

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.960 
and it's off by default in all man so if
you're<00:02:05.380> playing<00:02:05.709> an<00:02:05.890> online<00:02:06.069> ranked<00:02:06.670> game

you're playing an online ranked game

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.850 
you're playing an online ranked game
then<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:09.009> cone<00:02:09.280> will<00:02:09.519> actually<00:02:10.060> be<00:02:10.269> on

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
then that the cone will actually be on

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.160 
then that the cone will actually be on
the<00:02:11.860> square<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.700> for<00:02:13.000> an<00:02:13.120> aggressive<00:02:13.690> tackle

against some shifty backs now if it's a

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.960 
against some shifty backs now if it's a
guy<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:08.049> Alfred<00:03:08.590> Morris<00:03:08.829> who<00:03:09.459> is<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.640> much

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
guy like Alfred Morris who is a much

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.300 
guy like Alfred Morris who is a much
bigger<00:03:10.299> back<00:03:10.660> then<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.410> may<00:03:11.650> be<00:03:11.709> able<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.130> get

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
bigger back then you may be able to get

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.190 
bigger back then you may be able to get
away<00:03:12.430> with<00:03:12.609> it<00:03:13.000> but<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:13.269> you're<00:03:13.480> had<00:03:13.870> Chris

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
away with it but if you're had Chris

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.890 
away with it but if you're had Chris
Johnson<00:03:14.709> in<00:03:14.859> your<00:03:15.040> site<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.910> might<00:03:16.299> not<00:03:16.569> want

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
Johnson in your site you might not want

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.289 
Johnson in your site you might not want
to<00:03:17.019> hit<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.100> square<00:03:18.370> button<00:03:18.489> because<00:03:19.090> he's<00:03:19.269> a

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
to hit the square button because he's a

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.780 
to hit the square button because he's a
little<00:03:19.660> bit<00:03:19.989> more<00:03:20.440> elusive<00:03:20.950> than<00:03:21.190> Alfred

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
little bit more elusive than Alfred

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.479 
little bit more elusive than Alfred
Morris<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.390> he<00:03:22.540> may<00:03:22.810> get<00:03:23.049> past<00:03:23.319> you<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.739> that

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
Morris and he may get past you and that

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.420 
Morris and he may get past you and that
will<00:03:24.819> pretty<00:03:25.750> much<00:03:25.900> take<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.860> player<00:03:27.129> out

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
will pretty much take that player out

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.330 
will pretty much take that player out
the<00:03:27.670> way<00:03:27.819> now<00:03:28.090> x<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.230> conservative<00:03:29.860> chapel

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
the way now x is the conservative chapel

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.539 
the way now x is the conservative chapel
so<00:03:30.819> if<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.060> hit<00:03:31.239> X<00:03:31.510> when<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.739> ball<00:03:33.069> carriers

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
so if you hit X when that ball carriers

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.539 
so if you hit X when that ball carriers
in<00:03:33.819> your<00:03:34.360> proximity<00:03:35.170> cone<00:03:35.560> or<00:03:35.769> your<00:03:35.950> topic<00:03:36.370> on

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
in your proximity cone or your topic on

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.089 
in your proximity cone or your topic on
which<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:36.909> called<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.299> tackle<00:03:37.690> cone<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.680> will

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
which is called the tackle cone you will

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.699 
which is called the tackle cone you will
perform<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.909> more<00:03:40.239> reliable<00:03:40.659> tackle<00:03:41.470> more

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
perform a more reliable tackle more

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.559 
perform a more reliable tackle more
reliable<00:03:42.420> wrap<00:03:43.420> up<00:03:43.659> tackle<00:03:44.170> now<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.730> one<00:03:46.450> of

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
reliable wrap up tackle now the one of

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.559 
reliable wrap up tackle now the one of
the<00:03:46.629> major<00:03:46.840> differences<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.769> that<00:03:48.450> like<00:03:49.450> I

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
the major differences is that like I

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.259 
the major differences is that like I
said<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.959> X<00:03:50.200> is<00:03:50.409> more<00:03:50.590> reliable<00:03:51.010> but<00:03:51.489> you

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
said the X is more reliable but you

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.020 
said the X is more reliable but you
still<00:03:52.629> can<00:03:52.930> give<00:03:53.650> up<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:54.040> little<00:03:54.370> bit<00:03:54.519> more<00:03:54.670> yard

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
still can give up a little bit more yard

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.479 
still can give up a little bit more yard
so<00:03:55.480> you'll<00:03:55.840> see<00:03:56.019> more<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.349> like<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:56.860> rapping

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
so you'll see more of like a rapping

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.449 
so you'll see more of like a rapping
tackle<00:03:58.060> whereas<00:03:58.689> if<00:03:58.870> you<00:03:59.019> hit<00:03:59.230> X<00:03:59.500> it's<00:03:59.980> more<00:04:00.340> of

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
tackle whereas if you hit X it's more of

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.220 
tackle whereas if you hit X it's more of
a<00:04:00.549> head<00:04:00.819> stick<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.360> know<00:04:01.480> you're<00:04:01.689> trying<00:04:01.959> to

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230
