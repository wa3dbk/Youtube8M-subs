okay<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:11.220> this<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.849> pit<00:00:12.180> lane<00:00:12.210> exit<00:00:12.570> here

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
okay so this is the pit lane exit here

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.260 
okay so this is the pit lane exit here
at<00:00:13.440> Baku<00:00:14.900> we<00:00:15.900> join<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.920> circuit<00:00:17.490> stay<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
at Baku we join the circuit stay to the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.839 
at Baku we join the circuit stay to the
right<00:00:18.330> hand<00:00:18.660> side<00:00:18.950> in<00:00:19.950> case<00:00:20.160> any<00:00:20.430> other<00:00:20.610> cars

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
right hand side in case any other cars

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.529 
right hand side in case any other cars
are<00:00:21.119> approaching<00:00:21.390> from<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.960> left

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
are approaching from the left

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.409 
are approaching from the left
it's<00:00:24.259> a<00:00:24.499> chicane<00:00:25.160> that's<00:00:25.460> very<00:00:25.759> very<00:00:26.060> tight

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
it's a chicane that's very very tight

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.620 
it's a chicane that's very very tight
enough<00:00:26.779> space<00:00:27.140> for<00:00:27.439> one<00:00:27.619> car

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
enough space for one car

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.870 
enough space for one car
and<00:00:29.199> then<00:00:29.349> it<00:00:29.500> opens<00:00:29.919> up<00:00:30.070> into<00:00:30.279> a<00:00:30.429> three-lane

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
and then it opens up into a three-lane

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.060 
and then it opens up into a three-lane
motorway or<00:00:31.840> they<00:00:31.990> approach<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.559> turn<00:00:32.770> one

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
motorway or they approach to turn one

motorway or they approach to turn one
which<00:00:34.000> is<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.590> 180-degree<00:00:35.590> habit

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.130 

it's<00:00:40.040> very<00:00:40.399> very<00:00:40.700> slow<00:00:41.030> speed<00:00:41.090> but<00:00:41.600> very<00:00:41.840> wide

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
it's very very slow speed but very wide

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.869 
it's very very slow speed but very wide
and<00:00:42.170> this<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:42.770> one<00:00:42.949> of<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.100> places<00:00:43.250> where<00:00:43.670> I<00:00:43.699> do

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
and this is one of the places where I do

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.180 
and this is one of the places where I do
think<00:00:44.449> there<00:00:45.140> will<00:00:45.290> be<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.469> lot<00:00:45.649> of<00:00:45.680> Oh<00:00:45.829> taken

wall on the left hand side another short
straight<00:01:14.980> into<00:01:15.370> a<00:01:15.400> 90<00:01:15.910> degree<00:01:16.030> left<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.960> you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
straight into a 90 degree left that you

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.110 
straight into a 90 degree left that you
can<00:01:17.200> see<00:01:17.410> there's<00:01:17.620> signs<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:18.220> narrow<00:01:18.460> down<00:01:18.790> now

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.850 

so<00:01:22.120> when<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.690> hook<00:01:22.900> with<00:01:23.140> all<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.410> buildings

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
so when the hook with all the buildings

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.430 
so when the hook with all the buildings
either<00:01:24.040> side<00:01:24.400> it's<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:25.390> feels<00:01:25.750> like<00:01:25.960> very<00:01:26.290> much

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
either side it's it feels like very much

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.899 
either side it's it feels like very much
you're<00:01:26.710> in<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.890> tunnel

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
you're in a tunnel

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.319 
you're in a tunnel
90<00:01:29.719> degree<00:01:29.960> right<00:01:30.289> very<00:01:30.679> slow<00:01:31.039> speed<00:01:31.100> opens<00:01:31.789> up

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
90 degree right very slow speed opens up

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.899 
90 degree right very slow speed opens up
then<00:01:32.810> it<00:01:32.929> gets<00:01:33.079> very<00:01:33.229> very<00:01:33.560> wide<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:34.369> don't

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
then it gets very very wide and don't

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.849 
then it gets very very wide and don't
see<00:01:35.060> much<00:01:35.240> overtaken<00:01:35.899> in<00:01:35.960> this<00:01:36.200> plan<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.619> train

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
see much overtaken in this plan to train

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.830 
see much overtaken in this plan to train
because<00:01:37.069> it's<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.490> very<00:01:37.520> fast<00:01:38.090> right-hander

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
because it's a very fast right-hander

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.050 
because it's a very fast right-hander
coming<00:01:39.079> up

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.149 

and<00:01:42.360> through<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.110> will<00:01:43.320> only<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.680> one

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and through here there will only be one

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
and through here there will only be one
line<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:44.909> off<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.270> line<00:01:45.420> once<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> track

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
line because off the line once the track

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.810 
line because off the line once the track
is<00:01:46.350> rubbered<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.860> you'll<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.280> quite<00:01:47.549> dusty

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
is rubbered up you'll be quite dusty

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.770 
is rubbered up you'll be quite dusty
dirty<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.780> slippery<00:01:49.700> okay<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:51.420> slow<00:01:51.720> speed

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
dirty and slippery okay very slow speed

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.710 
dirty and slippery okay very slow speed
chicane<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.920> tight<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> entry<00:01:53.970> opens<00:01:54.509> on

chicane it's tight on the entry opens on
the<00:01:54.750> exit<00:01:55.289> very<00:01:56.100> much<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> slow<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.060> fast<00:01:57.420> our

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
the exit very much a slow in fast our

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.480 
the exit very much a slow in fast our
time<00:01:57.990> corner<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.289> my<00:02:01.710> favorite<00:02:02.009> bit

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
time corner this is the my favorite bit

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.010 
time corner this is the my favorite bit
those<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.330> came<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.810> come<00:02:03.990> through

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
those you came we just come through

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.550 
those you came we just come through
another<00:02:04.740> chicane<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.090> bit<00:02:06.210> faster

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
another chicane it's a little bit faster

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.729 
another chicane it's a little bit faster
but<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:08.160> there's<00:02:08.880> absolutely<00:02:09.660> no<00:02:10.140> room<00:02:10.500> for

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
but it's there's absolutely no room for

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.470 
but it's there's absolutely no room for
error<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> left-hand<00:02:11.730> side<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.300> can

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
error on the left-hand side as you can

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.870 
error on the left-hand side as you can
see<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.840> barrier<00:02:13.170> comes<00:02:13.410> up<00:02:13.620> very<00:02:13.650> quickly

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
see the barrier comes up very quickly

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.180 
see the barrier comes up very quickly
now<00:02:16.420> we're<00:02:17.050> into<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.410> slowest<00:02:17.890> part<00:02:18.070> of<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
now we're into the slowest part of the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.850 
now we're into the slowest part of the
track<00:02:18.250> definitely<00:02:19.120> no<00:02:19.270> overtake<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.960> here<00:02:20.230> but

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
track definitely no overtake in here but

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.860
