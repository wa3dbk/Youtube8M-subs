00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.779
 Carlo and what ultimately can be picked up at my last retreat 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.540
 ending 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.629
 the plus in the name piece a cracked version 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.799
 2 s class Kazuyoshi it Iceland 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.759
 At the time, Peter noe was published 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.970
 Daige defensive distance seemed to me 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.199
 again are cutting 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.419
 compact all layers changed 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.210
 Sarrazin much 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 June is here 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.749
 the difficulty is so 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.330
 significantly higher than the original 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
 and that's just right for me 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.090
 Suddenly 2 percent in the supermarket birthplace wants is gambled 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.230
 that was pretty easy 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.040
 to come with the ball 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.320
 but there's no such thing as an explosion 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.690
 the inside view IMEX labels 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.750
 and that is much more difficult 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.510
 So what's a lot more difficult for me is by far the hardest 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.480
 was in the game what I played so far about life 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.880
 Kuntz who manages that he manages to get hold of everything gently so 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.039
 Sanderlings is 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.560
 were now games 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.570
 I think without problems now yoshi's Island at the beginning 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.570
 I wanted the original 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.359
 but I'm doing that, that's it 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.170
 many Les Bleus give of it 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.870
 and also pretty good 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.870
 I have now opted for the pc version 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.970
 and that the degree of difficulty is heard, of course it is 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.520
 interesting point also have less 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.680
 should get to know 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560
 I think that will play 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.630
 I can not do it yet I have now touched the first double 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.540
 that had already sent before 1 o'clock 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.960
 Belong to tribe 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 must think a bit 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.480
 the hippies stopped 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.480
 adventure 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.179
 Reduce practice 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.179
 who does not quite clear the game 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.549
 ever given away as a precaution the most serious difference is Bern 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.549
 controls Munich, of course 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.959
 when you get hit 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.709
 LG Marianne Rome blown back completely satisfied 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.419
 register per month 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.849
 yes, a small amount of time 2 1 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.759
 «To catch him again 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.759
 see you stepping out soon take off 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.369
 and again from epd 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.169
 So you can get one 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.169
 and use the loudest ones to watch them 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:00.589
 with a shake of the head 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.159
 whatever you do is tethered 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.419
 We will have to look for one hundred percent on the tiles 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:13.970
 this reacted 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.189
 deny it 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.259
 to know this 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:19.829
 Lira a bit different from the normal 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 "When one looks at opponents or throws 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.439
 wanted flying question marks 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.539
 then you get a red cap 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.309
 the red caps are important for me personally to communicate 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.049
 "I have reached Uwe percent 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.909
 here it is 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.399
 Hambrock 30 small stones 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.399
 20 clock measured which are more or less hidden 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.029
 Percent or disguised as normal people 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.739
 which additionally give a life 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.790
 All together, you get one hundred percent you have everything in one live 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.790
 seen 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.809
 the show "Van the Man" darling 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:17.299
 for Wednesday is by red 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.299
 a red scarf 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.740
 such an upper limit 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.490
 there was, for example, a reinforced one 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.240
 only the first warning 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.490
 o2 Mobile Move remains to happen 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.650
 but one 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.650
 Car Joschi 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.479
 Reason for the next turn 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.689
 pretty loud 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.689
 is not fun 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.659
 Red Bull Salzburg 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.659
 shocked 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.069
 there are already here 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.230
 you can Dr 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.449
 Subject overwritten 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.110
 but maybe we have been determined 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.180
 to calculate specifically 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.180
 Graham McTavish 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.069
 and British model is off 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.339
 "I know that I come only with the caliber 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.339
 but at the beginning I have disappeared in life because I said Schäuble 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.289
 also no more fires out there to express that 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.259
 press box checkers expected 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.259
 the blonde took you off 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.710
 Competition no idea 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.629
 Heike Biskup connection or her here 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:22.110
 two of the flames 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.729
 Fantastic most do have one 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.389
 Mixed 0 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.389
 There the tests would be realized 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:35.469
 30 journalists will not let up 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.619
 I have everything 

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:46.710
 wonderful 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.710
 100 percent whether to the finish 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:54.649
 that you are still pretty easy 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:58.399
 nevertheless seem 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.539
 let's see what will happen 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:03.779
 the politics do not live 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:06.779
 when you start in this game 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.050
 what should life be like 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.300
 pretty much the same 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.300
 Every life is valuable 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.869
 journey 

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:26.869
 we want 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.180
 horror 

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:37.069
 because there are more people 

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:40.229
 would not be the first video 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:41.569
 and see you in the second
