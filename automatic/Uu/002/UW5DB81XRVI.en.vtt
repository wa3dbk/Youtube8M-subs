00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
great this season already in the first

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.530 
great this season already in the first
few<00:02:22.930> games<00:02:23.170> but<00:02:23.950> yeah<00:02:24.160> last<00:02:24.489> season<00:02:24.970> I'm<00:02:25.390> not

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
few games but yeah last season I'm not

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.059 
few games but yeah last season I'm not
sure<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.780> haven't<00:02:26.020> looked<00:02:26.200> at<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.470> stats<00:02:26.709> but

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
sure I haven't looked at the stats but

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.710 
sure I haven't looked at the stats but
last<00:02:27.640> season<00:02:27.850> I'm<00:02:28.180> pretty<00:02:28.420> sure<00:02:28.569> he<00:02:28.660> was

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
last season I'm pretty sure he was

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.610 
last season I'm pretty sure he was
around<00:02:29.020> like<00:02:29.260> 25<00:02:29.860> points<00:02:30.370> for<00:02:30.550> per<00:02:31.450> game<00:02:31.720> but

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
around like 25 points for per game but

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.740 
around like 25 points for per game but
they<00:02:32.739> are<00:02:32.920> somewhat<00:02:33.489> similar<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.510> feel

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
they are somewhat similar and I feel

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.509 
they are somewhat similar and I feel
like<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.050> can<00:02:35.530> compare<00:02:35.890> these<00:02:36.100> two<00:02:36.250> players

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
like you can compare these two players

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.920 
like you can compare these two players
um<00:02:37.209> not<00:02:38.170> based<00:02:38.530> off<00:02:38.800> on<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.580> real<00:02:39.819> NBA<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:40.360> I'm

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
trying to that's what I wanted a

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.300 
trying to that's what I wanted a
challenge<00:03:37.239> is<00:03:37.630> because<00:03:38.380> they're<00:03:38.590> both<00:03:38.920> very

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
challenge is because they're both very

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.990 
challenge is because they're both very
very<00:03:39.670> similar<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.299> 2k14<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.370> not<00:03:42.640> not<00:03:42.970> really

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
very similar in 2k14 and not not really

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.699 
very similar in 2k14 and not not really
in<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.390> NBA<00:03:43.840> they're<00:03:44.230> totally<00:03:44.680> different

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
in the NBA they're totally different

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.860 
in the NBA they're totally different
players<00:03:45.220> in

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
players in

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.860 
players in
but<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:46.920> my<00:03:46.950> team's<00:03:47.580> just<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.390> opponents<00:03:48.780> I

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
but in my team's just the opponents I

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.759 
but in my team's just the opponents I
faced<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:50.310> also<00:03:50.909> in<00:03:51.030> my<00:03:51.209> experiences<00:03:52.019> Kevin

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
faced and also in my experiences Kevin

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.830 
faced and also in my experiences Kevin
Durant<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.159> Paul<00:03:53.400> George<00:03:53.700> they<00:03:54.239> just<00:03:54.450> score

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
Durant and Paul George they just score

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.750 
Durant and Paul George they just score
similars<00:03:55.470> they<00:03:55.860> have<00:03:55.980> similar<00:03:56.190> scoring

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
similars they have similar scoring

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.910 
similars they have similar scoring
styles<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:57.930> that's<00:03:58.080> why<00:03:58.230> would<00:03:58.409> have<00:03:58.500> compared

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
styles so that's why would have compared

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.339 
styles so that's why would have compared
these<00:03:59.159> two<00:03:59.400> players<00:03:59.810> because<00:04:00.810> i<00:04:00.989> feel<00:04:01.319> that

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
these two players because i feel that

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.490 
these two players because i feel that
actually<00:04:01.890> Paul<00:04:02.190> George<00:04:02.750> well<00:04:03.750> part<00:04:04.079> Paul

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
George has an 88 overall in this game

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.190 
George has an 88 overall in this game
and<00:04:07.260> Kevin<00:04:07.980> Durant<00:04:08.069> has<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.400> 94<00:04:09.060> overall<00:04:09.599> it's

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.229 
and Kevin Durant has a 94 overall it's
just<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.709> my<00:04:10.739> team<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.549> just<00:04:11.760> doesn't<00:04:11.940> feel

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
just in my team it just doesn't feel

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.960 
just in my team it just doesn't feel
like<00:04:12.450> kevin<00:04:12.870> durant<00:04:13.200> has<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.069> feels<00:04:14.640> like<00:04:14.790> the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
like kevin durant has it feels like the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.300 
like kevin durant has it feels like the
opposite<00:04:15.329> feels<00:04:15.540> like<00:04:15.659> Paul<00:04:15.900> George<00:04:16.320> has<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.680> 94

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
opposite feels like Paul George has a 94

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.550 
opposite feels like Paul George has a 94
all<00:04:17.459> over<00:04:17.940> all<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.600> Kevin<00:04:18.989> Durant's<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.410> guy

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
all over all and Kevin Durant's the guy

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.189 
all over all and Kevin Durant's the guy
that<00:04:19.739> has<00:04:19.829> an<00:04:20.010> 88<00:04:20.760> overall<00:04:21.239> but<00:04:21.810> maybe<00:04:22.019> it's

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
that has an 88 overall but maybe it's

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.500 
that has an 88 overall but maybe it's
just<00:04:22.289> me<00:04:22.620> maybe<00:04:22.949> it's<00:04:23.100> just<00:04:23.220> some<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.850> mean<00:04:24.150> with

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
just me maybe it's just some I mean with

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.570 
just me maybe it's just some I mean with
Kevin<00:04:24.810> gray<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.229> this<00:04:25.440> game<00:04:25.740> look<00:04:26.370> at<00:04:26.490> that

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
Kevin gray in this game look at that

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.189 
Kevin gray in this game look at that
right<00:04:26.789> there<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:27.030> don't<00:04:27.389> know<00:04:27.479> what's<00:04:27.750> going<00:04:28.110> on

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199

right there I don't know what's going on
I<00:04:28.470> just<00:04:29.039> really<00:04:29.400> think<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:29.820> Kevin<00:04:30.030> Durant

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
I just really think that Kevin Durant

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.969 
I just really think that Kevin Durant
should<00:04:30.539> be<00:04:30.600> making<00:04:30.780> more<00:04:31.169> of<00:04:31.229> his<00:04:31.440> shots<00:04:31.770> he's

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
should be making more of his shots he's

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.230 
should be making more of his shots he's
wide<00:04:32.370> open<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:33.090> mean<00:04:33.270> all<00:04:33.720> greens<00:04:34.410> wide<00:04:34.949> open<00:04:35.580> he

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
wide open I mean all greens wide open he

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.730 
wide open I mean all greens wide open he
should<00:04:36.479> have<00:04:36.600> made<00:04:36.630> that<00:04:36.810> shot<00:04:37.050> maybe<00:04:37.650> I

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
should have made that shot maybe I

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.529 
should have made that shot maybe I
should<00:04:37.979> have<00:04:38.070> drove<00:04:38.340> more<00:04:38.699> to<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.000> brim<00:04:39.240> with
