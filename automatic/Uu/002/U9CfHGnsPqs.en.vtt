00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.800
The ingineer and constructor Houl Moller

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.200
spend more than 75 million dollars

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.600
to make a reality his dreams

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
flying car it is a mashine 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.700
capable to solve multiple decisions

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.800
take off vertikal like a chopper

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.100
fly fast like a plane

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.100
and drive in a roads like an avto

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.800
in begining Moller concentrate his research

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.400
to take off vertikal

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.200
many poeople dont have aeroport 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.600
in a back streets

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.200
that why need to solve this problem

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.300
in research that question

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.900
Moller get cuple problems

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.300
hold balance in vertikal take off

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
became imposible for man

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000
no pilots can fast control engine

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500
in a both sides by holding them in balance

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.900
so that why Moller create 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.100
complex program maintenance

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.500
conected to control center 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.900
which can solve all problems

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.500
harrier already using same control program

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.400
but that aircraft Costs more expensively

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.700
100 thousands dollars

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.200
Moller believe his flying car 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.500
vill be not expensive

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.700
but tis is no only problem

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.700
to take off vertikal 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.500
Moller need more powerfull 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200
and not heavy engines 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.600
instead of aviation engines 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.300
hi midified small Venhels 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.200
rotor-piston engines  

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.900
with to mobile parts

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.700
they can move four mobile screws

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.700
wich can accept vertical position 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.200
for take off

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.300
and horisontal position to fly

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.500
and here is result of Some decades

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.700
of research and workings out

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.400
this is SkyCar Moller flying mashine 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.200
700 horse powers with 635 kilo of weight

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.200
The given car is capable to fly 480 km/h 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.700
but could hi realy take off

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.800
it did

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.500
for now Moller is necessary to solve problems

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.500
with flying and engine noises level

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.600
and Moller predict after 20 years

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.600
police and ambulance will use 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.600
exactly like that flying car
