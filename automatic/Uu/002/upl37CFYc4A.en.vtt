but<00:01:01.440> they're<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:01.800> ahead<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> ship

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
but they're going to go ahead and ship

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.099 
but they're going to go ahead and ship
this<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.789> about<00:01:02.879> two<00:01:03.270> weeks<00:01:03.300> anyway

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:04.109 
this in about two weeks anyway

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:06.889 
this in about two weeks anyway
now<00:01:04.889> I<00:01:04.949> only<00:01:05.159> used<00:01:05.399> it<00:01:05.609> for<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> few<00:01:06.060> seconds<00:01:06.779> a

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
now I only used it for a few seconds a

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.899 
now I only used it for a few seconds a
couple<00:01:07.229> minutes<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.619> most<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.609> found<00:01:08.819> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
couple minutes at most and I found that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.819 
couple minutes at most and I found that
the<00:01:09.029> keys<00:01:09.240> were<00:01:09.450> pretty<00:01:09.719> responsive<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.709> is<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
the keys were pretty responsive it is a

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.580 
the keys were pretty responsive it is a
little<00:01:11.159> bit<00:01:11.279> interesting<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.630> design<00:01:12.959> it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
little bit interesting of a design it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.050 
little bit interesting of a design it
definitely<00:01:14.039> feels<00:01:14.249> a<00:01:14.429> little<00:01:14.549> different

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
definitely feels a little different

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
definitely feels a little different
because<00:01:15.209> the<00:01:15.959> case<00:01:16.229> extends<00:01:16.979> beyond<00:01:17.249> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
because the case extends beyond the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
because the case extends beyond the
bottom<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.789> the<00:01:17.849> phone<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.509> even<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.929> keys<00:01:19.139> on

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
bottom of the phone and even the keys on

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.649 
bottom of the phone and even the keys on
the<00:01:19.529> side<00:01:19.709> extend<00:01:20.249> a<00:01:20.459> little<00:01:20.969> bit<00:01:21.179> beyond<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the side extend a little bit beyond the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
the side extend a little bit beyond the
side<00:01:21.929> of<00:01:22.079> the<00:01:22.200> phone<00:01:22.409> although<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.189> was

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
side of the phone although it was

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.980 
side of the phone although it was
responsive<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.029> found<00:01:24.209> that<00:01:24.329> I<00:01:24.359> wasn't<00:01:24.569> very

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
responsive I found that I wasn't very

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.139 
responsive I found that I wasn't very
accurate<00:01:25.380> typing<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.429> this<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.849> something

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
accurate typing but this is something

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.380 
accurate typing but this is something
that<00:01:27.179> I<00:01:27.329> assume

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
that I assume

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.300 
that I assume
you<00:01:28.659> or<00:01:28.960> me<00:01:28.990> or<00:01:29.140> anybody<00:01:29.320> else<00:01:29.710> would<00:01:30.130> grow
