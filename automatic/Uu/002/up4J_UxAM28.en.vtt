to<00:00:51.149> show<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.199> thread<00:00:52.440> path<00:00:52.679> a<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:53.039> bit

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
to show you the thread path a little bit

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.950 
to show you the thread path a little bit
more<00:00:53.460> easily<00:00:53.819> against<00:00:54.269> the<00:00:54.390> colors<00:00:54.719> but

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
more easily against the colors but

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.590 
more easily against the colors but
normally<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.409> would<00:00:55.710> use<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.210> similar<00:00:57.210> colored

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
normally you would use a similar colored

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.380 
normally you would use a similar colored
thread<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.260> crystal<00:00:58.949> colored<00:00:59.699> thread<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.359> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
thread or crystal colored thread so that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.500 
thread or crystal colored thread so that
you<00:01:00.690> cannot<00:01:01.229> see<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> thread<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.219> most<00:01:03.179> bead

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you cannot see the thread like most bead

you cannot see the thread like most bead
stitches<00:01:04.080> first<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> add<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
stitches first I'm going to add a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.710 
stitches first I'm going to add a
stopper<00:01:05.970> bead<00:01:06.260> leaving<00:01:07.260> about<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:08.070> six<00:01:08.880> to

eight<00:01:09.870> inch<00:01:10.170> tail<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> go<00:01:13.290> through<00:01:13.620> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
eight inch tail you go through the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.670 
eight inch tail you go through the
stopper<00:01:14.160> bead<00:01:14.370> and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.330> pass<00:01:16.020> through

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
stopper bead and then you pass through

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
stopper bead and then you pass through
it<00:01:18.260> one<00:01:19.260> more<00:01:19.290> time<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.980> that<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.490> keep<00:01:20.730> your

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
it one more time and that will keep your

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.230 
it one more time and that will keep your
bead<00:01:21.810> work<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.230> your<00:01:23.220> thread<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:24.180> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
them you're going to go back up through

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.680 
them you're going to go back up through
the<00:02:57.760> second<00:02:58.150> bead<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.690> second<00:02:59.080> row<00:03:00.690> pull

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
the second bead in the second row pull

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.320 
the second bead in the second row pull
tight

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
tight

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.740 
tight
now<00:03:04.330> you're<00:03:04.540> going<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.900> add<00:03:06.420> pick<00:03:07.420> up<00:03:07.540> one<00:03:07.720> more

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
now you're going to add pick up one more

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.600 
now you're going to add pick up one more
bead<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:10.350> then<00:03:11.350> you're<00:03:11.680> going<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.130> pass

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
bead and then you're going to pass

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.380 
bead and then you're going to pass
through<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.570> thread<00:03:15.030> between<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.910> next<00:03:19.150> two

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
through the thread between the next two

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:29.220 
through the thread between the next two
beads<00:03:20.380> in<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.830> base<00:03:21.010> row<00:03:24.810> go<00:03:25.810> back<00:03:26.730> up<00:03:28.230> through

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
beads in the base row go back up through

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.640 
beads in the base row go back up through
that<00:03:29.260> last<00:03:29.680> bead<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.250> added<00:03:30.519> add<00:03:31.650> one

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
that last bead that you added add one

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.949 
that last bead that you added add one
more<00:03:32.830> bead<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.430> you're<00:03:34.330> going<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.600> continue

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
more bead and you're going to continue

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:42.360 
more bead and you're going to continue
in<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:35.320> manner<00:03:35.380> until<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.459> have<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.950> second

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
in this manner until you have the second

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.610 
in this manner until you have the second
row<00:03:42.519> completed<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.840> can<00:03:43.870> flip<00:03:44.260> your<00:03:44.380> beadwork

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
row completed you can flip your beadwork

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.710 
row completed you can flip your beadwork
again<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.400> start<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.180> you're<00:03:46.299> always<00:03:46.450> working

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
again and start so you're always working

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.330 
again and start so you're always working
in<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.049> same<00:03:47.200> direction<00:03:47.260> basically<00:03:50.160> now<00:03:51.160> as

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
in the same direction basically now as

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.229 
in the same direction basically now as
you<00:03:51.519> can<00:03:51.640> tell<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:52.180> think<00:03:53.110> that<00:03:53.790> most<00:03:54.790> people

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
you can tell I think that most people

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.580 
you can tell I think that most people
would<00:03:55.360> agree<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:55.989> would<00:03:56.080> be<00:03:56.230> easy<00:03:56.440> to

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
would agree that it would be easy to

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.690 
would agree that it would be easy to
just<00:03:56.950> decrease<00:03:57.489> this<00:03:57.760> stitch<00:03:58.860> by<00:03:59.860> completing

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
just decrease this stitch by completing

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.390 
just decrease this stitch by completing
the<00:04:01.180> next<00:04:01.480> row<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:02.080> way<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.440> we<00:04:02.620> did<00:04:02.769> that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
the next row the way that we did that

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.030 
the next row the way that we did that
row<00:04:03.730> in<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.090> row<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:05.170> would<00:04:05.320> gradually

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
row in that row and it would gradually

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.490 
row in that row and it would gradually
get<00:04:06.370> smaller<00:04:06.400> like<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.269> pyramid<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:11.170> if<00:04:11.290> that's

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
get smaller like a pyramid so if that's

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.890 
get smaller like a pyramid so if that's
what<00:04:11.739> you<00:04:11.920> want<00:04:12.130> then<00:04:12.579> that<00:04:12.910> is<00:04:13.209> very<00:04:13.269> easy<00:04:13.660> to

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
what you want then that is very easy to

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.560 
what you want then that is very easy to
do<00:04:14.049> but<00:04:14.290> if<00:04:14.410> that's<00:04:14.530> not<00:04:14.680> what<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:15.100> want<00:04:15.570> then

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
do but if that's not what you want then

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.249 
do but if that's not what you want then
what<00:04:16.780> you're<00:04:16.930> going<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.200> do

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:20.259 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.060 

pick<00:04:21.259> up<00:04:21.470> two<00:04:22.310> beads<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.820> your<00:04:22.850> third<00:04:23.240> row<00:04:23.270> and

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
pick up two beads of your third row and

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:34.510 
pick up two beads of your third row and
this<00:04:25.070> time<00:04:26.350> you're<00:04:27.350> going<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.620> go<00:04:29.590> through<00:04:33.520> the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
this time you're going to go through the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.270 
this time you're going to go through the
last<00:04:34.729> bead<00:04:35.030> in<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.270> previous<00:04:35.780> row<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:37.000> also

through the thread between the first two
beads<00:04:49.970> in<00:04:50.270> your<00:04:50.330> base<00:04:50.900> row<00:04:51.699> you're<00:04:52.699> going<00:04:52.820> to

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
beads in your base row you're going to

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.390 
beads in your base row you're going to
pull<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.180> tight<00:04:54.039> then<00:04:55.039> go<00:04:55.310> up<00:04:57.370> through<00:04:58.370> the

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
pull that tight then go up through the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.920 
pull that tight then go up through the
last<00:04:58.520> bead<00:04:59.620> of<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:01.850> second<00:05:02.300> row<00:05:03.850> up<00:05:04.930> through

and then back up through that second
bead<00:05:31.520> and<00:05:31.729> that's<00:05:31.910> how<00:05:32.090> you<00:05:32.150> begin<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:33.110> third

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
bead and that's how you begin the third

bead and that's how you begin the third
row<00:05:34.250> and<00:05:34.630> then<00:05:35.630> from<00:05:35.960> there<00:05:36.199> on<00:05:36.229> you're<00:05:36.740> going

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.089 
to do is you're going to add the bead
you<00:05:56.270> can<00:05:58.060> put<00:05:59.060> it<00:05:59.150> into<00:05:59.270> place<00:05:59.570> if<00:05:59.780> you'd<00:05:59.900> like

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
you can put it into place if you'd like

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:06.159 
you can put it into place if you'd like
but<00:06:01.099> you<00:06:01.280> need<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.550> go<00:06:03.760> pass<00:06:04.760> your<00:06:05.030> needle<00:06:05.780> down

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
but you need to go pass your needle down

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:11.610 
but you need to go pass your needle down
through<00:06:07.010> the<00:06:07.789> last<00:06:08.150> bead<00:06:08.419> in<00:06:08.930> the<00:06:09.139> second<00:06:09.560> row

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
through the last bead in the second row

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.689 
through the last bead in the second row
and<00:06:12.620> then<00:06:13.010> this<00:06:13.159> is<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.490> tricky<00:06:13.880> part

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
and then this is the tricky part

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.320 
and then this is the tricky part
you're<00:06:16.699> going<00:06:16.940> to<00:06:17.120> pass<00:06:17.389> it<00:06:19.000> underneath<00:06:20.000> the

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
you're going to pass it underneath the

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.020 
you're going to pass it underneath the
thread<00:06:21.430> connecting<00:06:22.479> the<00:06:23.479> last<00:06:23.840> two<00:06:24.260> beads<00:06:24.590> of

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
thread connecting the last two beads of

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.399 
thread connecting the last two beads of
the<00:06:26.030> base<00:06:26.240> row<00:06:26.570> and<00:06:27.159> then<00:06:28.930> back<00:06:29.930> up<00:06:29.960> through

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:30.409 
the base row and then back up through

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:31.990 
the base row and then back up through
the<00:06:30.500> layers<00:06:30.680> back<00:06:31.159> up<00:06:31.400> through

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
the layers back up through

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.200 
the layers back up through
oh<00:06:33.910> the<00:06:34.910> last<00:06:35.120> bead<00:06:35.480> of<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:36.200> second<00:06:36.950> row<00:06:37.100> and

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
the last bead of the first row to

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.410 
the last bead of the first row to
tighten<00:06:52.010> that<00:06:52.100> stitch<00:06:52.430> up<00:06:55.180> you're<00:06:56.180> going<00:06:56.360> to

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:56.420 
tighten that stitch up you're going to

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.010 
tighten that stitch up you're going to
go<00:06:56.540> back<00:06:57.400> through<00:06:58.400> those<00:06:58.580> last<00:06:59.000> two<00:06:59.300> beads<00:06:59.690> of

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
go back through those last two beads of

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.470 
go back through those last two beads of
the<00:07:00.560> last<00:07:00.800> row<00:07:00.980> once<00:07:01.250> again<00:07:04.090> so<00:07:05.090> as<00:07:05.180> you<00:07:05.330> can

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 
the last row once again so as you can

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.730 
the last row once again so as you can
