the<00:00:53.969> steering<00:00:54.620> pull<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> back<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> bit<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.430> here

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the steering pull it back a bit up here

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.689 
the steering pull it back a bit up here
is<00:00:56.699> way<00:00:56.850> too<00:00:56.910> far<00:00:57.270> from<00:00:57.590> pull<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> back<00:00:58.859> keeping

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
is way too far from pull it back keeping

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.310 
is way too far from pull it back keeping
figure<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.270> some<00:01:00.480> steering<00:01:00.780> how<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
figure out some steering how to get it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.729 
figure out some steering how to get it
to<00:01:01.350> work<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.129> stuff<00:01:02.340> i<00:01:02.460> did<00:01:02.640> today<00:01:03.500> flux<00:01:04.500> core

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
to work the stuff i did today flux core

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.350 
to work the stuff i did today flux core
is<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> best<00:01:05.280> thing<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.700> still<00:01:06.180> works

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
is not the best thing but still works

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.399 
is not the best thing but still works
it's<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.950> messy<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.369> who<00:01:08.880> cares<00:01:09.090> right

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
it's a little messy but who cares right

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.440 
it's a little messy but who cares right
so<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.530> got<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> front<00:01:10.890> end<00:01:11.150> situated<00:01:12.150> all

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so we got the front end situated all

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
so we got the front end situated all
nicely<00:01:12.920> in<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.610> i<00:01:14.700> got<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.880> figure<00:01:15.060> out

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
nicely in there and i got to figure out

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
nicely in there and i got to figure out
the<00:01:15.270> steering<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.520> guess<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.610> could<00:01:17.729> throw

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the steering and I guess I could throw

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.249 
the steering and I guess I could throw
battery<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> thing<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.689> her<00:01:18.810> just

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
battery the thing you think of her just

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010 
battery the thing you think of her just
puttering<00:01:20.009> away<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.780> skip<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> whole

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
puttering away here skip the whole

puttering away here skip the whole
crapload<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.590> steps<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.159> remember<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
crapload of steps but remember that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.289 
crapload of steps but remember that
