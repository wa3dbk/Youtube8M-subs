00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello girls I wish you one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.480
 beautiful mornings morning early 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.280
 at least it is with me 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.320
 I think when you see the video 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.330
 It is probably already afternoon 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.809
 However, I have something for you today 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.480
 very special and a cosmetic 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.670
 yourself instructions, so to speak 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.949
 I have a lip balm myself 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.600
 that looks like this and that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.920
 you can easily copy her 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.689
 It does not need many at all 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.090
 ingredients as I said I have it all 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.980
 spontaneously decided and had everything 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.140
 but at home, of course, the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.239
 I have not had any dishes now 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.730
 I just have a trial like that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.160
 taken and from my concealer of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.879
 Patrice I washed out 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.800
 empty goods there have all this year 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.450
 filled product lines it really is 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.370
 very handy and you can do that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.020
 Of course, individualize by 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.579
 we are still doing something or that 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.770
 nicely packed and then a friend 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.930
 given away depending on how much of it 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.910
 and otherwise, of course, too 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 Creativity does not limit yourself 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.899
 make everything there can freely what you 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.040
 you want to be able to determine the oil yourself 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.200
 Of course I have a lot now 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.909
 I have to say that intense oil is there 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.189
 you can taste it would be a 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.710
 a bit out that taste very much 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.240
 Herpes and I'll get there you can 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.500
 of course I've vary 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.180
 quite a few different types of honey 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.979
 at home and there I have mine 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.780
 chooses honey and next to it 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.610
 North Rhine made and that tastes 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.520
 really good on the lips and the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.350
 lip color or you can also sarah 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.450
 determine by simply one 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.790
 different colored lipstick reinmacht 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.009
 or of course completely completely 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.930
 omits and I would say to the celebration 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.670
 of the day just start with 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.920
 the video and I'll explain you briefly how 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 the whole thing is the first thing you should do 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.670
 you a heat resistant bowl 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.049
 take in cooking afterwards 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.509
 enter hot water 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.670
 A little blackboard is a blackboard 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.290
 now a espresso cup and then 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.210
 you really only need Vaseline 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.650
 there you take depending on feeling 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.510
 or you should 2 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.150
 take the spoon vaseline you can do that 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.350
 here under reduce or like him 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.480
 it just wants to be in proportion to it 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.009
 screw on top or screw down 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.080
 I have now finally down 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.120
 screwed and then you need 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.280
 actually only your honey of choice 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.920
 and then you should of course still that 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.690
 Oil there is actually no matter what 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.430
 you for an oil that it already has to be 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.090
 Body care oil be it one 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.180
 almond oil or rose oil depending on what 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.550
 you have at home and otherwise either 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.920
 a lipstick a color of your choice 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.890
 then you can take it or you leave it 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.760
 lipstick completely off my white 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.920
 scrapped and that's why he sees 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.110
 bit demolished but he has 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.310
 I fulfilled my purpose then 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.230
 Of course, two more 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.870
 the one search was one period 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.910
 and the other was my patrice 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.459
 concealer all gone and there 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.930
 I just have the product in the box 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.120
 and as a small treat, so to speak 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.400
 I still have a stone there 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.810
 purely given in my presence then 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.090
 I would enjoy it every time 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.190
 when I open it all up and 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.750
 On my lips would be that one now the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.820
 Of course , ingredients were needed 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.830
 a spoon and then the whole thing goes 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.170
 Actually, you're already starting 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.269
 you boil the water be it with 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.580
 a kettle or in a pot 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.170
 that does not really matter and then give 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.060
 her the hot water in the bowl 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.090
 of course you should have the blackboard first 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.060
 Put it in and then give it first 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.830
 the height of the body into the cup afterwards 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.540
 you then do the berliner there 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.150
 should you as I said two teaspoons 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.940
 Take a teaspoon of the body oil 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.459
 and then it continues with the honey there 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.290
 take her on a teaspoon and close 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.420
 Good last you take then 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.549
 a bit of your pen there 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.319
 Of course, they also vary how you do that 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.879
 like so I want to have now yes i 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.859
 believe the half of the lipstick 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.719
 cut off and then it works 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.700
 everything already touches the whole thing 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:54.579
 so long until the mass is homogeneous it 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.030
 is called until she has a consistency 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.129
 so to speak and if that's the case 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.099
 then you take that of course your cup 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.049
 and has felt in your cups and 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.939
 the whole load you cool off and 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.560
 it was actually already are 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.359
 you finished and you can finish 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.519
 Of course I still like a little one 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.549
 Put in stone or leave the whole thing 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.959
 and then you're done that's how it looks 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.519
 It could all look finished then 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.320
 Of course we still pack this 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.380
 we want to give it away for 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.400
 your friends or for grandmas or grandpa 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.009
 depending on 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.349
 and otherwise I just have to 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.870
 say or ask as he does the whole thing 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.669
 because you found if you already know this idea 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.620
 surely some of them can do it 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.150
 I thought it was very nice though 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.979
 to do it because it is somehow 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.259
 something personal like me 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.720
 and if you want me even more 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.210
 Such cosmetic do it yourself 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.740
 do things then just give me one 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.380
 thumbs up maybe I'm thinking 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.590
 something fancier or looking for 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.539
 something fancier and then you will 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.099
 Have a nice monday far 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.099
 hardworking and see you tomorrow
