00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.830
 we have already done an experiment with 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.290
 in fact we showed you this 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.420
 the photo on facebook and in many me 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.130

 now I leave you the tutorial bye then 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.959
 first we apply a base 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.459
 I have already applied this transparent 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.260
 just to protect the nails then 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.150
 from the enamels from the enamel of the beads 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.130
 you understand later when the base 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.040
 transparent dried out I take mine 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.780
 who do you like our kit take off the 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.760
 cover I leave him nearby because 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.549
 in a while we will need then you will see 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.780
 meanwhile I take this pink nail polish 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.180
 pastel product to apply the enamel 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.840
 pink on all nails in the meantime I do 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.840
 a pass 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.170
 ok now let's wait for this first 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.000
 pass it dry completely ok 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.650
 over the completely dry glaze 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.350
 we can continue now I want 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.410
 take the lid we put on 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.020
 first I turn it upside down and keep it 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.120
 here because then I'll work on it when 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.460
 I'll go pour the beads I'll do it 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.770
 precisely above so that then all 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.560
 the beads go and end up inside 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.460
 in order not to waste them now I go to work in 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.350
 via nail I go to get the nail polish 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.520
 that we have just applied step one 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.800
 second pass on the nail remember 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.990
 that you don't have to be precise when 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.660
 apply this enamel because then not 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.970
 we will see that we are going to pour ourselves 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.030
 the balls above this point I take 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.150
 mine for linear I go when the enamel 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:03.789
 still fresh to pour a lot of super 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:10.180
 give now let's remove the excess then 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:13.539
 gently I go to press them so 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.220
 that stick better and the enamel 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.860
 now we do the same thing with all the 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:22.050
 other nails then we pour super le 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.050
 our hills 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.389
 but that excess and then the near 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.389
 gently only mine 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.789
 now we just have to wait for one 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.129
 fifteen minutes for everything to be 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.840
 well dried well well and then I'll do it 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.240
 see how I will apply the top coat 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.819
 in the meantime I take the mini mute that 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.110
 you have seen before and I insert it in the 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:05.550
 bottle with the beads and I go to pour 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.550
 all the balls in the bottle 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.919
 so that they are not wasted are 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.409
 fifteen minutes then now 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.389
 I can go and get my touch 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.789
 transparent and spread it on the nails here 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.129
 but I'm not going to spread it over the whole 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:33.819
 length of the nail but only on the 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:35.740
 tips of no girls this was the 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.539
 caviar hands 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.800
 let me know what you think though 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.870
 I know that lots of people are coming 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.969
 they knew is above all remember 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.310
 that you don't have to take this 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:47.409
 kit to have a similar result 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.380
 there are lots of beads 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:53.229
 similar on ebay of the same size 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.389
 you can also create your own imagination 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:57.039
 then mixing of balls with beads 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.880
 of it calls the beads beads of the 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:00.279
 different colors 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.080
 so give yourself a little and nothing 

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:04.630
 big induction boy away very early 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.199
