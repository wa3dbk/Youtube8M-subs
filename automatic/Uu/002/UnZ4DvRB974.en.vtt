00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
hard these are pretty tough they're not

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.279 
hard these are pretty tough they're not
like<00:04:26.880> soft<00:04:27.300> like<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.750> shells<00:04:28.020> are<00:04:28.289> so<00:04:30.199> here<00:04:31.199> it

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
like soft like the shells are so here it

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:41.340 
like soft like the shells are so here it
goes

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.140 

sometimes<00:04:42.350> it<00:04:42.530> shoots<00:04:42.830> out<00:04:43.070> that's<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.970> only

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
sometimes it shoots out that's the only

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.090 
sometimes it shoots out that's the only
problem<00:04:44.389> but<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:46.570> first<00:04:47.570> pass<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.830> just

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
problem but so first pass it just

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.680 
problem but so first pass it just
chipped<00:04:49.430> off<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.790> end<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:50.570> the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
chipped off the end of it this is the

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.879 
chipped off the end of it this is the
little<00:04:50.840> piece<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.139> came<00:04:51.590> off

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.830 

all<00:04:54.889> right<00:04:55.010> so<00:04:55.340> I'll<00:04:55.699> keep<00:04:56.060> shredding<00:04:56.510> it<00:04:56.630> some

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
all right so I'll keep shredding it some

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.050 
all right so I'll keep shredding it some
more<00:04:57.050> until<00:04:57.590> it's<00:04:57.889> pretty<00:04:58.370> sure<00:04:58.610> it's<00:04:58.880> pretty

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
more until it's pretty sure it's pretty

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:13.360 
more until it's pretty sure it's pretty
ground<00:04:59.360> up

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.490 

jumped<00:05:14.090> out<00:05:14.180> again<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:15.639> have<00:05:16.639> to<00:05:17.020> fix<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.260> gear

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
jumped out again I have to fix the gear

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.610 
jumped out again I have to fix the gear
on<00:05:18.530> this<00:05:18.920> alright

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
on this alright

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.530 
on this alright
so<00:05:21.620> jumped<00:05:22.070> out<00:05:22.190> again<00:05:22.520> so<00:05:22.820> I'll<00:05:23.180> just<00:05:23.330> keep

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
so jumped out again so I'll just keep

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:35.230 
so jumped out again so I'll just keep
shutting<00:05:23.900> it<00:05:24.080> for<00:05:24.320> now<00:05:29.410> well<00:05:30.520> I<00:05:34.120> don't<00:05:35.120> know

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
shutting it for now well I don't know

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.970 
shutting it for now well I don't know
where<00:05:35.480> the<00:05:35.630> rest<00:05:35.780> of<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.169> we'll<00:05:36.380> only<00:05:36.560> found

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
where the rest of that we'll only found

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.940 
where the rest of that we'll only found
one<00:05:37.730> piece

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.909 

I<00:05:42.950> don't<00:05:43.250> have<00:05:43.340> to<00:05:43.490> find<00:05:43.700> the<00:05:43.820> other<00:05:43.970> piece

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:57.670 

somewhere<00:05:48.919> in<00:05:49.070> here<00:05:49.400> okay<00:05:56.110> yeah<00:05:57.110> sometimes

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
somewhere in here okay yeah sometimes

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.890 
somewhere in here okay yeah sometimes
also<00:05:57.919> shoot<00:05:58.280> at<00:05:58.400> a<00:05:58.430> lot<00:05:58.730> I<00:05:59.090> don't<00:05:59.419> know<00:05:59.630> if<00:05:59.750> I

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
also shoot at a lot I don't know if I

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.860 
also shoot at a lot I don't know if I
I'm<00:06:00.080> short<00:06:00.440> it<00:06:00.590> with<00:06:00.710> my<00:06:00.950> um<00:06:01.360> my<00:06:02.360> second

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
I'm short it with my um my second

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.240 
I'm short it with my um my second
shutter<00:06:03.080> which<00:06:03.290> is<00:06:03.440> basically<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:04.040> same

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
shutter which is basically the same

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.030 
shutter which is basically the same
thing<00:06:04.550> as<00:06:04.729> this<00:06:04.910> is<00:06:05.120> either<00:06:05.630> like<00:06:05.930> a<00:06:06.110> safety

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
thing as this is either like a safety

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.180 
thing as this is either like a safety
cage<00:06:07.250> sort<00:06:07.580> of<00:06:07.760> sort<00:06:08.450> of<00:06:08.570> so<00:06:08.840> long<00:06:09.050> if<00:06:09.710> you<00:06:09.950> can

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
cage sort of sort of so long if you can

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.610 
cage sort of sort of so long if you can
put<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:10.430> in<00:06:10.580> it<00:06:10.760> has<00:06:10.910> a<00:06:10.940> special<00:06:11.600> flap<00:06:11.840> in<00:06:12.110> front

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
put it in it has a special flap in front

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.150 
put it in it has a special flap in front
so<00:06:13.160> if<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.400> material<00:06:13.580> gets<00:06:14.210> bounced<00:06:15.200> up<00:06:15.380> or<00:06:15.620> if

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
so if the material gets bounced up or if

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.040 
so if the material gets bounced up or if
it<00:06:16.340> like<00:06:16.520> kind<00:06:16.940> of<00:06:17.000> shoots<00:06:17.240> out<00:06:17.450> it'll<00:06:17.840> stay

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
it like kind of shoots out it'll stay

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.730 
it like kind of shoots out it'll stay
inside<00:06:18.410> the<00:06:18.590> shredder<00:06:18.860> so<00:06:19.190> I<00:06:19.400> might<00:06:19.970> build<00:06:20.360> uh

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
inside the shredder so I might build uh

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.980 
inside the shredder so I might build uh
another<00:06:21.740> hopper<00:06:22.220> for<00:06:22.430> that<00:06:22.610> so<00:06:23.000> this<00:06:23.660> is<00:06:23.840> what

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
another hopper for that so this is what

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.360 
another hopper for that so this is what
happened<00:06:24.350> to<00:06:24.470> it<00:06:25.780> big<00:06:26.780> chunk<00:06:27.620> taken<00:06:27.979> off<00:06:28.070> of<00:06:28.100> it

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
happened to it big chunk taken off of it

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.940 
happened to it big chunk taken off of it
and<00:06:29.000> I've<00:06:29.090> shredded<00:06:29.419> these<00:06:29.750> peanuts<00:06:30.470> before

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
and I've shredded these peanuts before

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.950 
and I've shredded these peanuts before
to<00:06:31.550> where<00:06:31.729> they're<00:06:32.030> ground<00:06:32.300> up<00:06:32.479> into<00:06:32.720> about

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
to where they're ground up into about

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.469 
to where they're ground up into about
these<00:06:33.440> size<00:06:33.710> pieces<00:06:34.039> so<00:06:35.200> yeah<00:06:36.200> this<00:06:36.350> is<00:06:36.590> a<00:06:36.620> very

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
these size pieces so yeah this is a very

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.710 
these size pieces so yeah this is a very
efficient<00:06:38.479> shredder<00:06:38.860> and<00:06:39.860> I<00:06:40.010> I<00:06:40.460> won't<00:06:41.360> be

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
efficient shredder and I I won't be

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.990 
efficient shredder and I I won't be
taking<00:06:42.140> this<00:06:42.229> apart<00:06:42.560> for<00:06:42.830> a<00:06:42.860> long<00:06:43.100> time<00:06:43.370> unless

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
taking this apart for a long time unless

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.960 
taking this apart for a long time unless
I<00:06:44.270> drop<00:06:44.570> it<00:06:44.780> or<00:06:44.930> it<00:06:45.169> breaks<00:06:45.500> now<00:06:46.400> sure<00:06:46.669> I<00:06:46.700> did

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
I drop it or it breaks now sure I did

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.690 
I drop it or it breaks now sure I did
drop<00:06:47.210> it<00:06:47.450> actually<00:06:47.900> I<00:06:48.050> was<00:06:48.700> downstairs

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
drop it actually I was downstairs

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.740
