up and you arrest them now this is a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.530 
up and you arrest them now this is a
different<00:04:08.730> feeling<00:04:08.910> from<00:04:09.150> your<00:04:09.329> main

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
different feeling from your main

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.659 
different feeling from your main

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
missions because most main missions are

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.550 
missions because most main missions are
just<00:04:11.849> investigation<00:04:12.630> with<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.870> shooting<00:04:13.290> scene

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
here and there but with sign missions

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.750 
here and there but with sign missions
even<00:04:16.650> though<00:04:16.739> they<00:04:16.889> are<00:04:17.099> shorter<00:04:17.489> than<00:04:17.519> your

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
even though they are shorter than your

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.479 
even though they are shorter than your
main<00:04:17.940> missions<00:04:18.389> they<00:04:19.349> might<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.250> more

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
main missions they might be more

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.820 
main missions they might be more
exciting<00:04:21.090> based<00:04:21.359> on<00:04:21.599> the<00:04:21.930> shooting<00:04:22.289> aspect

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
exciting based on the shooting aspect

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.310 
exciting based on the shooting aspect
and<00:04:23.039> you<00:04:23.099> can

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
and you can

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.050 
and you can
always<00:04:23.530> expect<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.100> shooting<00:04:24.460> are<00:04:24.700> almost

your<00:04:27.190> side<00:04:27.400> missions<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.030> it's<00:04:28.150> just

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
your side missions and it's just

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.510 
your side missions and it's just
something<00:04:28.780> fun<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.080> do<00:04:29.260> primarily<00:04:30.160> when<00:04:30.370> you

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
something fun to do primarily when you

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.250 
something fun to do primarily when you
beat<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.150> game<00:04:31.360> or<00:04:31.720> you're<00:04:31.960> just<00:04:31.990> getting

beat the game or you're just getting

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.530 
beat the game or you're just getting
bored<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.220> main<00:04:33.520> missions<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.240> the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
bored of the main missions and the

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.060 
bored of the main missions and the
investigation<00:04:35.230> part<00:04:35.470> of<00:04:35.560> it

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
investigation part of it

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.580 
investigation part of it
the<00:04:36.850> next<00:04:37.120> thing<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.390> talk<00:04:37.600> about<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.930> free<00:04:38.380> room

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
the next thing to talk about a free room

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.500 
the next thing to talk about a free room
is<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.190> cannot<00:04:39.550> choose<00:04:39.760> whip<00:04:40.060> out<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.240> gun

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
is that you cannot choose whip out a gun

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.940 
is that you cannot choose whip out a gun
whenever<00:04:40.870> you're<00:04:41.050> walking<00:04:41.230> around<00:04:41.740> or

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
whenever you're walking around or

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.250 
whenever you're walking around or
driving<00:04:42.220> around<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:43.660> reason<00:04:43.960> for<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.200> is

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
driving around the reason for this is

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.870 
driving around the reason for this is
because<00:04:44.410> Rockstar<00:04:45.160> didn't<00:04:45.370> wanted<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.700> make

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
because Rockstar didn't wanted to make

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.540 
because Rockstar didn't wanted to make
another<00:04:46.180> killing<00:04:46.740> spree<00:04:47.740> like<00:04:48.250> Grand<00:04:48.520> Theft

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
another killing spree like Grand Theft

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.780 
another killing spree like Grand Theft
Auto<00:04:48.820> was<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.990> are<00:04:50.200> a<00:04:50.470> detective<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.640> are

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
Auto was you are a detective and you are

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.220 
Auto was you are a detective and you are
the<00:04:51.940> good<00:04:52.150> guy<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.480> they<00:04:52.660> want<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.900> keep<00:04:53.080> it

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
the good guy and they want to keep it

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.830 
the good guy and they want to keep it
that<00:04:53.290> way<00:04:53.470> most<00:04:54.220> likely<00:04:54.700> if<00:04:54.880> they<00:04:54.910> were<00:04:55.090> to

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
that way most likely if they were to

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.870 
that way most likely if they were to
allow<00:04:56.020> us<00:04:56.230> to<00:04:56.440> use<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.680> gun<00:04:57.100> just<00:04:57.340> whenever<00:04:57.550> we

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
allow us to use a gun just whenever we

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.490 
allow us to use a gun just whenever we
wanted<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.390> we<00:04:58.750> would<00:04:58.930> kill<00:04:59.140> many<00:04:59.380> innocent

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
wanted to we would kill many innocent

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.740 
wanted to we would kill many innocent
people<00:04:59.920> and<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.430> would<00:05:00.520> just<00:05:00.730> take<00:05:00.910> away<00:05:01.090> the

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
people and it would just take away the

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.260 
people and it would just take away the
innocent<00:05:01.930> perspective<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:03.160> this<00:05:03.430> game<00:05:03.760> so

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
innocent perspective of this game so

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.540 
innocent perspective of this game so
that<00:05:04.480> is<00:05:04.660> why<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:04.900> cannot<00:05:05.350> use<00:05:05.590> guns<00:05:05.890> just

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
that is why you cannot use guns just

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.340 
that is why you cannot use guns just
whenever<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.150> want<00:05:07.390> you<00:05:07.720> can<00:05:07.990> run<00:05:08.200> over

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
whenever you want you can run over

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.270 
whenever you want you can run over
people<00:05:08.680> but<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.640> main<00:05:09.790> missions<00:05:10.180> you<00:05:10.330> will

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
people but in the main missions you will
