00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:11.730
 hello how are you welcome once again 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.130
 to my channel and today we are going to do one of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 the things that I like to use the most and are 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.630
 vinil we are going to do it in a very 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.980
 fast very cheap and very easy and if 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.980
 you want to learn how to do the following 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.570
 for this tutorial we're going to need a 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.180
 old solar or that you no longer use 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.140
 scissors and fabric adhesive we are going to 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.540
 start cutting the ground 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.000
 horizontally below the sleeves what 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.400
 let's cut to the end and then 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.190
 let's start cutting only one 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.260
 from the sides 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.090
 and then we're going to open it and we're not going to 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.719
 put on your head so that we have the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.129
 perfect measure for us when you 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.320
 measured baby catches a skewer of 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.390
 reference and then I started cutting from 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.750
 up there to have only the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.680
 piece of cloth that we need 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.230
 when we have the bit that 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.360
 we need we can double it in three or 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.790
 in four I folded it into three parts 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.380
 because it made me a lot easier but 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.080
 obviously you can double it in four 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.490
 parts if you want and that's how you should 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.530
 stay 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.540
 and then let's see how long 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.549
 we want to cut it because here we are going to 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.960
 cut as in the shape of a nice if 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.360
 you want you can take a beanie that already 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.460
 have reference and when I'm 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.960
 safe or sure where you want it 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.189
 cut you just have to start 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:36.170
 cut very carefully and that as well as 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.060
 it is then we will open it and we will remain 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.100
 like three or four if montaÃ±istas 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.890
 you speak in four then turn it over 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.780
 in such a way that we see the reverse and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.220
 we will put glue on the back 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.530
 remember that it has to be about the 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.020
 backwards because then we are going to turn it around and 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.020
 we will join it with the other edge of the fabric 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.799
 we will make sure it has been well 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.829
 stuck and then we will start to put 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.989
 glue on the mountains this step 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.489
 it's kind of hard to explain but it's 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.500
 super easy to do is easier 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.660
 true if they look at it but more or less the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.519
 idea is to put glue on all 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.290
 edges of the mountains but paste 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.830
 because with edges to the edges that are 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.260
 next to 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.420
 so that it remains as in the form 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.650
 of the tip of the vin and the way that the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.650
 pin and have at the end 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.440
 but if this is more or less the idea is 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.660
 paste all the tips so that in the end 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.470
 we stay like I'm showing it in 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.470
 these moments 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.950
 and when the mountains are stuck 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.350
 and dry we will take yarn flip we have 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.060
 we already have a new wine from a 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.160
 serum which may no longer used it or not 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.730
 We wanted or maybe even was 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.730
 from us 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.310
 but no 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.930
 I hope you liked it a lot

 today's video as the super re 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.129
