00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
not so private I guess we can take a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.369 
not so private I guess we can take a
walk<00:00:38.250> down<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.670> guess<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.690> let's<00:00:39.719> let's

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
walk down I guess and see so let's let's

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.479 
walk down I guess and see so let's let's
let's<00:00:40.680> figure<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.309> way<00:00:41.460> through<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.730> oh

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
let's figure out a way through this oh

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.990 
let's figure out a way through this oh
do<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.700> jungle<00:00:45.210> give<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> channel<00:00:47.000> no

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
do the jungle give you the channel no

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
do the jungle give you the channel no
look<00:00:48.210> there's<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.960> trail<00:00:49.200> how<00:00:49.440> convenient<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
look there's a trail how convenient I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.680 
look there's a trail how convenient I
walked<00:00:50.610> through<00:00:50.700> all<00:00:50.969> these<00:00:51.059> woods<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.600> in

here<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.870> guess<00:00:52.050> there's<00:00:52.199> apparently<00:00:52.410> there's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
here I guess there's apparently there's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.170 
here I guess there's apparently there's
an<00:00:52.890> easier<00:00:53.129> way<00:00:53.160> cuz<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.910> cleared

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
an easier way cuz this is all cleared
