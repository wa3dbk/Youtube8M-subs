because it's kind of inaccurate with

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.689 
because it's kind of inaccurate with
that<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.279> turn<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.519> put<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.850> 5<00:00:25.430> tablespoons<00:00:26.430> of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
tablespoons we're going to do that twice

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.840

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
so that probably be a good choice for

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.520

that<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> kettle<00:01:10.830> turn<00:01:11.549> all<00:01:11.759> those<00:01:14.240> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
that is the kettle turn all those and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:25.429 
that is the kettle turn all those and
we'll<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.540> how<00:01:15.659> much<00:01:15.780> she<00:01:15.899> makes<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> open<00:01:25.380> up

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:23.610 

and<00:01:52.039> I'm<00:01:52.310> thinking<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:52.850> up<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.179> lot<00:01:53.299> of<00:01:53.360> oil

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.670 

let's<00:02:24.620> top<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:24.920> off<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.489> have<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:25.819> open<00:02:26.180> up

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
let's top it off you have to open up

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.309 
let's top it off you have to open up
hopeful<00:02:27.680> thing<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.980> get<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.190> rest<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.549> it<00:02:28.700> off

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
hopeful thing to get the rest of it off

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.530 
hopeful thing to get the rest of it off
and<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.500> shut<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.769> you<00:02:31.670> do<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.150> spinner

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
and you shut that you do it spinner

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.400 
and you shut that you do it spinner
things<00:02:32.810> like<00:02:33.019> a<00:02:33.049> rotator<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:33.920> heater<00:02:34.519> off

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
things like a rotator and the heater off

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:49.470 
things like a rotator and the heater off
I'd<00:02:36.410> say<00:02:36.650> that's<00:02:36.799> done<00:02:37.810> yeah<00:02:39.819> of<00:02:40.819> course<00:02:41.980> Hey

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.100 

there<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.630> go

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
there you go

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.220 
there you go
so<00:02:51.740> you<00:02:51.830> can<00:02:51.950> do<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.100> couple<00:02:52.400> batches<00:02:53.230> before

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
so you can do a couple batches before

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.320 
so you can do a couple batches before
you<00:02:54.320> even<00:02:54.500> before<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.850> just<00:02:56.000> leave<00:02:56.180> it
