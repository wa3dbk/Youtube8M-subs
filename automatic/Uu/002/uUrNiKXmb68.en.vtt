00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello dear friends with you I am Yuri 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 axenov is a gameplay and today we 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.150
 look at the new game from the company 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.960
 electronics spa nuanced names 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.240
 Paradise 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.429
 that is, the paradise of minions about what we 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.560
 tells the background of the game allegedly 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.840
 the minions were cruising but 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.390
 then phil too much smeared 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.900
 tanning oil slide over his 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.820
 the ship's fault sank and all the minions 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.039
 thrown on a desert island and now 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.410
 force will need to equip this 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.020
 wild corner what do we need to be 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.300
 do as in any company a minin 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.860
 wait just the same is a farm 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.890
 we will need to build various 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.260
 tasks to mine kraft resources 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.899
 items of them and accordingly 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.969
 perform tasks that will be us 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.940
 accordingly raise in level and 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.800
 allows us to discover new lands 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.140
 new buildings and a lot of interesting things 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.420
 the first thing you build on your island 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.129
 this bar is exactly in barry fell will 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.510
 work and from there you will come 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.559
 main tasks 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.500
 next you build a palm plantation 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.939
 gas swamps and also reed 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.460
 farms where you can mine 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.650
 related resources on coconut 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.310
 palm oh you can mine coconuts in 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.890
 reed 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.350
 forests you can mine reed well well 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.540
 gas swamps of course just gas 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.330
 There are two main currencies in the game 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.270
 this is the shells behind which you can build 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.810
 various buildings and stuff etc. 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.939
 and gold coins tokens and for these tokens 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.890
 you can do anything you want 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.680
 you can pay them you can 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.049
 speed up the process of working minions and so 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.810
 further at the beginning of your team just 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.030
 there will be 3 minions apart from fila but with 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.520
 increasing each level you will 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.290
 sail 3 more minions that is what 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.210
 the higher your level the more you have 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.479
 working hands and the more action 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.450
 at the same time you can build a building 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.240
 here are the following types of it 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.409
 manufacture of leisure decoration and 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.100
 mixing principle where is what 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.680
 explain I think not 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.210
 necessary because everything is so elementary 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.160
 I understand the island on which you hit 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.410
 big enough even that's probably 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.330
 better to say no island archipelago because 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.580
 that it consists of many others 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.660
 small islets and on reaching 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.209
 a certain level you can 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.540
 expand their ownership and accordingly 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.239
 already there build your houses built so 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.700
 further but in addition to the buildings in the extension 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.560
 there are other buns on each of these 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.560
 small islets will be present 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.270
 mini games that you can also 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 play and 1 mini game that you 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.040
 open this crazy fishing one of 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.930
 little yellow friends goes 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.690
 fishing but he is far from 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.700
 worms and carries on pork ham and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.190
 Naturally on this ham pecks 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.860
 passed and now the crocodile grabbed 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.959
 ham will steal you your task 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.819
 will avoid obstacles to pass 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.790
 through checkpoints and collect some 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.069
 gold teeth and the more teeth you 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.140
 collect the more points and bonuses you 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.870
 get at the end of the mission will be let down 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.700
 results and it seems to you how much you 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.310
 you need to collect these gold teeth 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.170
 to get this or that bonus by 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.180
 as you progress, you will build 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.680
 more and more buildings more and 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.829
 more interesting minions will be 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.739
 appear and they will do not understand 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.720
 that and thereby entertain you that I 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.670
 I want to say about probably 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.910
 graphic design everything is in principle 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.549
 it looks bright cool but that's what I do 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.160
 did not like in terms of implementation so 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.769
 this hair the hair of minions look like 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.750
 somehow disgusting and more like 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.420
 some needles that they stuck in 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.299
 head and probably item number two which 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.549
 I didn't like this one very much 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.980
 much later will put pressure on you donat 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.390
 because the money will gradually 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.359
 will end they will be missed 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.060
 will have to perform additional orders 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:58.180
 which will appear on a special 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.819
 blackboard and making money will be very 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.380
 and very long and very difficult too 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.810
 will have to wait very much 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.690
 time to build a torino edition 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.989
 or until the carry will be made other 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.840
 resources or vice versa is already final 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.079
 Crafting things for example 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.840
 like a skateboard helmet skateboards 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.459
 grenades and stuff on now let me get you 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.070
 tell you what I liked besides 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.139
 I liked the graphics in the game 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.180
 here minions are involved because 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.330
 Minions love probably all because 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.030
 these are cute yellow creatures that wish 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.490
 only good and serve the latest 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.350
 villain further I liked the fact that 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.180
 There are many mini-games here 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.880
 which of course will open 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.280
 gradually and to unlock them all 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.080
 will have to sweat very very much 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.780
 but the less mini-games a little bit 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.970
 diluted monotonous gameplay and 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.550
 thanks to this add some 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.190
 extra touch of this game and how 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.010
 the result probably can be said that by itself 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.729
 Imagine yourself a standard farm 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.520
 mini games 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.729
 but something relational in this genre is not 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.620
 brought and generally in my opinion this 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.530
 the game still serves probably advertising 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.970
 campaigns about the movie minions more precisely to 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.400
 spin-off ugly me 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.560
 which will be out this summer I think 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.050
 many will be interested in this cartoon 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.810
 see but for now we are waiting for the cartoon why 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.030
 would not play this cool farm 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.400
 and if you probably return to the game 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.539
 once or twice a day you can 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.669
 handle 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.700
 Yiddish donator on this my review came up 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.810
 Thank you all very much for your attention. 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.750
 subscribe to the channel put your finger 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.020
 up under the video all bye and up to the new 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.020
 meeting
