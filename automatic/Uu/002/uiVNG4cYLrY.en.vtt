00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
works great the other thing that's might

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.490 
works great the other thing that's might
be<00:02:23.120> missing<00:02:23.330> on<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.989> looks<00:02:24.110> like<00:02:24.350> we

be missing on this it looks like we

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.720 
be missing on this it looks like we

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
don't have any volume control so we

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.790 
don't have any volume control so we
can't<00:02:28.940> change<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.690> volume<00:02:29.840> or<00:02:30.230> turn<00:02:30.680> the

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
fared as you saw in that one video shot

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.620 
fared as you saw in that one video shot
it<00:05:15.889> did<00:05:16.190> fog<00:05:16.520> up<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.789> little<00:05:17.030> bit<00:05:17.120> on<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.360> screen

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
it did fog up a little bit on the screen

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.060 
it did fog up a little bit on the screen
and<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.840> touchscreen<00:05:18.349> was<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.590> little<00:05:18.979> bit

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
and the touchscreen was a little bit

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.400 
and the touchscreen was a little bit
tricky<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.550> work<00:05:19.760> at<00:05:19.940> times<00:05:20.180> but<00:05:20.449> anyway<00:05:21.199> let's

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
tricky to work at times but anyway let's

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.159 
tricky to work at times but anyway let's
open<00:05:21.650> it<00:05:21.740> up<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:21.979> check<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.340> out<00:05:23.080> opening<00:05:24.080> the

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
open it up and check it out opening the

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.879 
open it up and check it out opening the
case<00:05:25.660> flips<00:05:26.660> open<00:05:26.780> very<00:05:27.199> easily<00:05:27.410> in<00:05:27.830> the

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
case flips open very easily in the

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.240 
case flips open very easily in the
iphone<00:05:29.169> it's<00:05:30.169> pretty<00:05:30.410> tightly<00:05:30.710> tucked<00:05:31.039> in

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
iphone it's pretty tightly tucked in

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.830
