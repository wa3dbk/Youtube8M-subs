great ski for a beginning skier or
someone<00:01:55.179> who<00:01:55.239> just<00:01:55.360> wants<00:01:55.660> a<00:01:55.690> simple<00:01:56.140> jump<00:01:56.770> on

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
someone who just wants a simple jump on

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.100 
someone who just wants a simple jump on
and<00:01:57.129> go<00:01:57.220> kind<00:01:57.459> of<00:01:57.610> ski<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:58.330> other<00:01:58.479> option<00:01:58.929> is

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
and go kind of ski the other option is

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.510 
and go kind of ski the other option is
the<00:01:59.950> control<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.629> a<00:02:01.660> wider<00:02:02.080> ski<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:03.220> it's

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
the control this is a wider ski so it's

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.639 
the control this is a wider ski so it's
a<00:02:03.580> little<00:02:03.759> more<00:02:03.869> versatile<00:02:04.869> you<00:02:05.410> want<00:02:05.560> to

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
a little more versatile you want to

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.260 
a little more versatile you want to
break<00:02:05.920> away<00:02:06.099> from<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.489> groomed<00:02:06.910> sort<00:02:07.209> of

Trail maybe explore out the back door

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.729 
Trail maybe explore out the back door
kind<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.849> thing<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:14.050> where<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.379> control

kind of thing that is where the control

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.690 
kind of thing that is where the control
comes<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.989> essentially<00:02:17.069> same<00:02:18.069> idea<00:02:18.489> with

a<00:02:18.760> nice<00:02:19.209> wax

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880

patter or less less wax pattern but

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.350 
patter or less less wax pattern but
being<00:02:23.900> wider<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.560> more<00:02:25.040> versatile<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.730> also

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
being wider is more versatile and also

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.540 
being wider is more versatile and also
being<00:02:26.600> wider<00:02:26.840> might<00:02:27.290> require<00:02:27.680> if<00:02:28.100> you're

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
being wider might require if you're

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.390 
being wider might require if you're
thinking<00:02:28.940> off<00:02:29.240> trail<00:02:29.660> most<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.950> time<00:02:31.160> you

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
thinking off trail most of the time you

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.560 
thinking off trail most of the time you
might<00:02:31.550> want<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.880> boot<00:02:32.120> with<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.300> little<00:02:32.510> more

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
might want to boot with a little more

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.750 
might want to boot with a little more
support<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.350> once<00:02:33.680> you've<00:02:33.830> decided<00:02:33.950> which<00:02:34.460> ski

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
support so once you've decided which ski

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.390 
support so once you've decided which ski
is<00:02:34.970> appropriate<00:02:35.750> for<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:36.200> then<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:37.040> look<00:02:37.220> at

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
is appropriate for you then you look at

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.600 
is appropriate for you then you look at
a<00:02:37.610> boot<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.540> let's<00:02:38.720> look<00:02:38.810> at<00:02:38.930> some<00:02:39.080> boots<00:02:39.260> here

there's the SP 10 doesn't have that cuff
and<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.400> gives<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.700> lot<00:03:37.940> more<00:03:38.090> lateral

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
and that gives you a lot more lateral

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.230 
and that gives you a lot more lateral
stiffness<00:03:38.960> and<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.800> can<00:03:39.950> really<00:03:40.130> drive<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.790> ski

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
stiffness and it can really drive a ski

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.620 
stiffness and it can really drive a ski
that<00:03:41.960> is<00:03:42.320> wider<00:03:42.770> so<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:43.760> pair<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.270> up<00:03:44.420> with

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
that is wider so we pair this up with

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.660 
that is wider so we pair this up with
the<00:03:44.780> controls<00:03:45.290> because<00:03:46.070> again<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.490> might<00:03:46.610> be

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
the controls because again you might be

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.260 
the controls because again you might be
off<00:03:46.910> track

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
off track

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.670 
off track
you<00:03:47.720> could<00:03:47.930> may<00:03:48.020> be<00:03:48.080> coming<00:03:48.290> down<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.530> hill

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
you could may be coming down the hill

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.500 
you could may be coming down the hill
you<00:03:49.430> don't<00:03:49.580> know<00:03:49.640> what<00:03:49.820> you're<00:03:50.090> gonna<00:03:50.180> see<00:03:50.420> at

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
you don't know what you're gonna see at

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.940 
you don't know what you're gonna see at
the<00:03:50.600> bottom<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:51.080> might<00:03:51.170> need<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.500> little<00:03:51.709> more

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
the bottom you might need a little more

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.920 
the bottom you might need a little more
control<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.550> more<00:03:52.730> power<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.240> turn<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.630> ski

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
control the more power to turn that ski

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.660 
control the more power to turn that ski
that's<00:03:54.470> where<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:54.800> boot<00:03:55.100> with<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:55.400> cuff

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
that's where a boot with this cuff

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.570 
that's where a boot with this cuff
really<00:03:56.000> helps<00:03:56.300> out<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:57.890> also<00:03:58.040> have<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> bra

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
really helps out and you also have a bra

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.690 
really helps out and you also have a bra
zx5<00:03:59.530> for<00:04:00.530> men<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.860> women<00:04:01.130> this<00:04:01.250> is<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.490> men's

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
zx5 for men and women this is the men's

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.660 
zx5 for men and women this is the men's
same<00:04:02.420> idea<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.810> big<00:04:03.050> old<00:04:03.200> plastic<00:04:03.380> cuff<00:04:03.830> rising

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
same idea a big old plastic cuff rising

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.010 
same idea a big old plastic cuff rising
above<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:04.910> ankle<00:04:05.390> with<00:04:05.570> a<00:04:05.630> little<00:04:05.870> power

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
above the ankle with a little power

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.590 
above the ankle with a little power
strap<00:04:06.350> this<00:04:07.070> also<00:04:07.280> has<00:04:07.520> that<00:04:07.730> power<00:04:07.970> strap<00:04:08.270> and

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
strap this also has that power strap and

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.390 
strap this also has that power strap and
that<00:04:08.750> just<00:04:08.930> time<00:04:09.140> snugs<00:04:09.860> it<00:04:10.010> up<00:04:10.100> around<00:04:10.220> your

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
that just time snugs it up around your

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.970 
that just time snugs it up around your
ankle<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.420> really<00:04:11.660> helps<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.320> control

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
ankle and it really helps to control

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.699 
ankle and it really helps to control
that<00:04:13.459> ski<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.820> lot<00:04:14.000> more<00:04:14.270> so<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.900> x5<00:04:15.230> by<00:04:15.440> Rossi

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
that ski a lot more so the x5 by Rossi

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.640 
that ski a lot more so the x5 by Rossi
is<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.190> great<00:04:16.549> choice<00:04:16.850> on<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.180> control<00:04:17.650> and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
is a great choice on the control and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.500 
is a great choice on the control and
again<00:04:18.920> there's<00:04:19.130> no<00:04:19.340> harm<00:04:19.730> whatsoever<00:04:20.000> in<00:04:20.480> a

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
again there's no harm whatsoever in a

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.180 
again there's no harm whatsoever in a
boot<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:20.840> has<00:04:20.900> more<00:04:21.200> support<00:04:21.380> so<00:04:21.650> don't<00:04:22.010> feel

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
boot that has more support so don't feel

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.770 
boot that has more support so don't feel
like<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:22.580> is<00:04:22.700> too<00:04:22.730> much<00:04:23.060> boot<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.510> certainly

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
like this is too much boot it certainly

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.660 
like this is too much boot it certainly
is<00:04:23.900> not<00:04:24.050> this<00:04:24.500> will<00:04:24.680> work<00:04:24.740> great<00:04:25.040> on<00:04:25.280> the

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
is not this will work great on the

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.560 
is not this will work great on the
sports<00:04:25.970> Tour<00:04:26.240> as<00:04:26.450> well<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:28.250> again<00:04:28.820> think<00:04:29.330> about

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
sports Tour as well so again think about

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.890 
sports Tour as well so again think about
where<00:04:29.780> are<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:29.930> going<00:04:30.290> and

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
where are you going and

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.480 
where are you going and
you<00:04:31.050> want<00:04:31.259> to<00:04:31.350> do<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.860> will<00:04:32.070> help<00:04:32.250> narrow

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
you want to do that will help narrow

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.730 
you want to do that will help narrow
down<00:04:32.970> your<00:04:33.030> selection<00:04:33.509> there's<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.320> lot<00:04:34.560> of

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
down your selection there's a lot of
