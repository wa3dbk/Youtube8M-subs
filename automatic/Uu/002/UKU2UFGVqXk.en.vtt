00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.420
 After all it is meat 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:14.010
 If you say Matsuki or potato 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:18.950
 It's such a great thing, but I've entered one step, but it is a stone from the meatman 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:21.539
 Hey Is was a cartoon recently still Hikaru no Go 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.460
 I am not not a hair 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.699
 The idol is pretty good, but I can only know the name of the tube Olympics said akb 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.699
 I 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.620
 Ease to the river 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.390
 What color do you like 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.899
 It is orange or yellow 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.899
 It is a cat 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.440
 It was recommended to Yu trees 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.410
 It's a chance, and I've always been with that four friends 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:03.079
 I feel to go to come to do 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:08.190
 Oh yes , it's a game that you can play with a team like that, not just Role 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:10.220
 It is the most fun is to say or give thought everyone 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.590
 To spend the night 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.120
 A while ago 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.170
 a game that says sf 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:22.400
 I did it in a team for about 23 years 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.790
 San Juan All Landing comes out in the cartoon called Hunter Hunter 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.220
 Gallactor's 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.610
 Hayako 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.980
 I use so 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.230
 pot wow 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.620
 Oh, but more than I think 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.650
 I often hit in the game 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.750
 I'm just going to be good outside 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:48.530
 So I say that I can find various correct answers while colliding with such parts 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.810
 I think that I think that it is good after all in the meaning 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.240
 It is still Rampage 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.659
 Well if I say I what is strong me strength's Rampage team stylo 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.830
 I think that having the best is the best strength 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:10.340
 I think that if you have only individual abilities you will not lose so much 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:12.660
 And I wish I should have established whether fight or Toma we also properly's style and the style you 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.250
 I think 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.050
 That's right after all 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.430
 That mid- naper's sense of stability says so 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.400
 Keeping it alive 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.239
 If you can make it from Mitt 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.370
 How to carry after the middle stage 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.739
 Than is I think the great good among themselves 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.739
 I think if I could extend that more and more 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.630
 As a support to say as a goal 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.400
 tps mistake player 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.230
 After all we went to old times and there is thing that we rely on, and we respect Brocken inoculation together 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.420
 is not it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:03:01.170
 I thought I convex in I Well I think originally that it is so even now doing Mamitto 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:03.720
 It seems that support is in reverse in the position that is most noticeable or in a flower shape . 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.079
 Or rather me me and know you know 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:12.370
 Such a fine place 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:14.510

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:21.850
 No pari 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:28.420
 Good year bar is also discussed Yappa it'd great big it Tteyuu gathered 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.950
 Well after all levels in the individual in the sense Tteyuu go looking for the answer to analyze various things is 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.910
 I think it has gone up 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.060
 Even the team 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:40.370
 I think that I have became successfully to feel more and more good 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.379
 After all that two servers are made 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.379
 I think that the level of Japan will definitely rise 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.970
 I want to win I thought led back to Yappa 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.460

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.680
 Tona 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.560
 I thought it was a chance 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.819

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.380
