00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.100 
thought better of it Kyle was there and
and<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.030> probably<00:02:41.330> could<00:02:41.630> have<00:02:41.660> snuck<00:02:41.930> under

and I probably could have snuck under

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.780 
and I probably could have snuck under
there<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.590> maybe<00:02:42.740> caused<00:02:42.980> some<00:02:43.190> havoc<00:02:43.340> so

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
there and maybe caused some havoc so

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.240 
there and maybe caused some havoc so
better<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.390> come<00:02:44.600> home<00:02:44.810> second<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.380> give<00:02:46.100> my

with with Dennis Theresa and see what we
can<00:04:30.979> do<00:04:31.099> you<00:04:31.569> tried<00:04:32.569> to<00:04:32.659> make<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:32.810> couple<00:04:33.080> slide

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
can do you tried to make a couple slide

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.469 
can do you tried to make a couple slide
jobs<00:04:33.650> work<00:04:33.949> but<00:04:34.430> at<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.759> end<00:04:34.789> it<00:04:35.060> took<00:04:35.240> rubber

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
jobs work but at the end it took rubber

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.180 
jobs work but at the end it took rubber
how<00:04:35.720> hard<00:04:35.990> is<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.139> to<00:04:36.259> make<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.500> slide<00:04:36.770> job<00:04:36.979> work

in<00:04:37.430> rubber<00:04:37.940> it's<00:04:39.069> nearly<00:04:40.069> impossible<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.940> mean

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
in rubber it's nearly impossible I mean

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.999 
in rubber it's nearly impossible I mean
you<00:04:41.569> almost<00:04:41.870> drive<00:04:42.199> yourself<00:04:42.590> right<00:04:42.800> out<00:04:42.979> of

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
you almost drive yourself right out of

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.670 
you almost drive yourself right out of
the<00:04:43.220> rubber<00:04:43.430> every<00:04:43.849> time<00:04:44.229> you<00:04:45.229> know<00:04:45.319> we<00:04:45.500> were

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
little bit too snug there at the end and

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.860 
little bit too snug there at the end and
the<00:04:48.710> rubber<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.330> just<00:04:50.330> getting<00:04:50.569> line<00:04:50.750> to

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870
