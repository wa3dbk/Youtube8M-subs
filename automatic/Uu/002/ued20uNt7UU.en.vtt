last six months with this very large
number<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.290> applications<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.220> download

number of applications and download
obviously<00:00:06.330> you've<00:00:06.509> been<00:00:06.540> doing<00:00:06.930> you've<00:00:07.470> had

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
obviously you've been doing you've had

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.860 
obviously you've been doing you've had
an<00:00:07.740> application<00:00:08.340> platform<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.300> phones<00:00:09.599> for

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
an application platform on phones for

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.410 
an application platform on phones for
many<00:00:10.050> years<00:00:10.490> probably<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.880> have<00:00:12.090> more

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
many years probably you have more

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.120 
many years probably you have more
applications<00:00:13.110> than<00:00:13.170> they<00:00:13.380> choose<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.860> count

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
applications than they choose to count

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.420 
applications than they choose to count
all<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> time<00:00:14.580> but<00:00:14.910> something<00:00:15.890> really<00:00:16.890> rapid

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
all the time but something really rapid

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.950 
all the time but something really rapid
and<00:00:17.609> interesting<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.270> happening<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> last

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and interesting is happening in the last

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.310 
and interesting is happening in the last
few<00:00:19.170> months<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.650> wonder<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.189> make<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> it

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
few months I wonder what you make of it

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.609 
few months I wonder what you make of it
well<00:00:22.320> let's<00:00:23.279> take<00:00:23.490> out<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:24.050> those<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> very

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
well let's take out of those out a very

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
well let's take out of those out a very
nice<00:00:25.800> job<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.369> would<00:00:26.580> say<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.880> making<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> easy

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
nice job I would say of making it easy

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.880 
nice job I would say of making it easy
to<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:29.390> eight<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.630> ads<00:00:30.929> free<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.500> there

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
to get it at eight or ads free up there

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.970 
to get it at eight or ads free up there
just<00:00:32.040> made<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> very<00:00:32.480> nice<00:00:33.480> job<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.079> they

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
just made a very nice job on that they

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.660 
just made a very nice job on that they
have<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> nice<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.670> platform<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.489> many<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
have a nice out platform we do many of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
have a nice out platform we do many of
us<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> that's<00:00:39.300> not<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.469> only

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
us to that's not that the only

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.340 
us to that's not that the only
distinguishing<00:00:41.570> characteristics<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> so

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
distinguishing characteristics and so

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.040 
distinguishing characteristics and so
that<00:00:43.530> people<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.280> downloading<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.539> absence

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
that people are downloading the absence

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.709 
that people are downloading the absence

of powerful computing platform they

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
of powerful computing platform they
designed<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.170> very<00:00:49.350> high-end<00:00:49.620> device<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
designed a very high-end device and

the best intentions would have a hard

think look out to instant attention I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.020 
think look out to instant attention I
don't<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> most<00:01:20.340> economic

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
don't know what the most economic

up<00:01:23.580> with<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.210> kind<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.080> those<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:26.150> when<00:01:27.150> I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
up with what kind of those of when I

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.880 
up with what kind of those of when I
said<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.600> hear<00:01:27.840> from<00:01:27.990> customers<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> think

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
said I hear from customers to I think

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.490 
said I hear from customers to I think
what<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.579> happen<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:31.049> will<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
what really happen is there will be a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.890 
what really happen is there will be a
competition<00:01:32.189> both<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.240> our<00:01:33.329> country<00:01:33.689> probably

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
competition both of our country probably

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.319 
competition both of our country probably
wishes<00:01:34.439> would<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.799> accelerate<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.759> don't

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
wishes would just accelerate I don't

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.300 
wishes would just accelerate I don't
think<00:01:36.540> we're<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.020> nine<00:01:37.310> mobile

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
think we're going to have nine mobile

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.569 
think we're going to have nine mobile
platforms<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.659> next<00:01:40.049> ten<00:01:40.259> years<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.860> think

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
platforms for the next ten years I think

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.399 
platforms for the next ten years I think
we'll<00:01:41.759> probably<00:01:41.970> shake<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> couple

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
we'll probably shake out with a couple

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.969 
we'll probably shake out with a couple
tree<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.979> application

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
tree that really have application

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.510 
tree that really have application
developer<00:01:47.880> momentum<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.500> high<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.369> an

developer momentum with a high with an

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.719 
developer momentum with a high with an
appropriate<00:01:50.939> level<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.720> interoperability

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
appropriate level of interoperability

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.160 
appropriate level of interoperability
giving<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.820> highlight<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.899> quite

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
giving a highlight that is quite

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.620 
giving a highlight that is quite
different<00:01:55.470> from<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.670> say<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.909> days<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.600> we

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
different from what say the days when we

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.440 
different from what say the days when we
