00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
now will nicely blend this together the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.090 
now will nicely blend this together the
code<00:01:49.329> that<00:01:49.360> we<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:50.020> taken<00:01:50.590> from<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
code that we have taken from the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.649 
code that we have taken from the
vegetable<00:01:51.460> because<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:52.090> will<00:01:52.180> add<00:01:52.299> a<00:01:52.329> good

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.880 
along with it add a little water to
blend<00:01:56.619> it<00:02:01.020> let's<00:02:02.020> check<00:02:02.289> whether<00:02:02.560> it's<00:02:02.710> nice

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
blend it let's check whether it's nice

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.969 
blend it let's check whether it's nice
blend<00:02:03.280> together<00:02:03.580> yeah<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:05.289> now<00:02:05.470> we<00:02:05.530> will<00:02:05.770> cook

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979
