00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
Brian hall this is really kind of a joke

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.470 
Brian hall this is really kind of a joke
but<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.520> really<00:00:17.699> kind<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.029> not<00:00:18.180> I'm<00:00:18.330> just

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
but it's really kind of not I'm just

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.109 
but it's really kind of not I'm just
kind<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.660> doing<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.020> for<00:00:19.230> fun<00:00:20.119> because

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
kind of doing this for fun because

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.609 
kind of doing this for fun because
there's<00:00:21.330> always<00:00:21.630> lessons<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.350> learned

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
there's always lessons to be learned

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.050 
there's always lessons to be learned
even<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> simplest<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> most

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
even in the simplest and the most

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.790 
even in the simplest and the most
complex<00:00:25.580> instruction<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.320> Brian<00:00:28.320> wanted<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
complex instruction so Brian wanted to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.019 
complex instruction so Brian wanted to
learn<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.099> song<00:00:29.279> because<00:00:29.519> he<00:00:29.640> doesn't<00:00:29.820> know

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
learn this song because he doesn't know

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.889 
learn this song because he doesn't know
it<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> started<00:00:33.059> messing<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.690> last

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
it so I started messing with it last

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
night I thought yeah I put a video and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.700 
night I thought yeah I put a video and
so<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.390> one's<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:36.630> for<00:00:36.960> fun<00:00:37.170> guys<00:00:37.469> this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so this one's just for fun guys this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.729 
so this one's just for fun guys this
isn't<00:00:38.040> serious<00:00:38.219> no<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.379> gonna<00:00:40.530> make<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
isn't serious no and I'm gonna make a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.200 
isn't serious no and I'm gonna make a
lot<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> mistakes<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.610> I've<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:41.879> sketched

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
lot of mistakes but I've just sketched

00:00:42.210 --> 00:02:01.790 
lot of mistakes but I've just sketched
the<00:00:42.570> skeleton<00:00:43.140> outline<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> okay

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.080 

it's<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:03.070> middle<00:02:03.280> part<00:02:03.610> sounds<00:02:03.910> something

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
it's the middle part sounds something

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:14.270 
it's the middle part sounds something
like<00:02:04.210> this

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:49.690 

not<00:02:15.030> even<00:02:15.300> into

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.699 

anyway<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.760> get<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.030> idea<00:02:51.420> right<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.560> if<00:02:52.620> you

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
anyway you get the idea right so if you

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.869 
anyway you get the idea right so if you
want<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.920> learn<00:02:53.099> some<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.519> this<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.730> a

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
want to learn some of this this is a

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:54.890 
want to learn some of this this is a
great<00:02:54.000> thing<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.330> fool<00:02:54.569> around<00:02:54.690> with

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
great thing to fool around with

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780 
great thing to fool around with
especially<00:02:55.590> if<00:02:55.680> you're<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> guitar<00:02:55.980> player<00:02:56.220> so

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
especially if you're a guitar player so

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.630 
especially if you're a guitar player so
let<00:02:57.239> me<00:02:57.390> give<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.599> an<00:02:57.690> idea<00:02:58.129> really<00:02:59.129> what<00:02:59.549> I'm

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
let me give you an idea really what I'm

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.430 
let me give you an idea really what I'm
doing<00:02:59.879> it's<00:03:00.390> an<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.720> minor<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.230> we're<00:03:01.349> beginning

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
doing it's an a minor so we're beginning

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.130 
doing it's an a minor so we're beginning
with<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.799> pedal<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:02.370> position<00:03:02.760> number<00:03:02.909> eight

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.280 

so<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.590> matter

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.470

- emajor to see

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.619 
- emajor to see
this<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.440> an<00:03:17.560> D<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.370> or<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.760> position<00:03:19.180> one<00:03:19.360> with

this is an D so or a position one with

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
Janine against Turing aid in there

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.610 
Janine against Turing aid in there
because<00:03:30.260> we<00:03:30.380> don't<00:03:30.530> have<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.680> root<00:03:30.980> here<00:03:31.280> so

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.559 

and<00:03:35.980> then<00:03:36.400> GA<00:03:36.700> matter

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.350

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
so I'm just using six eight and ten and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:55.720 
so I'm just using six eight and ten and
then<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.750> pill<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.379> six<00:03:44.159> seven<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.700> ten

G major and now the pull off indeed
let's<00:04:23.670> use<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.300> at<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.720> position<00:04:24.900> one<00:04:25.410> and

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
let's use a and at that position one and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.460 
let's use a and at that position one and
play<00:04:27.440> string<00:04:28.440> one<00:04:29.870> we're<00:04:30.870> actually<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.260> pull
