00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
three different chords they're just

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.080 
three different chords they're just
changing<00:01:38.119> that<00:01:38.209> one<00:01:38.420> string<00:01:39.729> I'm<00:01:40.729> just<00:01:40.940> gonna

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
changing that one string I'm just gonna

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.150 
changing that one string I'm just gonna
isolate<00:01:41.330> it<00:01:42.069> so<00:01:43.069> you<00:01:43.130> guys<00:01:43.340> can<00:01:43.399> see<00:01:43.819> it's<00:01:44.600> just

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
isolate it so you guys can see it's just

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.639 
isolate it so you guys can see it's just
when<00:01:46.160> you<00:01:46.280> when<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:46.700> hold<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.030> normal<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.649> you're

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
when you when you hold a normal a you're

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.190 
when you when you hold a normal a you're
holding<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:48.920> like<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:50.050> so<00:01:51.050> they're

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
holding it like that so they're

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.300 
holding it like that so they're
basically<00:01:51.349> going

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.930 

that's<00:01:56.000> all<00:01:56.180> that's<00:01:56.480> all<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:56.870> is<00:01:57.550> so<00:01:58.550> instead

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
that's all that's all it is so instead

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.090 
that's all that's all it is so instead
of<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.480> know<00:01:59.540> doing<00:01:59.600> that<00:02:00.050> just<00:02:00.680> do<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:00.980> with

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
of you know doing that just do it with

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.660 
of you know doing that just do it with
the<00:02:01.190> cord<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.770> then<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.040> move<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.220> achieve

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
the cord and then you move to achieve

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.290 
the cord and then you move to achieve
gonna<00:02:08.600> do<00:02:08.840> back<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:09.890> an<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:13.090> that's<00:02:14.090> pretty

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
gonna do back to an a and that's pretty

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.190 
gonna do back to an a and that's pretty
much<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> whole<00:02:14.750> song<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:17.050> start<00:02:18.050> off

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
much the whole song so you start off

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.220 
much the whole song so you start off
with<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.709> normal<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.470> go<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.860> G
