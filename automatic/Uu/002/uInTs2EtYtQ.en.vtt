I have some Australian fans that came

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
I have some Australian fans that came
here<00:01:26.700> because<00:01:27.060> they<00:01:27.299> watch<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.719> show<00:01:27.929> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
here because they watch the show and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.300 
here because they watch the show and
they<00:01:28.289> want<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.530> come<00:01:28.649> eat<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.219> knew

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
they want to come eat because they knew

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.069 
they want to come eat because they knew
it<00:01:29.460> could<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.729> Mid<00:01:29.909> America<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.869> show

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
it could be at Mid America so the show

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.240 
it could be at Mid America so the show
is<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.380> permeated<00:01:32.039> I<00:01:32.250> guess<00:01:32.909> every<00:01:33.360> Shore<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
is now permeated I guess every Shore and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.679 
is now permeated I guess every Shore and
the<00:01:35.250> running<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.880> were<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.179> running<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.569> on

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the running that were now running it on

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.830 
the running that were now running it on
speed<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.229> ten<00:01:37.500> o'clock<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:38.429> Wednesdays<00:01:39.149> so<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
speed at ten o'clock on Wednesdays so I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.059 
speed at ten o'clock on Wednesdays so I
think<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> network<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.740> doing<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
think what the network is doing is

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:42.709 
think what the network is doing is
getting<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> feel<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.149> program<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
getting a feel for that program and

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.569 
getting a feel for that program and
hopefully<00:01:42.960> they'll<00:01:43.289> give<00:01:43.860> us<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.069> big<00:01:44.250> order

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
hopefully they'll give us a big order

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.819 
hopefully they'll give us a big order
I'd<00:01:45.420> say<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.780> opened<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.289> like<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
I'd say get opened for like on the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.289 
I'd say get opened for like on the

this kind of thing

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.289 
this kind of thing
yeah<00:02:02.099> I<00:02:02.130> actually<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.909> mean<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.239> think

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
yeah I actually we have I mean I think

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.729 
yeah I actually we have I mean I think
it<00:02:03.539> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.020> think<00:02:04.289> it's<00:02:04.500> safe<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.709> say

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:04.739 
it kind of I think it's safe to say

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:06.800 
it kind of I think it's safe to say
we're<00:02:05.039> pretty<00:02:05.340> much<00:02:05.459> pioneered<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.360> think

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
we're pretty much pioneered I think

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.380 
we're pretty much pioneered I think
those<00:02:07.160> at<00:02:08.160> least<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.489> far<00:02:08.519> as<00:02:08.670> talking<00:02:08.880> show<00:02:09.239> is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
those at least as far as talking show is

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.759 
those at least as far as talking show is
the<00:02:09.479> most<00:02:09.569> integrity<00:02:10.170> at<00:02:10.259> least<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.649> you're

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
the most integrity at least that you're

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:11.960 
the most integrity at least that you're
gonna<00:02:10.890> find<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.280> they're<00:02:11.489> not<00:02:11.700> there's<00:02:11.880> no

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.820 
almost every state back in the day so
over<00:05:09.180> it<00:05:09.450> was<00:05:09.540> so<00:05:09.570> long<00:05:09.960> over<00:05:10.440> length<00:05:10.590> and

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
over it was so long over length and

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.129 
over it was so long over length and
everything<00:05:11.700> about<00:05:11.910> it<00:05:12.150> was<00:05:12.180> he<00:05:12.750> was<00:05:12.900> on<00:05:12.990> the

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
everything about it was he was on the

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.870 
everything about it was he was on the
ABCs<00:05:13.530> my<00:05:13.680> rule<00:05:13.889> this<00:05:14.010> more<00:05:14.250> in<00:05:14.310> six<00:05:14.700> of<00:05:14.820> the

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
ABCs my rule this more in six of the

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.240 
ABCs my rule this more in six of the
seven<00:05:14.940> times<00:05:15.330> he<00:05:15.510> was<00:05:15.630> on<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:16.139> it's<00:05:16.980> it's

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
seven times he was on so it's it's

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.370 
seven times he was on so it's it's
something<00:05:17.700> that<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:18.060> think<00:05:18.660> is<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.840> museum<00:05:19.350> piece
