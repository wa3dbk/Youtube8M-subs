the times I was out on the beach should

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.640

just starts crawling stuff in the sand
and<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.250> wouldn't<00:01:34.460> have<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.700> worry<00:01:34.850> about

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
and I wouldn't have to worry about

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.120 
and I wouldn't have to worry about
anybody<00:01:35.330> else's<00:01:35.900> judgement<00:01:36.590> because<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:36.920> was

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
anybody else's judgement because I was

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.680 
anybody else's judgement because I was
there<00:01:37.310> by<00:01:37.460> myself<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.150> waves<00:01:38.330> were<00:01:38.570> gonna

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
there by myself and the waves were gonna

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.970 
there by myself and the waves were gonna
take<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.140> anyway<00:01:39.440> so<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:40.490> process<00:01:41.000> for<00:01:41.030> me<00:01:41.420> is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
take it anyway so the process for me is

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.020 
take it anyway so the process for me is
basically<00:01:42.980> being<00:01:43.190> with<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.370> thought<00:01:43.730> and

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
basically being with a thought and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.030 
basically being with a thought and
emotion<00:01:44.450> or<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.600> story<00:01:45.050> usually<00:01:45.440> on<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.830> drive

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
emotion or a story usually on the drive

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.130 
emotion or a story usually on the drive
over<00:01:46.070> something<00:01:47.030> will<00:01:47.150> come<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.360> me<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:47.780> then

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
over something will come to me and then

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.630 
over something will come to me and then
a<00:01:48.170> shape<00:01:48.470> will<00:01:48.650> manifest<00:01:48.920> from<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.580> it

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
a shape will manifest from that and it

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.340 
a shape will manifest from that and it
all<00:01:49.760> starts<00:01:50.060> from<00:01:50.180> there<00:01:50.330> can<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.110> tell<00:01:51.260> me
