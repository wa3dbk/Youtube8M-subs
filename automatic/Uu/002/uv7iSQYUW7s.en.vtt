which I don't have that it does show the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.370 
which I don't have that it does show the
locos<00:01:08.220> being<00:01:08.549> black<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.960> got<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
locos being black and that it's got the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
locos being black and that it's got the
UT<00:01:10.680> debris<00:01:10.890> or<00:01:11.010> painted<00:01:11.460> out<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> real

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
UT debris or painted out and the real

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.929 
UT debris or painted out and the real
number<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.510> 1401<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> looks<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.920> when<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
number is 1401 so it looks like when the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
number is 1401 so it looks like when the
set<00:01:15.150> comes<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.689> July<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.890> to
