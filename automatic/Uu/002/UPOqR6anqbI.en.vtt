00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.250
 Good day to all pilots with you gif and this 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.380
 review of the largest at the moment 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.430
 trading ship in the world or are you 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.040
 Type 9 truck built on top of lacquer 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.800
 on companies that have fired as well as very 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.460
 good ship and such as type 6 eos 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.610
 so frankly unfortunate in my opinion with 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.350
 7 truth of this empire is clipper here 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.710
 the rest have to be content 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.890
 That is, let's start with the characteristics 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.350
 the ship itself is worth 75 million credits 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.680
 but the factory configuration needs 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.799
 upgrades in the armament section three 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.809
 medium slot two small but mean 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.290
 slump set only turrets 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.220
 or 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.629
 do not put anything to ease the weight 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.019
 slots for military equipment can 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.610
 put the amplifier and bills catching 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.799
 she managed to take me side winder 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.030
 more than half the bill was cooling 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.549
 my psd 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.570
 Well, the trick with the silent mode is not here 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.250
 I think that will pass 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.320
 it's very quiet one ship and huge from 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.370
 internal equipment most important 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.490
 this fsd a6 engine is worth 16 million 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.440
 loans and he needed necessarily otherwise 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.150
 leap into six light years with full 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.150
 hold you ban everywhere with a6 engine 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.710
 type 9 jumps around 12 and 13 years 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.770
 loaded and over 18 empty 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.930
 64 ton max fsd tank 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.420
 engine can absorb up to 8 tons 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.460
 in one jump 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.530
 I configured for my route 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.590
 I needed a ship at 14 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.360
 light years then the fuel 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.360
 baku no arrows just one jump in 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.450
 one side and place only snapped on 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.729
 four hundred and seventy tons could 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.690
 put shunting engines d6 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.989
 then the hold would be 486 tom but unfortunately 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.090
 d6 and shunting very slow me 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.370
 refused this option and returned 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.600
 frame films 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.510
 maximum hold that can be done 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.040
 This is 9 without removing the accounts this is 500 units 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.850
 by the way about the holds big holds now 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.190
 roads and on the two main holds 128 and 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.680
 256GB capacity needs five more 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.110
 million and current and without a ship will cost 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.560
 about 20-25 million above from 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.410
 prices and for the purchase of t9 means you need to have 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.120
 about 100 million with another 10 bad checks 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.920
 on goods and insurance talk about all 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.930
 other internal components 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.810
 It makes no sense either we put what 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.060
 weighs less to continue jumping either 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:00.000
 put what you like more all on 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:02.880
 just need the power of the engine 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.610
 view and cabin not handsome absolutely me 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.370
 no fear he is huge takes more 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.220
 half gateway and not able to break up with 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.960
 most ships used to say 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.500
 there was a problem to fly in with the released 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.600
 chassis 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.180
 but now I do not observe this problem 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.130
 specially checked everything fits into the dock 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.370
 in any case chassis or released 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.280
 there is no difference the cabin is very spacious 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.830
 the view from her is good all sides but there is 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.470
 one but the cabin is at the bottom of the ship 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.530
 this should be considered when flying through the gateway 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.690
 although once again I will notice problems taking off 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.670
 the gateway was experiencing no more than a cliptery 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.120
 Well, now the most important thing about trading 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.920
 worth it or not if before that you 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.110
 traded on the clip before then quite 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.590
 expect your earnings to grow by two 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.500
 times 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.660
 since the hold has doubled sram 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.080
 fuel kopek earlier it could 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.530
 interfere 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.380
 But now we'll live exactly but in 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.209
 There is no business as the code and 9 is enough 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.980
 the little jump is where the clipper is 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.400
 jumped once here have to do 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.040
 two jumps and even if the jump remains 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.930
 one of those seconds needed 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.930
 on performing maneuvers when approaching 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.730
 station flying around the sun 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.669
 those minutes are getting out of the gateway 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.310
 as a result of which income per hour 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.140
 still below my expected speed 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.970
 displacement between stations dropped 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.760
 about one and a half times 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.470
 nato what was fixed left 10 minutes 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.970
 over and 9 takes 13-15 minutes approximately 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.680
 only in defense of t9 worth saying 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.140
 that constantly for 10 minutes on the caliper 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.200
 do n't even bargain all the same monotony 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.480
 trade kills and here is t9 your time 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.610
 shows stable slower nowhere 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.610
 you can really watch 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.640
 tv even two eyes whether secret 9 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.520
 not that one read a book to cook 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.250
 dinner well, that is, you can do a lot 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.760
 things while you slowly swim to the side 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.310
 dock 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.040
 but if you traded t7 then I think 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.870
 The difference in speed is particularly no 9 I 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.460
 I'll probably even say more manageable 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.270
 rather than his younger brother 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.310
 but this is a matter of taste as I think not 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.770
 it's worth mentioning you're 9 queen only 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.510
 to large sites and therefore the choice of places 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.310
 trade is limited compared to 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:26.250
 python and t sixth summing up if y 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.650
 you have a good shopping route superfluous 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.680
 100 million and you are not very annoying 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.570
 trade is worth taking the money will 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.070
 earn more and so on 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.040
 the rest of the entertainment will be more 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.850
 free time I make it 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.680
 9 about 5-6 million hours I donâ€™t 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.229
 It seems this ship is convenient for 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.780
 to explore the galaxy on it 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.610
 look on it for new trade routes to my 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.430
 a look easier to do on something more 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.580
 fleet for example buy a cobra 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.760
 briefly and then in fact already drive 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.910
 there t9 and carry on a profitable route 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.520
 and this is quite a convenient working 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.400
 the horse is not even such a huge horse 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.820
 cargo mare with a loading capacity of 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.310
 500 tons for which, in general, and she loves to 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.580
 this all with you was gif and lucky for you 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.580
 flight
