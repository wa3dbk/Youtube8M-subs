00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
is Liz not only does he affect the game

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.490

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.440 
something different this year they've
still<00:01:31.979> got<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> same<00:01:32.460> kind<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.790> back<00:01:33.090> forward

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
still got the same kind of back forward

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.740 
still got the same kind of back forward
defensive<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.259> structure<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.850> no<00:01:36.570> it's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
defensive kind of structure but no it's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.289 
defensive kind of structure but no it's
it's<00:01:36.960> good<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.340> pairing<00:01:38.850> coach

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it's good to see you know pairing coach

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.609 
it's good to see you know pairing coach
Allen<00:01:39.540> Iike<00:01:39.689> me<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.930> mean<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.500> see

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
Allen Iike me I mean when you can see

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.810 
Allen Iike me I mean when you can see
today<00:01:40.860> those<00:01:41.040> moments<00:01:41.280> when<00:01:41.520> they're<00:01:41.700> not

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
today those moments when they're not

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.399 
today those moments when they're not
communicating<00:01:42.390> fully<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.079> that's<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
communicating fully and that's the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.749 
communicating fully and that's the
problem<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
problem I think it's not really the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.920 
problem I think it's not really the
title<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> think<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.299> communication<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
title I think it's just communication is

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420 
title I think it's just communication is
important<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.860> think<00:01:47.070> they<00:01:47.220> both

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
important with them so I think they both

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.580 
important with them so I think they both
got<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.939> mistake<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.689> them<00:01:48.840> which<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> problem

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
got a mistake in them which is a problem

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
got a mistake in them which is a problem
but<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.490> once<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.210> build<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
but you know once you kind of build up a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.060 
but you know once you kind of build up a
partnership<00:01:51.899> we'll<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.530> over<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
partnership we'll get over that and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.300 
partnership we'll get over that and
we'll<00:01:53.189> push<00:01:53.520> forward<00:01:53.880> see<00:01:54.119> ya<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.409> we

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
top of the league at the moment can we

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.499 
top of the league at the moment can we

be around there come May next year well

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.270 
be around there come May next year well
I<00:02:00.780> mean<00:02:00.990> we've<00:02:01.469> got<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.680> team<00:02:01.890> that's<00:02:01.920> played

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
I mean we've got a team that's played

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.469 
I mean we've got a team that's played
together<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.729> years<00:02:02.880> now<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.329> that's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
together for years now and that's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.330 
together for years now and that's
something<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.530> dismiss<00:02:04.890> easily<00:02:05.250> who

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
something you know we dismiss easily who

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.440 
something you know we dismiss easily who
teams<00:02:05.549> buying<00:02:05.880> players<00:02:06.060> left<00:02:06.270> right<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
teams buying players left right and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.199 
teams buying players left right and
center<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.960> could<00:02:07.229> Tottenham<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.680> example

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
center that could Tottenham for example

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.089 
center that could Tottenham for example
and<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.450> know<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.750> Chelsea<00:02:10.140> look<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.379> bit<00:02:10.560> on

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
and you know like Chelsea look a bit on

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.949 
and you know like Chelsea look a bit on
settle<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.580> moment<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.970> mean<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.420> changes

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
settle at the moment I mean like changes

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.580 
settle at the moment I mean like changes
going<00:02:13.110> all

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
going all

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.470 
going all
whatever<00:02:13.830> they<00:02:13.980> say<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.700> think<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.450> just

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
whatever they say so I think if we just

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.040 
whatever they say so I think if we just
keep<00:02:16.340> injury-free<00:02:17.340> as<00:02:17.700> much<00:02:17.879> as<00:02:18.000> possible

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
keep injury-free as much as possible

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.809 
keep injury-free as much as possible
Mikell<00:02:19.590> coming<00:02:19.860> back<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.129> for<00:02:20.280> me<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.610> mean

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
Mikell coming back is for me is I mean

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.790 
Mikell coming back is for me is I mean
that's<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.330> huge<00:02:21.629> thing<00:02:21.660> because<00:02:22.110> he's<00:02:22.290> kind<00:02:22.650> of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
that's a huge thing because he's kind of

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.880 
that's a huge thing because he's kind of
the<00:02:23.459> technical<00:02:23.790> centerpiece<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.629> our<00:02:24.690> team

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
the technical centerpiece to our team

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.860 
the technical centerpiece to our team
I<00:02:25.920> mean<00:02:26.220> family's<00:02:26.580> been<00:02:26.790> great<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.030> can't<00:02:27.330> say

I mean family's been great I can't say

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.400 
I mean family's been great I can't say
no<00:02:28.019> but<00:02:28.200> we<00:02:29.010> forget<00:02:29.310> how<00:02:29.489> important<00:02:30.090> Arteta

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
no but we forget how important Arteta

playing<00:02:32.760> even<00:02:32.970> better<00:02:33.090> I'll<00:02:33.629> test<00:02:33.900> her<00:02:33.959> back

playing even better I'll test her back
in<00:02:34.260> there<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.590> then<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:35.010> let<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.239> guys
