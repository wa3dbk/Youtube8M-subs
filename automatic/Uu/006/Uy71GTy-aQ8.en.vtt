00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
this leg extends that she's actually
going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.040> less<00:02:02.280> balanced<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.149> keeping

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
going to be less balanced so keeping

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.990 
going to be less balanced so keeping
that<00:02:03.659> left<00:02:03.899> leg<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:04.920> bent<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.759> going<00:02:05.939> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that left leg for now bent it's going to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.700 
that left leg for now bent it's going to
give<00:02:06.149> her<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> little<00:02:06.509> bit<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:06.930> stability<00:02:07.170> as

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
give her a little bit more stability as

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.009 
give her a little bit more stability as
we<00:02:07.860> go<00:02:07.979> into<00:02:08.129> her<00:02:08.399> setup<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:09.569> want<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> make

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
we go into her setup we want to make

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.349 
we go into her setup we want to make
sure<00:02:10.049> that<00:02:10.470> at<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.860> waist<00:02:11.219> between<00:02:11.879> ribs<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:12.359 
sure that at the waist between ribs and

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.409 
sure that at the waist between ribs and
pelvis<00:02:12.540> she's<00:02:12.989> in<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.559> neutral<00:02:14.459> position<00:02:14.609> so

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:15.419 
pelvis she's in a neutral position so

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:16.940 
pelvis she's in a neutral position so
typically<00:02:15.840> what<00:02:16.109> happens<00:02:16.139> is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
typically what happens is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.830 
typically what happens is
our<00:02:17.250> patients<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.880> students<00:02:18.330> will<00:02:18.480> go<00:02:18.600> into

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
our patients and students will go into

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.170 
our patients and students will go into
more<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.350> collapse<00:02:19.800> or<00:02:20.070> side-bend<00:02:20.610> position

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
more of a collapse or side-bend position

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.120 
more of a collapse or side-bend position
which<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.840> clearly<00:02:22.110> not<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> neutral<00:02:22.950> position

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
which is clearly not a neutral position

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.780 
which is clearly not a neutral position
in<00:02:23.670> terms<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:25.230> frontal<00:02:25.740> plane<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.520> we

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
in terms of that frontal plane so we

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.660 
in terms of that frontal plane so we
want<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.240> make<00:02:27.390> sure<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.290> is

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
want to make sure that this is

in this case we're working on adduction

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.600 
in this case we're working on adduction
and<00:02:57.480> not<00:02:57.990> have<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.410> worry<00:02:58.620> about<00:02:58.980> their<00:02:59.310> neck

that lower leg down onto the table and
so<00:03:05.130> we're<00:03:05.640> gonna<00:03:05.760> work<00:03:06.120> from<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:07.140> inside<00:03:07.800> of

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
so we're gonna work from the inside of

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.660 
so we're gonna work from the inside of
her<00:03:08.340> left<00:03:08.610> leg<00:03:09.320> she's<00:03:10.320> maintaining<00:03:11.040> her<00:03:11.220> trunk

her left leg she's maintaining her trunk
position<00:03:12.180> take<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> breath<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.080> if<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.440> will<00:03:13.620> to

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
position take a breath in if you will to

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.280 
position take a breath in if you will to
prepare<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.580> then<00:03:15.060> as<00:03:15.300> she<00:03:15.360> exhales<00:03:15.660> she's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
prepare and then as she exhales she's

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.290 
prepare and then as she exhales she's
gonna<00:03:16.410> bring<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.130> leg<00:03:17.370> straight<00:03:17.820> up<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.209> the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
gonna bring that leg straight up to the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.050 
gonna bring that leg straight up to the
upper<00:03:18.600> leg<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:18.870> then<00:03:19.560> lower<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.950> back<00:03:20.250> down<00:03:20.310> so

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
upper leg and then lower it back down so

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.390 
upper leg and then lower it back down so
what<00:03:21.239> we're<00:03:21.390> looking<00:03:21.420> for<00:03:22.019> here<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.500> control

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
what we're looking for here is control

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.390 
what we're looking for here is control
of<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.970> right<00:03:24.180> leg<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.989> even<00:03:25.980> though<00:03:26.160> her

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
of the right leg and even though her

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.600 
of the right leg and even though her
left<00:03:26.850> leg<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.630> moving<00:03:27.989> there's<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.860> lot<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.400> work

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
left leg is moving there's a lot of work

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.640 
left leg is moving there's a lot of work
going<00:03:29.880> on<00:03:30.150> here<00:03:30.209> through<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.840> right<00:03:31.080> leg<00:03:31.380> and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
going on here through the right leg and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.410 
going on here through the right leg and
through<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.100> pelvis<00:03:32.550> in<00:03:32.730> order<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.209> maintain

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
through the pelvis in order to maintain

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.990 
through the pelvis in order to maintain
that<00:03:33.780> stability<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.950> she's<00:03:35.190> maintaining<00:03:35.730> of

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
that stability that she's maintaining of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.540 
that stability that she's maintaining of
the<00:03:36.570> right<00:03:36.780> leg<00:03:37.050> typically<00:03:37.980> what<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.340> might

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
the right leg typically what you might

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.970 
the right leg typically what you might
see<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.090> instead<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.750> left<00:03:40.110> leg<00:03:40.350> coming<00:03:40.800> up

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
see is instead of the left leg coming up

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.790 
see is instead of the left leg coming up
the<00:03:41.940> right<00:03:42.269> leg<00:03:42.300> will<00:03:42.780> come<00:03:42.989> down<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.470> Krista

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
the right leg will come down so Krista

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.410 
the right leg will come down so Krista
is<00:03:43.860> just<00:03:44.040> going<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.250> show<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.489> what<00:03:44.910> typically

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
is just going to show you what typically

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.979 
is just going to show you what typically
happens<00:03:45.980> with<00:03:46.980> most<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.550> us<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.480> instead<00:03:48.930> of

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
happens with most of us so instead of

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.199 
happens with most of us so instead of
keeping<00:03:49.260> stability<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.220> right<00:03:50.519> leg<00:03:50.910> and

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
keeping stability of the right leg and

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.060 
keeping stability of the right leg and
then<00:03:51.360> being<00:03:51.570> able<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.900> access<00:03:52.620> movement

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
then being able to access movement

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.740 
then being able to access movement
through<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.459> left<00:03:53.790> you'll<00:03:54.060> see<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> little<00:03:54.570> bit

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
through the left you'll see a little bit

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.290 
through the left you'll see a little bit
of<00:03:54.810> both<00:03:55.110> so<00:03:55.890> one<00:03:56.280> nice<00:03:56.580> way<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:56.880> think<00:03:57.030> about

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
of both so one nice way to think about

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.690 
of both so one nice way to think about
this<00:03:57.600> is<00:03:57.780> if<00:03:57.900> we<00:03:58.050> can<00:03:58.230> connect<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.920> left<00:03:59.250> sit

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
this is if we can connect the left sit

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.690 
this is if we can connect the left sit
bone<00:03:59.730> to<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.750> right<00:04:01.019> sit<00:04:01.410> bone<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.550> the

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
bone to the right sit bone so that the

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.610 
bone to the right sit bone so that the
activation<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.510> starting<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.260> pelvic

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
activation is starting in the pelvic

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.860 
activation is starting in the pelvic
floor<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.610> deeper<00:04:05.940> core<00:04:06.209> muscles<00:04:06.660> and

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
floor and the deeper core muscles and

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.680 
floor and the deeper core muscles and
then<00:04:07.489> creating<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.700> nice<00:04:08.940> adduction

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
then creating that nice adduction

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.530 
then creating that nice adduction
activation<00:04:10.470> into<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.519> rest<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.030> left<00:04:12.269> leg

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
activation into the rest of the left leg

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.600 
activation into the rest of the left leg
beautiful<00:04:13.140> so<00:04:13.590> now<00:04:13.769> we're<00:04:13.890> going<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.040> go<00:04:14.220> into

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
beautiful so now we're going to go into

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.800 
beautiful so now we're going to go into
a<00:04:14.640> little<00:04:14.850> bit<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.120> variation<00:04:15.269> you're<00:04:15.690> going

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
a little bit of a variation you're going

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.170 
a little bit of a variation you're going
to<00:04:15.870> bring<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.049> left<00:04:16.320> leg<00:04:16.530> back<00:04:16.709> into

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
to bring that left leg back into

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.699 
to bring that left leg back into
extension<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.570> she's<00:04:18.720> going<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.900> externally

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
extension and she's going to externally

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.979 
extension and she's going to externally
rotate<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.160> left<00:04:20.549> leg<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.330> right<00:04:21.510> leg<00:04:21.780> can

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
rotate the left leg the right leg can

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.080 
rotate the left leg the right leg can
also<00:04:22.169> be<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.500> little<00:04:22.710> bit<00:04:22.800> externally<00:04:23.550> rotated

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
also be a little bit externally rotated

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.360 
also be a little bit externally rotated
just<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.450> match<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.560> then<00:04:25.770> from<00:04:26.340> here

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
just to match that and then from here

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.450 
just to match that and then from here
she's<00:04:26.970> going<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.210> float<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:27.810> leg<00:04:28.080> up<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.710> meet

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
she's going to float that leg up to meet

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.230 
she's going to float that leg up to meet
the<00:04:29.729> other<00:04:29.880> leg

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
the other leg

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.689 
the other leg
so<00:04:30.810> here<00:04:31.259> we're<00:04:31.500> accessing<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.280> little<00:04:32.520> more

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
so here we're accessing a little more

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.379 
so here we're accessing a little more
external<00:04:33.479> rotation<00:04:34.430> we're<00:04:35.430> also<00:04:35.669> getting<00:04:36.120> a

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
external rotation we're also getting a

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.110 
external rotation we're also getting a
sense<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:36.930> imbalances<00:04:37.919> potentially<00:04:38.639> in<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
sense of imbalances potentially in the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.930 
sense of imbalances potentially in the
adductors<00:04:39.720> system<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:40.830> making<00:04:41.550> sure<00:04:41.759> that

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
adductors system so making sure that

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.939 
adductors system so making sure that
we're<00:04:42.210> looking<00:04:42.569> at<00:04:42.780> external<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.740> internal

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
we're looking at external and internal

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.580 
we're looking at external and internal
rotation<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:45.090> really<00:04:45.479> important<00:04:45.960> and<00:04:46.319> can<00:04:46.470> you

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
rotation is really important and can you

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.809 
rotation is really important and can you
just<00:04:46.740> bring<00:04:46.889> that<00:04:46.949> leg<00:04:47.220> into<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.490> little<00:04:47.669> more

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
just bring that leg into a little more

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.700 
just bring that leg into a little more
extension<00:04:48.539> and<00:04:48.990> we're<00:04:49.110> just<00:04:49.199> gonna<00:04:49.380> challenge

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
extension and we're just gonna challenge

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.350 
extension and we're just gonna challenge
her<00:04:50.039> one<00:04:50.400> more<00:04:50.669> she's<00:04:50.849> going<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.060> take<00:04:51.210> that

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
her one more she's going to take that

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.629 
her one more she's going to take that
leg<00:04:51.569> further<00:04:52.020> back<00:04:52.289> into<00:04:52.470> extension<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.220> see

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
leg further back into extension and see

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.279 
leg further back into extension and see
if<00:04:53.759> she<00:04:53.910> can<00:04:54.030> bring<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.479> left<00:04:54.720> heel<00:04:55.020> behind

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
if she can bring that left heel behind

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.490 
if she can bring that left heel behind
the<00:04:56.069> right<00:04:56.280> one<00:04:56.550> which<00:04:57.210> is<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:57.599> really<00:04:58.289> really

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
the right one which is a really really

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.520 
the right one which is a really really
big<00:04:58.860> challenge<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.990> then<00:05:00.990> bring<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:01.319> leg

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
big challenge and then bring the leg

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.170 
big challenge and then bring the leg
forward<00:05:01.949> if<00:05:02.160> you<00:05:02.280> will<00:05:02.460> Christos<00:05:02.880> so<00:05:03.030> now

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
forward if you will Christos so now

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.490 
forward if you will Christos so now
she's<00:05:03.389> going<00:05:03.509> to<00:05:03.630> take<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:03.900> lower<00:05:04.110> leg<00:05:04.319> into

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
she's going to take that lower leg into

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.219 
she's going to take that lower leg into
a<00:05:04.620> little<00:05:04.830> bit<00:05:04.979> of<00:05:05.130> flexion<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.509> internal

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
a little bit of flexion and internal

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.290 
a little bit of flexion and internal
rotation<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:08.069> then<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:08.729> is<00:05:08.880> going<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.060> pull

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
rotation and then this is going to pull

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.430 
rotation and then this is going to pull
in<00:05:09.419> a<00:05:09.479> little<00:05:09.659> more<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:09.990> medial

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
in a little more of the medial

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.040 
in a little more of the medial
quadriceps<00:05:11.250> as<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:12.030> exhale<00:05:12.449> so<00:05:12.750> she<00:05:12.810> could

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
quadriceps as you exhale so she could

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.230 
quadriceps as you exhale so she could
medially<00:05:13.620> rotate<00:05:14.099> that<00:05:14.310> upper<00:05:14.669> leg<00:05:14.849> as<00:05:15.000> well

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
medially rotate that upper leg as well

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.189 
medially rotate that upper leg as well
and<00:05:15.539> then<00:05:16.050> float<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.800> lower<00:05:16.979> leg<00:05:17.280> up<00:05:17.550> good<00:05:18.199> we

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
and then float the lower leg up good we

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.680 
and then float the lower leg up good we
also<00:05:19.380> want<00:05:19.710> to<00:05:19.770> pay<00:05:19.949> attention<00:05:20.490> here<00:05:20.729> to<00:05:21.000> what

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
also want to pay attention here to what

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.870 
also want to pay attention here to what
kinds<00:05:22.259> of<00:05:22.349> activity<00:05:23.039> is<00:05:23.159> going<00:05:23.370> on<00:05:23.669> in<00:05:23.789> the

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
kinds of activity is going on in the

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.700 
kinds of activity is going on in the
foot<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.419> ankle<00:05:24.449> typically<00:05:25.289> we'll<00:05:25.470> see

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
foot and the ankle typically we'll see

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.529 
foot and the ankle typically we'll see
all<00:05:25.889> sorts<00:05:26.250> of<00:05:26.310> interesting<00:05:26.699> patterns<00:05:27.389> of
