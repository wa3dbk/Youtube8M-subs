materials<00:00:23.810> fairly<00:00:24.810> simple<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.560> case

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
materials fairly simple in this case

materials fairly simple in this case
approximately<00:00:26.849> 12<00:00:27.240> inch<00:00:27.420> 30<00:00:27.840> centimeters<00:00:28.439> of

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
approximately 12 inch 30 centimeters of

approximately 12 inch 30 centimeters of
not<00:00:29.279> point<00:00:29.550> 8<00:00:29.760> millimeter<00:00:30.269> or<00:00:30.630> 20<00:00:31.050> gauge<00:00:31.199> round

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.470 
not point 8 millimeter or 20 gauge round
wire<00:00:31.740> I've<00:00:31.980> used<00:00:32.309> silver<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.180> craft

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
wire I've used silver you can use craft

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.100 
wire I've used silver you can use craft
wire<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.989> I've<00:00:34.620> used<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:35.010> 8<00:00:35.309> millimeter<00:00:35.850> bead

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
wire and I've used an 8 millimeter bead

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.960 
wire and I've used an 8 millimeter bead
so<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.290> got<00:00:39.740> my<00:00:39.890> wire<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.310> I've<00:00:40.520> already

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
so I got my wire and I've already

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.820 
so I got my wire and I've already
measured<00:00:41.150> that<00:00:41.420> out<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:42.020> I'm<00:00:42.200> just<00:00:42.500> gonna

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
measured that out and I'm just gonna

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.540 
measured that out and I'm just gonna
straighten<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:44.530> makes<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:45.710> little<00:00:45.950> easier

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
straighten that makes it little easier

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.910 
straighten that makes it little easier
to<00:00:46.730> use<00:00:47.000> if<00:00:47.810> you<00:00:48.050> find<00:00:48.260> this<00:00:48.410> easier<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:48.890> a

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
to use if you find this easier to a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.370 
to use if you find this easier to a
cloth<00:00:49.240> it<00:00:50.240> does<00:00:50.390> keep<00:00:50.600> your<00:00:50.750> fingers<00:00:51.080> cleaner

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
cloth it does keep your fingers cleaner

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.360 
cloth it does keep your fingers cleaner
I<00:00:51.710> tend<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.700> use<00:00:52.790> my<00:00:53.120> fingers<00:00:53.510> I'm<00:00:53.660> very<00:00:53.870> good

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
I tend to use my fingers I'm very good

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.850 
I tend to use my fingers I'm very good
so<00:00:55.370> I've<00:00:55.580> got<00:00:55.730> my<00:00:55.820> wire<00:00:56.000> up<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.360> got<00:00:57.140> my<00:00:57.530> snipe

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
so I've got my wire up I got my snipe

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.170 
so I've got my wire up I got my snipe
nose<00:00:57.890> pliers<00:00:58.309> which<00:00:58.520> are<00:00:58.700> leaving<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.030> little

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
nose pliers which are leaving a little

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.390 
nose pliers which are leaving a little
bit<00:00:59.390> swashbucklers<00:00:59.960> out<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.290> way<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.100> I've

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
bit swashbucklers out the way and I've

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.910 
bit swashbucklers out the way and I've
got<00:01:01.610> my<00:01:01.730> 8<00:01:02.000> millimeter<00:01:02.750> bead<00:01:03.170> really<00:01:03.770> nice

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
got my 8 millimeter bead really nice

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.350 
got my 8 millimeter bead really nice
pretty<00:01:04.190> bead<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:04.790> it's<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.030> piece<00:01:05.210> of

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
pretty bead is this it's a piece of

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.969 
pretty bead is this it's a piece of
sushi<00:01:05.510> like<00:01:05.750> I<00:01:05.930> don't<00:01:05.990> get<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:06.290> often<00:01:06.710> but<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:06.890> do

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
sushi like I don't get it often but I do

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.749 
sushi like I don't get it often but I do
like<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:07.840> I'm<00:01:08.840> gonna<00:01:09.080> put<00:01:09.260> my<00:01:09.380> bead<00:01:09.530> into<00:01:10.310> the

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
like it I'm gonna put my bead into the

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.520 
like it I'm gonna put my bead into the
middle<00:01:11.119> of<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.450> wire<00:01:11.630> now<00:01:11.840> if<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.110> find<00:01:12.380> it

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
middle of the wire now if you find it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.620 
middle of the wire now if you find it
easier<00:01:13.000> measuring<00:01:14.000> your<00:01:14.090> wire<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.509> the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
easier measuring your wire to the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.600 
easier measuring your wire to the
central<00:01:15.020> point<00:01:15.229> puts<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.619> mark<00:01:15.890> on<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:16.310> with<00:01:16.580> a

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
central point puts a mark on it with a

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.880 
central point puts a mark on it with a
sharpie<00:01:16.790> or<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.540> felt<00:01:17.810> pen<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:18.770> know

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
sharpie or a felt pen so that you know

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.460 
sharpie or a felt pen so that you know
where<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.070> put<00:01:19.250> your<00:01:19.400> bead<00:01:19.900> once<00:01:20.900> you<00:01:21.050> beads<00:01:21.259> in

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
where to put your bead once you beads in

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.910 
where to put your bead once you beads in
the<00:01:21.560> middle

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
the middle

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.550 
the middle
you<00:01:22.910> could<00:01:23.210> try<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:23.600> put<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:23.840> on<00:01:23.960> your<00:01:24.200> mandrel

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
you could try and put it on your mandrel

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.950 
you could try and put it on your mandrel
however<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.759> not<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.360> easiest<00:01:26.720> thing<00:01:26.840> to

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
however this is not the easiest thing to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.740 
however this is not the easiest thing to
do<00:01:27.229> because<00:01:27.440> when<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.680> do<00:01:27.830> that<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.880> slips<00:01:29.509> and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
do because when you do that it slips and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.109 
do because when you do that it slips and
it<00:01:29.840> wobbles<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:30.590> it's<00:01:30.860> not<00:01:31.009> good<00:01:31.190> so<00:01:31.759> this<00:01:31.970> is

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
it wobbles and it's not good so this is

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.060 
it wobbles and it's not good so this is
just<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.330> little<00:01:32.570> tip<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:33.050> make<00:01:33.710> life<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:34.040> bit

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
just a little tip to make life a bit

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.670 
just a little tip to make life a bit
easier<00:01:34.340> for<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.090> if<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.930> bend<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.500> wire

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
easier for you if you bend the wire

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.969 
easier for you if you bend the wire
either<00:01:37.250> side<00:01:37.759> of<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.420> bead<00:01:38.600> just<00:01:39.560> like<00:01:39.800> that

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
either side of the bead just like that

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.859 
either side of the bead just like that
now<00:01:40.399> I'm<00:01:40.520> gonna<00:01:40.700> show<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.119> close-up<00:01:41.540> of

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
now I'm gonna show you a close-up of

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.749 
now I'm gonna show you a close-up of
that<00:01:41.929> so<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:42.319> can<00:01:42.410> actually<00:01:42.560> see<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.250> little

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
that so you can actually see a little

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.480 
that so you can actually see a little
bit<00:01:44.030> better<00:01:44.179> what<00:01:44.450> I've<00:01:44.569> done<00:01:44.810> with<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.140> wire

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
bit better what I've done with the wire

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.990 
bit better what I've done with the wire
there<00:01:46.490> we<00:01:46.640> go

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
there we go

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.359 
there we go
the<00:01:47.479> bead<00:01:47.630> can't<00:01:47.960> move<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:48.710> can't<00:01:48.950> wobble

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
the bead can't move it can't wobble

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.059 
the bead can't move it can't wobble
around<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.910> can't<00:01:50.149> slip<00:01:51.050> up<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.229> fly<00:01:51.649> off<00:01:51.860> and

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
around it can't slip up and fly off and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.820 
around it can't slip up and fly off and
end<00:01:52.310> up<00:01:52.429> on<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.610> floor<00:01:52.819> like<00:01:53.179> things<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:54.050> mix

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
end up on the floor like things to mix

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.590 
end up on the floor like things to mix
life<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.250> bit<00:01:55.399> easier<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:56.090> I'm<00:01:56.209> gonna<00:01:56.330> pop<00:01:56.569> that

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
life a bit easier and I'm gonna pop that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.960 
life a bit easier and I'm gonna pop that
onto<00:01:56.929> my<00:01:57.080> mandrel<00:01:57.590> now<00:01:57.740> I'm<00:01:58.310> having<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.759> work

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
onto my mandrel now I'm having to work

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.580 
onto my mandrel now I'm having to work
slightly<00:01:59.240> sideways<00:01:59.869> this<00:02:00.050> is<00:02:00.200> because<00:02:00.440> I've

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
slightly sideways this is because I've

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.290 
slightly sideways this is because I've
got<00:02:00.709> a<00:02:00.740> camera<00:02:00.979> 2<00:02:01.369> inches<00:02:01.640> under<00:02:01.910> my<00:02:02.030> nose

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
got a camera 2 inches under my nose

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.620 
got a camera 2 inches under my nose
obviously<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.619> don't<00:02:03.950> have<00:02:04.069> a<00:02:04.100> camera<00:02:04.630> life's

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
obviously you don't have a camera life's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.130 
obviously you don't have a camera life's
a<00:02:05.750> lot<00:02:05.840> easier<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:07.250> I'm<00:02:07.340> just<00:02:07.520> gonna<00:02:07.610> wrap<00:02:08.240> my

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
a lot easier so I'm just gonna wrap my

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.230 
a lot easier so I'm just gonna wrap my
wires<00:02:09.530> around

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
wires around

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.360 
wires around
and<00:02:11.720> then<00:02:12.050> I'm<00:02:12.200> gonna<00:02:12.380> show<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:12.830> in

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and then I'm gonna show you in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.720 
and then I'm gonna show you in
photographs<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:14.810> haven't<00:02:15.140> got<00:02:15.290> this

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
photographs so that you haven't got this

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.130 
photographs so that you haven't got this
slightly<00:02:16.730> strange<00:02:17.090> angle<00:02:17.540> where<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.810> can't

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
slightly strange angle where you can't

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.980 
slightly strange angle where you can't
see<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:18.620> hold<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:20.060> wire<00:02:20.210> on<00:02:20.480> with<00:02:20.660> your<00:02:20.810> thumb

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
see so hold the wire on with your thumb

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.960 
see so hold the wire on with your thumb
on<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.530> bead<00:02:21.710> it's<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.160> easiest<00:02:22.520> way<00:02:22.730> and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
on the bead it's the easiest way and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.960 
on the bead it's the easiest way and
then<00:02:23.210> wrap<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:24.470> wires<00:02:24.710> around<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.730> like<00:02:25.940> a

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
then wrap the wires around it's like a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.080 
then wrap the wires around it's like a
coil<00:02:26.960> or<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.320> spring<00:02:27.470> we're<00:02:28.460> not<00:02:28.610> crossing<00:02:28.850> the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
coil or a spring we're not crossing the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.420 
coil or a spring we're not crossing the
wires<00:02:29.330> over<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:30.560> when<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.800> get<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.160> top

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
wires over so when you get to the top

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.810 
wires over so when you get to the top
I'm<00:02:31.640> gonna<00:02:31.730> wrap<00:02:31.910> around<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.510> bead<00:02:32.690> so

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
I'm gonna wrap around the bead so

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.130 
I'm gonna wrap around the bead so
grabbing<00:02:34.820> both<00:02:35.210> wires<00:02:35.540> we<00:02:36.170> go<00:02:36.410> around<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:39.110> I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
grabbing both wires we go around so I

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.110 
grabbing both wires we go around so I
never<00:02:39.320> got<00:02:39.710> one<00:02:41.290> round<00:02:42.290> again<00:02:42.650> twice<00:02:43.120> it's

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
never got one round again twice it's

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.240 
never got one round again twice it's
really<00:02:44.420> depends<00:02:44.840> on<00:02:44.930> how<00:02:45.170> much<00:02:45.440> wire<00:02:45.920> you've

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
really depends on how much wire you've

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.950 
really depends on how much wire you've
got<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.850> gone<00:02:47.000> around<00:02:47.210> like<00:02:47.390> three<00:02:47.570> times

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
got I have gone around like three times

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.290 
got I have gone around like three times
that<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.130> close-up<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.820> show<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.060> that's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
that so a close-up to show you that's

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.880 
that so a close-up to show you that's
the<00:02:50.450> first<00:02:50.480> time<00:02:50.930> around<00:02:51.080> -<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.500> way<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.620> looks

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
the first time around - the way it looks

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.820 
the first time around - the way it looks
and<00:02:52.270> then<00:02:53.270> I've<00:02:53.540> got<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.930> second<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.680> can<00:02:54.800> see

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
and then I've got the second you can see

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.000 
and then I've got the second you can see
how<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.250> wires<00:02:55.990> building<00:02:56.990> up<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.650> sort<00:02:57.920> of

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
how the wires building up the sort of

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.340 
how the wires building up the sort of
underneath<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:59.000> bead<00:02:59.210> and<00:02:59.540> then<00:02:59.780> that's<00:03:00.080> the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
underneath the bead and then that's the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.030 
underneath the bead and then that's the
third<00:03:00.590> time<00:03:01.040> now<00:03:02.230> that's<00:03:03.230> about<00:03:03.470> enough

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
third time now that's about enough

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.320 
third time now that's about enough
obviously<00:03:04.430> if<00:03:04.700> you've<00:03:04.790> got<00:03:04.880> loads<00:03:05.030> why<00:03:05.270> you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
obviously if you've got loads why you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.030 
obviously if you've got loads why you
can<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.690> more<00:03:05.900> they've<00:03:06.530> got<00:03:06.620> less<00:03:06.800> way<00:03:06.980> you

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
can do it more they've got less way you

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.880 
can do it more they've got less way you
do<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.340> lace<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.720> only<00:03:08.960> thing<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.260> don't<00:03:09.320> like

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
do it lace the only thing I don't like

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.980 
do it lace the only thing I don't like
is<00:03:10.460> can<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.880> see<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.120> little<00:03:11.300> hole<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.900> we

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
is can you see this little hole that we

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.470 
is can you see this little hole that we
have<00:03:12.170> here<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:13.340> tends<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.850> happen<00:03:14.060> because

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
have here it tends to happen because

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.870 
have here it tends to happen because
your<00:03:14.660> wires<00:03:15.020> go<00:03:15.260> around<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.430> wire<00:03:16.640> that's

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
your wires go around the wire that's

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.850 
your wires go around the wire that's
coming<00:03:17.180> out<00:03:17.300> of<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.480> bead<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.960> not<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.680> bead

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
coming out of the bead and not the bead

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.610 
coming out of the bead and not the bead
itself<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:20.750> slip<00:03:20.960> my<00:03:21.080> ring<00:03:21.290> off<00:03:21.560> the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
itself so just slip my ring off the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.640 
itself so just slip my ring off the
mandrel<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.640> I'm<00:03:22.910> just<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.900> take<00:03:24.410> my

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
mandrel and I'm just going to take my

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.990 
mandrel and I'm just going to take my
piece<00:03:24.860> of<00:03:25.070> wire<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:26.830> instead<00:03:27.830> of<00:03:27.890> going<00:03:28.190> over

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
piece of wire and instead of going over

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.460 
piece of wire and instead of going over
the<00:03:29.030> other<00:03:29.270> wires<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.990> follow<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.260> same

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
the other wires and follow the same

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.220 
the other wires and follow the same
light<00:03:30.710> I'm<00:03:30.950> actually<00:03:31.250> going<00:03:32.060> around<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:33.020> bead

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
light I'm actually going around the bead

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.840 
light I'm actually going around the bead
so<00:03:34.220> I've<00:03:34.730> sort<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.570> pulled<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.290> up<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.850> tucked

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
so I've sort of pulled it up and tucked

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.520 
so I've sort of pulled it up and tucked
it<00:03:38.120> against<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.140> bead

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
it against the bead

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.050 
it against the bead
that's<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.670> then<00:03:42.319> wrapped<00:03:43.319> around<00:03:43.560> there

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
that's it and then wrapped around there

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
wire going through the bead it looks

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.740 
wire going through the bead it looks
like<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.530> beads<00:03:52.740> nestled<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.459> amongst<00:03:53.940> so

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
like the beads nestled in amongst so

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.540 
like the beads nestled in amongst so
I've<00:03:54.840> taken<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.200> end<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.740> I've<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.220> tucked

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
I've taken that end and I've just tucked

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.479 
I've taken that end and I've just tucked
it<00:03:56.760> inside<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.989> shank<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.530> ring<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.340> I'm

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
it inside the shank of the ring and I'm

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.770 
it inside the shank of the ring and I'm
just<00:03:59.670> pulling<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.030> round<00:04:00.239> with<00:04:00.390> my<00:04:00.540> pliers

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
just pulling that round with my pliers

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.570 
just pulling that round with my pliers
so<00:04:01.290> I'm<00:04:01.560> going<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.770> show<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:01.920> in<00:04:02.069> close-ups

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
so I'm going to show you in close-ups

so I'm going to show you in close-ups
this<00:04:03.209> is<00:04:03.420> me<00:04:03.630> pulling<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.170> wire<00:04:04.319> around<00:04:04.770> the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
this is me pulling the wire around the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.270 
this is me pulling the wire around the
edge<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.700> bead<00:04:06.470> now<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.770> you<00:04:07.890> see<00:04:08.100> it's

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
edge of the bead now can you see it's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.820 
edge of the bead now can you see it's
filled<00:04:08.520> that<00:04:08.730> gap<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:09.300> so<00:04:10.080> we<00:04:10.200> had<00:04:10.410> that<00:04:10.650> little

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
filled that gap in so we had that little

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.070 
filled that gap in so we had that little
gap<00:04:11.700> where<00:04:11.910> we<00:04:12.030> could<00:04:12.209> see<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.600> wire<00:04:12.810> goes

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
gap where we could see the wire goes

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.920 
gap where we could see the wire goes
through<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.500> bead<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.830> now<00:04:14.130> it's<00:04:14.340> gone<00:04:14.930> which

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
through the bead and now it's gone which

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.080 
through the bead and now it's gone which
is<00:04:16.220> gives<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.370> more<00:04:17.519> professional<00:04:17.970> finish
