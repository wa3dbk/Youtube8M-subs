00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:56.070

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.290

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.530
 square prew to ob do not see for 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.980
 drink 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:36.900
 the ym the victory is oy yo x for the x 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:40.350
 the lb was worth 11 liberators there we can 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:54.660
 forget about analogue ones 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:04:01.890
 press them from the left and the 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:04.680
 right done that and from here you go 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.989
 set up, for example, to 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.570
 internet with the mouse 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.760
 the xbox one dollar you will select

 You do not want, for example, any 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:44.070
 wrong and it turns off 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:47.340
