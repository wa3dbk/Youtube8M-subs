00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.690
 if you are a fan of nutella do not look 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.820
 not this video thank you 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.650
 this site is a light line message 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.260
 are you going to how to make a brownie 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.300
 Nutella is gone then for the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.520
 purse said you will need 15 g of cocoa 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.470
 a pause is that a pinch of yeast 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.940
 chemical half a teaspoon 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.390
 vanilla extract 200 g butter 150 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.210
 g brown sugar 60 g flour and 2 x 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.710
 200 g of nutella 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.629
 so we come for a statement written off and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 we add flour cocoa 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:46.199
 then we just put the salt of a 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.539
 side and baking powder of the other 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.879
 in fact it does not have to touch it 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.729
 destroys a little yeast salt 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.649
 so we always separate then 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.519
 in a salad bowl we put the 100 g of 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.440
 butter we add the sugar and we go 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.579
 pass that to the round myth for about 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.189
 50 seconds 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.250
 once the butter starts thoroughly 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.340
 we mix everything well then 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.469
 add the vanilla extract and the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.299
 more interesting I want to say the 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:21.119
 nutella and here we come to mix well and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.509
 to finish we add the two 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.869
 as usual we mix and add 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.299
 chocolate flour all contents of the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.929
 first bowl and we come 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.590
 delicately incorporate it that's where the 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.759
 dough is ready 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 we will be able to pour it into a mold 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.929
 so you take a mold or put a 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.280
 parchment paper at the top and 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.359
 have pour well dough 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.710
 so here I am sure you like it said yeah 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.719
 but why did you have a race of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.280
 nutella it goes where in fact you have everything 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.420
 simply put half of the dough 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.630
 and we come 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.770
 open with nutella moods on 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.600
 covers with the rest of the dough and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.970
 now we will go to cooking 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.340
 in an oven preheated to 180 degrees in 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.410
 was worth for 35 minutes we end up 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.620
 right after then then you can see at 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.630
 how much the heart of brownies is 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.209
 melting we have a slight crunch on the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.730
 it's fair and gentlemen it's a 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.650
 real perfect mix between them two 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.540
 gluttony which are the brownie and the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.090
 nutella so I urge you to
