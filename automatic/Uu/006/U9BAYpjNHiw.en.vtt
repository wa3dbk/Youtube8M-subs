00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.099
 hi how about youtube friends here 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.930
 we are in a new video in which they 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.930
 I bring how to make a TV to mix 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:30.849
 pocket edition version and whatever 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.250
 give at 0.8 point 10 point 9.5 and so on 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.829
 good is going to be this server have to 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.629
 go to your router many variants of 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.629
 router but well well there are not many 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 but this the router also depends on 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 what kind of 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.070
 of wise today I have come back after good 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.629
 you can look for how-to tutorials 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:57.079
 know your router in my case 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:01:01.159
 my modem's router is 192 point 168 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.860
 points 0.1 as ordered and it was already put only 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.430
 so he wants more he screamed so that this one 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.440
 know what is my router in this case 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.180
 Well, as you can see, it's going to open up 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.860
 me this one that you dial the modem or a 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.060
 better touch marked type I do not stop 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:25.119
 what is this but good as they see my type 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.119
 from mobile to reese this one 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.470
 you are going to look like there are ones that are going 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.250
 to look like they put their username and 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.200
 and your password or cons and I have put 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.080
 this so there are no problems and that's how it is 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.980
 with the video and everything because now here 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.500
 expose all 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.300
 your password or how much did you know 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.190
 what I have to put in my case 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.110
 we had to put 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:57.260
 this username admin and then password 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.270
 password when he is good can be 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.340
 here as you see first you have to go 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.090
 but even if it has a model 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.730
 artist and if they do not have there then sometimes 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.350
 disappear from this as it is called 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.270
 game options something of the same color 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.370
 but games and applications do not place me 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:20.930
 by itself but something like that but in my case 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:25.460
 it would be in free way this for not making tone 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.580
 virtual servers but virtual server 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.650
 virtual servers select it in the 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.950
 left side of the screen 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.290
 Well, here, as you see, here I have 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.340
 a server that I had done either more 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.159
 in city ​​which is what he used when 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.470
 I put a world and I can with my friends and 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.930
 this from here to add a plane in 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.329
 the west is I do not know what appears to them but 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.090
 in my case it 's at since the description 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.769
 they put a name they can put 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.359
 craft good minecraft forgiveness yes yes 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.780
 I think we hope that I'm not so 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:06.180
 good to think of two things to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.400
 be writing and talking I almost do not know 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.239
 very good but good here where I did 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.299
 in bonn 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.190
 fort has to put the contribution that 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.639
 you want your friends to put you 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.329
 and you can put the default 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:26.010
 that comes with the mycroft that would be 19 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:30.200
 132 and if they could not put one of is 5 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:35.330
 digits put you put 55 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:42.700
 7 I'm going to put the one that comes from 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:46.459
 football 132 equal here with the same 19 132 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.269
 and then here it tells us format down says 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:54.530
 tcp select it says bolt 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:57.650
 that would be both select what you 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.489
 they put where he is deprived and parents for 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.530
 put the ip here have to go to 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.530
 settings here settings 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.420
 then they will have to go to the section of 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.330
 Wifi 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.130

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.430
 sorry for the train but it is that 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.120
 going through my house forgives a truth 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.880
 in the video 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.680
 good here no longer select your internet 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.260
 or not your wifi is selected and to see 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.690
 the normal ip will go down little where it says 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.000
 ip address here you have to put this 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.000
 in there on the page 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.370
 I observed almost I do not do it so I do not 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.010
 I can worry that you 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:51.910
 want to put or something like that here as 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:54.150
 they saw it was 191 2,168 sorry 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:00.090

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:03.090
 points 0.12 and here can our that 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:08.710
 same as you see above if I eat him 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.570
 I say the one of 19 132 I put it back 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.640
 well that's what I believe but to me if 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.640
 It works like this so let's be good 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:23.030
 if you change the transport 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.030
 the configuration good then here 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:33.930
 virtual server 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:33.930
 here as they say do not accept that why 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.860
 because like that one I put one and then 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:46.180

 even as you see here already putting in mode 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:41.840

 always the error of a white level does not 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.229
 punishable server to the new one I hope 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.699
