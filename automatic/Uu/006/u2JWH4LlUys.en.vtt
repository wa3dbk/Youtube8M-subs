over<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.239> head<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
over your head now if you do it with a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
over your head now if you do it with a
player<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.070> 4<00:00:47.340> star<00:00:47.579> skills<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.030> less<00:00:48.180> you'll

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
player with 4 star skills or less you'll

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
player with 4 star skills or less you'll
just<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> overhead<00:00:49.350> flick<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
just get the overhead flick and it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.029 
just get the overhead flick and it
serves<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> exact<00:00:51.329> same<00:00:51.539> purpose<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.739> just

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
serves the exact same purpose but I just

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.500 
serves the exact same purpose but I just
think<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.340> umbrella<00:00:53.699> flick<00:00:53.969> looks<00:00:54.239> way

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
think this umbrella flick looks way

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
think this umbrella flick looks way
cooler<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.289> should<00:00:55.469> aim<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
cooler so you should aim to do it with a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.459 
cooler so you should aim to do it with a
5<00:00:56.489> star<00:00:56.520> circular<00:00:57.149> often<00:00:57.449> cost<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> have

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
5 star circular often cost so you have

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.349 
5 star circular often cost so you have
just<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.800> practice<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> practice<00:01:00.090> arena

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
just a practice in the practice arena

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.599 
just a practice in the practice arena
pass<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> five<00:01:01.350> star<00:01:01.379> skill<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.520> if

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
pass it to a five star skill and see if

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.070 
pass it to a five star skill and see if
you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.820> pull<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> off<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.899> easy

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you can pull it off it's really easy

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.469 
you can pull it off it's really easy
once<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> hang<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.880> let's<00:01:06.330> get

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
once you get the hang of it so let's get

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.050 
once you get the hang of it so let's get
into<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.260> should<00:01:07.439> use<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.340> game<00:01:08.670> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
into when you should use it in a game so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.810 
into when you should use it in a game so
the<00:01:09.810> best<00:01:10.049> time<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.640> your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the best time to use it is when your

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
the best time to use it is when your
opponent's<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.540> kind<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.900> rushing<00:01:13.290> towards

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
opponent's is kind of rushing towards

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.230 
opponent's is kind of rushing towards
you<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> defender<00:01:14.310> don't<00:01:14.909> need<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> little

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you with a defender don't need a little

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.999 
you with a defender don't need a little
bit<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> space<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.930> him<00:01:16.049> because<00:01:16.500> it'll<00:01:16.890> make

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
bit of space to him because it'll make

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.130 
bit of space to him because it'll make
it<00:01:17.159> easier<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.850> past<00:01:18.210> him<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.990> he

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
it easier to get past him because he

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.410 
it easier to get past him because he
will<00:01:19.229> rush<00:01:19.560> into<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.220> watch<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:21.090> attacker

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
will rush into to watch your attacker

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
will rush into to watch your attacker
and<00:01:21.720> you'll<00:01:22.020> figure<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> opposite

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and you'll figure it in the opposite

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.289 
and you'll figure it in the opposite
direction<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.670> you'll<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.000> able<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
direction and you'll be able to

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.170 
direction and you'll be able to
accelerate<00:01:24.689> away<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:25.470> him<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.400> get<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
accelerate away from him and get that a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
accelerate away from him and get that a
bit<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.630> space<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> where<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> find<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
bit of space so that is where I find it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.429 
bit of space so that is where I find it
most<00:01:29.640> useful<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.110> another

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
most useful now there is another

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.960 
most useful now there is another
situation<00:01:31.740> where<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
situation where you can use it and that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.640 
situation where you can use it and that
is<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.720> where<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> defender<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
is like here where the defender is

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.109 
is like here where the defender is
really<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.070> close<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> I'll<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
really really close to you and I'll just

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.450 
really really close to you and I'll just
refresh<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.750> clip<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.170> because<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.340> will

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
refresh the clip here because what will

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.550 
refresh the clip here because what will
very<00:01:38.759> often<00:01:38.970> happen<00:01:39.509> when<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.900> play<00:01:40.140> online

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
very often happen when you play online

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.010 
very often happen when you play online
is<00:01:40.740> your<00:01:41.009> opponent<00:01:41.490> try<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> head<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.479> away

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
is your opponent try to head it away

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960 
is your opponent try to head it away
with<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> same<00:01:43.710> button<00:01:44.040> he<00:01:44.189> contains<00:01:44.670> with

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
with the same button he contains with

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.330 
with the same button he contains with
and<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.509> means<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.049> very<00:01:46.500> often<00:01:46.710> interfere

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and that means it very often interfere

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.520 
and that means it very often interfere
switch<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.149> each<00:01:48.360> other<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.899> he<00:01:49.409> will

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
switch it with each other and he will

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.410 
switch it with each other and he will
instead<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.399> containing<00:01:50.970> instead<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
instead be be containing instead of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.300 
instead be be containing instead of
being<00:01:51.630> able<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.020> head<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> away<00:01:52.740> because<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
being able to head it away because the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.149 
being able to head it away because the
ball<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.790> close<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> his<00:01:54.360> defender<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
ball is so close to his defender and

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.679 
ball is so close to his defender and
basically<00:01:56.159> you'll<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.850> able<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.570> of

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
basically you'll be able to get a bit of

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.630 
basically you'll be able to get a bit of
space<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> turn<00:01:58.500> around<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.189> shot<00:01:59.610> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
space and turn around and get a shot in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.120 
space and turn around and get a shot in
so<00:02:00.000> you'll<00:02:00.180> not<00:02:00.390> pull<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.020> off<00:02:01.140> perfectly<00:02:01.469> but

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
so you'll not pull it off perfectly but

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.920 
so you'll not pull it off perfectly but
you'll<00:02:02.310> still<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.729> able<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.119> get<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> bit<00:02:03.899> of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you'll still be able to get a bit of

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230 
you'll still be able to get a bit of
space<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.469> take<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> shot<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.969> pretty

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
space and take a shot so that is pretty

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.180 
space and take a shot so that is pretty
much<00:02:06.390> all<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.110> tutorial<00:02:07.290> guys<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.950> hope

you learned something from it and now we

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.660 
you learned something from it and now we
got<00:02:10.170> into<00:02:10.470> why<00:02:10.709> I'm<00:02:10.770> kind<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.160> ending<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
got into why I'm kind of ending the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.559 
got into why I'm kind of ending the
series<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
series is that

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.110 
series is that
um<00:02:12.659> I'm<00:02:13.530> at<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.249> moment<00:02:14.519> I'm<00:02:14.579> having<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.939> really

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
um I'm at the moment I'm having a really

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.179 
um I'm at the moment I'm having a really
difficult<00:02:15.209> time<00:02:15.629> thinking<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.349> new<00:02:16.650> content

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
difficult time thinking of new content

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.009 
difficult time thinking of new content
the<00:02:17.340> new<00:02:17.670> skill<00:02:17.939> moves<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.299> combos<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.659> show

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
the new skill moves and combos to show

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.160 
the new skill moves and combos to show
off<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:20.459> feel<00:02:20.999> it'll<00:02:21.510> kind<00:02:21.719> of<00:02:21.780> lower<00:02:21.989> my

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
off and I feel it'll kind of lower my

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.379 
off and I feel it'll kind of lower my
content<00:02:22.620> if<00:02:22.799> I<00:02:23.010> try<00:02:23.400> keep<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.849> thinking<00:02:24.239> of

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
content if I try keep on thinking of

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.209 
content if I try keep on thinking of
stuff<00:02:24.629> because<00:02:24.959> sometimes<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.980> quite

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
stuff because sometimes it can be quite

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.369 
stuff because sometimes it can be quite
difficult<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.879> I'd<00:02:27.239> much<00:02:27.540> rather<00:02:27.599> wait<00:02:28.349> for

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
difficult and I'd much rather wait for

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.559 
difficult and I'd much rather wait for
FIFA<00:02:28.769> 14<00:02:29.129> because<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.939> know<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.269> all<00:02:30.389> new

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
FIFA 14 because you know with all new

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.270 
FIFA 14 because you know with all new
fevers<00:02:30.989> there's<00:02:31.200> usually<00:02:31.409> new<00:02:31.799> skill<00:02:32.069> moves

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
fevers there's usually new skill moves

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.369 
fevers there's usually new skill moves
and<00:02:32.430> new<00:02:32.579> skill<00:02:32.879> combos<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.269> can<00:02:33.389> pull<00:02:33.569> off<00:02:33.719> so

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
and new skill combos you can pull off so

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.830 
and new skill combos you can pull off so
I'd<00:02:34.530> much<00:02:34.769> rather<00:02:35.189> wait<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:35.969> that<00:02:36.329> point<00:02:36.719> in

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
I'd much rather wait for that point in

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.959 
I'd much rather wait for that point in
time<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.319> then<00:02:37.439> started<00:02:37.829> up<00:02:37.950> again<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.430> then

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
time and then started up again and then

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.509 
time and then started up again and then
like<00:02:39.510> try<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.079> learn<00:02:40.379> new<00:02:40.439> guys<00:02:40.829> new<00:02:41.099> stuff<00:02:41.370> in

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
like try and learn new guys new stuff in

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.039 
like try and learn new guys new stuff in
