00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
loosen that to take the tension off see
right<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:07.170> screw<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.979> loose<00:01:08.630> my

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
right there that screw is loose my

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.170 
right there that screw is loose my
finger<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.200> pointing<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:11.000> but<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.119> not

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.130 

that's<00:02:27.160> how<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.370> get<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.550> carriage<00:02:27.790> assembly

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.480 

to<00:02:32.140> remove<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.620> belt<00:02:32.830> once<00:02:33.069> you<00:02:33.160> get<00:02:33.340> the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
to remove the belt once you get the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.820 
to remove the belt once you get the
carriage<00:02:33.760> assembly<00:02:34.180> out<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:35.290> turn<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.680> over

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
carriage assembly out just turn it over

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.410 
carriage assembly out just turn it over
and<00:02:38.160> there's<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.190> little<00:02:39.370> diagram<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:39.910> shows

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
and there's a little diagram here shows

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.460 
and there's a little diagram here shows
you<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.170> ridges<00:02:42.420> for<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.510> belt<00:02:46.200> should<00:02:47.200> be<00:02:47.260> on

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
you the ridges for the belt should be on

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.740 
you the ridges for the belt should be on
this<00:02:47.620> side<00:02:47.920> should<00:02:48.820> match<00:02:49.000> up<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.390> side<00:02:49.630> in

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
this side should match up this side in

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.890 
this side should match up this side in
the<00:02:49.840> Schatz<00:02:50.140> I'd<00:02:51.180> guess<00:02:52.180> one<00:02:52.390> side<00:02:52.630> is

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
the Schatz I'd guess one side is

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.080 
the Schatz I'd guess one side is
vertical<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:53.920> other<00:02:54.040> side<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.310> horizontal

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
vertical and other side is horizontal

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.729 
vertical and other side is horizontal
the<00:02:55.150> horizontal<00:02:55.690> side<00:02:55.900> has<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.290> line<00:02:56.440> up<00:02:56.590> on

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
the horizontal side has to line up on

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.470 
the horizontal side has to line up on
this<00:02:56.950> way<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:58.000> side<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.530> vertical<00:03:00.480> tread

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
this way this side the vertical tread

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.780 
this way this side the vertical tread
has<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.900> go<00:03:02.020> on<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.530> side<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.040> then<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.580> belt

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
has to go on this side and then the belt

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.780 
has to go on this side and then the belt
just<00:03:03.970> slides<00:03:05.190> within<00:03:06.190> here<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.500> then<00:03:08.790> easily

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
just slides within here and then easily

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.090 
just slides within here and then easily
comes<00:03:10.120> out<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:11.440> replacement<00:03:13.890> hook<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:15.010> up

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
comes out for replacement hook it up

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.910 
comes out for replacement hook it up
right<00:03:15.280> at<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.430> edge<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.110> lines<00:03:17.320> up<00:03:17.530> just

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
right at the edge so it lines up just

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.450 
right at the edge so it lines up just
like<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.550> that<00:03:19.060> diagram
