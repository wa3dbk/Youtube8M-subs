00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
I got to show you a chem cloud today

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.539 
I got to show you a chem cloud today
that<00:00:02.520> blew<00:00:02.700> my<00:00:02.730> mind<00:00:03.740> check<00:00:04.740> out<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.100> real<00:00:05.279> Kim

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
clouds now take a look at this cam cloud

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.210 
clouds now take a look at this cam cloud
look<00:00:27.689> at<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.019> thing<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.619> like<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> giant

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
look at this thing it's like a giant

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:38.630 
look at this thing it's like a giant
shelf<00:00:29.789> cloud<00:00:31.130> look<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:36.920> like<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.219> can't

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
shelf cloud look at that like I can't

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.850 
shelf cloud look at that like I can't
fathom<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.660> people<00:00:40.020> would<00:00:40.170> wake<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.649> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
fathom the people would wake up this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.310 
fathom the people would wake up this
morning<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.550> look<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> window<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
morning and look out the window and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.380 
morning and look out the window and
think<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> real<00:00:44.280> cloud<00:00:47.149> look<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.239> this

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
think this is a real cloud look at this

00:00:48.390 --> 00:01:18.340 
think this is a real cloud look at this
thing

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:31.429 

how<00:01:19.350> weird<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.460> chem<00:01:20.790> cloud<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:30.439> again

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
how weird this chem cloud is again

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:39.360 
how weird this chem cloud is again
there's<00:01:31.680> Mother<00:01:31.950> Nature<00:01:32.430> down<00:01:32.700> below

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.810 

there's<00:01:40.370> mother<00:01:40.700> nature<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.480> cumulus<00:01:42.080> heads

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
there's mother nature the cumulus heads

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.540 
there's mother nature the cumulus heads
and<00:01:43.820> then<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.210> Jeep<00:01:44.840> giant<00:01:45.800> shelf<00:01:46.220> beast<00:01:48.550> man

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
and then this Jeep giant shelf beast man

00:01:49.550 --> 00:02:26.530 
and then this Jeep giant shelf beast man
made<00:01:49.910> him<00:01:50.450> cloud<00:01:50.750> look<00:01:51.080> at<00:01:51.200> this

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540

look<00:02:32.820> at<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.210> chem<00:02:33.480> cloud<00:02:34.190> can't<00:02:35.190> get<00:02:35.370> enough

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
look at that chem cloud can't get enough

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.340 
look at that chem cloud can't get enough
of<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> huge<00:02:39.180> thunderstorm<00:02:40.140> last

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
of that with a huge thunderstorm last

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.170 
of that with a huge thunderstorm last
night<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.740> was<00:02:40.800> lightning<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.580> knew<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:41.970> was

harp testing then I wake up this morning

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.530 
harp testing then I wake up this morning
and<00:02:45.650> there's<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.920> beast<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.060> chemical<00:02:48.270> out

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and there's this beast of a chemical out

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.700 
and there's this beast of a chemical out
on<00:02:48.780> top<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.260> Al<00:02:49.590> again<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> again<00:02:55.110> check<00:02:55.530> out

on top of Al again and again check out

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.640 
on top of Al again and again check out
this<00:02:55.980> other<00:02:56.220> cem<00:02:56.610> cloud<00:02:56.910> right<00:02:57.270> here<00:03:00.650> good

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
this other cem cloud right here good

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.460 
this other cem cloud right here good
ugly<00:03:02.220> thing

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.010
