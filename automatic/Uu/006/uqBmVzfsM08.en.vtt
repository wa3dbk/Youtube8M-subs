note<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.680> not<00:02:24.739> standoff<00:02:25.400> not<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:26.720> looks

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
note this is not standoff not it's looks

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:36.280 
note this is not standoff not it's looks
like<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.500> medium<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:31.040> then<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:34.040> next<00:02:34.489> one<00:02:35.290> and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
like a medium and then this next one and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:48.520 
like a medium and then this next one and
then<00:02:39.010> next<00:02:40.010> mark<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.680> now<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:47.290> odds<00:02:48.290> are

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
then next mark and now this odds are

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.110 
then next mark and now this odds are
open<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.550> then<00:02:50.060> my<00:02:51.019> idea<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.400> idle<00:02:52.910> to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
open and then my idea is the idle to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.650 
open and then my idea is the idle to
paint<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.470> here<00:02:54.739> but<00:02:55.070> this<00:02:55.970> might<00:02:56.269> be

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
paint that in here but this might be

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.860 
paint that in here but this might be
quite<00:02:56.900> tight<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:59.590> let's<00:03:00.590> look<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:02.450> if<00:03:02.630> I

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
quite tight and let's look that if I

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.280 
quite tight and let's look that if I
hammer<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.709> little<00:03:04.040> bit<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:04.400> ball<00:03:04.700> step<00:03:05.290> how

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
hammer a little bit this ball step how

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:16.150 
hammer a little bit this ball step how
to<00:03:06.320> help<00:03:07.329> more<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.660> marine<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.799> tight

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
to help more a marine and this is tight

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.330 
to help more a marine and this is tight
and<00:03:16.519> then<00:03:16.790> I'll<00:03:17.030> take<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:18.549> opposite<00:03:19.549> side

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
and then I'll take that opposite side

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.900 
and then I'll take that opposite side
there<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:24.640> there<00:03:25.640> is<00:03:25.820> a<00:03:25.989> message<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:28.850> is

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
there is there is a message that it is

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.360 
there is there is a message that it is

only so die except I refused then a

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.229 
only so die except I refused then a
little<00:03:34.370> bit<00:03:34.519> my<00:03:34.790> screwdriver<00:03:35.390> next<00:03:37.150> okay<00:03:38.150> and

little bit my screwdriver next okay and

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.530 
little bit my screwdriver next okay and
then<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.630> have<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:39.110> flat<00:03:39.470> screwdriver<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:41.090> I

carefully assess that in here and then I

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.259 
carefully assess that in here and then I
start<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.140> pin<00:03:49.239> carefully<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.570> all<00:03:50.840> others

sensor status nice gas get in here and
this<00:04:18.530> is<00:04:18.799> this<00:04:19.070> sensor<00:04:19.549> array<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:22.070> we

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
this is this sensor array and and we

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.940 
this is this sensor array and and we
looked<00:04:22.610> at<00:04:22.850> part<00:04:24.040> is<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.780> p.m.<00:04:26.780> is<00:04:26.960> logo<00:04:27.500> and

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
looked at part is this p.m. is logo and

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.640 
looked at part is this p.m. is logo and
manufacturer<00:04:28.880> is<00:04:29.060> hello<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.730> this<00:04:31.730> part<00:04:32.150> is

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
manufacturer is hello and this part is

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.390 
manufacturer is hello and this part is
made<00:04:33.650> in<00:04:33.680> Germany<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:35.710> this<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.919> this<00:04:37.130> oil

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
made in Germany and this is this oil

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.280 
made in Germany and this is this oil
level<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.690> part

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
level and this part

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.470 
level and this part
Terk<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:41.240> then<00:04:41.450> oil<00:04:41.800> goes<00:04:42.800> down

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
Terk so that that then oil goes down

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.540 
Terk so that that then oil goes down
there<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.510> small<00:04:44.900> sensor<00:04:45.590> in<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.950> insert<00:04:46.310> and

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
there a small sensor in the insert and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.350 
there a small sensor in the insert and
then<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:47.510> sends<00:04:47.810> message<00:04:48.410> through<00:04:49.370> those

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
then it sends message through those

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.960 
then it sends message through those
metallic<00:04:50.780> pins<00:04:51.260> that<00:04:51.530> hey<00:04:52.220> now<00:04:52.700> they're

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
metallic pins that hey now they're

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.719 
metallic pins that hey now they're
spawning<00:04:53.360> message<00:04:53.840> that<00:04:54.110> we<00:04:54.919> have<00:04:55.130> shortage

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
spawning message that we have shortage

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.020 
spawning message that we have shortage
and<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.330> log<00:04:56.810> whole<00:04:57.229> level<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:58.160> then<00:04:58.610> we<00:04:58.820> need

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
and to log whole level and then we need

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.170 
and to log whole level and then we need
that<00:04:59.360> oil<00:04:59.540> and<00:04:59.960> all<00:05:00.169> goes<00:05:00.740> up<00:05:01.070> and<00:05:01.820> then<00:05:01.970> this

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
that oil and all goes up and then this

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.130 
that oil and all goes up and then this
sensor<00:05:02.890> becomes<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:04.310> active<00:05:04.550> status<00:05:05.419> like

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
sensor becomes the active status like

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.180 
sensor becomes the active status like
off<00:05:06.560> smokers<00:05:07.510> okay<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.720> that<00:05:09.440> kind<00:05:09.740> of<00:05:09.830> part
