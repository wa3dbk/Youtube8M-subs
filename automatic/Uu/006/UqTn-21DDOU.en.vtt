00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.599
 aha good afternoon welcome and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.480
 welcome everyone and this second day 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.200
 from this surely on to it will be a long 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.810
 and a fruitful day of dialogue to see 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.000
 if we can solve this minuscule 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.120
 crisis that has a sector of the country yesterday 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.089
 as a sector of that stabilizer I 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.769
 accused of intolerant taste when I go in 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.440
 vote is going to bring guys that I do not 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:44.429
 lets talk but good today I decided 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.649
 give up the microphone so that some of the 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.079
 comrade is the word of the program 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.940
 good afternoon gentlemen what happens is that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.679
 when I walk they point me with a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.440
 pistol they rob me is their stolen 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.579
 executed they stole my things and I think 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.740
 that the one who is not going to be able to intervene 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.750
 so far it's a shame 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.550
 let's listen to see what the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.890
 next comrade 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.120
 the truth Mr. President is that I was going 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.790
 to be a list to put all the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.500
 points and that but spend all afternoon in 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.730
 a tail looking for six dancers and 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.090
 those things then he did not give me time 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.580
 well I already see the time to me sometimes the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.880
 time I can not reach the next 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.189

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.049
 good afternoon true president 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.640
 I appreciate this excellent opportunity that 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.610
 we all have to talk today with 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.439
 you and well I wanted to tell you that today 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.649
 go through four bookstores looking for paper 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.110
 and to make a list to discuss the 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.570
 points here but I did not get anywhere 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
 side then I memorize them now it 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.200

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.909

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.250
 road for a demonstration and what 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.079

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.610
