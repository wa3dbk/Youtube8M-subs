now<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> custom-built<00:01:38.579> hardened<00:01:39.270> glass

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
now is a custom-built hardened glass

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.170 
now is a custom-built hardened glass
lens<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.200> our<00:01:40.920> technical<00:01:41.280> guys<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.820> athletes

have got together and work to realize

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.550 
have got together and work to realize
the<00:01:44.640> optimum<00:01:45.180> field<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.600> view<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> POV

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the optimum field of view for a POV

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.010 
the optimum field of view for a POV
camera<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.189> 160<00:01:48.000> degrees<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:48.869> exactly

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
camera at 160 degrees and that's exactly

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.200 
camera at 160 degrees and that's exactly
what<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.770> has<00:01:49.880> coming<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> the

you can do that now at the air pro he's
on<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> inside<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.270> 1080p<00:02:04.110> at

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
on the inside here you can do 1080p at

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.459 
on the inside here you can do 1080p at
60<00:02:04.860> frames<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.310> second<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.880> 720p<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.350> are

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
60 frames a second and 720p that are

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.979 
60 frames a second and 720p that are
really<00:02:07.680> impressive<00:02:08.179> 120<00:02:09.179> frames<00:02:09.390> per<00:02:09.569> second

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
really impressive 120 frames per second

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.490 
really impressive 120 frames per second
so<00:02:10.709> there<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.340> new<00:02:11.489> iron<00:02:11.760> air<00:02:12.150> pro<00:02:12.390> 3

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
so there is the new iron air pro 3

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.050 
so there is the new iron air pro 3
lots<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.830> original<00:02:14.160> features<00:02:14.520> from<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> ion
