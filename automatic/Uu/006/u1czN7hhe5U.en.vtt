 So many people are yireotji'd normally do as I wrote thou Singer 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.800
 You do 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:40.360
 However, if you do not find it beforehand and regularly manage it, 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.690
 I can stop it in an uncontrollable situation, 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.980
 If we do, it will go to a very serious situation. 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:52.120
 Usually crowd because they came first case is one touched a nerve treatment 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:56.829
 I do not feel sick when I do neurological treatment . 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:01.660
 That's why I do not even know where my head is . 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:06.400
 But x-rays and bond guys went to the jujube , 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.240
 Take iteunikka also saw the sword that his sins may be alive 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.240
 Let's do it once. 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:20.400
 Then internal cavities 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:26.040
 If you look there is this and this and this so now you see two pictures 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.970
 When the rest of the crown and the tooth so that kind of a new color 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.340
 Appears 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:39.210
 Easy things take on the role of white 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.280
 If white and white lines are in line, 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.340
 Think of it as a crown. 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:52.500
 There's a black space between the white and this, like this one. 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:57.210
 This is a symptom when you use this server. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.760
 I did not know how to walk because I had a nerve treatment for 2 minutes suddenly crown 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.750
 I learned it because it was a lesser price . 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.210
 When I took an x-ray, my wife found it completely bingo. 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.670
 Let's see. 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:15.959
 There are so Crown Crown There are now more get the crown again this 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.880
 I was taking it off because I was worried about it. Let's open it once. 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:27.060
 2 What is this a wake deoni 4 is yet unknown food expend 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:32.370
 It's broken like this if you tap it with your mouse. 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.160
 I worry a heart-thumper, but should be a comprehensive basis anyway hard to write 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:42.360
 It's been like this since I removed it. 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:48.390
 If you have a body to come up above the evidence is weak pull it crystallized 4 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:51.660
 I do not want to eat because I'm so sorry to have you. 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.360
 Remove all of your gums by the side. 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.390
 And contrary to that, I'm lowering my gums. 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:03.840
 I put my gums down and cleaned them up. 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:08.430
 It's pretty. Yeah. Okay. It's sort of like this. Now I have no hair. 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:14.690
 If we say that the roots are fresh, we do not pick them. 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:17.760
 That the roots just fine for you to install it so that the poles 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:23.040
 I 'll make the crown again. 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.880
 Yes. So, from the picture, you see this column going in. 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:31.290
 For crowns letting the wieda that has done 9 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:36.480
 Anyway, however, I found it in the pre- stage of the column 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.860
 If you do not forget , you will not get hurt or broken, 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.840
 I have to pick it up. 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:48.600
 So the crown was before this step because the final pay 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.310
 I'd like to exchange it for 10 years, just open it and open it. 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.330
 To you 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.330
