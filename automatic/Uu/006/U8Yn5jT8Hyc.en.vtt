and that can lead to inflation where the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.139 
and that can lead to inflation where the
value<00:01:57.070> of<00:01:57.189> your<00:01:57.249> dollar<00:01:57.429> is<00:01:57.579> worth<00:01:57.789> a<00:01:57.969> lot<00:01:58.119> less

and of course that can also lead to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.099 
and of course that can also lead to
hyperinflation<00:02:00.759> where<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.689> value<00:02:01.929> of<00:02:02.020> your
