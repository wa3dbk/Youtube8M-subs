00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 or 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:10.280
 hello here Carlita brought a set that she 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.160
 it was made gyan was to his refers was 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.930
 some plump but I liked the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.539
 little detail that she did there with 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.220
 gold and some pebbles all enamel 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.900
 that can see it I'm stirring well 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.140
 easy with the thriller 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.240
 I'm using the carbayera that's short 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.730
 very carefully, of course, the video goes 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.160
 accelerated 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.450
 because it was bringing uprising was already 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.320
 necessary to cut 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.180
 will remove lift here I will pass 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.940
 around those little stones that already 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.490
 it stuck and after the hedge was very 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.270
 Old man, but the little stones, so not 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.850
 I wanted to damage them and I left that detail 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.530
 that is already done there the gold is enamel 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.650
 also so I tried to get him very 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.540
 well the turn lower the most acrylic 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.960
 that can be the thickness because I'm going to 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.870
 overlay an acrylic color to her 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.080
 liked the set that I bring so in this 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.060
 Design A splash of colors but because 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.510
 Of course the essence of it is more 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.790
 different already likes the square ti 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.200
 although I would cite the extravagant as 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.020
 the ones that I bring so I gave him a 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.850
 little touch of what I bring her 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.530
 he brought a lilac nail color and I'm not 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.020
 of nail polish whether it is that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.910
 I preferred to prepare it in acrylic and here 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.830
 I'm going to show you bustillo prepare 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.710
 lilac tone that was identical to the enamel 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.390
 from her for the mixture I will measure with 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.480
 the cuticle pusher with the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.790
 custom one purple and two 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.940
 beige pushers that prepare 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.670
 the last time and ready, the 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.480
 first exactly the tone that she 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.940
 I was looking for 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.930
 let's start here with the splash of 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.660
 colors 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.640
 we are staining the nail of different 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.300
 Acrylic tones you like 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 these are the ones that I chose, I know that and 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.470
 it looks like that red one of them but in 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.310
 rosita not really know why 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.770
 camera does not raise the color well 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.450
 and nothing else we are putting spots like that 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.690
 everywhere do not do it very thick 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.209
 so they do not have to then file and that 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.700
 they are left empty of color in some 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:24.319
 places especially here that I am 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.660
 working on a set and old man and 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.760
 I continue filling with little spots with a lot 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.120
 careful not to climb on the pebbles or 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.830
 the golden color that has already applied 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.500
 even a little more to lower the nail 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.360
 If I'm not struggling so much 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.790
 then I'm going to encapsulate it 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.549
 a little too thin 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.439
 also what I did even in my set 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.090
 and they will see it also after the video 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.519
 of my set 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.560
 was to use gold with the golden color 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.200
 stain the nail 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.650
 so the tones fade even more 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.799
 like a raised marvel the encapsulation goes 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.870
 to be very thin and caring too 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.970
 again that the pebbles do not go to 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.459
 we're trying to save those 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.370
 pebbles and also because I want that 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.150
 remains a just a stuffing and not 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.220
 kill me 3 not to remove and all that 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.560
 I would have had to do and go back to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.360
 hitting pebbles so this I did more 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.940
 well to save time and it was very fast 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.650
 and fill the rest of the nails and lower 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.840
 a lot that acrylic were good 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.210
 thin nails to be able to overpower 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.720
 another way when filing breasts 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.580
 serious of ars are going to see pieces 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.500
 transparent and pieces of colors not 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.960
 we want that, that's why we have to reduce 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.800
 well that critic and the other steps are 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.660
 they know limo one very well and ready 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.330
 here yes I had to do with the denim and 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.160
 very carefully again not to damage 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.310
 the pebbles but it was very easy because 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.010
 it was not so thick in fact if you 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.750
 I teach in a scene how is it that line 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.060
 in that nail that already had the pebbles 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.930
 with the barrel is that very well the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.480
 back to that area and it was not 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.270
 entry to the nail for nothing equal to the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.260
 time to polish 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.409
 to scrape the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.220
 clean and use the vih finish that I 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.720
 gave away hurry in the sea and it is a shine 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.760
 very spectacular I liked it 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.550
 a lot, I'm really finishing it 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.650
 Well the end is not juntitos 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.860
 be thank you for watching the video and even the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.860
 next
