00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
of the Year award in 2009 I think what

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.590 
of the Year award in 2009 I think what
strikes<00:03:46.560> me<00:03:46.680> most<00:03:46.920> about<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.579> his<00:03:48.360> toughness

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
strikes me most about is his toughness

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.979 
strikes me most about is his toughness
and<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:50.130> think<00:03:50.549> that<00:03:50.640> accounts<00:03:50.910> for<00:03:51.090> his

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
and I think that accounts for his

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.460 
and I think that accounts for his
upbringing<00:03:52.170> he's<00:03:52.950> never<00:03:53.610> had<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.910> easy<00:03:54.470> he's

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
upbringing he's never had it easy he's

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.530 
upbringing he's never had it easy he's
had<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.739> fight<00:03:55.950> his<00:03:56.130> way<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.700> come<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.390> where

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
had to fight his way and come to where

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.430 
had to fight his way and come to where
he<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.459> also<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.489> feel<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.230> he's<00:04:01.230> also

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
he is and also I feel that he's also

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.080 
he is and also I feel that he's also
someone<00:04:01.709> who's<00:04:02.070> got<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.280> mind<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.610> his<00:04:02.730> own<00:04:02.850> he's
