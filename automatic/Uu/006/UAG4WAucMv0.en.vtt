might<00:02:27.880> actually<00:02:28.120> have<00:02:28.450> better<00:02:28.630> luck<00:02:28.840> if

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
might actually have better luck if

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.400 
might actually have better luck if
you're<00:02:29.230> more<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.250> tactile<00:02:31.090> person<00:02:31.510> just

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
you're more of a tactile person just

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.190 
you're more of a tactile person just
doing<00:02:32.740> it<00:02:32.860> by<00:02:32.980> feel<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.450> not<00:02:34.600> in<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.930> mirror

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
doing it by feel but not in the mirror

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.530 
doing it by feel but not in the mirror
and<00:02:35.350> kind<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.430> getting<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.820> down<00:02:37.000> by<00:02:37.210> feel

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and kind of getting it down by feel

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.090 
and kind of getting it down by feel
first<00:02:37.990> without<00:02:38.200> worrying<00:02:38.620> about<00:02:38.680> how<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
first without worrying about how it

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.850 
first without worrying about how it
looks<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:40.300> going<00:02:40.540> back<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.140> refining

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
looks and then going back and refining

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.780 
looks and then going back and refining
it<00:02:42.130> once<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.520> have<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.570> feel<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:43.960> it<00:02:44.260> down<00:02:44.790> so

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
it once you have the feel of it down so

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.700 
it once you have the feel of it down so
I'm<00:02:45.820> just<00:02:46.150> taking<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.110> little<00:02:47.140> from<00:02:47.530> either

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
I'm just taking a little from either

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:57.030 
I'm just taking a little from either
side<00:02:52.110> then<00:02:53.110> adding<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.770> as<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.250> go<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:56.040> you

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
side then adding it in as I go so you

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.070 
side then adding it in as I go so you
can<00:02:57.100> see<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.450> just<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.840> regular

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
can see this is this is just a regular

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.730 
can see this is this is just a regular
French<00:02:59.590> braid<00:02:59.680> I<00:03:00.160> must<00:03:00.790> stop<00:03:00.940> my<00:03:01.090> braid<00:03:01.270> there

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
French braid I must stop my braid there

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.960 
French braid I must stop my braid there
so<00:03:02.740> at<00:03:02.830> this<00:03:02.890> point<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.310> know<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.520> can<00:03:03.790> braid

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
so at this point you know you can braid

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.080 
so at this point you know you can braid
it<00:03:04.060> all<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.270> way<00:03:04.360> down<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.720> ends<00:03:06.000> just<00:03:07.000> a

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
it all the way down to the ends just a

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.670 
it all the way down to the ends just a
free<00:03:07.330> braid<00:03:07.570> down<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.080> end<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.410> then<00:03:08.560> you

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
free braid down to the end and then you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.470 
free braid down to the end and then you
have<00:03:08.830> sort<00:03:09.070> of<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.220> half<00:03:09.400> up<00:03:09.670> French<00:03:10.000> braid<00:03:10.240> or

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
have sort of a half up French braid or

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.870 
have sort of a half up French braid or
you<00:03:10.570> could<00:03:10.750> braid<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.080> all<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.350> way<00:03:11.440> back<00:03:11.880> I'm

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
you could braid it all the way back I'm

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.250 
you could braid it all the way back I'm
going<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.090> go<00:03:13.180> ahead<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.420> just<00:03:13.630> pin<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.050> in

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
going to go ahead and just pin this in

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.640 
going to go ahead and just pin this in
right<00:03:14.440> here<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:16.690> will<00:03:16.870> get<00:03:16.959> started<00:03:17.470> on

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
right here and we will get started on

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.280 
right here and we will get started on
our<00:03:17.680> inside<00:03:18.220> out<00:03:18.370> right<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:20.140> I'm<00:03:20.230> just<00:03:20.410> going

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
our inside out right so I'm just going

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.780 
our inside out right so I'm just going
okay<00:03:23.290> regular<00:03:23.890> regular<00:03:24.280> French<00:03:24.730> braid

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
okay regular regular French braid

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.140 
okay regular regular French braid
classic<00:03:27.060> now<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:29.170> one<00:03:29.970> comes<00:03:30.970> sometimes

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
classic now this one comes sometimes

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.840 
classic now this one comes sometimes
more<00:03:31.720> more<00:03:32.200> naturally<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.709> some<00:03:32.830> people<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.670> do

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
more more naturally to some people to do

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.380 
more more naturally to some people to do
the<00:03:34.000> inside<00:03:34.300> out<00:03:34.480> braids<00:03:35.250> not<00:03:36.250> me<00:03:36.520> in<00:03:36.850> fact<00:03:37.180> i'm

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
the inside out braids not me in fact i'm

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.900 
the inside out braids not me in fact i'm
just<00:03:37.720> now<00:03:38.050> kind<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.470> getting<00:03:38.709> around<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.190> using

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
just now kind of getting around to using

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.750 
just now kind of getting around to using
this<00:03:40.180> technique<00:03:40.690> but<00:03:41.230> it<00:03:41.320> looks<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:41.980> cool<00:03:42.010> so

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
this technique but it looks so cool so

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.860 
this technique but it looks so cool so
i'll<00:03:42.910> show<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.150> how<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.360> do<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.720> you'll

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
i'll show you how to do it and you'll

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.860 
i'll show you how to do it and you'll
see<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.230> difference<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:45.600> we're<00:03:46.600> going<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.750> go

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
see the difference and we're going to go

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.630 
see the difference and we're going to go
under<00:03:48.270> under<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:49.390> center<00:03:49.780> under<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:51.370> summer

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
under under the center under the summer

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.229 
under under the center under the summer
instead<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.600> over<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.080> center<00:03:54.030> submit<00:03:55.030> add

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
instead of over the center submit add

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.160 
instead of over the center submit add
some<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.200> side<00:03:56.470> bring<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.160> under<00:03:57.810> add<00:03:58.810> some

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
some of the side bring it under add some

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.000 
some of the side bring it under add some
over<00:03:59.440> here<00:04:00.570> bring<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.690> under

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
over here bring it under

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.880 
over here bring it under
that's<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.280> over<00:04:05.580> here<00:04:07.910> bring<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.060> under<00:04:09.890> we're

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
that's it over here bring it under we're

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.350 
that's it over here bring it under we're
not<00:04:11.010> going<00:04:11.040> for<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.490> perfect<00:04:11.670> bright<00:04:12.120> today

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360

guys<00:04:12.630> I'm<00:04:12.959> just<00:04:13.170> teaching<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> technique

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
guys I'm just teaching you the technique

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.819 
guys I'm just teaching you the technique
so<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.610> can<00:04:14.760> practice<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:16.410> takes<00:04:16.650> a

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
so that you can practice it it takes a

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.530 
so that you can practice it it takes a
while<00:04:16.980> though<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.700> get<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:17.970> down<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.209> where

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
while though to get it down to where

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.820 
while though to get it down to where
your<00:04:19.320> braids<00:04:19.560> actually<00:04:20.040> look<00:04:21.030> good<00:04:21.590> but<00:04:22.590> um

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
your braids actually look good but um

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
you can see what I'm doing here I'm

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.140 
you can see what I'm doing here I'm
taking<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:25.020> little<00:04:25.050> bit<00:04:25.880> adding<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.000> the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
taking a little bit adding it to the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.090 
taking a little bit adding it to the
outside<00:04:27.180> pieces<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:28.020> then<00:04:28.110> bring<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.680> under

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
outside pieces and then bring it under

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.210 
outside pieces and then bring it under
the<00:04:29.340> centerpiece<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.360> then<00:04:30.740> doing<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:31.919> on<00:04:32.100> the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
the centerpiece and then doing it on the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.770 
the centerpiece and then doing it on the
other<00:04:32.340> side<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:36.110> if<00:04:37.110> you'll<00:04:37.470> notice<00:04:38.780> this

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
other side and if you'll notice this

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.780 
other side and if you'll notice this
braid<00:04:40.110> sits<00:04:40.919> on<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.460> outside<00:04:41.940> on<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.990> top<00:04:43.790> it
