00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.040
 your face guessed it all that emotion 5 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.380
 a lost from pec zwolle in final 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.299
 you are incredible water is not that 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.480
 right emotion 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.480
 Yes 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.119
 really disappointed resolution down 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.730
 It actually says you can actually do it that way 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.010
 fast on a 0 prevents nice scenario 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.170
 you can not think of course and that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.050
 you actually leave so late to 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.500
 finally because that ultimately also 7181 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.930
 can therefore be very airy 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.050
 wonderful goal that hell van gerven he 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.530
 year I also not for that hopefully the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.270
 winning must be different but one 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 better state king that wish and he stretches 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.420
 started fantastic for you and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 especially for you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.550
 sure chordae enjoy something so 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.140
 fast and of course that's how you make it 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 good in that regard has already been said 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.600
 with the good on our part and what 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.140
 then it happened that was tough partnership 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.510
 us of course this the after you 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.420
 a bunch of malloten 10 minutes 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.280
 a quarter have a break 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.140
 yes then they can also do the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.159
 put pairing heads together because 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.390
 previously it was of course one 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.720
 sledgehammer is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.930
 after 2 minutes on the one tricky then come 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.470
 you get b points and 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.300
 would you have to say every one is in front 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.980
 chance the bass also direct and red 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.740
 follow me they may have four or 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.500
 five hated in the first two or two 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.280
 a some de dani these a chances and 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.410
 was ingo 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.360
 anyway and that was happy with it 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.690
 like our happy just bad defending 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.250
 have in the first half 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.630
 yes my two well you are going to take some more risks 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.860
 and you know I am more spaces 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.390
 can come 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.330
 heap cells tying goal 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.910
 actually that is the fifth 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.770
 coal from which job springs for them 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.869
 performs failed and not for ours 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.280
 falls and you must enforce that 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.660
 We have not taken this whole 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.880
 match not one 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.590
 and therefore 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.259
 congratulations pec zwolle she comes one 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.550
 fat, well deserved weather , what every and 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.800
 drama was of course in the beginning 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.069
 the fire work on the field match 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.989
 was stopped and yes you had there 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.930
 already bothered by where you worked 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.519
 on a somehow 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.440
 well i think it's easy to do that 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.819
 especially if to use as an excuse 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.920
 and you certainly can't do it because 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.290
 you know that both teams there of course 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.849
 suffer from that both go one 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.130
 time goes back in what is not 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.010
 ideal is only a good one if you 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.049
 of course you want as beautiful as you want 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.190
 that gladly so gladly through the 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.989
 natural course and then that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.160
 anyway a break is not ideal 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.049
 and 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.269
 well again it's not left him like 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.540
 Use performance if you don't but it 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.970
 It wasn't just incredible that you did 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.740
 what you do this type of action 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.720
 A small tourist time is every 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.260
 game again just 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.660
 and under b what porter we have in such 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.060
 nice ambience and a bunch of crazy people 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.660
 screw up prepared for you to what extent 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.310
 do you think has influenced your couple? 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.750
 I do n't think it's an excuse we're there 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.630
 actually not that much bother 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.770
 of course it's a 0 for one you want 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.340
 of course 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.050
 that happy woman feeling and then you go 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.160
 said the silence for fifteen minutes 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.720
 not inconvenient, but it is not 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.130
 often fierce to the opposition 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.540
 just want to share 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.430
 the trainer can, of course, just the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.720
 putting heads together that is then 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.690
 maybe my advantage for pec zwolle 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.760
 but then you shouldn't play like that 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.130
 like we did today you have 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.070
 any idea it could be the 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.570
 only explanation for are you we have 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.850
 if it does not perform well that is 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.910
 clear if you have 15 years of loss 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.260
 but you can put your finger on the sore 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.850
 place 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.510
 no I think especially finds it in the 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.350
 First or you because you saw that rose over 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.270
 duels do not live 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.830
 That is why I came to see, of course 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.240
 just in order to have their game is left 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.300
 they just good football time and 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.940
 space it was our fault that it was 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.250
 we gave it to them and that is especially 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.020
 I think you have been the basis of this 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.390
 after justified defeat is next 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.490
 You can already win a championship there 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.130
 Think a bit or what should you do this 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.329
 we can still process it here 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.689
 honestly think about it 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.729
 now want is with a player of 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:25.310
 finally talk how this 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:29.300
 summer can happen and try to realize 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.300
 that this is not permissible for 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.710
 play for y for an ai so there 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.840
 we have to 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.460
 attack me and there we go to 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.289
 match against nice and quiet and we 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.340
 would have liked 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.599
 I said there will pass 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.729
 by writing through that triple 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.409
 of course and that will still be 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.629
 be a slice in the coming days 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.340
 but they will again 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.110
 That button converted to order next week 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.340
 well the atmosphere and the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.370
 and then hopefully nice day out 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.370
 to make
