every<00:00:00.240> second<00:00:00.989> we<00:00:01.230> get<00:00:01.500> one<00:00:01.770> picture<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.460> we

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
every second we get one picture and we

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.570 
every second we get one picture and we
see<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.480> altar<00:00:03.990> octree<00:00:04.799> see<00:00:05.089> what<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.270> altar

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
see the altar octree see what is altar

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.749 
see the altar octree see what is altar
green<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:09.290> left<00:00:10.290> renal<00:00:10.710> activity<00:00:11.429> but

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
green is left renal activity but

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.039 
green is left renal activity but
hydrogen<00:00:12.259> and<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.679> right<00:00:13.889> relativity<00:00:15.049> by

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
hydrogen and this is right relativity by

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.470 
hydrogen and this is right relativity by
renal<00:00:16.500> artery<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.250> we<00:00:17.520> see<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> perfusion

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
renal artery so we see the perfusion

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.650 
renal artery so we see the perfusion
it's<00:00:18.810> okay<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:20.150> near<00:00:21.150> too<00:00:21.560> similar<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.740> art

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
it's okay it's near too similar to art

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.089 
it's okay it's near too similar to art
music<00:00:24.660> perfume<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.560> good

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
music perfume is good

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.529 
music perfume is good
and<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.580> second<00:00:26.970> phase<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.890> charity<00:00:29.789> means<00:00:29.970> we

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
and in second phase the charity means we

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.400 
and in second phase the charity means we
take<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.170> picture<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.980> air<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.669> minutes<00:00:33.410> 30

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
take one picture in air one minutes 30

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.090 
take one picture in air one minutes 30
picture<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> uptake<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.590> tcp<00:00:38.489> and

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
picture so we see the uptake of tcp and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.430 
picture so we see the uptake of tcp and
concentration<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.600> excretion<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
concentration and excretion you see the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:54.290 
concentration and excretion you see the
your<00:00:43.590> steps<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:52.309> we<00:00:53.309> visually

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
your steps here it's like we visually

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.799 
your steps here it's like we visually
able<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.739> milk<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.570> time<00:00:57.570> at

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
able a and then milk it's time at

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.090 
able a and then milk it's time at
Whitaker<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.309> red<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.719> red<00:01:01.620> kidney

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
Whitaker so this red one is red kidney

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.479 
Whitaker so this red one is red kidney
this<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.270> left<00:01:03.750> kidney<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.680> mean<00:01:04.890> left<00:01:05.220> give

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
this is left kidney this mean left give

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.850 
this is left kidney this mean left give
me<00:01:05.640> taken<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:07.970> four<00:01:08.970> minutes<00:01:09.860> four

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
me taken up it's four minutes four

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.880 
me taken up it's four minutes four
minutes

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
minutes

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.480 
minutes
this<00:01:12.250> is<00:01:12.400> normal<00:01:12.820> so<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.620> expression<00:01:14.620> begins

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
this is normal so that expression begins

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.750 
this is normal so that expression begins
okay<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:16.840> it's<00:01:17.409> getting<00:01:17.650> down<00:01:18.570> okay<00:01:19.570> but<00:01:20.760> right

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
okay so it's getting down okay but right

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.649 
okay so it's getting down okay but right
kidney<00:01:22.119> is<00:01:22.659> just<00:01:23.260> going<00:01:23.710> up<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:25.119> up<00:01:25.360> because

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
kidney is just going up going up because

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.700 
kidney is just going up going up because
there<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.020> no<00:01:26.140> excretion<00:01:26.740> until<00:01:27.190> this<00:01:27.460> point

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
there is no excretion until this point

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.640 
there is no excretion until this point
at<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:30.040> point<00:01:30.100> because<00:01:30.910> we<00:01:31.180> give<00:01:31.570> very<00:01:32.170> dire

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
at that point because we give very dire

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.490 
at that point because we give very dire
eurasia<00:01:33.280> classic<00:01:33.759> smell<00:01:34.090> inject<00:01:34.659> elastics

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
eurasia classic smell inject elastics

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.300 
eurasia classic smell inject elastics
and<00:01:35.590> after<00:01:35.890> lasts<00:01:36.250> it's<00:01:36.430> getting<00:01:36.820> down

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and after lasts it's getting down

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.249 
and after lasts it's getting down
excretion<00:01:39.310> begins<00:01:40.240> after<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:41.080> die<00:01:41.259> with<00:01:43.259> this

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
excretion begins after you die with this

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.180 
excretion begins after you die with this
means<00:01:44.500> there's<00:01:45.160> no<00:01:45.910> objective<00:01:46.680> retention<00:01:47.710> no

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
means there's no objective retention no

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.120 
means there's no objective retention no
no<00:01:48.340> service<00:01:48.880> okay<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.410> you<00:01:50.649> see<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.070> OP

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
no service okay so and you see the OP

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.180 
no service okay so and you see the OP
section<00:01:51.580> here<00:01:51.700> recession<00:01:52.600> here<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.890> this<00:01:54.039> is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
section here recession here but this is

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.330 
section here recession here but this is
not<00:01:54.340> known<00:01:54.759> absolutely<00:01:55.270> because<00:01:55.810> it's<00:01:59.340> this

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
not known absolutely because it's this

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.760 
not known absolutely because it's this
is<00:02:00.520> normal<00:02:00.910> this<00:02:00.940> is<00:02:01.240> non<00:02:01.479> objective<00:02:03.000> kidney

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
is normal this is non objective kidney

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.960 
is normal this is non objective kidney
and<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:07.300> other<00:02:08.039> good<00:02:09.039> things<00:02:09.369> with<00:02:09.820> this

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and the other good things with this

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.380 
and the other good things with this
study

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
study

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.290 
study
this<00:02:11.170> shows<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.730> differential<00:02:12.730> function

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
this shows the differential function

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.620 
this shows the differential function
left<00:02:14.080> if<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.500> inverse<00:02:14.890> port<00:02:15.820> it's<00:02:16.090> seven

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
left if the inverse port it's seven

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.780 
left if the inverse port it's seven
persons<00:02:17.170> or<00:02:17.860> some<00:02:18.310> GFR<00:02:18.880> rights<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.989> doing<00:02:20.790> 52%

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
persons or some GFR rights is doing 52%

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.699 
persons or some GFR rights is doing 52%
of<00:02:21.970> GFR<00:02:22.510> yeah<00:02:23.340> good<00:02:24.340> America<00:02:24.880> tuition<00:02:25.209> rates

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
of GFR yeah good America tuition rates

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.060 
of GFR yeah good America tuition rates
so<00:02:26.709> which<00:02:26.950> one<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.459> working<00:02:28.360> good<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.950> is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
so which one is working good this is

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.770 
so which one is working good this is
similar<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.579> is<00:02:30.640> both<00:02:31.209> good<00:02:31.480> path<00:02:31.750> right

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
similar this is both good path right

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.819 
similar this is both good path right
there<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.100> move<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:34.200> succession<00:02:35.230> right

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
there is a move of succession right

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.600 
there is a move of succession right
kidney<00:02:36.600> okay
