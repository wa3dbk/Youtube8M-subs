00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
with that I think they'll be cracking

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.729 
with that I think they'll be cracking
for<00:02:24.040> motorbike<00:02:25.040> exhausts<00:02:25.820> car<00:02:26.750> exhausts<00:02:27.530> and

for motorbike exhausts car exhausts and
I'm<00:02:28.520> sure<00:02:28.730> I'll<00:02:28.910> think<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.239> area<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:29.690> there's

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
I'm sure I'll think of area so there's

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.830

the<00:03:35.930> preview<00:03:36.470> screen<00:03:36.799> here<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:38.110> I<00:03:39.110> think<00:03:39.980> it

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
the preview screen here and I think it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.270

look at that you should be able to get

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.390 
look at that you should be able to get
an<00:03:43.370> idea<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:44.769> what<00:03:45.769> that's<00:03:45.920> like<00:03:45.980> that's<00:03:46.250> had<00:03:46.370> a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
an idea of what that's like that's had a

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.069 
an idea of what that's like that's had a

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
quick buff with it with a comb but I

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.300 
quick buff with it with a comb but I
mean<00:03:48.260> that's<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:48.530> fantastic<00:03:49.100> and<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.870> side

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
mean that's just fantastic and this side

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.490 
mean that's just fantastic and this side
the<00:03:52.310> opposite<00:03:52.610> side<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:52.940> it<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:54.140> stainless

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
the opposite side of it is the stainless

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.539

steel<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.750> again<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:57.560> see<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:58.220> can<00:03:58.370> see<00:03:58.519> you

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
steel and again you see you can see you

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.539 
steel and again you see you can see you
get<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> nice<00:03:58.910> reflection<00:03:59.329> off<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.549> I'm

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
get a nice reflection off that and I'm

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.979 
get a nice reflection off that and I'm
sure<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.940> doesn't<00:04:02.090> come<00:04:02.480> across<00:04:02.600> anything

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
sure it doesn't come across anything

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.480 
sure it doesn't come across anything
