00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.660
 and well there at the post the world spoils them 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.310
 his lives said today people are getting 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.480
 find for a new video on 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.710
 alzette it must redo the guys 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.300
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.740
 new series a small series that I 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.880
 will launch on this famous call of duty 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.830
 since it's a series that has 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.599
 a lot inspired at first I wanted 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.950
 really do it but that's it without too much 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.360
 it's easy 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.160
 and in the end I looked a little 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.630
 I said to myself we can do a little 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.430
 series on that it can be fun and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.540
 that's the principle it's simple it's 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.180
 just that I advise you 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
 by but by my beginnings on their hunger 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.600
 the things that I could notice who 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.339
 can be to your advantage because his shot 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.570
 here there are more displacements than 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.070
 others or rather the classes because 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 that I'm going to start 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.289
 the blaze so the submachine gun types and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.850
 where to look up 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.679
 look at it told me if the passage of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.120
 you guys want to confess to yourself 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.859
 do you have that one frankly 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.089
 when I dodged the body drama 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.170
 In short, here we are today 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.030
 found for a carnage tuto 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.530
 submachine gun of which of course I hold 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.199
 to clarify that I am not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 professional and in no case am I 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 believe for a pro 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 when I do a tutorial like that guys 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.159
 it's like the saying goes CDC is 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.810
 start tutorials to take or to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.130
 just let you guys 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.930
 take them well if you do not 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.920
 do not take too much in hoping when 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.570
 even that it will please you I try 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.770
 to send this video to code cf6 me 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.060
 blood thank you so much anyway 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.470
 for the gameplay it's a very very good 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.760
 gameplay there will be a big 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.140
 rebound to the woman is to see them 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.420
 for why because I actually have 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.040
 had to start a series for the dena good 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.290
 by the way frozen in tamim unfortunately 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.600
 down to the game bat alex fenced and then 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.920
 even in any case I assure you 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.840
 I was dead so that's it 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.400
 so today ben here is tutorial for 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.780
 the machine guns so I have a little bit 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.550
 explained what am I doing when I 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 am submachine what game play 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.630
 mainly and then here is a small 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.970
 little tutorials classes and where 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.900
 debate because I really want to 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.460
 to show you what I can do 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.260
 and we hope you'll like it 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.150
 since you have to know one thing it is 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.470
 that zeus is ben arfa is a new game 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.970
 a new conference and we can say 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.500
 it's a new season in call of 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.520
 duty so that's absolutely necessary 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.140
 learn and play simply so 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.640
 we will start directly with 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.040
 grape shot that I advise the most and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.510
 which is a pretty played but despite that 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.980
 me on ps3 I do not see it very beautiful 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.119
 hang end I see very little is 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.679
 weird is important it's a very 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.569
 very good weapon and apparently on everything 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.760
 any other platform we have a lot 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.099
 a lot of forgiveness it's the km5 guys 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.200
 nokla kf5 me personally there is some 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.640
 many who who counseled us without 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.180
 silent it's true that without 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.400
 quiet 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.150
 it is very effective so it's for 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.129
 that I advise you 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.750
 sensitive to the heavens or with silence - 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.159
 froissart personally I was playing with 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.700
 since that I like being 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.049
 athletic 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.220
 knowing that I explained to you his part 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.689
 next I advise you 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.220
 especially a front handle because on 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.390
 this kind of machine guns bequeathed his box 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.860
 stage but sometimes there are small 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.420
 stuff like that they play and I you 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.950
 just advise a little one a 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.640
 little dagger gossas that's 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.109
 Verry much 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.640
 in fact I advise you all 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.829
 simply featherweight since that 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.450
 remains a machine gun and the purpose of my 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.349
 class finally in general of my technique 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.209
 when I was going to treat these two 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.709
 rocks of phew guys so frankly 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.250
 featherweight is a very very good 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.200
 strategy 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.909
 then my letting then yes of course the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.920
 level is not endless enough high 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.209
 to unlock this case so it's 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.639
 for that I advise you either 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.810
 malaise be frau go-getter and if you 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.190
 do not getter bah voila you 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.389
 choose between the other three assets 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.440
 people may have cold blood too 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.420
 it can be not bad but for the moment 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.670
 I absolutely recommend to the east 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.560
 then third in touba it's not 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.750
 a tough wizard is of course the guys 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.099
 then echoing the skills then that 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.870
 personally i'm practically 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.590
 never but for the few times that I 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.000
 plays I often play exo on 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.010
 overclocking pardon excuse me for the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.540
 pronunciation exactly to an exo who 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.859
 lets us run a little bit more 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.989
 quickly for a while 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.010
 really very limited of course but 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.819
 nevertheless it can be very effective 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.989
 in certain situations and then in 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.819
 district finally let's look also in 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.280
 exhaling sister so in tactical garnet 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.510
 I play for example guys so I 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.139
 you recommend it for example 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.519
 either 17 ex or obviously the iem so that's 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.599
 it's up to you to see it's everyone's 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.400
 strategy personally I play 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.840
 a lot to the paralytic so so 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.840
 here it is also in secondary I put 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.370
 an atlas 45 but that the asmo nerve it me 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.099
 not serve you simply because 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.329
 I advise you a lot to pick up 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.560
 weapons on the ground and often 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.090
 assault rifles guys because to true 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.799
 say on this map that I'm trying 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.169
 to throw a rather tight map but 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.629
 dense in big maps is better to 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.940
 gather twice small small 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.349
 assault rifles then in questrecques 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.199
 So guys we would identify score 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.609
 strict pardon excuse me I put a 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.289
 hacking water system that likes guys 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.859
 we're not going to hide the face and 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.380
 belie m 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.669
 then I put a bombing so that 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.750
 it's up to you personally to see 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.220
 put bombing which course 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.539
 it's a class for carnage a 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.729
 precise game it's not to tempt 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.080
 edena bomble edena good bah I will you 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.219
 explain a tutorial in an upcoming 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.479
 video so that did you see I 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.800
 abandoned 10 with stuff I have not 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.729
 understood the delirium I left direct the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.889
 bombing raid 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.210
 launched after reassure you like the gt in 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.409
 series guys as you can 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.580
 notice I was stuck by the snow and 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.139
 you will see that I unlocked a 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.240
 medal there and it really gave me 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.620
 want to continue here without mercy and 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.849
 when we are together stung all and you 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.719
 go see the pig sequence that I 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.729
 will make you look what's feed 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.020
 then had 26 yet to maintain 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.219
 still the cua of feed so that's it 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.509
 frankly I was super happy and there 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.219
 I do not think it's even even 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.180
 still there that I'm going to get killed but 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.129
 you may notice that it even 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.020
 brel in front of so here you go 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.219
 then I continue shelling 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.770
 if they wanted to make big carnage 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:06.419
 and paladin so paladin guys he is 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.529
 super good as strict but good thing 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.909
 it's still pretty vague 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.889
 on the game you'll see I'm going 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.300
 use it embarrassed seen nobody on the map 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.979
 it was really a waste of time not 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.059
 possible suddenly I was obliged to 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.770
 night time because we were pissed off 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.879
 like rats so voila voila 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.949
 after that it's up to you to see 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:23.580
 then we'll go to 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.930
 the coast and strategic game I you 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.360
 just advise guys when you 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.649
 play the miter and not to jump in 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.629
 the amap because it's something 

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:32.279
 rather difficult enough to counter sarsan 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.629
 blow if you jump too much and especially on 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.279
 maps that are not covered by 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.599
 donations and forgiveness buildings is 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.460
 by the way a lot of backs 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.110
 who will see you and who will necessarily 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.029
 you kill since you are armed 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.349
 simply just one and 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.180
 machine guns and grape shot can not 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.099
 not really have a scope of or 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.099
 fleyhane frankly a feint must 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.659
 really stay on the ground and do not 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.860
 necessarily double job 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.209
 so I advise you double when 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.740
 you saw the enemy when the enemy 

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:57.060
 saw you like that you at least have 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.409
 finally it's left or double everything 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.759
 just not really, that's when 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.110
 you see an enemy that he too you 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.580
 have you can john you are in any case 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.509
 that's my opinion and of course the 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.009
 gas if you want to test a new 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.159
 weapon that the room home I you 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.809
 strongly advise the ASM 1 which is 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.339
 simply a very very very good 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:12.659
 hour I would advise it's at this 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.469
 place in a next video this is my 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.879
 favorite class 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:16.709
 so I did not take in the mood 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:17.759
 gameplay but rest assured in my 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.749
 future gameplay I really think 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.389
 use of weapons because she is 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.379
 really really super kiffante and then 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.550
 I think I already talked about it 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:23.939
 in one of my last videos so 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.139
 here we are 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.370
 does this video show you hours in 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.050
 track my sharing and lakes and is 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.729
 the essential for me it me me that me 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.110
 motivates a lot and I will do the 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.899
 second episode if you ask me to 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.860
 the echa or simply be studied 

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:36.860
 Chubais
