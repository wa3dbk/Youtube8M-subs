00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:52.340 

okay<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:45.430> one<00:00:45.640> also<00:00:45.910> has<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:48.460> that<00:00:48.700> out

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.580 

that<00:00:53.350> will<00:00:53.470> release<00:00:53.770> the<00:00:53.800> whole<00:00:54.160> mud<00:00:54.370> guard<00:00:58.590> in

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
that will release the whole mud guard in

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.350 
that will release the whole mud guard in
this<00:01:00.040> front<00:01:00.700> unit<00:01:01.380> if<00:01:02.380> you<00:01:02.590> look<00:01:02.770> closely

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360

this front unit if you look closely
you'll<00:01:04.360> see<00:01:04.449> that<00:01:04.690> it<00:01:05.080> has<00:01:05.260> these<00:01:05.650> little<00:01:05.979> tabs

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
you'll see that it has these little tabs

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.510 
you'll see that it has these little tabs
here<00:01:06.790> okay<00:01:07.479> this<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.350> going<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.830> prevent<00:01:09.160> the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
here okay this is going to prevent the

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.510 
here okay this is going to prevent the
this<00:01:10.300> part<00:01:10.630> from<00:01:11.290> really<00:01:12.009> pressing<00:01:12.250> up

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
this part from really pressing up

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.550 
this part from really pressing up
against<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.180> mud<00:01:13.479> guard<00:01:13.750> so<00:01:14.290> what<00:01:14.440> we're

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
against the mud guard so what we're

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.930 
against the mud guard so what we're
going<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.740> want<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:15.040> do<00:01:15.130> is<00:01:15.280> just<00:01:15.430> kind<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.670> trim

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
going to want to do is just kind of trim

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.109 
going to want to do is just kind of trim
these<00:01:16.119> little<00:01:16.540> these<00:01:17.050> little<00:01:17.110> gussets<00:01:17.770> out

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
these little these little gussets out

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:28.990 
these little these little gussets out
okay<00:01:19.119> very<00:01:19.900> easy<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:23.170> so

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.300 

again<00:01:29.630> if<00:01:29.810> you've<00:01:29.930> got<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:31.120> an<00:01:32.120> exacto<00:01:32.720> knife

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
again if you've got a an exacto knife

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.650 
again if you've got a an exacto knife
makes<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.550> little<00:01:34.700> bit<00:01:34.820> easier<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.270> get<00:01:35.510> into

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
makes it a little bit easier to get into

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.270 
makes it a little bit easier to get into
these<00:01:35.870> tight<00:01:36.200> areas<00:01:39.010> okay

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
these tight areas okay

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.640 
these tight areas okay
that's<00:01:41.000> pretty<00:01:41.270> much<00:01:41.450> all<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.780> have<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.050> do<00:01:42.200> to

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
that's pretty much all you have to do to

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.690 
that's pretty much all you have to do to
prepare<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:43.730> front<00:01:44.210> one<00:01:44.390> now<00:01:45.170> this<00:01:45.920> also<00:01:46.280> has

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
prepare the front one now this also has

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.480 
prepare the front one now this also has
a<00:01:47.180> couple<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:48.020> screws<00:01:48.230> here<00:01:48.590> let's<00:01:49.070> take<00:01:49.250> a

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
a couple of screws here let's take a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:58.410 
a couple of screws here let's take a
little<00:01:49.940> bit<00:01:50.090> easier<00:01:50.840> access<00:01:51.050> in<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.680> back<00:01:51.860> one

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.270

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
entry holes are lined up with the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.180 
entry holes are lined up with the
factory<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.200> have<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> little<00:02:09.679> bit<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:09.920> play

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
you don't make sure you line these up

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.150 
you don't make sure you line these up
right<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:19.370> go<00:02:19.580> ahead<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.800> loosely<00:02:21.800> set

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
right so just go ahead and loosely set

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.080 
right so just go ahead and loosely set
your<00:02:22.370> screws<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.910> by<00:02:23.480> doing<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.050> loosely

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
your screws in by doing that loosely

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.490 
your screws in by doing that loosely
allow<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:27.680> line<00:02:28.190> up<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.840> mud<00:02:30.080> guard<00:02:30.350> a
