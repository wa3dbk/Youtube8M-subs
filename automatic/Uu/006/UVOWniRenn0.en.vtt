00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.190 
but so far we're gonna look into my
other<00:03:26.890> trap<00:03:27.189> on<00:03:27.579> their<00:03:27.730> game<00:03:27.970> Wow<00:03:28.390> okay<00:03:28.870> yeah

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
other trap on their game Wow okay yeah

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.520 
other trap on their game Wow okay yeah
like<00:03:29.859> as<00:03:30.129> of<00:03:30.459> recording<00:03:30.909> this<00:03:31.329> video<00:03:31.540> I'm

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
like as of recording this video I'm

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.250 
like as of recording this video I'm
still<00:03:33.219> trying<00:03:33.639> to<00:03:33.700> figure<00:03:33.790> out<00:03:34.150> what<00:03:34.780> makes<00:03:35.079> it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
still trying to figure out what makes it

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.740 
still trying to figure out what makes it
change<00:03:35.439> between<00:03:36.120> like<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.269> single<00:03:37.540> and

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
change between like the single and

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.379 
change between like the single and
multiplayer<00:03:38.340> character<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.579> Amy<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.060> chaos

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
multiplayer character like Amy and chaos

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.830 
multiplayer character like Amy and chaos
and<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.139> chair<00:03:41.919> walkers<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:42.939> you<00:03:43.480> could<00:03:43.659> try

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
and the chair walkers so you could try

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.119 
and the chair walkers so you could try
to<00:03:43.900> play<00:03:44.049> as<00:03:44.079> I'm<00:03:44.319> a<00:03:44.349> single<00:03:44.650> player<00:03:44.889> and
