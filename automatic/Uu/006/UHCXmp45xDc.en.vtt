00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.110
 good morning my name is michael 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.780
 swirls and today we will see 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.950
 how to install a video card in 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.340
 hardware and software 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.849
 well the first thing we should have for 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.500
 to be able to install the video card 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.650
 this is the video card and have a 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.869
 equipment disconnected from all energy what 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.610
 second thing we have to do is go 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.950
 download us 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.710
 by a bright and static or 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.780
 putting your hands on a metal by 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.780
 approximately 5 or 10 seconds 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.490
 after this we can pass 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.670
 to that news on the side of the 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.670
 tower 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.559
 there is this metal which we will do for 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.770
 can see to connect the card 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.770
 video 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.960
 we remove that metal 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.740
 and now now we will take the card 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.740
 video 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.480
 and we have to connect it in the slot to 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.820
 gp which is usually brown 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.540
 coffee or in this case that is red color 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.540
 so 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.470
 As you can see we will do that almost in this 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.470
 hollow here 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.710
 another we connect well 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.940
 and now we usually put the metal 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.519
 the metal was put back so that for 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.010
 that presses with a metal that was left 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.730
 here the video card and so the card 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.730
 video was not known 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.160
 now in the next part they 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.230
 We will teach how to install the drivers 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.569
 the new video card 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.190
 and it is very important that when connecting the 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.150
 video card as we can notice 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.299
 now there are 222 female connectors bg to 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.980
 what are those 2 then we have to 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.049
 be clear that when connecting the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.660
 team we have to connect it to the new 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.019
 video card so going to make use 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.019
 her
