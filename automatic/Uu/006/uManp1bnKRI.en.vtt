00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.319
 divide by a number has multiplied by its inverse 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.869
 my attention 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.449
 one is the least outclassed 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.429
 ken surely right 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.549
 with the hammer passage towards the assizes it will change of signal 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.169
 3 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.759
 8th multiplied by 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.390
 the breakout montebourg 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.710
 you will join ensures that the shift 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 they are both in the same table a c4 2 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.330
 so I want to ambush here three years and under three also 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.410
 simplified 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.730
 looking for the origin of it this meaning 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.580
 Negative shark 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 negative signal in in my expression 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.930
 the result will be negative 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.570
 and that did it 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.830
 at 20 hours 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.030
 what does this fight 2 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.870
 - Saturday 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.350
 yet day by day gold so if 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.630
 but no actually it's the judge he said 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.300
 one divided by three in a circle 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.300
 despite this 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.600
 divide by seven on -5 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.290
 sony unfortunately multiplied remains nevertheless within the board 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.610
 I hold anciaux 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.590
 three seventh secure 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.450
 surely interested nothing but the quotient 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.260
 7 cm per year 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.010
 47-21 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.270
 so here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.799
 divide by 15 on -21% it is to multiply the edges of the mersey 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.300
 the book on me instead of lille 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
 in the peninsula 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.370
 three socialists have reached on everything 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.360
 the days ioc occupies the office of the sivom am I know it will be negative 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.979
 it is through this site 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.069
 negative 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.420
 and then if I look at just applying what the flame 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.049
 in the same table 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.449
 here I have to believe that it does not make a recipe 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.669
 for 15 years 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.889
 15 53 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.639
 what will remain attention 3 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.389
 suleman 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.389
 on how much 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:52.449
 - this 11th on me it seduced me no less than 500 rugby board 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.489
 its inverse 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.099
 what is the drop of -5 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.099
 lightening its momentum a nickname 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:03.489
 so here 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.059
 the site of the result will be positive jude if negative this dish knew how to do it 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.919
 it's like that 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.290
 before anything here i'm writing numerator and the denominator under 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.489
 traction form 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 here it was pure business 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.169
 more 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.169
 of gaulle the case of a fraud 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.519
 over a year 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.779
 here I am going to do tomorrow 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.259
 m as denominator 10 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.109
 it's only a few tenths 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.079
 under 25 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.369
 how to occupy your columns five tenths 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.679
 twice five divisions of 55 years is uncertain 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.379
 and at 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.719
 - the King of Pop 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.259
 the more the heart makes me feel good 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.259
 - 1 kas sublime 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.349
 how we are one of the few 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.879
 10th 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.410
 here to sign with the flows the result will be positive 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.539
 divided gold 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.930
 21 10th for 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.930
 serial multiply in his business 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.419
 so we had written to have concluded again that you draw soccer 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.099
 - 1 kas you have to see 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.659
 he is also on the ground 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.759
 I will of course retain as I said a moment ago a result 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.999
 positive since I have two sites 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.840
 negative soccer 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.449
 10 and 6 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:56.409
 turenne 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:57.800
 theater 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.639
 times at 9 pm 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.349
 so be careful ten equal 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.309
 here are all the simplified game modes 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:07.819
 on the Phoenician 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.819
 heavens twice the earth 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:10.490
 good war
