00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
recent memory banged up with injuries

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479 
recent memory banged up with injuries
all<00:00:33.750> season<00:00:34.170> long<00:00:34.380> their<00:00:34.770> trainer<00:00:35.100> may<00:00:35.370> have

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
all season long their trainer may have

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.150 
all season long their trainer may have
been<00:00:35.670> their<00:00:35.850> MVP<00:00:36.510> during<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> year<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.980> they

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
been their MVP during the year but they

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.830 
been their MVP during the year but they
are<00:00:38.250> gelling<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> right<00:00:38.910> time<00:00:39.120> yeah<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.780> I

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
are gelling at the right time yeah and I

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.229 
are gelling at the right time yeah and I
think<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.290> saw<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.700> injuries

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
think what we really saw is the injuries

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.660 
think what we really saw is the injuries
kind<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.110> hid<00:00:43.320> how<00:00:43.559> good<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:43.980> frontcourt<00:00:44.460> can

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
kind of hid how good this frontcourt can

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.279 
kind of hid how good this frontcourt can
be<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.030> saw<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> tonight<00:00:45.600> against<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> Cavs

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
be we saw it tonight against the Cavs

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
be we saw it tonight against the Cavs
know<00:00:46.620> no<00:00:46.829> question<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.670> think<00:00:48.090> right

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
know no question about it I think right

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
know no question about it I think right
from<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.600> outset<00:00:48.629> Adrien<00:00:49.350> pain<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.860> gave

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
from the outset Adrien pain really gave

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.010 
from the outset Adrien pain really gave
them<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> boost<00:00:50.670> Michigan<00:00:51.239> State<00:00:51.510> got<00:00:51.690> off<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
quick start shooting seven of ten then

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.420 
quick start shooting seven of ten then
both<00:00:54.480> defenses<00:00:55.140> settled<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.949> Payne<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
both defenses settled in but Payne and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.220 
both defenses settled in but Payne and
Austin<00:00:56.879> were<00:00:57.000> awesome<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.780> they

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
Austin were awesome they just they

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.529 
Austin were awesome they just they
combined<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:58.710> 40<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> 61<00:00:59.969> points<00:01:00.420> tonight

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
combined for 40 of the 61 points tonight

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.900 
combined for 40 of the 61 points tonight
and<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.170> saw<00:01:01.350> obviously<00:01:01.590> Mike<00:01:02.309> Tobey<00:01:02.760> had<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and we saw obviously Mike Tobey had a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
and we saw obviously Mike Tobey had a
hard<00:01:03.120> time<00:01:03.149> keeping<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.780> down<00:01:03.930> low<00:01:04.110> Anthony

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
hard time keeping up down low Anthony

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.679 
hard time keeping up down low Anthony
Gill<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.830> hurt<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.580> UVA<00:01:05.880> wasn't<00:01:06.600> at

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
Gill was hurt so really UVA wasn't at

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.510 
Gill was hurt so really UVA wasn't at
its<00:01:06.840> best<00:01:07.049> down<00:01:07.290> low<00:01:07.500> tonight<00:01:07.710> right<00:01:08.130> yeah<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
its best down low tonight right yeah and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880 
its best down low tonight right yeah and
I<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> big<00:01:10.020> cause<00:01:10.260> Gill

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
I think that was a big cause Gill

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.100 
I think that was a big cause Gill
getting<00:01:11.280> hurt<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.850> Toby<00:01:12.360> did<00:01:12.540> pick<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.960> those

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
getting hurt that Toby did pick up those

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.999 
getting hurt that Toby did pick up those
early<00:01:13.530> fouls<00:01:14.090> Akhil<00:01:15.090> Mitchell<00:01:15.630> wasn't<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.170> huge

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
early fouls Akhil Mitchell wasn't a huge

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
early fouls Akhil Mitchell wasn't a huge
factor<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.880> game<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.320> those

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
factor in this game so all of those

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
factor in this game so all of those
things<00:01:19.799> really<00:01:20.040> opened<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> paint<00:01:20.880> for

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
things really opened up the paint for

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.030 
things really opened up the paint for
the<00:01:21.380> Spartans<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the Spartans now you look in the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.460 
the Spartans now you look in the
backcourt<00:01:23.549> Malcolm<00:01:24.060> Brogdon<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.869> Joe<00:01:25.170> Harris

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
backcourt Malcolm Brogdon and Joe Harris

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.649 
backcourt Malcolm Brogdon and Joe Harris
combined<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.070> 34<00:01:26.640> points<00:01:27.030> certainly<00:01:27.270> more

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
combined for 34 points certainly more

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
combined for 34 points certainly more
effective<00:01:28.409> than<00:01:28.799> Gary<00:01:29.159> Harris<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.790> Keith

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
effective than Gary Harris and Keith

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.240 
effective than Gary Harris and Keith
Appling<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.750> still<00:01:31.020> those<00:01:31.650> UV<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> bet<00:01:32.220> that
