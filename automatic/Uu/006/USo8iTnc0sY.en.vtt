00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
bass on a regular basis and that might

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.160 
bass on a regular basis and that might
happen<00:03:12.739> with<00:03:13.070> our<00:03:13.280> cast<00:03:13.640> as<00:03:13.940> they<00:03:14.239> age<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:14.930> at

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
happen with our cast as they age but at

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.900 
happen with our cast as they age but at
this<00:03:15.320> point<00:03:15.590> there's<00:03:16.370> really<00:03:16.489> no<00:03:16.820> need<00:03:16.850> to

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
the dogs on the other hand probably get

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.230
