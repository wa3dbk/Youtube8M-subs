 Ever since childhood, Sydney Young has dreamed of fascinating life. 

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.956
 Party Social. Hollywoodské celebrity. 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.968
 Celebrity? You pull your breasts and you're a celebrity. 

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:16.340
 Do you think it depends on your breasts? 

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.123
 By day, until he had a phone call. 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.225
 Which changed his life. 

00:00:21.652 --> 00:00:22.418
 - Sydney Young. - Sydney. 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.843
 Sydney, I'd like you to work for me at Sharp Magazine in New York. 

00:00:28.874 --> 00:00:30.243
 That's your chance. 

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:32.642
 This magazine is a window to the party. 

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:37.243
 I work for one periodical you may know. Sharp Magazine. 

00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:39.513
 It's a library card. 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.331
 This is your new rookie. Do something with him. 

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:45.343
 From MGM Pictures ... 

00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:49.484
 So you're an actress. I would definitely give you a vote for the best dress. 

00:00:49.724 --> 00:00:52.499
 I'm sorry, but I don't understand your accent. 

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:56.000
 This is New York, Sydney. Women only go with successful men. 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.818
 - I'll be successful. - Really? 

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.144
 BASED ON THE TRUE STORY OF REAL IDIOT 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.620
 I don't understand the meaning of the word fear. 

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:05.564
 I'm sure there are many words you don't understand the meaning. 

00:01:07.153 --> 00:01:08.056
 IT IS OUT OF THE BALL 

00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:11.554
 - So the hamster you play in the movie ... - He's a squirrel. 

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:13.520
 It does not matter. Is it gay? 

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.465
 IT IS OUT OF REACH 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.266
 Second question. Are you gay? 

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:22.328
 AND IS OUT OF CONTROL 

00:01:23.598 --> 00:01:24.721
 I should record this. 

00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:26.205
 Come on, let's go to Mr Maddeck. 

00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:27.855
 My God! That's terrible! 

00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:33.289
 I didn't know it was any day: Take your daughters to work. 

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:34.400
 Shut up. 

00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:37.014
 Everyone thinks I'm an idiot. 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.588
 It works. 

00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:42.603
 There's something very devastating about you. 

00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:44.184
 The story of a man is coming. 

00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:49.476
 Which goes to the bottom and beyond. 

00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:52.557

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:53.344

00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:55.757
 AND JEFF BRIDGES 

00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:58.293
 Where can I leave him here? He's a well-behaved Italian. 

00:01:58.403 --> 00:01:59.751
 Hi, Cubo. 

00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:01.621
 We will be friends? 

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:02.613
 Want to play a bit? 

00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:09.038
 HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS 

00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:11.658
 Where only can my Cuba be? 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:14.272
