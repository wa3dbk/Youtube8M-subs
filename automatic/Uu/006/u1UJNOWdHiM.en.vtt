00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
you to do as you can see is just kind of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.979 
you to do as you can see is just kind of
blast<00:00:40.680> along<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.399> planet's<00:00:42.059> surface<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.600> some

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
blast along a planet's surface at some

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.160 
blast along a planet's surface at some
pretty<00:00:43.170> reasonable<00:00:43.770> speeds<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:45.170> so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
pretty reasonable speeds actually so

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
pretty reasonable speeds actually so
it's<00:00:46.379> pretty<00:00:46.559> cool<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.100> looks<00:00:47.399> great<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
it's pretty cool it looks great it

it's pretty cool it looks great it
sounds<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.440> nice<00:00:49.649> when<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
sounds really nice when you kind of

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.470 
sounds really nice when you kind of
thrust<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.360> either<00:00:51.510> direction<00:00:51.770> you<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:52.920> this

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
thrust in either direction you get this

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.779 
thrust in either direction you get this
this<00:00:54.480> cool<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.070> cool<00:00:56.309> thruster<00:00:56.670> in

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
this cool you get that cool thruster in

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.400 
this cool you get that cool thruster in
the<00:00:56.850> back<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> leaves<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:58.260> neat

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the back and it leaves that really neat

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
the back and it leaves that really neat
trail<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.800> blue<00:00:58.980> particles<00:00:59.489> one<00:01:00.480> downside<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
trail of blue particles one downside to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.979 
trail of blue particles one downside to
this<00:01:01.140> mod<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.160> kind<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.660> get<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.690> in

through june just see if i can get down

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.950 
through june just see if i can get down
here<00:01:07.830> yeah<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.549> only<00:01:08.640> downside<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.360> i<00:01:09.720> can

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
here yeah the only downside that i can

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.890 
here yeah the only downside that i can
see<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.320> mod<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.710> far<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.750> blasting<00:01:12.750> up

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
see that this mod so far is blasting up

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
see that this mod so far is blasting up
like<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.200> takes<00:01:13.439> quite<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.920> energy<00:01:14.130> as

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
like that takes quite a bit of energy as

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.149 
like that takes quite a bit of energy as
you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.880> my<00:01:15.060> energy<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.509> gone<00:01:15.630> already<00:01:16.380> so

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you can see my energy is gone already so

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.920 
you can see my energy is gone already so
I<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.610> wait<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> come<00:01:18.720> back

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
I do have to wait for that to come back

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.749 
I do have to wait for that to come back
before<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.619> any<00:01:19.770> real<00:01:19.979> vertical

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
before I can do any real vertical

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
before I can do any real vertical
boosting<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.900> real<00:01:22.170> good<00:01:22.350> for

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
boosting so it's real good for

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.370 
boosting so it's real good for
traversing<00:01:22.860> horizontally<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.540> when<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
traversing horizontally but when it

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.039 
traversing horizontally but when it
comes<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.770> doing<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.700> lot<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.180> vertical

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
comes to doing a lot of like vertical

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.649 
comes to doing a lot of like vertical
stuff<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:29.280> becomes<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.820> bit<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> an<00:01:30.210> issue<00:01:30.329> as

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
stuff it becomes a bit of an issue as

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
stuff it becomes a bit of an issue as
you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.259> see<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.590> getting<00:01:31.860> above<00:01:32.009> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
you can see just getting above that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.550 
you can see just getting above that
little<00:01:32.460> hill<00:01:33.090> there<00:01:33.390> took<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.930> quite<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> lot<00:01:34.350> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
little hill there took up quite a lot of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
little hill there took up quite a lot of
my<00:01:34.650> energy<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.670> wanted<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> get<00:01:36.060> up

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
my energy and now if I wanted to get up

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.520 
my energy and now if I wanted to get up
here<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.780> gonna<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.170> wait<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.470> my

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
here I'm gonna have to wait for my

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.160 
here I'm gonna have to wait for my
energy<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.950> come<00:01:38.130> back<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.790> right<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.170> 217

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
energy to come back I have right now 217

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.020 
energy to come back I have right now 217
energy<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> crazy<00:01:41.310> amount<00:01:41.640> or

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
energy not like a crazy amount or

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.050 
energy not like a crazy amount or
anything<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:44.070> well<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> most<00:01:44.729> energy

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
anything but well it's the most energy

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.960 
anything but well it's the most energy
that<00:01:45.210> I've<00:01:45.299> ever<00:01:45.329> had<00:01:46.579> see<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.850> get

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
that I've ever had see if we can get

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.580 
that I've ever had see if we can get
that<00:01:48.030> come<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.899> yeah<00:01:49.079> they're<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that come here so yeah they're not the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.230 
that come here so yeah they're not the
best<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.040> traveling<00:01:50.430> vertical<00:01:50.850> what<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> would

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
best for traveling vertical what I would

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.460 
best for traveling vertical what I would
love<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:52.100> for<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.189> mod<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:54.600> I'd<00:01:55.290> like

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
love to see for this mod is a I'd like

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.069 
love to see for this mod is a I'd like
to<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> use<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.759> at<00:01:57.000> least<00:01:57.570> half<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
to see it use like at least half the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.359 
to see it use like at least half the
amount<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.380> energy<00:01:58.469> i<00:01:58.740> think<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.040> could<00:01:59.159> stand

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
amount of energy i think it could stand

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.929 
amount of energy i think it could stand
to<00:01:59.549> use<00:01:59.700> quite<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.509> bit<00:02:00.630> less<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.649> go<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.640> fact

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
to use quite a bit less to go up in fact

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.310 
to use quite a bit less to go up in fact
see<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:04.020> better<00:02:04.259> off

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
see just to get up here I'm better off

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.700 
see just to get up here I'm better off
just<00:02:04.920> getting<00:02:05.040> off<00:02:05.430> my<00:02:05.579> bike<00:02:05.759> entirely<00:02:06.469> as<00:02:07.469> for

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
just getting off my bike entirely as for

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.730 
just getting off my bike entirely as for
the<00:02:07.799> look<00:02:07.950> though<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.399> mean<00:02:08.610> they<00:02:08.729> look<00:02:08.910> great

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740

whole<00:03:04.470> idle<00:03:04.710> one<00:03:04.830> they<00:03:05.130> share<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.640> same<00:03:05.670> icon

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
whole idle one they share the same icon

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.300 
whole idle one they share the same icon
in<00:03:06.810> your<00:03:06.990> inventory<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:07.980> would<00:03:08.070> be<00:03:08.100> nice

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.650 
guess all right let's uh let's select
the<00:03:14.940> high<00:03:15.060> level<00:03:15.270> 1<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.950> use<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:18.510> is

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
the high level 1 and use it and this is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.850 
the high level 1 and use it and this is
the<00:03:18.750> high<00:03:18.870> load<00:03:19.020> will<00:03:19.170> have<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.320> bike<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:19.770> you

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
the high load will have a bike as you

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.700 
the high load will have a bike as you
can<00:03:19.950> see<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.280> has<00:03:20.490> a<00:03:20.550> really<00:03:20.790> cool<00:03:21.470> fish<00:03:22.470> look

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
can see it has a really cool fish look

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.590 
can see it has a really cool fish look
to<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.130> think<00:03:23.490> it<00:03:23.760> goes<00:03:23.880> fast<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.420> then<00:03:24.510> the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
to it I think it goes fast and then the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.900 
to it I think it goes fast and then the
human<00:03:24.840> one<00:03:24.960> but<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.260> also<00:03:25.460> takes<00:03:26.460> a<00:03:26.610> little<00:03:26.760> bit

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
human one but it also takes a little bit

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.440 
human one but it also takes a little bit
more<00:03:27.060> energy<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.720> jump<00:03:28.620> up<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:30.120> there's<00:03:30.300> this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
more energy to jump up so there's this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.300 
more energy to jump up so there's this
one<00:03:32.600> yeah<00:03:33.600> it's<00:03:34.290> kind<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.800> hard<00:03:34.980> for<00:03:35.040> me<00:03:35.220> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
one yeah it's kind of hard for me to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.980 
one yeah it's kind of hard for me to
actually<00:03:35.610> get<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.150> speed<00:03:36.480> going<00:03:36.690> because<00:03:36.900> I

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
actually get the speed going because I

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.150 
actually get the speed going because I
don't<00:03:37.170> really<00:03:37.200> have<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.500> good<00:03:37.680> clear<00:03:37.950> runway

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
don't really have a good clear runway

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.190 
don't really have a good clear runway
here<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:41.010> uh<00:03:41.040> that's<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
here but uh that's it that is the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.590 
here but uh that's it that is the
hoverbikes<00:03:43.220> by<00:03:44.220> or<00:03:44.580> lion<00:03:44.880> al-ahmad<00:03:45.240> I'd<00:03:45.450> love

would love to see him reducing energy

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.699 
would love to see him reducing energy
costs<00:03:53.459> for<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.330> bike<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:55.050> boost<00:03:55.260> upwards

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
costs for the bike to boost upwards

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.530 
costs for the bike to boost upwards

wonderful start okay let's move on to
the<00:04:00.000> next<00:04:00.030> mod<00:04:00.440> actually<00:04:01.440> before<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.830> move<00:04:02.040> on

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
the next mod actually before I move on

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.199 
the next mod actually before I move on
to<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.340> next<00:04:02.370> month<00:04:02.700> there<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:02.940> one<00:04:03.090> more

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
thing I'd like to say I think something

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.990 
thing I'd like to say I think something
that<00:04:04.709> would<00:04:04.950> make<00:04:04.980> another<00:04:05.580> great<00:04:05.820> feature

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
that would make another great feature

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.970 
that would make another great feature
for<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.450> mod<00:04:06.660> will<00:04:07.200> be<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.410> ability<00:04:07.800> to

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
for this mod will be the ability to

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.620 
for this mod will be the ability to
shoot<00:04:08.310> while<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.730> are<00:04:08.850> on<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.209> Hoverbike

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
shoot while you are on the Hoverbike

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.480 
shoot while you are on the Hoverbike
because<00:04:10.140> how<00:04:10.470> freaking<00:04:10.980> awesome<00:04:11.340> would<00:04:11.459> that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
because how freaking awesome would that

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.610 
because how freaking awesome would that
be<00:04:11.640> currently<00:04:12.510> your<00:04:12.810> mouse<00:04:13.020> buttons<00:04:13.350> don't

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
be currently your mouse buttons don't

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.410 
be currently your mouse buttons don't
actually<00:04:13.920> do<00:04:14.010> anything<00:04:14.070> left<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.030> right<00:04:15.180> is

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
actually do anything left and right is

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.060 
actually do anything left and right is
what<00:04:15.810> moves<00:04:16.020> you<00:04:16.140> left<00:04:16.320> or<00:04:16.470> night<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.620> holding

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
what moves you left or night and holding

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.560 
what moves you left or night and holding
your<00:04:17.160> spacebar<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.820> what<00:04:18.239> gives<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.540> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
your spacebar is what gives you the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.210 
your spacebar is what gives you the
vertical<00:04:18.989> boost<00:04:19.200> so

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
vertical boost so

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.650 
vertical boost so
if<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.579> possible<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.150> don't<00:04:21.299> know<00:04:21.390> if<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:21.570> is

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
if it's possible I don't know if it is

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.150 
if it's possible I don't know if it is
but<00:04:21.870> if<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.079> possible<00:04:22.230> to<00:04:22.470> code<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:22.980> so

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
but if it's possible to code it in so

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.470 
but if it's possible to code it in so
that<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.400> could<00:04:23.550> actually<00:04:23.580> have<00:04:24.000> your<00:04:24.150> weapon

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
that you could actually have your weapon

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.820 
that you could actually have your weapon
while<00:04:24.630> you're<00:04:24.780> using<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.170> Hoverbike<00:04:25.530> tech

you're blasting around on your hover

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.490 
you're blasting around on your hover
bike<00:04:29.520> that<00:04:29.850> would<00:04:30.000> be<00:04:30.120> that<00:04:31.050> would<00:04:31.110> make<00:04:31.350> this

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
bike that would be that would make this

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.490 
bike that would be that would make this
mod<00:04:31.710> absolutely<00:04:32.640> that<00:04:33.480> much<00:04:33.720> cooler<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.320> it's

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
mod absolutely that much cooler and it's

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.880 
mod absolutely that much cooler and it's
already<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.040> super<00:04:35.490> cool<00:04:35.670> mod<00:04:36.290> okay<00:04:37.290> now<00:04:37.860> let's

already a super cool mod okay now let's

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.850 
already a super cool mod okay now let's
move<00:04:38.160> on<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.490> next<00:04:38.640> mod<00:04:39.320> alright<00:04:40.320> guys<00:04:40.530> the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.990 
move on to the next mod alright guys the
next<00:04:40.980> mod<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.370> we're<00:04:41.490> going<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.670> be<00:04:41.730> having<00:04:41.820> a

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
next mod that we're going to be having a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.180 
next mod that we're going to be having a
look<00:04:42.120> at<00:04:42.300> is<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:42.510> hoverboard<00:04:43.230> tech<00:04:43.530> mud<00:04:43.830> by

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
look at is the hoverboard tech mud by

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.130 
look at is the hoverboard tech mud by
Demi<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.670> this<00:04:45.150> adds<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.420> hoverboard<00:04:45.810> into<00:04:46.050> the

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
Demi and this adds a hoverboard into the

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.390 
Demi and this adds a hoverboard into the
game<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.470> I<00:04:46.560> guess<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:46.830> hoverboard<00:04:47.130> is

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
game and I guess this hoverboard is

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.340 
game and I guess this hoverboard is
actually<00:04:47.790> lifted<00:04:48.210> right<00:04:48.480> out<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.750> terraria

going to have it on our person tillett's
beam<00:05:34.890> on<00:05:35.040> down<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.340> planet<00:05:35.700> and<00:05:35.760> try<00:05:36.180> this

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
beam on down to the planet and try this

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.350 
beam on down to the planet and try this
on<00:05:36.479> it<00:05:37.310> okay<00:05:38.310> so<00:05:38.370> here<00:05:38.640> we<00:05:38.729> are<00:05:38.820> on<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.030> planet

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
on it okay so here we are on the planet

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.000 
on it okay so here we are on the planet
and<00:05:39.510> the<00:05:39.990> way<00:05:40.110> that<00:05:40.290> this<00:05:40.410> thing<00:05:40.620> works<00:05:40.800> is

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
and the way that this thing works is

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.350 
and the way that this thing works is
actually<00:05:41.400> a<00:05:41.430> little<00:05:41.580> bit<00:05:41.850> different<00:05:42.210> if<00:05:42.270> you

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
actually a little bit different if you

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.360 
actually a little bit different if you
hold<00:05:42.630> space<00:05:42.960> after<00:05:43.770> you<00:05:43.830> jump<00:05:43.979> in<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.190> air<00:05:44.220> you

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
hold space after you jump in the air you

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.040 
hold space after you jump in the air you
just<00:05:44.580> kind<00:05:44.729> of<00:05:44.790> start<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.479> hover<00:05:45.630> on<00:05:45.900> your

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
just kind of start to hover on your

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.050 
just kind of start to hover on your
hoverboard<00:05:46.260> letting<00:05:46.650> go<00:05:46.740> of<00:05:46.770> space<00:05:47.130> as<00:05:47.340> you

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
hoverboard letting go of space as you

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.550 
hoverboard letting go of space as you
can<00:05:48.180> see<00:05:48.330> stops<00:05:48.690> your<00:05:48.900> hoverboard<00:05:49.140> and<00:05:49.440> it

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
can see stops your hoverboard and it

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.200 
can see stops your hoverboard and it
kind<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.740> disappears<00:05:50.190> from<00:05:50.340> view<00:05:50.430> holding

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
kind of disappears from view holding

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.030 
kind of disappears from view holding
down<00:05:51.450> and<00:05:51.810> a<00:05:51.990> direction<00:05:52.229> will<00:05:52.650> cause<00:05:52.860> you<00:05:53.010> to

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
down and a direction will cause you to

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.550 
down and a direction will cause you to
hover<00:05:53.940> in<00:05:54.060> that<00:05:54.330> direction<00:05:54.660> as<00:05:54.930> you<00:05:55.290> can<00:05:55.380> see<00:05:55.530> i

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
hover in that direction as you can see i

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.830 
hover in that direction as you can see i
can<00:05:55.680> go<00:05:55.830> left<00:05:56.040> or<00:05:56.130> right<00:05:56.300> and<00:05:57.300> then<00:05:57.450> holding

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
can go left or right and then holding

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.440 
can go left or right and then holding
space<00:05:58.229> and<00:05:58.500> down<00:05:58.700> what<00:05:59.700> caused<00:05:59.970> you<00:06:00.150> to<00:06:00.180> hover

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
space and down what caused you to hover

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.390 
space and down what caused you to hover
in<00:06:00.540> place<00:06:01.020> unless<00:06:01.950> you<00:06:02.040> already<00:06:02.160> have<00:06:02.280> a

little<00:06:02.580> bit<00:06:02.729> of<00:06:02.850> momentum<00:06:03.270> it's<00:06:03.840> actually<00:06:04.020> a

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
little bit of momentum it's actually a

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.710 
little bit of momentum it's actually a
little<00:06:04.470> bit<00:06:04.710> weird<00:06:05.160> to<00:06:05.310> get<00:06:05.580> used<00:06:05.850> to<00:06:06.030> to<00:06:06.600> be

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
little bit weird to get used to to be

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.230 
little bit weird to get used to to be
perfectly<00:06:06.900> honest<00:06:07.470> i<00:06:07.910> imagine<00:06:08.910> with<00:06:09.000> a<00:06:09.030> little

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
perfectly honest i imagine with a little

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.060 
perfectly honest i imagine with a little
bit<00:06:09.330> of<00:06:09.390> practice<00:06:09.720> it<00:06:09.870> won't<00:06:10.140> actually<00:06:10.590> be<00:06:10.830> too

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
bit of practice it won't actually be too

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.590 
bit of practice it won't actually be too
bad<00:06:11.250> though<00:06:11.460> it<00:06:11.669> doesn't<00:06:11.910> use<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.180> whole<00:06:12.419> hell

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
bad though it doesn't use a whole hell

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.060 
bad though it doesn't use a whole hell
of<00:06:12.630> a<00:06:13.020> lot<00:06:13.050> of<00:06:13.260> energy<00:06:13.380> let's<00:06:13.740> try<00:06:13.860> to<00:06:13.919> kill

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
of a lot of energy let's try to kill

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.900 
of a lot of energy let's try to kill
these<00:06:14.160> birds<00:06:15.800> but<00:06:16.800> uh<00:06:16.830> I<00:06:17.220> kind<00:06:17.669> of<00:06:17.729> feel<00:06:17.850> like
