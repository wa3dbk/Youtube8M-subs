00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello my love i am like it again 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.420
 announced there is now one 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.120
 nail polish 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.040
 So I'm sure they all have that 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.639
 motto super, I have been synonymous already 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 that was already a flop so so 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.010
 Can you just leave that what I have there 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.359
 So the first things are done 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.460
 I got me the cash tomorrow so can 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.220
 it exactly the prices you achieved and 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.490
 Although first the p2 new loads outside would be 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.399
 that does not know yet yes I stood there 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.660
 nominal paints taken and there are 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.190
 also many other things there 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.930
 lipgloss and so new and I will 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.430
 this time also try out where I 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 He did not hear that very well 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.180
 and therefore I do not know if I am 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.980
 I want to buy it over him already 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.070
 a bit more expensive but if I again 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.260
 Look exactly my first three days 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.670
 long of the new pc assortment i 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.210
 you'll probably already know one 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.730
 little 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.620
 they are also a bit hyped that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.219
 are these cents and I'll show you now 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.809
 first one 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.960
 this p2 is hens part polish so the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.869
 We have a sandy one, so to speak 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.189
 look a bit sandy from what i do 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.750
 I'm already ahead of the nail polish 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.090
 dismiss it because it's the same 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.220
 how about glitter or something like that you get 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.180
 yes very difficult and yes it will 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.970
 be the same 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.200
 and yes, I would have shown them one after another 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.170
 in stock and I have already 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.060
 one better you therefore see here the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.979
 first I got myself, I stop 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.979
 this one and that is the number 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.260
 the here you can not read 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.370
 I hope it works 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.240
 that's the number i want yes 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.440
 bad reading 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.940
 the ten is that and that's that color 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.500
 Here, as you can see, that is real 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.490
 very glitter me and if you are here 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.930
 it feels that way about it 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.430
 and yes I like it so well I think that's 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.490
 could not quite as good over from 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:04.670
 camera then the second nail polish that 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.750
 this one is here and that's this number 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.300
 here 60 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.480
 I'll take a look at that was right and yes 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.220
 this is the one in the middle 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.340
 So everything is funny without top 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.270
 applied and then I still have 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.670
 the bought the good was that the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.020
 always so far that was so 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.640
 standard the long corner in there and there 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.959
 the word staggered could be reserved 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.670
 see exactly what they look like 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.740
 I would not have bought that now 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.750
 I think he looks good but up 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.670
 the nails comes that he over the 20 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.550
 that's just this color and me 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.830
 think he has pink over as red 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.510
 and that's why I have mine today 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.400
 marked so that they are just one 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.260
 an hour fresh so therefore first 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.730
 if the splitter with me but me 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.110
 the heart unfortunately very fast for that 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.100
 me too stupid so I hope you 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.410
 you may have to realize 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.670
 that's what it looks like and I still have it 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.590
 just over done 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.500
 and yes I 'm really looking forward to the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.780
 things to do but look yes that 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.700
 you tasted the first and the first 1 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.010
 995 I can not say anything 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.840
 against then I have a very 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.100
 kept nail polish more bought and 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.620
 I have it too 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.320
 Instagram shampoos posted a photo and 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.720
 Although this experiment is this 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.250
 this tube of a ina blank 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.430
 again it ina weller circular I do not 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.630
 because I do not use food thank you 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.630
 and he tasted it 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.340
 51 and i'll say a kiss that 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.989
 number 146 yes that's why and I have 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.970
 the task yesterday and there I have a lot 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.019
 I tend to think so what 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.250
 I'm not a color though 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.159
 somehow I had confessed to myself 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.950
 I did not think so 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.310
 in swatch, and that is that the 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.340
 here 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.239
 So as I see these bright color've 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.609
 not yet 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.450
 So that's really nice color 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:05.069
 I recommend you in any case so 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.709
 if you want to have to eat this job 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.000
 then buy it here for one 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.720
 nice color so I like it right 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.950
 well as a 550 as I said so then 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.289
 I still made a mistake and 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.870
 Although I have a whole essens 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:23.550
 normal clear lacquer is bought that way and that is 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.260
 the 101 absolute pure is called this color 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.000
 the expensive at 550 so cost that 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.660
 whole times works and then I have 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.800
 far colin metaphors but another 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.360
 youtuber and i have seen her 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.530
 has mixed with pigments with 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.550
 then I did it also has the 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.320
 also works 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.349
 It was really hard to do that 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.180
 Just mix today I'll get the out and 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.080
 the whole pigments are deposited below 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.830
 and I do not get it right anymore 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.750
 mixed 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.270
 So if you have a hint somewhere like 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.910
 I get mixed up again because they are 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.760
 Although still relatively okay but 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.460
 if you swatch this is correct 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.870
 Pale easy so there you can really 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.000
 no color camp that was more of a 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.789
 a little stupid so the bike with him 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.210
 So much for your good tip 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.560
 i have her good tip i have 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.050
 that can mix well then tell me 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.860
 that in any case 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.229
 Then I have another nail polish 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.000
 brought by essens and this one here 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.000
 for the totally beautiful 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.750
 here is the taste there as it sees 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.580
 it's really pretty much too 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.320
 glitter also shimmer a bit we 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.000
 there are now two layers on it 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.530
 but if you do not do that then 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.210
 that is enough only with special needs 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.389
 you do not even subject to do under it 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.880
 Of course you can also do it as over 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.310
 long so use a different colors 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.180
 the over it that looks also nice from the 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.940
 but I have not yet on the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.390
 made nails but he has me totally 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.040
 addressed so and then a plaque 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.220
 yes already from my last video 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.900
 dm favorite box and but although the 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.270
 this one has here and there I have told 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.430
 that I bought one more 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.540
 First show the color 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:20.450
 that means that this color is here 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:22.910
 and here is the number and what about it 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.710
 These colors are very much to be said 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.210
 very covering so really in the 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.700
 first layer cover 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.130
 you could even use that as 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.540
 I think you can find dumping nail polish 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.020
 everyone in between you know 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.100
 everyone determines and you can do that 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.990
 use super because he just like that 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.000
 thick the kisses i dont but that 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.680
 is just very well commented if 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.539
 you can say that a nail polish so 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.229
 the opacity is a really great and 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:57.050
 I say I am more bought 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:58.150
 this one unfortunately I have already 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.280
 a bit subdued 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:06.110
 it is this earth that you are in there though 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.310
 well it's just news pink how come 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.640
 you pretty much over it 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:13.250
 he is definitely still a bit 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.530
 pink and yes that's this 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.270
 been here and yes I am actually 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.860
 about my poor was on the partie 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.350
 Incidentally all times I have not me 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.500
 bought is really enough when 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:26.840
 150 nail polish already 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:29.120
 yes I do not regret anything outside of this 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.340
 so regret that with you 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.750
 really but always has to say more 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.400
 how one 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.680
 since thereby the family can which is 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.180
 just a bit stupid but otherwise finds 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.850
 you all great as I said I have too 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.350
 now on it and let's see 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.600
 how is it going to get off 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:47.200
 yes I hope you liked the video 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.030
 and if you bought newer on 92 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.730
 Germany can you longer can you 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.740
 I like to write it comments 

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.620
 there are also normal nail polishes so 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.700
 not here these effects but 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:02.170
 also the very normal that comic tim 

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.910
 nail polishes you can write me like 

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.250
 so I'm also very concerned about toma 

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.290
 make a friend or a video answer 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.940
 I would also be happy about it and me 

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.050
 hope you will like it and yet 

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.050
 I want to say until next time
