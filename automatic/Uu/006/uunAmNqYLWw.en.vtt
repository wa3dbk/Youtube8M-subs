the drone that built the spawning pool

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.900 
the drone that built the spawning pool
and<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.620> you're<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.160> wait<00:00:53.340> until

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you get get that spawning pool done

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.389 
you get get that spawning pool done
you're<00:00:57.300> immediately<00:00:57.899> gonna<00:00:57.989> build<00:00:58.320> six<00:00:59.190> three

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you're immediately gonna build six three

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.410 
you're immediately gonna build six three
links<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.120> three<00:01:00.690> eggs<00:01:00.930> worth<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.350> Riggins

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
links so three eggs worth of the Riggins

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and then after that I'm going to build a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.120 
and then after that I'm going to build a
drone<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:08.880> an<00:01:09.000> overlord<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:10.950> get

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
drone and then an overlord so I can get

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.280 
drone and then an overlord so I can get
good<00:01:11.369> income<00:01:11.729> billing<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.140> sure

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290

I<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.710> definitely<00:01:14.460> plenty<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.880> space<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:16.220> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
I have definitely plenty of space to to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.440 
I have definitely plenty of space to to
get<00:01:17.369> my<00:01:17.490> zerglings

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
get my zerglings

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.080 
get my zerglings
they<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.229> ready<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.710> hatch<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:21.060> in

about<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.830> pop<00:01:56.069> so<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.490> soon<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:56.909> pops<00:01:57.030> I'm

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
about to pop so as soon as it pops I'm

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.350 
about to pop so as soon as it pops I'm
going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.170> build<00:01:58.380> lots<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.069> zerglings<00:01:59.360> my

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
going to build lots of zerglings my

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.789 
going to build lots of zerglings my
zerglings<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.079> routed<00:02:01.380> over<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.679> that

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
zerglings are just routed over to that

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.469 
zerglings are just routed over to that
base<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.090> enough<00:02:03.270> minerals

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
base you can see I have enough minerals

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.449 
base you can see I have enough minerals
that<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.959> build<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> Queen<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:05.280> I'm<00:02:05.340> going

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
that I can build the Queen so I'm going

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.520 
that I can build the Queen so I'm going
to<00:02:05.520> do<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.789> too<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.630> build<00:02:06.750> extra

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
to do that too so I can build extra

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.589 
to do that too so I can build extra
zerglings<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.250> case<00:02:08.489> my<00:02:08.670> initial<00:02:09.060> rush<00:02:09.239> does

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
zerglings in case my initial rush does

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.710 
zerglings in case my initial rush does
not<00:02:09.899> work<00:02:10.110> out<00:02:10.259> well<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.739> then<00:02:11.579> as<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:12.239> get<00:02:12.299> more

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
not work out well and then as I get more

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.050 
not work out well and then as I get more
larvae<00:02:13.680> I'm<00:02:13.950> gonna<00:02:14.160> continue<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.640> build<00:02:14.880> more

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
larvae I'm gonna continue to build more

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.430 
larvae I'm gonna continue to build more
very<00:02:15.299> links<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:18.269> can<00:02:18.420> argue<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.780> mmm

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
very links and a you can argue that mmm

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.720 
very links and a you can argue that mmm
you<00:02:19.500> should<00:02:19.650> get<00:02:19.709> an<00:02:19.829> overlord<00:02:20.160> at<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.459> point

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
you should get an overlord at this point

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.970 
you should get an overlord at this point
and<00:02:21.180> that's<00:02:21.420> potentially<00:02:22.260> good<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.739> do<00:02:22.859> you

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
and that's potentially good to do you

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.479 
and that's potentially good to do you
can<00:02:23.100> see<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.870> made<00:02:24.870> those<00:02:25.019> number<00:02:25.680> one<00:02:25.859> and<00:02:26.370> then

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
can see I made those number one and then

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.520 
can see I made those number one and then
I<00:02:26.639> can<00:02:26.819> make<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.049> might<00:02:28.200> build<00:02:28.350> an

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
I can make that so I might build an

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.559 
I can make that so I might build an
overlord<00:02:28.829> out<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.190> next<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:29.579> but<00:02:30.060> you

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
overlord out of the next one but you

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.440 
overlord out of the next one but you
potentially<00:02:31.079> are<00:02:31.109> gonna<00:02:31.230> lose<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:32.450> your

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
potentially are gonna lose your your

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.220 
potentially are gonna lose your your
zerglings<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.139> attack<00:02:34.489> so<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.840> might<00:02:37.079> not

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
zerglings on the attack so you might not

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.780 
zerglings on the attack so you might not
need<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.709> get<00:02:37.799> another<00:02:38.010> overlord<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.670> that

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
need to get another overlord and that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.580 
need to get another overlord and that
might<00:02:38.940> actually<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.959> waste<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.380> some

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
might actually be a waste of some

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.520 
might actually be a waste of some
potential<00:02:40.889> zerglings<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:42.900> it's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
potential zerglings you know it's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.199 
potential zerglings you know it's
neither<00:02:43.769> here<00:02:44.069> nor<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.060> your

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
neither here nor there it's up to your

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.460 
neither here nor there it's up to your
preference<00:02:45.540> you're<00:02:45.959> already<00:02:46.079> bringing<00:02:46.350> in

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
preference you're already bringing in

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.740 
preference you're already bringing in
some<00:02:46.680> really<00:02:47.069> early<00:02:47.250> troops<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.510> can<00:02:48.630> see

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
some really early troops so you can see

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.030 
some really early troops so you can see
I<00:02:48.780> got<00:02:48.930> my<00:02:48.989> queen<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:51.600> then<00:02:52.380> as<00:02:52.560> soon<00:02:52.739> as<00:02:52.859> they

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
I got my queen and then as soon as they

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.490 
I got my queen and then as soon as they
get<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.370> fight<00:02:53.609> I'm<00:02:53.819> going<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
get in the fight I'm going to do that

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.559 
get in the fight I'm going to do that
micro<00:02:55.500> some<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.010> them<00:02:56.100> way<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:57.180> they<00:02:57.359> won't

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
micro some of them way that they won't

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.490 
micro some of them way that they won't
get<00:02:57.840> killed

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
get killed

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.410 
get killed
I<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:59.370> come<00:02:59.549> as<00:02:59.700> much<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.090> light<00:03:00.269> as

I can come as much of the light as

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.530 
I can come as much of the light as
possible<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:01.680> then<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.030> bring<00:03:03.209> out<00:03:03.359> some

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
possible and then you can bring out some

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.479 
possible and then you can bring out some
drone<00:03:03.780> some<00:03:04.200> probes<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.680> that's<00:03:04.829> perfect<00:03:05.250> I

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
drone some probes and that's perfect I

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.580 
drone some probes and that's perfect I
can<00:03:05.970> handle<00:03:06.329> them<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.660> limited<00:03:06.989> No

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
can handle them and limited No

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.979 
can handle them and limited No
I'll<00:03:07.709> be<00:03:08.040> able<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.280> kill<00:03:08.519> them<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.870> then

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
I'll be able to kill them and then

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.390 
I'll be able to kill them and then

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
the whole time

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.309 
the whole time
get<00:03:13.409> your<00:03:13.819> you're<00:03:14.819> there<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.870> build<00:03:16.079> some<00:03:16.230> more

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
get your you're there to build some more

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.460 
get your you're there to build some more
food<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.890> know<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.599> then<00:03:18.810> focus<00:03:19.170> on<00:03:19.319> getting

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
food you know and then focus on getting

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.880 
food you know and then focus on getting
those<00:03:19.650> giggling<00:03:20.129> over<00:03:20.700> here<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:22.079> see<00:03:22.739> it's

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
those giggling over here so see it's

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.110 
those giggling over here so see it's
about<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.250> pause<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:26.400> as<00:03:26.430> soon<00:03:26.730> as<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.909> pops

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
about the pause so as soon as it pops

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.229 
about the pause so as soon as it pops
different<00:03:27.959> Queen<00:03:28.170> there's<00:03:28.890> more<00:03:29.129> damage<00:03:29.310> and

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
different Queen there's more damage and

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.899 
different Queen there's more damage and
then<00:03:30.599> send<00:03:31.379> all<00:03:31.470> those<00:03:31.590> into<00:03:31.829> circling<00:03:32.220> and

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
then send all those into circling and

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.220 
then send all those into circling and
when<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.090> second<00:03:33.480> round<00:03:33.599> gets<00:03:33.870> here<00:03:34.079> you

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
when that second round gets here you

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.750 
when that second round gets here you
should<00:03:34.470> be<00:03:34.560> pretty<00:03:34.829> close<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.099> dominating<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
should be pretty close to dominating the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.020 
should be pretty close to dominating the
game<00:03:35.959> definitely<00:03:36.959> gonna<00:03:37.200> have<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:38.030> advantage

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
game definitely gonna have a advantage

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.750 
game definitely gonna have a advantage
on<00:03:39.299> your<00:03:39.450> opponent<00:03:39.840> right<00:03:39.930> now<00:03:40.640> just<00:03:41.640> get

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
on your opponent right now just get

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.750 
on your opponent right now just get
those<00:03:41.940> numbers<00:03:42.390> keep<00:03:42.629> coming<00:03:43.049> away<00:03:43.760> and

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
those numbers keep coming away and

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
those numbers keep coming away and
surrounding<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:48.019> see<00:03:49.019> it's<00:03:49.650> doing<00:03:49.739> pretty

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
surrounding you see it's doing pretty

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.160 
surrounding you see it's doing pretty
well<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.790> can<00:03:50.970> go<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.510> can<00:03:51.690> get<00:03:51.780> some<00:03:51.989> gas

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
well you can go and you can get some gas

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.000 
well you can go and you can get some gas
right<00:03:52.440> now<00:03:52.470> at<00:03:52.889> a<00:03:52.950> lot<00:03:53.159> of<00:03:53.190> minerals<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:55.230> if

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
right now at a lot of minerals so if

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.339 
right now at a lot of minerals so if
things<00:03:56.250> don't<00:03:56.459> turn<00:03:56.549> out<00:03:56.819> well<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.389> might<00:03:58.170> be

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
things don't turn out well I might be

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.759 
things don't turn out well I might be
able<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.560> get<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.069> even<00:03:59.459> upgrade<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:01.409> then<00:04:01.680> I

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
able to get that even upgrade and then I

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.410 
able to get that even upgrade and then I
just<00:04:01.920> want<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.159> keep<00:04:02.280> drawing<00:04:02.940> their<00:04:03.180> probes

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
just want to keep drawing their probes

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.930 
just want to keep drawing their probes
off<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.900> lines<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.709> making<00:04:05.370> sure<00:04:05.519> they<00:04:05.670> can't

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
off the lines and making sure they can't

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.800 
off the lines and making sure they can't
you<00:04:06.180> don't<00:04:06.329> have<00:04:06.450> minerals<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.530> get<00:04:07.739> extra

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
you don't have minerals to get extra

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.500 
you don't have minerals to get extra
heat<00:04:09.810> waves<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.379> get<00:04:10.590> energies<00:04:13.879> and<00:04:14.879> then<00:04:15.060> you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
heat waves and get energies and then you

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.539 
heat waves and get energies and then you
can<00:04:15.720> like<00:04:15.930> oh<00:04:16.079> those<00:04:16.199> are<00:04:16.440> gleaming<00:04:16.650> down<00:04:17.070> yeah

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
can like oh those are gleaming down yeah

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.750 
can like oh those are gleaming down yeah
pop<00:04:17.820> again<00:04:18.150> I'm<00:04:18.959> gonna<00:04:19.109> get<00:04:19.579> get<00:04:20.579> those

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
pop again I'm gonna get get those

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.110 
pop again I'm gonna get get those
zerglings<00:04:21.209> in<00:04:21.449> here<00:04:22.340> do<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:23.460> much<00:04:23.610> damage<00:04:23.639> I

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
zerglings in here do as much damage I

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.750 
zerglings in here do as much damage I
can<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.660> then<00:04:25.139> when<00:04:25.710> your<00:04:25.830> opponent's<00:04:26.250> near

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
can and then when your opponent's near

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.279 
can and then when your opponent's near
the<00:04:26.910> end<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.389> just<00:04:27.449> want<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.810> finish<00:04:27.990> off

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
the end you just want to finish off

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.930 
the end you just want to finish off
their<00:04:28.470> probe<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.130> they<00:04:29.250> can't<00:04:29.490> get<00:04:29.610> any<00:04:29.789> more

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
their probe so they can't get any more

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.050 
their probe so they can't get any more
troops<00:04:30.620> out<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.860> their<00:04:32.010> buildings

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
troops out of their buildings

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.820 
troops out of their buildings
sometimes<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.720> gotta<00:04:34.139> use<00:04:34.380> their<00:04:34.560> wings<00:04:34.740> to

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
sometimes you gotta use their wings to

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.920 
sometimes you gotta use their wings to
do<00:04:34.979> that<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.820> they're<00:04:36.330> really<00:04:36.510> not<00:04:36.690> going<00:04:36.870> to

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
do that and they're really not going to

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.620 
do that and they're really not going to
be<00:04:37.020> able<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.229> do<00:04:37.349> anything<00:04:38.120> it's<00:04:39.120> even<00:04:39.449> comes

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
be able to do anything it's even comes

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.450 
be able to do anything it's even comes
another<00:04:39.810> wave<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.110> zerglings<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.190> I'm<00:04:41.250> just

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
another wave of zerglings so I'm just

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.779 
another wave of zerglings so I'm just
completely<00:04:41.849> overwhelming<00:04:42.479> my<00:04:42.660> opponent<00:04:43.789> with

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
completely overwhelming my opponent with

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.510 
completely overwhelming my opponent with
the<00:04:44.820> zerglings<00:04:46.070> there's<00:04:47.070> really<00:04:47.160> nothing<00:04:47.490> you

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
the zerglings there's really nothing you

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.610 
the zerglings there's really nothing you
can<00:04:47.729> do<00:04:47.849> and<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.389> let's<00:04:48.780> see<00:04:48.900> over<00:04:49.139> that<00:04:49.169> it's

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
can do and so let's see over that it's

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.530 
can do and so let's see over that it's
gonna<00:04:49.830> be

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
gonna be

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.570 
gonna be
you<00:04:51.540> on<00:04:51.840> 10<00:04:52.200> you<00:04:52.530> can<00:04:52.770> build<00:04:52.980> drones<00:04:53.130> until<00:04:53.520> you

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
you on 10 you can build drones until you

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.870 
you on 10 you can build drones until you
get<00:04:53.730> to<00:04:53.820> 10<00:04:53.900> after<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:54.990> get<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.140> 10<00:04:55.880> you're

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
get to 10 after you get to 10 you're

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.730 
get to 10 after you get to 10 you're
going<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.390> build<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.660> spawning<00:04:57.930> pool<00:04:58.080> after

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
going to build a spawning pool after

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.050 
going to build a spawning pool after
your<00:04:58.860> spawning<00:04:59.070> pool<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.430> can<00:04:59.490> build<00:04:59.730> a<00:04:59.790> drone

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
your spawning pool you can build a drone

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.570 
your spawning pool you can build a drone
and<00:05:00.450> then<00:05:00.660> an<00:05:00.810> overlord<00:05:01.250> you<00:05:02.250> want<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.460> build

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
and then an overlord you want to build

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.620 
and then an overlord you want to build
those<00:05:02.670> as<00:05:02.880> soon<00:05:02.970> as<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.150> get<00:05:03.240> enough<00:05:03.390> minerals

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
those as soon as you get enough minerals

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.310 
those as soon as you get enough minerals
for<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.110> then<00:05:04.380> as<00:05:04.470> soon<00:05:04.740> as<00:05:05.090> you're

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
for you and then as soon as you're

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.540 
for you and then as soon as you're
responding<00:05:07.320> pool<00:05:07.590> pops<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.220> should<00:05:08.400> have

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
responding pool pops you should have

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.610 
responding pool pops you should have
three<00:05:09.270> larvae<00:05:09.690> sitting<00:05:09.960> there<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.410> tend

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
three larvae sitting there and you tend

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.879 
three larvae sitting there and you tend
to<00:05:10.740> achieve<00:05:10.980> out<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.160> 18<00:05:11.610> 6<00:05:12.270> lanes<00:05:12.750> and

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
to achieve out of 18 6 lanes and

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.409 
to achieve out of 18 6 lanes and
to<00:05:13.979> be<00:05:14.099> able<00:05:14.189> to<00:05:14.340> build<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.610> queen<00:05:14.849> as<00:05:14.999> well<00:05:15.180> so

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
to be able to build a queen as well so

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.390 
to be able to build a queen as well so
I'd<00:05:15.509> recommend<00:05:15.659> building<00:05:16.169> the<00:05:16.229> Queen<00:05:16.469> and

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
I'd recommend building the Queen and

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.860 
I'd recommend building the Queen and
then<00:05:17.520> follow<00:05:17.789> that<00:05:17.909> with<00:05:17.969> just<00:05:18.180> more<00:05:18.360> zergling

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
then follow that with just more zergling

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.140 
then follow that with just more zergling
overlords<00:05:19.770> so<00:05:19.889> you<00:05:19.949> won't<00:05:20.219> run<00:05:20.430> out<00:05:20.699> of<00:05:20.759> space

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
overlords so you won't run out of space

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.480 
overlords so you won't run out of space
while<00:05:21.509> you're<00:05:21.659> on<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:22.020> attack<00:05:22.289> and<00:05:22.800> then<00:05:23.310> just

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
while you're on the attack and then just

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.580 
while you're on the attack and then just
continue<00:05:23.879> to<00:05:23.939> pressure<00:05:24.180> your<00:05:24.449> opponent<00:05:24.900> a

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
continue to pressure your opponent a

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.709 
continue to pressure your opponent a
couple<00:05:26.400> things<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.610> watch<00:05:26.759> out<00:05:26.909> for<00:05:26.969> if<00:05:27.539> your

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
couple things to watch out for if your

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.420 
couple things to watch out for if your
opponent<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.139> Terran<00:05:28.439> player<00:05:28.620> any<00:05:28.830> bunkers<00:05:29.219> in

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
opponent to Terran player any bunkers in

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.999 
opponent to Terran player any bunkers in
you're<00:05:30.060> going<00:05:30.330> to<00:05:30.509> want<00:05:30.689> to<00:05:30.810> take<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.229> gas

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
you're going to want to take that gas

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.429 
you're going to want to take that gas
really<00:05:32.520> early<00:05:32.669> so<00:05:33.389> you<00:05:33.479> can<00:05:33.509> go<00:05:33.749> switch<00:05:34.259> to<00:05:34.409> a

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:34.439 
really early so you can go switch to a

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:38.809 
really early so you can go switch to a
baneling<00:05:34.710> bust<00:05:35.389> and<00:05:37.099> and<00:05:38.099> then<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.610> bamboo

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
baneling bust and and then the bamboo

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.489 
baneling bust and and then the bamboo
bus<00:05:39.150> will<00:05:39.360> be<00:05:39.479> able<00:05:39.629> to<00:05:39.840> break<00:05:40.169> through<00:05:40.349> those

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:40.499 
bus will be able to break through those

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.119 
bus will be able to break through those
barriers<00:05:40.680> or<00:05:41.669> if<00:05:42.599> you<00:05:42.749> you<00:05:43.409> know<00:05:43.499> barians<00:05:44.039> you

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
barriers or if you you know barians you

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:45.499 
barriers or if you you know barians you
can<00:05:44.310> try<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:44.699> switch<00:05:44.849> to<00:05:44.999> more<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.240> a<00:05:45.300> macro

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
can try and switch to more of a macro

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.570 
can try and switch to more of a macro
game<00:05:45.779> by<00:05:46.080> going<00:05:46.379> ten<00:05:46.590> cool<00:05:46.830> you've<00:05:47.340> sacrificed

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
game by going ten cool you've sacrificed

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.360 
game by going ten cool you've sacrificed
economy<00:05:48.539> for<00:05:49.110> an<00:05:49.289> early<00:05:49.620> attack<00:05:49.919> so<00:05:50.189> that's

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
economy for an early attack so that's

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.769 
economy for an early attack so that's
something<00:05:50.550> that<00:05:50.729> you<00:05:50.969> know<00:05:51.120> you're<00:05:51.629> gonna

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:51.779 
something that you know you're gonna

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:53.929 
something that you know you're gonna
have<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.960> trade<00:05:52.259> off<00:05:52.469> so<00:05:52.740> it's<00:05:53.250> best<00:05:53.490> on<00:05:53.699> maps

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:53.939 
have to trade off so it's best on maps

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:55.580 
have to trade off so it's best on maps
that<00:05:54.090> are<00:05:54.210> really<00:05:54.449> short<00:05:54.719> distance<00:05:55.229> like<00:05:55.409> this

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
that are really short distance like this

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.629 
that are really short distance like this
where<00:05:55.800> you're<00:05:55.889> gonna<00:05:55.949> be<00:05:56.159> able<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.370> get<00:05:56.490> your

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
where you're gonna be able to get your

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.640 
where you're gonna be able to get your
opponent<00:05:56.969> quickly<00:05:57.060> and<00:05:57.419> also<00:05:58.110> where<00:05:58.349> the<00:05:58.469> ramp

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
opponent quickly and also where the ramp

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.010 
opponent quickly and also where the ramp
isn't<00:05:59.039> so<00:05:59.430> so<00:06:00.210> small<00:06:00.479> this<00:06:00.629> is<00:06:00.689> actually<00:06:00.990> a

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
isn't so so small this is actually a

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.929 
isn't so so small this is actually a
really<00:06:01.139> small<00:06:01.379> ramp<00:06:01.620> so<00:06:02.250> if<00:06:02.520> it's<00:06:02.669> a<00:06:02.759> bigger

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:02.939 
really small ramp so if it's a bigger

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:04.850 
really small ramp so if it's a bigger
ramp<00:06:03.180> you're<00:06:03.539> more<00:06:03.750> likely<00:06:03.930> to<00:06:04.409> be<00:06:04.560> able<00:06:04.740> to

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
ramp you're more likely to be able to

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.029 
ramp you're more likely to be able to
get<00:06:05.009> in<00:06:05.159> before<00:06:05.339> being<00:06:05.849> blocked<00:06:06.150> off<00:06:06.560> I<00:06:07.560> hope

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
get in before being blocked off I hope

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.860 
get in before being blocked off I hope
that<00:06:08.189> works<00:06:08.400> well<00:06:08.580> for<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:08.789> remember<00:06:09.120> it's

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
that works well for you remember it's

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.929 
that works well for you remember it's
really<00:06:09.960> simple<00:06:10.379> on<00:06:10.889> ten<00:06:11.370> jones<00:06:11.580> you<00:06:11.729> build<00:06:11.879> a

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:11.939 
really simple on ten jones you build a

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.579 
really simple on ten jones you build a
spawning<00:06:12.150> pool<00:06:12.449> then<00:06:12.930> you<00:06:13.020> build<00:06:13.169> a<00:06:13.229> drone<00:06:13.439> and

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:13.589 
spawning pool then you build a drone and

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:14.959 
spawning pool then you build a drone and
overlord<00:06:13.979> then<00:06:14.249> when<00:06:14.339> you're<00:06:14.490> spawning<00:06:14.729> pool

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
overlord then when you're spawning pool

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:17.329 
overlord then when you're spawning pool
pops<00:06:15.180> you<00:06:15.389> build<00:06:15.620> six<00:06:16.620> earthlings<00:06:17.039> with<00:06:17.189> the

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:17.339 
pops you build six earthlings with the

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:19.040 
pops you build six earthlings with the
three<00:06:17.819> larvae<00:06:18.089> that<00:06:18.210> come<00:06:18.389> out<00:06:18.569> and<00:06:18.870> then<00:06:19.020> I

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
three larvae that come out and then I

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.360 
three larvae that come out and then I
like<00:06:19.229> to<00:06:19.259> follow<00:06:19.500> that<00:06:19.680> with<00:06:19.800> a<00:06:19.830> queen<00:06:20.069> so<00:06:20.279> I

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
like to follow that with a queen so I

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.730 
like to follow that with a queen so I
can<00:06:20.550> mask<00:06:21.210> my<00:06:21.419> production<00:06:21.839> after<00:06:22.080> that<00:06:22.229> and

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
can mask my production after that and

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.559 
can mask my production after that and
depending<00:06:23.189> on<00:06:23.250> how<00:06:23.430> things<00:06:23.639> are<00:06:23.759> going<00:06:23.819> you're

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
depending on how things are going you're

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:25.969 
depending on how things are going you're
going<00:06:24.719> to<00:06:24.900> need<00:06:25.080> to<00:06:25.229> maybe<00:06:25.379> tech<00:06:25.800> two

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
going to need to maybe tech two

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.969 
going to need to maybe tech two
banelings<00:06:26.689> or<00:06:27.689> just<00:06:28.050> go<00:06:28.199> with<00:06:28.439> a<00:06:28.469> more<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:28.889> a

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
banelings or just go with a more of a

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.010 
banelings or just go with a more of a
