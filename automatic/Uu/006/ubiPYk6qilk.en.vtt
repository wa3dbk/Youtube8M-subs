00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 welcome to another pokemon x 6 video 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.420
 mysteries without solving this section 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.010
 where we treat the mysteries more 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.650
 enigmatic that there are within our 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.840
 pokemon x cartridges and many of them 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.849
 are unresolved and are left to question the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.980
 Own opinion of each person you want 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.109
 believe if they are true or false and good at 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.720
 this occasion we bring as in all 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.850
 others a very interesting mystery and this 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 mystery will be the third part of the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.970
 such a great mystery that we have given 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.590
 follow-up in this week that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.510
 they also know that they will have both 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.460
 videos of which I am speaking in the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.809
 description of the video and good in this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.399
 already we will talk about the third 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.980
 part of these videos that we have tried 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.170
 this week as I mentioned the first one was 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 about a hidden message the second 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.670
 it was a ghost within our 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.829
 cartridges and the third and last one that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.579
 is part of this saga of mysteries 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 that may be one is only one 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.320
 strange message inside the rich hotel 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 chilton in luminary and good city 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.309
 directly we are going to talk about this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.989
 mystery that also has a lot 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.310
 what to do with others and good we are going to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.070
 start 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.080
 if we visit the rich chilton hotel in 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.420
 luminary city and we go to the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.220
 third floor we will find a 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.680
 woman next to the wall right in the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.200
 room to the right of the elevator to the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.530
 speak she says close the peak if not no 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.930
 I can hear the elevator noise is 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.360
 a very strange phrase in which he gives us 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.090
 this woman equally a little 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 chilling because as we can see is 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.690
 the same ghost girl that appears in 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.850
 the mystery video unresolved in the 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.010
 previous chapter is the same no doubt 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.100
 some though it may be another very 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.560
 different but equally similar to 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.020
 love is and well let's keep talking about this 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.119
 a chilling scene and more 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.250
 inevitable if we relate it to the 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.800
 ghost as mentioned above 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.660
 this girl looks the same or 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.670
 maybe it's related to the mystery 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.500
 of the note at the train station 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.840
 it was she who wrote the note in that 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.270
 test but where always in is the hotel 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.250
 no doubt it would explain that he is 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.420
 so nervous and that she is so aware of 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.849
 lift 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.500
 this leaves us several questions that 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.620
 this is still not resolved 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.300
 mystery first of all why is it 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.910
 so nervous because there is so much 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.730
 listen to the elevator perhaps suffers a case 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.989
 of paranoia which is something very strange 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.989
 found inside a cartridge 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.690
 pokemon to a woman in a position 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.760
 strange waiting for an elevator as if 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.800
 I had some case of strange paranoia or 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.630
 something like that the truth is all very 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.660
 bad clip 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.190
 does not fit at all with anything like they can 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.620
 see these pokemon cartridges x there 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.240
 they are full of a lot of things that 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.100
 we could not explain and that the truth 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.360
 they are interesting to the sea but 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.760
 they also leave us many 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.100
 questions that really is related 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.530
 all this to the previous mentioned already in 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.080
 other videos I do not know the truth but I hope 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.830
 that some day we have an answer 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.800
 number one to whom he wrote the message and 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.690
 where is that always number two so 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.210
 it's that ghost woman inside that 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.300
 office and number three because this woman 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.120
 that is so similar to that ghost girl 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.760
 she is so nervous to hear the sound 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.620
 of the elevator and see who's coming are a 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.950
 lots of mysteries that the truth gives 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.620
 chill 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.250
 they would make the skin to anyone 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.120
 I also hope you liked it 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.250
 this video was how you can see quite 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.870
 quite mysterious so to speak 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.730
 let's also hope that one day 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.230
 have answers and do not be mind and do not 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.510
 just be a joke that we are 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.670
 playing nintendo and if he is doing it 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.620
 you have to applaud it because it is 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.599
 giving a lot of missing links 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.670
 for a story that can be giant 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.170
 or at the same time it can be nothing but of equal 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.760
 way we'll be waiting to see if 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.950
 someday we know something more about it 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.450
 but for the moment everything will go away and if they 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.310
 like this chapter please 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.379
 I would very much appreciate a like a comment 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.269
 and a subscription do not forget that now 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.489
 every time these videos reach 70 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.769
 I like we will automatically upload another 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.569
 chapter of this same series remember 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.049
 that in the description you will be able to find 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.819
 the two links so they can see the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.040
 two previous chapters that are very 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.870
 related to this story that we are 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.269
 speaking at this time thanks for watching 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.859
 this video we see each other until the next 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.859
 good night and goodbye
