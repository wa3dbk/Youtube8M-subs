00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the heat to kind of let it conform to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.359 
the heat to kind of let it conform to
the<00:01:12.180> curves<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.810> edges<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.979> especially

the sides in the bezel area but overall

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.840 
the sides in the bezel area but overall
this<00:01:21.689> actually<00:01:22.320> went<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.220> pretty<00:01:23.460> good<00:01:23.640> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this actually went on pretty good I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.539 
this actually went on pretty good I
enjoyed<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.770> wasn't<00:01:25.890> too<00:01:26.159> hard<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
enjoyed it and it wasn't too hard of a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.450 
enjoyed it and it wasn't too hard of a
process<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.360> normally<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.049> would

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
process you know normally I would

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.649 
process you know normally I would
include<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> installation<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.329> video

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
include the installation in the video

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
include the installation in the video
but<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.320> actually<00:01:31.619> too<00:01:31.829> difficult

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
but it was just actually too difficult

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.460 
but it was just actually too difficult
to<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.790> record<00:01:33.270> at<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> same<00:01:33.689> time<00:01:33.990> so

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to do and record at the same time so

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.289 
to do and record at the same time so
I'll<00:01:35.100> put<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> link<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> description<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
I'll put a link in the description of

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.999 
I'll put a link in the description of
some<00:01:36.479> other<00:01:36.659> skins<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.380> installed<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
some other skins I have installed in the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.850 
some other skins I have installed in the
past<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.150> overall<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.840> was<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.380> too<00:01:40.590> bad<00:01:40.619> at

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
past but overall it was not too bad at

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.260 
past but overall it was not too bad at
all<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> didn't<00:01:41.310> take<00:01:41.430> me<00:01:41.549> very<00:01:41.579> long<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.970> do

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
all it didn't take me very long to do

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
all it didn't take me very long to do
and<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.829> cruiser<00:01:44.100> light<00:01:44.340> did<00:01:44.610> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and you can see that cruiser light did a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.179 
and you can see that cruiser light did a
pretty<00:01:44.909> good<00:01:45.060> job<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.960> accuracy<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
pretty good job with the accuracy of the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.780 
pretty good job with the accuracy of the
cuts<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:48.479> buttons<00:01:48.810> are<00:01:49.170> perfect<00:01:49.790> they

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
cuts the buttons are perfect they

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.030 
cuts the buttons are perfect they
connect<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:51.479> good<00:01:51.630> together<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.380> there

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
connect really good together and there

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
connect really good together and there
wasn't<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.369> any<00:01:53.610> errors<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.299> there's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
wasn't really any errors and if there's

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050 
wasn't really any errors and if there's
any<00:01:54.600> errors<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.229> usually<00:01:55.590> user<00:01:55.979> error<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.820> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
any errors it's usually user error so I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.660 
any errors it's usually user error so I
really<00:01:57.530> commend<00:01:58.530> cruise<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> light<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.520> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
really commend cruise the light for that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.630 
really commend cruise the light for that
detail<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.329> they<00:02:00.540> put<00:02:00.689> into<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.640> now

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
detail that they put into this now

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.069

overall<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.869> this

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
overall I really think that this

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.249 
overall I really think that this
