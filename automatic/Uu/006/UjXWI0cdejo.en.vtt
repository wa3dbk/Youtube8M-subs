not mix old and new batteries so there

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.750 
not mix old and new batteries so there
is<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:58.170> better<00:02:58.890> case<00:02:59.190> right<00:02:59.370> here<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.700> will

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
is a better case right here that will

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.560 
is a better case right here that will
need<00:02:59.880> a<00:02:59.940> screwdriver<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.630> open<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:03.299> don't

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
need a screwdriver to open and I don't

see<00:03:03.750> any<00:03:04.019> installation<00:03:05.010> instructions<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
see any installation instructions in the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.729 
see any installation instructions in the
box<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:07.049> guess<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.160> intended<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:09.739> no

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
box so I guess that is intended for no

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:11.960 
box so I guess that is intended for no
here<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.100> goes<00:03:11.220> it's<00:03:11.459> right<00:03:11.579> on<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.760> back<00:03:11.940> of

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
here it goes it's right on the back of

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.850 
here it goes it's right on the back of
the<00:03:12.120> box<00:03:12.329> which<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:12.900> good<00:03:13.170> because<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.590> squeaks

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
the box which is good because of squeaks

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.289 
the box which is good because of squeaks
we<00:03:14.040> don't<00:03:14.190> know<00:03:14.340> how<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:14.579> use<00:03:14.730> power<00:03:14.940> tools

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
we don't know how to use power tools

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.759 
we don't know how to use power tools
so<00:03:16.019> I'll<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.290> follow<00:03:16.440> those<00:03:16.739> instructions

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
so I'll just follow those instructions

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.370 
so I'll just follow those instructions
and<00:03:17.489> we'll<00:03:17.640> get<00:03:17.760> them<00:03:17.880> right<00:03:18.030> onto<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.630> wall

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
and we'll get them right onto the wall

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.520 
and we'll get them right onto the wall

just pops right off easy enough and is

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.130 
just pops right off easy enough and is
that<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.670> Phillips<00:04:04.360> screwdriver<00:04:04.599> that<00:04:05.019> you're

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
that a Phillips screwdriver that you're

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.589 
that a Phillips screwdriver that you're
using<00:04:05.290> on<00:04:05.439> these<00:04:05.590> screws<00:04:05.879> fly<00:04:06.879> that<00:04:07.090> flathead

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
using on these screws fly that flathead

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.509 
using on these screws fly that flathead
right<00:04:08.140> we<00:04:08.530> needed<00:04:08.799> a<00:04:08.860> Phillips<00:04:09.189> to<00:04:09.310> get<00:04:09.430> the

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
right we needed a Phillips to get the

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.000 
right we needed a Phillips to get the
battery<00:04:09.909> case<00:04:10.150> off<00:04:10.390> but<00:04:10.659> the<00:04:10.780> screws<00:04:11.680> actually

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
battery case off but the screws actually

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.009 
battery case off but the screws actually
going<00:04:12.159> to<00:04:12.340> those<00:04:12.459> two<00:04:12.700> holes<00:04:12.939> on<00:04:13.209> above<00:04:13.840> and

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
going to those two holes on above and

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:21.479 
going to those two holes on above and
below<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.470> joystick<00:04:14.829> itself<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:19.680> see<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:21.340> that

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
below the joystick itself I see is that

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:37.680 
below the joystick itself I see is that
gonna<00:04:21.609> be<00:04:21.789> a<00:04:21.820> problem<00:04:21.880> going<00:04:22.300> into<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:36.690> hold

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
gonna be a problem going into the hold

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:48.900 
gonna be a problem going into the hold
on<00:04:37.810> side<00:04:39.270> there<00:04:40.270> we<00:04:40.360> go<00:04:47.370> now<00:04:48.370> according<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.760> the

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
on side there we go now according to the

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.120 
on side there we go now according to the
instructions<00:04:49.479> the<00:04:49.840> light<00:04:50.650> switch<00:04:50.949> will<00:04:51.100> be

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
instructions the light switch will be

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.590 
instructions the light switch will be
the<00:04:51.340> opposite<00:04:51.940> behavior<00:04:52.360> that<00:04:52.449> you'd

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
the opposite behavior that you'd

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.350 
the opposite behavior that you'd
normally<00:04:52.780> expect<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:54.639> on<00:04:54.760> most<00:04:54.970> light<00:04:55.150> switch

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
normally expect so on most light switch

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.730 
normally expect so on most light switch
is<00:04:55.510> pushing<00:04:55.870> up<00:04:56.050> will<00:04:56.320> turn<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.590> light<00:04:56.710> switch

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
is pushing up will turn the light switch

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:05.640 
is pushing up will turn the light switch
on<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:58.270> push<00:04:58.449> it<00:04:58.539> down<00:04:58.570> will<00:04:58.900> turn<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.199> off<00:05:04.650> but

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
on and push it down will turn it off but

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.050 
on and push it down will turn it off but
this<00:05:05.800> doesn't<00:05:06.070> actually<00:05:06.190> replace<00:05:06.699> the<00:05:06.910> light

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
this doesn't actually replace the light

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.140 
this doesn't actually replace the light
switches<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.539> cover<00:05:08.320> for<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.680> light<00:05:08.860> switch<00:05:09.160> so

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
switches a cover for the light switch so

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.089 
switches a cover for the light switch so
pushing<00:05:10.539> down<00:05:10.900> on<00:05:10.930> this<00:05:11.320> will<00:05:11.620> push<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:11.949> light

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
pushing down on this will push the light

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:19.379 
pushing down on this will push the light
switch<00:05:12.370> up<00:05:15.240> now<00:05:17.220> fumblerooski<00:05:18.220> sorry<00:05:19.180> about

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
switch up now fumblerooski sorry about

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:20.240 
switch up now fumblerooski sorry about
that

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
that

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:30.709 
that
save<00:05:21.250> it<00:05:21.340> for<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.550> outtakes<00:05:21.669> bloopers

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:32.239 

so<00:05:31.289> this<00:05:31.469> seems<00:05:31.619> like<00:05:31.709> something<00:05:31.949> that

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:32.249 
so this seems like something that

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.279 
so this seems like something that
anybody<00:05:33.209> proficient<00:05:33.869> with<00:05:33.959> a<00:05:34.049> screwdriver

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
anybody proficient with a screwdriver

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.289 
anybody proficient with a screwdriver
can<00:05:34.739> do<00:05:34.919> you<00:05:35.279> don't<00:05:35.399> need<00:05:35.519> to<00:05:35.610> be<00:05:35.699> an<00:05:35.909> expert<00:05:36.059> at

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:36.299 
can do you don't need to be an expert at

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:47.389 
can do you don't need to be an expert at
wiring<00:05:36.809> or<00:05:36.929> anything<00:05:37.110> no<00:05:46.369> person
