Morrison<00:03:23.510> Owens<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:23.960> thought<00:03:24.170> Ziggler<00:03:24.350> got<00:03:24.560> out

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
Morrison Owens I thought Ziggler got out

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.410 
Morrison Owens I thought Ziggler got out
of<00:03:24.740> the<00:03:24.800> way<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:24.950> guess<00:03:25.220> Ziggler<00:03:25.490> did<00:03:25.640> not<00:03:25.790> avoid

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
of the way I guess Ziggler did not avoid

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.510 
of the way I guess Ziggler did not avoid
that<00:03:26.720> at<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:26.900> time<00:03:27.050> Morrison<00:03:27.980> top<00:03:28.130> rope<00:03:28.340> it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
that at that time Morrison top rope it

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.370 
that at that time Morrison top rope it
all<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.730> want<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.090> great<00:03:29.300> dropkick<00:03:29.570> from<00:03:29.960> the<00:03:30.140> top

all I want a great dropkick from the top

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.070 
all I want a great dropkick from the top
I<00:03:30.680> think<00:03:31.310> Morrison<00:03:31.760> was<00:03:31.880> thinking<00:03:32.600> something

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
I think Morrison was thinking something

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.140 
I think Morrison was thinking something
else<00:03:33.350> but<00:03:33.560> he<00:03:33.950> changed<00:03:34.640> direction<00:03:34.760> in<00:03:35.090> midair

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
else but he changed direction in midair

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.180 
else but he changed direction in midair
and<00:03:35.630> because<00:03:36.500> he<00:03:36.560> didn't<00:03:36.710> want<00:03:36.740> to<00:03:36.890> get<00:03:36.950> caught

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
and because he didn't want to get caught

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.680 
and because he didn't want to get caught
again<00:03:37.250> we<00:03:37.520> get<00:03:37.640> it<00:03:37.760> earlier<00:03:38.210> in<00:03:38.300> this<00:03:38.420> match
