you coming out with educate dominate I

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.640 
you coming out with educate dominate I
thought<00:00:33.570> today<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.840> touched<00:00:34.200> briefly<00:00:34.380> on

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
thought today I touched briefly on

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.190 
thought today I touched briefly on
program<00:00:35.550> design<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.270> approach<00:00:36.750> my

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
program design and how I approach my

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.980 
program design and how I approach my
periodization<00:00:38.510> particularly<00:00:39.510> because<00:00:39.660> I'm

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:39.990 
periodization particularly because I'm

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.440 
periodization particularly because I'm
just<00:00:40.170> coming<00:00:40.410> off<00:00:40.500> an<00:00:40.770> injury<00:00:40.980> or<00:00:41.450> more

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
just coming off an injury or more

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.480 
just coming off an injury or more
particularly<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.900> surgery<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:44.100> obviously

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
particularly a surgery which obviously

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.770 
particularly a surgery which obviously
set<00:00:44.640> me<00:00:44.730> back<00:00:44.790> I<00:00:44.910> had<00:00:45.150> to<00:00:45.180> take<00:00:45.360> five<00:00:45.570> just

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
set me back I had to take five just

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.110 
set me back I had to take five just
spent<00:00:46.290> both<00:00:46.410> six<00:00:46.650> weeks<00:00:46.860> off<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> gym<00:00:47.370> give<00:00:48.000> or

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
spent both six weeks off the gym give or

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.790 
spent both six weeks off the gym give or
take<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.990> lot<00:00:49.290> of<00:00:49.320> people<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.590> asked<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
take so a lot of people are asked a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.080 
take so a lot of people are asked a
little<00:00:49.890> bit<00:00:50.070> how<00:00:50.220> do<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.460> come<00:00:50.700> back<00:00:50.880> from

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
little bit how do you come back from

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.220 
little bit how do you come back from
something<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.540> that<00:00:51.720> and<00:00:51.930> how<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:52.080> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
something like that and how do you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.020 
something like that and how do you
approach<00:00:52.470> you<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.190> basic<00:00:53.490> Kuiper's<00:00:53.880> free

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
approach you know a basic Kuiper's free

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
approach you know a basic Kuiper's free
program<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.960> ideally<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.310> give<00:00:56.400> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
program so ideally I'm going to give you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.190 
program so ideally I'm going to give you
guys<00:00:56.580> an<00:00:56.730> idea<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.330> insights<00:00:57.900> that<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
guys an idea as to the insights that I

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.350 
guys an idea as to the insights that I
look<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.950> when<00:00:58.980> creating<00:00:59.400> this<00:00:59.640> my<00:01:00.090> approach

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
look at when creating this my approach

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.160 
look at when creating this my approach
so<00:01:01.290> obviously<00:01:01.560> you<00:01:01.650> have<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> start<00:01:02.100> off<00:01:02.280> with

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
so obviously you have to start off with

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.109 
so obviously you have to start off with
you<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.199> minimal<00:01:04.680> volume<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.670> body<00:01:05.820> kit

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you know minimal volume your body kit

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.319 
you know minimal volume your body kit
you<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:06.990> obviously<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:08.640> recover<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
you know obviously we recover and

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.660 
you know obviously we recover and
respond<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.840> large<00:01:10.829> amounts<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> volume<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.640> we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
respond to large amounts of volume so we

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.540 
respond to large amounts of volume so we
start<00:01:11.940> with<00:01:12.030> very<00:01:12.060> very<00:01:12.390> minimal<00:01:12.659> volume<00:01:13.550> two

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
start with very very minimal volume two

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.000 
start with very very minimal volume two
or<00:01:14.700> three<00:01:14.880> minutes<00:01:15.030> rest<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.770> about

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
or three minutes rest it's really about

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.520 
or three minutes rest it's really about
what<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> call<00:01:17.780> relearning<00:01:18.780> motor<00:01:19.110> movement

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
what I call relearning motor movement

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320 
what I call relearning motor movement
patterns<00:01:19.800> relearning<00:01:20.310> movement<00:01:21.030> patterns

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
patterns relearning movement patterns

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.260 
patterns relearning movement patterns
really<00:01:21.720> really<00:01:21.930> simple<00:01:22.230> stuff<00:01:23.150> take<00:01:24.150> an

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
really really simple stuff take an

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.640 
really really simple stuff take an
exercise<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> full<00:01:25.050> range<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> motion<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
exercise to a full range of motion and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.960 
exercise to a full range of motion and
teach<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.130> muscle<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.550> contract

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
teach that muscle how to contract

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.510 
teach that muscle how to contract
properly<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.960> appropriate<00:01:28.440> range<00:01:28.650> last

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
properly in the appropriate range last

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.580 
properly in the appropriate range last
you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> two<00:01:30.720> weeks<00:01:30.870> once

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
you know the first one to two weeks once

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.020 
you know the first one to two weeks once
you<00:01:31.710> feel<00:01:31.860> your<00:01:32.010> body<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.310> starting<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.729> adapt

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you feel your body is starting to adapt

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020 
you feel your body is starting to adapt
to<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.680> again<00:01:34.680> another<00:01:34.920> reason<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.370> have<00:01:35.940> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
to that again another reason you have to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.760 
to that again another reason you have to
go<00:01:36.120> slowly<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.750> anytime<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.740> looking

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
go slowly is you anytime you're looking

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
go slowly is you anytime you're looking
for<00:01:38.250> ideal<00:01:38.640> body<00:01:38.970> composition<00:01:39.270> at<00:01:39.510> virtually

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
for ideal body composition at virtually

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.500 
for ideal body composition at virtually
you<00:01:39.960> need<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.200> minimize<00:01:40.380> information<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.670> if

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
you need to minimize information so if

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.719 
you need to minimize information so if
we're<00:01:42.690> doing<00:01:42.810> too<00:01:43.140> much<00:01:43.320> training<00:01:43.620> too<00:01:44.460> fast

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
we're doing too much training too fast

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.130 
we're doing too much training too fast
and<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.030> too<00:01:45.240> sore<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.840> question<00:01:45.960> all

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and get too sore I get this question all

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.390 
and get too sore I get this question all
the<00:01:46.170> time<00:01:46.229> should<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.680> know<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.159> kill<00:01:47.370> a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
the time should I you know really kill a

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.039 
the time should I you know really kill a
muscle<00:01:47.820> or<00:01:47.970> should<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.479> train<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.690> little<00:01:48.930> more

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
muscle or should I train a little more

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.750 
muscle or should I train a little more
frequently<00:01:49.500> something<00:01:50.100> called<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.369> repeated

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
frequently something called a repeated

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.550 
frequently something called a repeated
bat<00:01:50.909> effect<00:01:51.240> has<00:01:51.690> been<00:01:51.720> shown<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.350> more

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
bat effect has been shown to be more

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.840 
bat effect has been shown to be more
beneficial<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> long<00:01:53.460> term<00:01:53.670> growth

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
beneficial for the long term growth

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.969 
beneficial for the long term growth
meaning<00:01:54.270> don't<00:01:54.990> train<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.350> quite<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.710> hard<00:01:55.920> to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
meaning don't train it quite as hard to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:56.930 
meaning don't train it quite as hard to
strain<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.369> more<00:01:56.520> often

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
strain it more often

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.550 
strain it more often
so<00:01:57.420> anybody<00:01:57.690> looking<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.170> perch<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.500> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
week a couple weeks I come back I'm

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
week a couple weeks I come back I'm
doing<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.580> little<00:02:02.880> less<00:02:03.090> volume<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.810> little<00:02:03.960> more

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
doing a little less volume a little more

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.859 
doing a little less volume a little more
time<00:02:04.409> between<00:02:05.280> sets<00:02:05.760> we're<00:02:06.390> allowing<00:02:06.659> my<00:02:06.840> body

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
time between sets we're allowing my body

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.320 
time between sets we're allowing my body
to<00:02:07.140> adapt<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.740> trying<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> accumulate

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
to adapt and trying not to accumulate

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.699 
to adapt and trying not to accumulate
excessive<00:02:09.780> inflammation<00:02:09.899> which<00:02:10.409> is<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.649> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
excessive inflammation which is going to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.020 
excessive inflammation which is going to
force

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
force

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.880 
force
injury<00:02:11.569> will<00:02:12.080> have<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.260> take<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.470> lot<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.740> time

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
injury will have to take a lot of time

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.400 
injury will have to take a lot of time
off<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.970> next<00:02:14.240> thing<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:15.080> I'll

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
off the next thing that I do is I'll

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.980 
off the next thing that I do is I'll
increase<00:02:15.830> or<00:02:16.040> decrease<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.730> rest<00:02:17.030> periods<00:02:17.390> so

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
increase or decrease the rest periods so

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.330 
increase or decrease the rest periods so
essentially<00:02:18.440> I'm<00:02:18.530> increasing<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:18.980> workout

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
essentially I'm increasing the workout

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.949 
essentially I'm increasing the workout
density<00:02:19.880> let's<00:02:20.060> call<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.270> workout<00:02:20.540> density

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
density let's call the workout density

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.559 
density let's call the workout density
so<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.380> mean<00:02:21.770> ultimately<00:02:22.220> doing<00:02:22.819> either<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
so I mean ultimately doing either the

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.820 
so I mean ultimately doing either the
same<00:02:23.750> amount<00:02:23.990> of<00:02:24.020> work<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.410> shorter<00:02:24.709> period

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
same amount of work in a shorter period

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.440 
same amount of work in a shorter period
of<00:02:24.950> time<00:02:25.130> or<00:02:25.340> slightly<00:02:25.670> more<00:02:25.940> work<00:02:26.120> because

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
of time or slightly more work because

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.090 
of time or slightly more work because
it's<00:02:26.739> less<00:02:27.739> rest<00:02:28.040> between<00:02:28.310> sets<00:02:29.860> beyond<00:02:30.860> that

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
it's less rest between sets beyond that

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.220 
it's less rest between sets beyond that
then<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.430> start<00:02:31.760> adding<00:02:31.880> in<00:02:32.239> slightly<00:02:33.050> more

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
then I start adding in slightly more

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.740 
then I start adding in slightly more
frequent<00:02:33.950> workouts<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.640> instead<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.540> doing

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
frequent workouts so instead of doing

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.559 
frequent workouts so instead of doing
something<00:02:35.989> every<00:02:36.200> six<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.190> seven<00:02:37.670> days<00:02:37.850> maybe

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
something every six to seven days maybe

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:39.729 
something every six to seven days maybe
I'll<00:02:38.660> start<00:02:38.810> doing<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.110> every<00:02:39.290> four<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.560> five

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
I'll start doing it every four to five

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.400 
I'll start doing it every four to five
days<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.610> my<00:02:40.730> next<00:02:40.970> thing<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.810> from<00:02:42.020> density

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
days so my next thing is so from density

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.570 
days so my next thing is so from density
then<00:02:42.530> we<00:02:42.590> go<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.770> frequency<00:02:43.220> we<00:02:43.310> improve

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
then we go to frequency we improve

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.490 
then we go to frequency we improve
workout<00:02:44.090> frequency<00:02:44.720> or<00:02:44.840> increased<00:02:45.170> workout

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
workout frequency or increased workout

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.560 
workout frequency or increased workout
frequency<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.700> now<00:02:46.850> I'm<00:02:46.970> doing<00:02:47.120> every<00:02:47.390> body

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
frequency so now I'm doing every body

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.960 
frequency so now I'm doing every body
part<00:02:47.750> every<00:02:48.050> four<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.350> five<00:02:48.530> days<00:02:48.739> still<00:02:49.519> using

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
part every four to five days still using

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.840 
part every four to five days still using
on<00:02:50.180> average<00:02:50.630> 60<00:02:51.110> seconds<00:02:51.530> rest<00:02:51.769> between<00:02:52.550> sets

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
on average 60 seconds rest between sets

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.479 
on average 60 seconds rest between sets
and<00:02:53.720> try<00:02:53.930> not<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.170> get<00:02:54.620> myself<00:02:54.709> too<00:02:55.130> long<00:02:55.340> to

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
and try not to get myself too long to

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.460 
and try not to get myself too long to
recover<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.090> not<00:02:56.600> let<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.870> workout<00:02:57.170> stretch

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
recover and not let the workout stretch

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.020 
recover and not let the workout stretch
anywhere<00:02:57.769> beyond<00:02:57.980> an<00:02:58.100> hour<00:02:58.220> hour<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.880> ten

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
anywhere beyond an hour hour and ten

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.880 
anywhere beyond an hour hour and ten
minutes<00:02:59.350> if<00:03:00.350> we're<00:03:00.530> really<00:03:00.680> working

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
minutes if we're really working

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.860 
minutes if we're really working
efficiently<00:03:01.459> which<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.209> flat<00:03:02.420> yet<00:03:02.630> but<00:03:02.840> a

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
efficiently which is it flat yet but a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.720 
efficiently which is it flat yet but a
little<00:03:03.080> down<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.350> road<00:03:03.500> 45<00:03:04.250> minutes<00:03:04.550> it<00:03:04.610> hit

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
little down the road 45 minutes it hit

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.270 
little down the road 45 minutes it hit
really<00:03:04.850> hard<00:03:04.970> we<00:03:05.720> get<00:03:05.900> out<00:03:06.080> so<00:03:06.800> then<00:03:06.980> beyond

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
really hard we get out so then beyond

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.830 
really hard we get out so then beyond
frequency<00:03:07.790> what<00:03:07.940> I'm<00:03:08.060> going<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.209> be<00:03:08.330> doing<00:03:08.569> is

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
frequency what I'm going to be doing is

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.250 
frequency what I'm going to be doing is
I'm<00:03:09.140> going<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.350> be<00:03:09.670> starting<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.760> add<00:03:10.880> in

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
I'm going to be starting to add in

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.350 
I'm going to be starting to add in
intensifiers<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:13.069> for<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.370> first<00:03:13.819> three<00:03:14.269> to

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
intensifiers so for this first three to

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.699 
intensifiers so for this first three to
four<00:03:14.540> weeks<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:14.989> I'm<00:03:15.170> back<00:03:15.320> in<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.530> gym

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
four weeks that I'm back in the gym

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.440 
four weeks that I'm back in the gym
there's<00:03:16.250> really<00:03:16.400> not<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:16.640> lot<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.820> intensifiers

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
there's really not a lot of intensifiers

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.180 
there's really not a lot of intensifiers
it's<00:03:17.630> not<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> lot<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:17.989> super<00:03:18.290> sets<00:03:18.500> there's<00:03:19.040> not

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
it's not a lot of super sets there's not

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.100 
it's not a lot of super sets there's not
a<00:03:19.220> lot<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.400> drop<00:03:19.670> sets<00:03:20.000> it's<00:03:20.600> just<00:03:20.810> really

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
a lot of drop sets it's just really

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.630 
a lot of drop sets it's just really
trying<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.530> keep<00:03:21.590> everything<00:03:21.860> straight<00:03:22.010> sets

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
trying to keep everything straight sets

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.970 
trying to keep everything straight sets
and<00:03:22.910> allow<00:03:23.090> my<00:03:23.269> body<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.570> adapt<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.049> the

and allow my body to adapt to the

and allow my body to adapt to the
increased<00:03:25.340> density<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.820> increased

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
increased density and increased

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.910 
increased density and increased
frequency<00:03:26.480> why<00:03:26.690> because<00:03:27.410> obviously<00:03:27.560> if<00:03:27.829> I've

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
frequency why because obviously if I've

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.350 
frequency why because obviously if I've
been<00:03:28.040> off<00:03:28.160> for<00:03:28.310> six<00:03:28.459> weeks<00:03:28.670> my<00:03:28.910> body's<00:03:29.209> going

been off for six weeks my body's going

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.900 
been off for six weeks my body's going
to<00:03:29.420> really<00:03:29.870> grow<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:31.010> respond<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.519> anything<00:03:31.760> I

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
to really grow and respond to anything I

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.410 
to really grow and respond to anything I
subjected<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:32.750> why<00:03:32.900> would<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.200> try<00:03:33.829> to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
subjected to so why would I try to

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.460 
subjected to so why would I try to
overload<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.750> I'll<00:03:36.079> use<00:03:36.230> all<00:03:36.380> these

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
overload and I'll use all these

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.160 
overload and I'll use all these
intensifiers<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.400> all<00:03:37.459> these<00:03:38.170> additional

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
intensifiers and all these additional

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.449 
intensifiers and all these additional
techniques<00:03:39.560> which<00:03:39.859> is<00:03:39.980> going<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.160> make<00:03:40.280> my

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
techniques which is going to make my

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.729 
techniques which is going to make my
workouts<00:03:40.850> harder<00:03:41.840> when<00:03:42.260> my<00:03:42.380> body<00:03:42.560> doesn't

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
workouts harder when my body doesn't

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.110 
workouts harder when my body doesn't
really<00:03:42.950> need<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.370> adapt<00:03:43.609> my<00:03:43.760> body's<00:03:44.030> really

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
really need it to adapt my body's really

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.060 
really need it to adapt my body's really
going<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.390> adapt<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.840> guy<00:03:45.049> subjected<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.890> so

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
going to adapt to a guy subjected to so

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.490 
going to adapt to a guy subjected to so
ideally<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.459> logic<00:03:46.850> is<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.930> should<00:03:48.109> be<00:03:48.230> doing

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
ideally the logic is you should be doing

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.349 
ideally the logic is you should be doing
as<00:03:48.620> little<00:03:48.920> as<00:03:49.220> possible<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.730> get<00:03:49.910> all<00:03:49.970> as<00:03:50.150> much

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
as little as possible to get all as much

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.240 
as little as possible to get all as much
growth<00:03:50.600> as<00:03:50.720> possible<00:03:51.200> so<00:03:51.440> are<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.130> that

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
growth as possible so are and that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.620 
growth as possible so are and that
sounds<00:03:52.519> kind<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.760> sounds<00:03:53.299> like<00:03:53.329> a<00:03:53.420> cheater

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
sounds kind of sounds like a cheater

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.390 
sounds kind of sounds like a cheater
approach<00:03:53.930> but<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.859> want<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.040> work<00:03:55.190> really

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
approach but you want to work really

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.759 
approach but you want to work really
really<00:03:55.549> hard<00:03:55.790> just<00:03:56.390> with<00:03:56.510> small<00:03:56.810> bouts<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:57.470> I

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
really hard just with small bouts so I

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.470 
really hard just with small bouts so I
mean<00:03:58.190> ultimately<00:03:58.280> today<00:03:58.940> I'm<00:03:59.060> working<00:03:59.180> for

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
mean ultimately today I'm working for

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.599 
mean ultimately today I'm working for
thirty<00:03:59.690> minutes<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.380> really<00:04:00.500> hard<00:04:00.799> next<00:04:01.459> we

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
thirty minutes it's really hard next we

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.069 
thirty minutes it's really hard next we
got<00:04:01.700> number<00:04:01.880> four<00:04:02.269> for<00:04:02.420> 40<00:04:02.690> minutes<00:04:02.840> and

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
got number four for 40 minutes and

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.630 
got number four for 40 minutes and
really<00:04:03.350> I<00:04:03.530> still<00:04:03.799> work<00:04:03.920> really<00:04:04.070> hard<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:04.459> get

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
really I still work really hard and get

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.040 
really I still work really hard and get
additional<00:04:05.060> benefits

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
additional benefits

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.390 
additional benefits
so<00:04:06.290> ultimately<00:04:06.740> we're<00:04:07.040> trying<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.280> be<00:04:07.340> really

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
so ultimately we're trying to be really

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.830 
so ultimately we're trying to be really
smart<00:04:07.850> with<00:04:07.910> our<00:04:08.030> approach<00:04:08.270> and<00:04:08.450> not<00:04:08.570> burn<00:04:08.720> out

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
smart with our approach and not burn out

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.930 
smart with our approach and not burn out
our<00:04:08.990> body<00:04:09.200> there<00:04:09.800> is<00:04:09.920> definitely<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.340> time<00:04:10.550> and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
our body there is definitely a time and

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.670 
our body there is definitely a time and
a<00:04:11.000> place<00:04:11.030> for<00:04:11.270> doing<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:12.410> know<00:04:12.530> an

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
a place for doing you know an

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.020 
a place for doing you know an
hour-and-a-half<00:04:13.040> workout<00:04:13.490> twice<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.760> day

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
hour-and-a-half workout twice a day

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.970 
hour-and-a-half workout twice a day
which<00:04:14.270> I'll<00:04:14.420> get<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.650> but<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.950> know

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
which I'll get to but you know

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.280 
which I'll get to but you know
ultimately<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.760> try<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.180> do<00:04:17.270> as<00:04:17.870> little<00:04:18.170> work

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
ultimately you try to do as little work

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.990 
ultimately you try to do as little work
or<00:04:18.860> as<00:04:18.950> much<00:04:19.100> work<00:04:19.310> as<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.489> shorter<00:04:19.760> period<00:04:19.880> of

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
or as much work as a shorter period of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.790 
or as much work as a shorter period of
time<00:04:20.060> as<00:04:20.270> possible<00:04:20.300> until<00:04:21.170> your<00:04:21.410> body<00:04:21.470> stops

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
time as possible until your body stops

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.080 
time as possible until your body stops
responding<00:04:21.950> to<00:04:22.310> that<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.610> then<00:04:22.730> slightly

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
responding to that and then slightly

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.120 
responding to that and then slightly
make<00:04:23.420> increases<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.530> whether<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:24.830> be<00:04:24.920> 10

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
make increases so whether it be 10

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.890 
make increases so whether it be 10
minutes<00:04:25.370> or<00:04:25.460> 5<00:04:25.640> minutes<00:04:25.940> or<00:04:26.390> adding<00:04:26.630> an<00:04:26.720> extra

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
minutes or 5 minutes or adding an extra

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.600 
minutes or 5 minutes or adding an extra
set<00:04:27.170> in<00:04:27.320> here<00:04:27.500> or<00:04:27.620> adding<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:27.890> little<00:04:28.160> bit<00:04:28.370> less

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
set in here or adding a little bit less

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.550 
set in here or adding a little bit less
rest<00:04:28.940> in<00:04:29.120> there<00:04:29.390> okay<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.320> next<00:04:30.440> thing

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
rest in there okay so the next thing

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.720 
rest in there okay so the next thing
I'll<00:04:30.740> start<00:04:30.920> doing<00:04:31.070> like<00:04:31.220> I<00:04:31.310> said<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.640> I'll

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
I'll start doing like I said is I'll

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.860 
I'll start doing like I said is I'll
edit<00:04:31.880> intensifiers

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
edit intensifiers

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.770 
edit intensifiers
so<00:04:33.290> I<00:04:33.320> did<00:04:33.830> super<00:04:34.730> sets<00:04:34.940> drop<00:04:35.240> sets<00:04:35.510> so<00:04:35.690> the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
so I did super sets drop sets so the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.060 
so I did super sets drop sets so the
first<00:04:35.960> thing<00:04:36.140> I<00:04:36.200> lied<00:04:36.380> in<00:04:36.530> is<00:04:36.680> all<00:04:36.800> even<00:04:37.010> a

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
first thing I lied in is all even a

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.650 
first thing I lied in is all even a
single<00:04:37.280> drop<00:04:37.460> set<00:04:37.790> so<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.300> lot<00:04:38.450> of<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:38.630> know

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
single drop set so a lot of you know

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.230 
single drop set so a lot of you know
about<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.140> mi40<00:04:39.620> program<00:04:39.980> that<00:04:40.190> I

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
about the mi40 program that I

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.430 
about the mi40 program that I
incorporate<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.480> lot<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.690> nos<00:04:41.870> sets<00:04:42.170> into<00:04:42.350> my

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
incorporate a lot of nos sets into my

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.200 
incorporate a lot of nos sets into my
training<00:04:42.650> which<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.340> absolutely<00:04:43.640> do<00:04:43.880> when<00:04:44.090> I'm

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
training which I absolutely do when I'm

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.810 
training which I absolutely do when I'm
at<00:04:44.360> five<00:04:44.570> peak<00:04:44.990> when<00:04:45.950> I'm<00:04:46.040> training<00:04:46.280> toward

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
at five peak when I'm training toward

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.400 
at five peak when I'm training toward
building<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:47.720> will<00:04:47.840> start<00:04:48.110> with<00:04:48.230> with

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
building to that it will start with with

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.310 
building to that it will start with with
simply<00:04:49.040> super<00:04:49.310> sets<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:50.210> two<00:04:50.300> exercises<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.230> a

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
simply super sets so two exercises in a

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.700 
simply super sets so two exercises in a
row<00:04:51.470> or<00:04:51.680> a<00:04:51.740> simple<00:04:52.430> drop<00:04:52.610> set<00:04:53.530> again<00:04:54.530> that's

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
row or a simple drop set again that's

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.960 
row or a simple drop set again that's
one<00:04:54.950> additional<00:04:55.400> thing<00:04:55.520> we<00:04:55.700> add<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:55.940> our

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
one additional thing we add to our

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.570 
one additional thing we add to our
repertoire<00:04:56.390> which's<00:04:56.690> which<00:04:57.320> is<00:04:57.650> a<00:04:57.770> change<00:04:58.190> and

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
repertoire which's which is a change and

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.850 
repertoire which's which is a change and
my<00:04:58.940> body<00:04:59.150> will<00:04:59.300> will<00:04:59.690> respond<00:05:00.140> then<00:05:00.680> maybe

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
my body will will respond then maybe

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.290 
my body will will respond then maybe
we'll<00:05:01.010> go<00:05:01.130> to<00:05:01.190> try<00:05:01.430> sets<00:05:01.760> or<00:05:02.030> we'll<00:05:02.150> put<00:05:02.270> a

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
we'll go to try sets or we'll put a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.970 
we'll go to try sets or we'll put a
triple<00:05:02.540> drop<00:05:02.840> sets<00:05:03.110> and<00:05:03.620> then<00:05:03.740> eventually

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
triple drop sets and then eventually

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.740 
triple drop sets and then eventually
we'll<00:05:04.220> work<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.520> went<00:05:04.700> from<00:05:04.820> no<00:05:04.970> sets<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.510> all

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
we'll work I went from no sets and all

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.480 
we'll work I went from no sets and all
those<00:05:05.930> all<00:05:06.170> while<00:05:06.380> keeping<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.770> frequency<00:05:07.250> at

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
those all while keeping the frequency at

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.660 
those all while keeping the frequency at
every<00:05:08.300> four<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.630> five<00:05:08.810> days<00:05:08.990> per<00:05:09.290> body<00:05:09.470> part<00:05:09.770> a

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
every four to five days per body part a

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.460 
every four to five days per body part a
lot<00:05:11.300> of<00:05:11.360> people<00:05:11.600> have<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.780> misconception<00:05:11.900> of

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
lot of people have the misconception of

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.170 
lot of people have the misconception of
training<00:05:12.800> every<00:05:12.860> seven<00:05:13.280> days<00:05:13.310> being<00:05:13.730> optimal

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
training every seven days being optimal

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.000 
training every seven days being optimal
I<00:05:14.390> really<00:05:14.960> think<00:05:15.170> anyone<00:05:15.500> who<00:05:15.590> knows<00:05:15.710> anything

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
I really think anyone who knows anything

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.230 
I really think anyone who knows anything
about<00:05:16.130> hypertrophy<00:05:16.730> will<00:05:16.850> tell<00:05:17.030> you<00:05:17.120> that

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
about hypertrophy will tell you that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.150 
about hypertrophy will tell you that
every<00:05:17.420> seven<00:05:17.780> days<00:05:17.900> it's<00:05:18.080> not<00:05:18.260> optimal<00:05:18.680> it's

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
every seven days it's not optimal it's

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.500 
every seven days it's not optimal it's
just<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.460> know<00:05:19.580> what<00:05:19.940> does<00:05:20.030> your<00:05:20.060> body<00:05:20.240> know

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
just you know what does your body know

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.330 
just you know what does your body know
what<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:20.960> week<00:05:21.110> or<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.500> week<00:05:21.620> is<00:05:21.830> your<00:05:22.100> body<00:05:22.220> has

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
what a week or the week is your body has

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.190 
what a week or the week is your body has
no<00:05:22.460> idea<00:05:22.700> what<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.880> week<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.240> your<00:05:23.810> body<00:05:23.990> knows

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
no idea what a week is your body knows

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.750 
no idea what a week is your body knows
it<00:05:24.500> takes<00:05:24.950> this<00:05:25.040> long<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.340> recover<00:05:25.550> this

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
it takes this long to recover this

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.160 
it takes this long to recover this
muscle<00:05:26.150> whenever<00:05:26.420> it's<00:05:26.570> recover<00:05:26.840> it's<00:05:27.020> time

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
muscle whenever it's recover it's time

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.050 
muscle whenever it's recover it's time
to<00:05:27.260> do<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.440> again<00:05:27.680> as<00:05:28.190> someone<00:05:28.400> looking<00:05:29.000> to

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
to do it again as someone looking to

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.790 
to do it again as someone looking to
optimize<00:05:29.270> hypertrophy<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.110> often<00:05:30.470> looking

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
optimize hypertrophy and often looking

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.860 
optimize hypertrophy and often looking
to<00:05:30.890> optimize<00:05:30.980> body<00:05:31.520> composition<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.570> ideal

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
to optimize body composition the ideal

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.870 
to optimize body composition the ideal
goal<00:05:33.350> is<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.710> train<00:05:33.920> as<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.160> body<00:05:34.610> quite<00:05:34.760> as

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
goal is to train as a body quite as

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.420 
goal is to train as a body quite as
often<00:05:35.240> as<00:05:35.390> you<00:05:35.510> can<00:05:35.750> while<00:05:36.470> still<00:05:36.890> recovering

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
often as you can while still recovering

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.580 
often as you can while still recovering
so<00:05:38.150> I<00:05:38.180> mean<00:05:38.480> if<00:05:38.570> you<00:05:38.600> can<00:05:38.810> recover<00:05:38.930> training

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
so I mean if you can recover training

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.990 
so I mean if you can recover training
your<00:05:39.680> legs<00:05:39.800> over<00:05:39.950> three<00:05:40.220> days<00:05:40.340> you're<00:05:40.880> going

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
your legs over three days you're going

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.490 
your legs over three days you're going
to<00:05:41.060> grow<00:05:41.270> more<00:05:41.510> than<00:05:41.570> epic<00:05:41.990> training<00:05:42.290> for

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
to grow more than epic training for

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.740 
to grow more than epic training for
seven<00:05:42.710> days<00:05:42.800> very<00:05:43.100> simple<00:05:43.520> logic<00:05:43.880> but

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
seven days very simple logic but

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.390 
seven days very simple logic but
training<00:05:45.470> every<00:05:45.620> seven<00:05:45.890> days<00:05:45.920> is<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.220> huge

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
training every seven days is a huge

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.730 
training every seven days is a huge
misconception<00:05:46.670> probably<00:05:47.360> you<00:05:47.930> know<00:05:48.050> that

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
misconception probably you know that

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.620 
misconception probably you know that
came<00:05:48.950> to<00:05:49.100> fruition<00:05:49.520> in<00:05:49.880> an<00:05:49.970> operation<00:05:50.480> in<00:05:50.570> the

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
came to fruition in an operation in the

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.860 
came to fruition in an operation in the
90s<00:05:50.960> or<00:05:51.080> 80s<00:05:51.500> so<00:05:52.490> that's<00:05:53.120> in<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.330> past<00:05:53.540> we

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
90s or 80s so that's in the past we

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.450 
90s or 80s so that's in the past we
don't<00:05:54.020> think<00:05:54.110> about<00:05:54.260> that<00:05:54.350> anymore<00:05:54.470> so<00:05:54.980> we're

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
don't think about that anymore so we're

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.830 
don't think about that anymore so we're
on<00:05:55.580> to<00:05:55.610> training<00:05:56.030> for<00:05:56.120> four<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:56.419> five<00:05:56.570> days

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
on to training for four to five days

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.320 
on to training for four to five days
we're<00:05:57.380> doing<00:05:57.590> super<00:05:58.460> sets<00:05:58.640> drop<00:05:58.880> sets<00:05:59.120> and<00:05:59.270> not

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
we're doing super sets drop sets and not

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330 
we're doing super sets drop sets and not
sets<00:05:59.690> beyond<00:06:00.410> that<00:06:00.650> then<00:06:00.950> I'm<00:06:01.040> going<00:06:01.160> to<00:06:01.250> go

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
sets beyond that then I'm going to go

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.250 
sets beyond that then I'm going to go
into<00:06:01.490> doing<00:06:01.669> things<00:06:01.970> twice<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.450> day<00:06:02.660> so<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:02.900> love

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
into doing things twice a day so I love

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.980 
into doing things twice a day so I love
about<00:06:03.530> a<00:06:03.760> six<00:06:04.760> week<00:06:04.940> progression<00:06:05.540> before<00:06:05.930> I

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
about a six week progression before I

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.170 
about a six week progression before I
get<00:06:06.169> into<00:06:06.380> doing<00:06:06.500> things<00:06:06.800> in<00:06:07.070> to<00:06:07.550> add<00:06:07.669> a<00:06:07.760> split

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
get into doing things in to add a split

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.970 
get into doing things in to add a split
so<00:06:08.419> I<00:06:08.450> know<00:06:08.570> a<00:06:08.600> lot<00:06:08.720> of<00:06:08.750> you<00:06:08.870> guys<00:06:08.990> asked<00:06:09.410> no<00:06:09.830> man

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
so I know a lot of you guys asked no man

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.590 
so I know a lot of you guys asked no man
how<00:06:10.100> do<00:06:10.160> I<00:06:10.310> get<00:06:10.400> doing<00:06:10.880> things<00:06:11.090> twice<00:06:11.240> a<00:06:11.360> day

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
how do I get doing things twice a day

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.120 
how do I get doing things twice a day
there<00:06:12.050> needs<00:06:12.260> to<00:06:12.380> be<00:06:12.470> a<00:06:12.560> logical<00:06:12.800> progression

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
there needs to be a logical progression

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.890 
there needs to be a logical progression
guys<00:06:13.580> it<00:06:13.760> can't<00:06:13.940> just<00:06:14.000> be<00:06:14.180> from<00:06:14.840> A<00:06:15.020> to<00:06:15.290> Z

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
guys it can't just be from A to Z

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.930 
guys it can't just be from A to Z
or<00:06:15.960> from<00:06:16.260> zero<00:06:16.560> to<00:06:16.740> 100<00:06:16.920> it<00:06:17.490> doesn't<00:06:17.790> look<00:06:17.910> like

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
or from zero to 100 it doesn't look like

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.640 
or from zero to 100 it doesn't look like
that<00:06:18.120> or<00:06:18.480> at<00:06:18.840> least<00:06:18.870> it<00:06:19.050> shouldn't<00:06:19.260> work<00:06:19.380> like

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
that or at least it shouldn't work like

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.740 
that or at least it shouldn't work like
that<00:06:19.830> I<00:06:20.010> mean<00:06:20.610> you<00:06:20.940> could<00:06:21.120> theoretically<00:06:21.300> do

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
that I mean you could theoretically do

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.120 
that I mean you could theoretically do
it<00:06:21.870> but<00:06:22.020> you're<00:06:22.140> missing<00:06:22.440> all<00:06:22.530> these<00:06:22.680> these

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
it but you're missing all these these

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.370 
it but you're missing all these these
steps<00:06:23.640> for<00:06:23.760> growth<00:06:23.970> potential<00:06:24.450> in<00:06:24.510> between<00:06:24.780> so

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
steps for growth potential in between so

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.510 
steps for growth potential in between so
why<00:06:25.560> would<00:06:25.740> you<00:06:25.830> do<00:06:25.950> that<00:06:25.980> I<00:06:26.280> mean<00:06:26.430> ultimately

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
why would you do that I mean ultimately

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.980 
why would you do that I mean ultimately
as<00:06:26.850> someone<00:06:27.540> who's<00:06:27.630> looking<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.900> optimize

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
as someone who's looking to optimize

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.040 
as someone who's looking to optimize
super<00:06:28.500> trophy<00:06:29.390> like<00:06:30.390> I<00:06:30.510> say<00:06:30.660> it<00:06:30.750> sounds<00:06:30.930> like

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
super trophy like I say it sounds like

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.480 
super trophy like I say it sounds like
cheating<00:06:31.290> but<00:06:31.410> ideally<00:06:31.650> just<00:06:31.800> a<00:06:32.040> little<00:06:32.370> bit

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
cheating but ideally just a little bit

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.950 
cheating but ideally just a little bit
more<00:06:32.670> a<00:06:32.850> little<00:06:32.910> more<00:06:33.210> stimulus<00:06:33.690> will<00:06:33.840> give

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
more a little more stimulus will give

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.570 
more a little more stimulus will give
you<00:06:34.050> a<00:06:34.080> substantial<00:06:34.710> amount<00:06:35.130> of<00:06:35.190> growth<00:06:35.370> your

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
you a substantial amount of growth your

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.580 
you a substantial amount of growth your
body<00:06:35.730> can<00:06:35.940> only<00:06:35.970> grow<00:06:36.240> so<00:06:36.480> fast<00:06:36.510> so<00:06:37.350> why<00:06:37.530> you

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
body can only grow so fast so why you

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.680 
body can only grow so fast so why you
use<00:06:37.830> why<00:06:38.130> lose<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:38.760> use<00:06:39.000> all<00:06:39.300> these<00:06:39.420> growth

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
use why lose and use all these growth

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.390 
use why lose and use all these growth
steps<00:06:39.960> in<00:06:40.350> between<00:06:40.710> you<00:06:41.070> need<00:06:41.160> to<00:06:41.250> take

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
steps in between you need to take

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.950 
steps in between you need to take
advantage<00:06:41.730> of<00:06:41.820> every<00:06:42.000> growth<00:06:42.180> potential<00:06:42.900> in

between to add a training I do for 3
weeks<00:06:46.320> max<00:06:47.190> and<00:06:47.550> then<00:06:47.670> I<00:06:47.730> take<00:06:47.910> a<00:06:47.940> week<00:06:48.120> off<00:06:48.300> or
