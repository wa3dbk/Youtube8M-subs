our<00:00:32.940> quarterback<00:00:33.420> i<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:33.930> got<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.200> stop

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
our quarterback i think they got to stop

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.530 
our quarterback i think they got to stop
the<00:00:34.500> run<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> eliminate<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.120> big<00:00:36.360> plays

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the run and eliminate a lot of big plays

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.900 
the run and eliminate a lot of big plays
especially<00:00:36.930> from<00:00:37.469> girly<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.790> do

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
especially from girly so if they can do

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.280 
especially from girly so if they can do
that<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.120> think<00:00:39.239> it'd<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> four-quarter

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
that I think it'd be a four-quarter

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
powerful but he's also very fast and he

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
powerful but he's also very fast and he
can<00:00:57.420> pull<00:00:57.629> away<00:00:57.780> from<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.500> guys<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.890> you

think you'll have a shopping he's at

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.639 
think you'll have a shopping he's at
least<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> mix<00:01:48.570> right<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.259> there's<00:01:49.500> an

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
least in the mix right now if there's an

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.460 
least in the mix right now if there's an
X<00:01:49.829> Factor<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.369> each<00:01:50.490> team

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
X Factor for each team

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.770 
X Factor for each team
would<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.710> be<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:52.130> think<00:01:53.060> it's<00:01:53.150> offensive<00:01:53.450> line

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
would it be I think it's offensive line

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.780 
would it be I think it's offensive line
for<00:01:54.020> Tennessee<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.740> think<00:01:55.340> it's<00:01:55.490> Hutson<00:01:55.760> Mason

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790
