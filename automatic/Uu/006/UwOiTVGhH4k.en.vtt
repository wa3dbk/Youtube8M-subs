about it because they're new kuber's but

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410 
about it because they're new kuber's but
you<00:00:20.010> know<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.369> not<00:00:20.520> talked<00:00:20.820> about<00:00:21.060> because

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
you know it's not talked about because

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.179 
you know it's not talked about because
it<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.140> old<00:00:22.230> model<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.920> then

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
it is like a really old model and then

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.470 
it is like a really old model and then
they<00:00:23.279> came<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.519> -<00:00:23.670> goo<00:00:23.820> hyung<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.210> they<00:00:24.269> kind

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
they came out - goo hyung and they kind

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.450 
they came out - goo hyung and they kind
of<00:00:24.510> went<00:00:24.630> off<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.019> model<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.189> got

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of went off that model so what I got

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.779 
of went off that model so what I got
with<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> unboxing<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:29.099> bag<00:00:29.340> which

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
with the unboxing was a little bag which

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.680 
with the unboxing was a little bag which
I<00:00:30.090> don't<00:00:30.510> want<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.900> then<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:32.430> some<00:00:33.239> stickers

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
I don't want and then some some stickers

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.450 
I don't want and then some some stickers
and<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.989> guess<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.350> their<00:00:34.649> old<00:00:34.829> logo<00:00:35.309> or

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and I guess this was their old logo or

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.979 
and I guess this was their old logo or
maybe<00:00:35.640> that's<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.120> tie-in<00:00:36.480> logo<00:00:36.690> I'm<00:00:36.840> not

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
maybe that's just a tie-in logo I'm not

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.959 
maybe that's just a tie-in logo I'm not
exactly<00:00:37.290> sure<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:38.219> I'm<00:00:38.340> not<00:00:38.460> gonna<00:00:38.640> use<00:00:38.760> those

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
exactly sure but I'm not gonna use those

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.389 
exactly sure but I'm not gonna use those
because<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.750> them<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.710> comes

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
because I don't like them and now comes

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.819 
because I don't like them and now comes
the<00:00:41.520> cube<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.230> curious<00:00:43.469> about

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
the cube and I'm really curious about

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.619 
the cube and I'm really curious about
this<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.520> heard<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.390> great

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
this because I heard it's not that great

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.750 
this because I heard it's not that great
but<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.829> their<00:00:47.039> first<00:00:47.190> model<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
but you know it's their first model and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760 
but you know it's their first model and
I<00:00:47.879> know<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.350> goo<00:00:49.530> Hong

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
I know what you know the the goo Hong

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.010 
I know what you know the the goo Hong
and<00:00:49.950> all<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> new<00:00:50.219> Dian<00:00:50.579> pieces<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.690> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.270 
and all the new Dian pieces look like so
I'm<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.230> curious<00:00:52.469> about<00:00:52.649> how<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> moves

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I'm really curious about how this moves

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400 
I'm really curious about how this moves
and<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.670> already<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.300> how<00:00:54.510> blocky<00:00:55.020> it's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and I can already see how blocky it's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.099 
and I can already see how blocky it's
gonna<00:00:55.620> feel<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.820> let's<00:00:57.329> take<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> look<00:00:57.809> at<00:00:57.960> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
gonna feel so let's take a look at this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.250 
gonna feel so let's take a look at this
this<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> corner<00:00:59.039> piece<00:00:59.250> now<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.260> it's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
this is a corner piece now and it's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.450 
this is a corner piece now and it's
already<00:01:01.620> assembled<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.280> tell<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
already assembled and you can tell that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
already assembled and you can tell that
you<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.820> usual<00:01:03.780> Dian<00:01:04.080> cube<00:01:04.290> comes<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you know a usual Dian cube comes in

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.770 
you know a usual Dian cube comes in
three<00:01:05.040> pieces<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.630> really

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
three pieces and this is really really

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
three pieces and this is really really
square<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.890> curved<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.640> not

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
square it's not curved it's not

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.539 
square it's not curved it's not
shallowed<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:10.290> scalloped<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.159> it's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
shallowed out or scalloped is it's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.450 
shallowed out or scalloped is it's
called<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.689> pieces<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.280> guess

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
called in these pieces here and I guess

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.630 
called in these pieces here and I guess
these<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:15.570> caps<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:18.020> yep<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> there's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
these are caps for it yep so there's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.980 
these are caps for it yep so there's
caps<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> side<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.810> kind

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
caps that go on the side and that kind

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
caps that go on the side and that kind
of<00:01:22.049> reminds<00:01:22.380> me<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:23.040> Shing<00:01:23.280> shall<00:01:23.549> 4x4<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
of reminds me of a Shing shall 4x4 I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.490 
of reminds me of a Shing shall 4x4 I
don't<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.630> they're<00:01:24.750> three<00:01:24.990> by<00:01:25.110> threes<00:01:25.380> do

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
don't know if they're three by threes do

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.899 
don't know if they're three by threes do
that<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> know<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.009> they're<00:01:26.580> four<00:01:26.759> by

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
that but I know that they're four by

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.120 
that but I know that they're four by
fours<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.390> capped<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.930> these<00:01:28.380> sides<00:01:28.710> instead

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
fours are capped on these sides instead

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.910 
fours are capped on these sides instead
of<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.610> inside<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.680> hopefully<00:01:31.680> they<00:01:31.770> don't

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
of on the inside so hopefully they don't

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.469 
of on the inside so hopefully they don't
pop<00:01:32.189> out<00:01:32.369> let's<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.880> edge<00:01:35.880> piece

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
pop out let's see here is a edge piece

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.270 
pop out let's see here is a edge piece
and<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.619> looks<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:37.950> your<00:01:38.100> standard

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and that just looks like your standard

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.440 
and that just looks like your standard
edge<00:01:38.640> piece<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.840> fits<00:01:40.229> together<00:01:40.970> Wow

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.940 

here<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.140> fits<00:01:46.470> together<00:01:46.649> like

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
here we go so that fits together like

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.560 
here we go so that fits together like
this<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.000> don't<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.360> that's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
this and that's I don't know that's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.340 
this and that's I don't know that's
gonna<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.110> curious<00:01:50.299> I'm<00:01:51.299> not<00:01:51.570> sure<00:01:51.720> how<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> feel

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
gonna be curious I'm not sure how I feel

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410 
gonna be curious I'm not sure how I feel
about<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.159> design<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:53.970> sure<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
about the design but I'm sure that I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
about the design but I'm sure that I
will<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:55.470> how<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.860> feel<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.549> when<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
will know how I feel about it when the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
will know how I feel about it when the
time<00:01:56.880> comes<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.409> put<00:01:58.560> together

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
time comes because it's put together

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.950 
time comes because it's put together
which<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.399> gonna<00:01:59.790> happen<00:01:59.969> pretty<00:02:00.420> quick

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
which is gonna happen pretty quick

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.090 
which is gonna happen pretty quick
because<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.500> really<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> whole<00:02:01.890> lot<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
because it's not really a whole lot to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.569 
because it's not really a whole lot to
show<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.600> standard<00:02:04.579> its

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
show you here is your standard its

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.730 
show you here is your standard its
standard<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.299> mean<00:02:06.540> there's<00:02:06.990> nothing<00:02:07.469> really

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
standard I mean there's nothing really

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.710 
standard I mean there's nothing really
special<00:02:07.829> about<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.090> they<00:02:09.479> made<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
special about it but they made it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
special about it but they made it
special<00:02:10.170> by<00:02:10.289> making<00:02:10.830> more<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.039> more<00:02:11.160> versions

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
special by making more and more versions

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.580 
special by making more and more versions
which<00:02:11.760> turned<00:02:12.120> out<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.300> be<00:02:12.450> really<00:02:12.840> awesome<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
which turned out to be really awesome so

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.900 
which turned out to be really awesome so
I'm<00:02:13.980> gonna<00:02:14.129> go<00:02:14.250> ahead<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.519> put<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.730> together

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
I'm gonna go ahead and put this together

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.400 
I'm gonna go ahead and put this together
and<00:02:15.300> then<00:02:15.390> let<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.599> guys<00:02:15.750> know<00:02:15.989> what<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.170> think

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
and then let you guys know what I think

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.530 
and then let you guys know what I think
about<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.739> all<00:02:17.519> right<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.819> I've<00:02:17.910> had<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.239> cube

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
about it all right so I've had this cube

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.420 
about it all right so I've had this cube
for<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> couple<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.140> days<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.769> gotta<00:02:19.950> say<00:02:20.160> I'm

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
for a couple of days and I gotta say I'm

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.220 
for a couple of days and I gotta say I'm
actually<00:02:20.730> kind<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.120> surprised<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.810> thought

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
actually kind of surprised I thought

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.600 
actually kind of surprised I thought
that<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:22.410> was<00:02:22.560> gonna<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.069> give<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.310> cube

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
that I was gonna have to give this cube

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
that I was gonna have to give this cube
a<00:02:23.790> bad<00:02:24.569> review<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.349> definitely<00:02:25.590> not<00:02:25.769> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
a bad review and it's definitely not the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.619 
a bad review and it's definitely not the
best<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.489> Diane<00:02:26.819> series<00:02:27.209> don't<00:02:27.420> get<00:02:27.540> me

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
best in the Diane series don't get me

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.990 
best in the Diane series don't get me
wrong<00:02:27.660> but<00:02:28.379> it's<00:02:28.560> definitely<00:02:28.800> uh<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:29.700> it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
wrong but it's definitely uh it's it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.390 
wrong but it's definitely uh it's it's
it's<00:02:30.209> not<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> bad<00:02:30.750> cube<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.290> mean<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.069> corner

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
it's not a bad cube I mean in the corner

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's not a bad cube I mean in the corner
cuts<00:02:32.670> 45<00:02:33.209> degrees<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.319> rest<00:02:34.530> of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
cuts 45 degrees just like the rest of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.830 
cuts 45 degrees just like the rest of
them<00:02:34.739> reverse<00:02:35.370> corner<00:02:35.670> cutting<00:02:35.760> not<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:36.629> much

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
them reverse corner cutting not so much

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.229 
them reverse corner cutting not so much
and<00:02:37.769> just<00:02:37.799> so<00:02:38.129> you<00:02:38.190> guys<00:02:38.430> see<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
and just so you guys see this is the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.030 
and just so you guys see this is the
tie-in<00:02:39.480> I'm<00:02:39.780> not<00:02:39.900> using<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.170> guhong<00:02:40.590> or

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
tie-in I'm not using that guhong or

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.949 
tie-in I'm not using that guhong or
something<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.730> saying<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.540> better<00:02:42.690> than<00:02:42.840> it

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
something and saying it's better than it

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
something and saying it's better than it
is<00:02:43.049> but<00:02:43.230> it's<00:02:43.620> actually<00:02:43.769> not<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.160> bad<00:02:44.370> cubic<00:02:44.910> I'm

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
is but it's actually not a bad cubic I'm

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.150 
is but it's actually not a bad cubic I'm
hitting<00:02:45.330> sub-20<00:02:45.750> averages<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:47.069> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
hitting sub-20 averages and it's the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.430 
hitting sub-20 averages and it's the
same<00:02:47.370> size<00:02:47.640> as<00:02:47.970> their<00:02:48.150> regular<00:02:48.750> standard

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
same size as their regular standard

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.960 
same size as their regular standard
cubes<00:02:49.829> there's<00:02:50.099> nothing<00:02:50.370> really<00:02:50.579> new<00:02:50.819> about

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
cubes there's nothing really new about

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.850 
cubes there's nothing really new about
this<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.840> only<00:02:52.019> difference<00:02:52.349> between<00:02:52.470> this

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
this the only difference between this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.460 
this the only difference between this
and<00:02:53.130> other<00:02:53.310> Dyan<00:02:53.790> cubes<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.329> that<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:55.019> pieces

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
and other Dyan cubes is that the pieces

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.770 
and other Dyan cubes is that the pieces
you<00:02:56.280> know<00:02:56.400> they're<00:02:56.640> they're<00:02:57.000> single<00:02:57.390> pieces

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
you know they're they're single pieces

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.240 
you know they're they're single pieces
and<00:02:57.900> they're<00:02:57.989> capped<00:02:58.230> on<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.590> sides<00:02:58.860> which<00:02:59.129> is

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and they're capped on the sides which is

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.460 
and they're capped on the sides which is
different<00:02:59.549> like<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.760> just<00:02:59.940> saw<00:03:00.150> as<00:03:01.140> far<00:03:01.379> as

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
different like you just saw as far as

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.530 
different like you just saw as far as
the<00:03:01.560> feeling<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.129> cube<00:03:02.400> goes<00:03:02.579> it's<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the feeling of this cube goes it's a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.930 
the feeling of this cube goes it's a
little<00:03:03.720> bit<00:03:03.840> clicky<00:03:04.260> but<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.280> usually<00:03:05.489> find

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
little bit clicky but I usually find

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.059 
little bit clicky but I usually find
that<00:03:06.030> with<00:03:06.329> cubes<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:06.780> aren't<00:03:07.079> Dyan<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.709> if

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
that with cubes that aren't Dyan like if

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.039 
that with cubes that aren't Dyan like if
you<00:03:08.190> if<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.549> see<00:03:08.819> an<00:03:08.910> alpha<00:03:09.180> 5<00:03:09.390> there's<00:03:09.660> you

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
you if you see an alpha 5 there's you

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.930 
you if you see an alpha 5 there's you
know<00:03:10.110> pieces<00:03:10.379> rub<00:03:10.829> against<00:03:11.250> each<00:03:11.310> other<00:03:11.549> and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
know pieces rub against each other and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.430 
know pieces rub against each other and
it's<00:03:12.090> because<00:03:12.480> they're<00:03:12.599> not<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:12.900> rounded

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
it's because they're not like rounded

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.580 
it's because they're not like rounded
off<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:13.829> Diahann<00:03:14.190> cubes<00:03:14.549> are<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:16.470> know

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
off like Diahann cubes are and you know

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.710 
off like Diahann cubes are and you know
for<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:16.860> first<00:03:17.069> model<00:03:17.489> I'd<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.299> say<00:03:18.450> this

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
for a first model I'd have to say this

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.650 
for a first model I'd have to say this
is<00:03:18.930> an<00:03:19.230> exceptional<00:03:19.950> cube<00:03:20.639> I<00:03:20.850> mean<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.450> is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
is an exceptional cube I mean this is

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.259 
is an exceptional cube I mean this is
Diane's<00:03:21.989> first<00:03:22.350> model<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:24.060> know<00:03:24.150> I've

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
Diane's first model and you know I've

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.240 
Diane's first model and you know I've
heard<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.569> lot<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.780> people<00:03:24.989> compare<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:25.829> cube

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
heard a lot of people compare this cube

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.910 
heard a lot of people compare this cube
to<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.760> V<00:03:26.910> cubes<00:03:27.180> 3<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.870> think<00:03:28.230> even<00:03:28.380> myself

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
to the V cubes 3 and I think even myself

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.339 
to the V cubes 3 and I think even myself
and<00:03:29.160> PI<00:03:29.280> said<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.750> know<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.959> V<00:03:31.049> cube<00:03:31.230> 3

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
and PI said that you know the V cube 3

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.839 
and PI said that you know the V cube 3
is<00:03:31.470> better<00:03:31.680> than<00:03:31.859> this<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.069> I<00:03:32.130> got<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.760> be

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
is better than this but I got to be

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.220 
is better than this but I got to be
honest<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.150> disagree<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:33.959> not<00:03:34.109> because

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
honest I disagree and it's not because

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.140 
honest I disagree and it's not because
they<00:03:34.410> don't<00:03:34.470> like<00:03:34.650> V<00:03:34.920> cubes<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.639> think

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
they don't like V cubes I just think

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.330 
they don't like V cubes I just think
that<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:36.389> is<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.989> really<00:03:37.709> good<00:03:37.859> cube<00:03:38.130> actually

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
that this is a really good cube actually

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.400 
that this is a really good cube actually
it's<00:03:38.819> not<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.150> bad<00:03:39.329> as<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.840> thought<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.319> was

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
it's not as bad as I thought it was

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.530 
it's not as bad as I thought it was
gonna<00:03:40.560> be<00:03:40.650> I'll<00:03:40.950> do<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> little<00:03:41.940> bit<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.239> solve

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
gonna be I'll do a little bit of a solve

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.830 
gonna be I'll do a little bit of a solve
here<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.639> I'm<00:03:44.639> not<00:03:44.819> gonna<00:03:44.940> tie<00:03:45.209> myself<00:03:45.419> or

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
here and I'm not gonna tie myself or

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.780 
here and I'm not gonna tie myself or
anything<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.560> can<00:03:46.709> see<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.220> turning

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
anything just so you can see the turning

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:56.270 
anything just so you can see the turning
of<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:48.599> cube<00:03:53.269> as<00:03:54.319> you<00:03:55.319> can<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:56.069> not

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
of this cube as you can see it's not

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.339 
of this cube as you can see it's not
locking<00:03:56.700> up<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.180> me<00:03:57.389> or<00:03:57.569> anything<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:58.139> it's

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
locking up on me or anything like it's

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.110 
locking up on me or anything like it's
it's<00:03:58.620> actually<00:03:58.849> quite<00:03:59.849> nice<00:04:00.030> oh<00:04:01.760> well<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.940> don't

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
it's actually quite nice oh well I don't

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.670 
it's actually quite nice oh well I don't
know

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
know

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.050 
know
and<00:04:04.700> then<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:06.180> print<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:08.190> yeah<00:04:08.310> it's<00:04:08.519> it's<00:04:08.700> a

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
and then you print so yeah it's it's a

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.720 
and then you print so yeah it's it's a
pretty<00:04:09.389> good<00:04:09.630> cube<00:04:10.250> it's<00:04:11.250> definitely<00:04:11.669> not

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
pretty good cube it's definitely not

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.400 
pretty good cube it's definitely not
gonna<00:04:11.880> be<00:04:12.000> my<00:04:12.120> main<00:04:12.299> no<00:04:12.480> like<00:04:12.660> like<00:04:12.989> I'll<00:04:13.200> be

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
gonna be my main no like like I'll be

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.990 
gonna be my main no like like I'll be
honest<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:13.769> not<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.370> best<00:04:14.579> out<00:04:14.819> of<00:04:14.849> the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
honest it's not the best out of the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.240 
honest it's not the best out of the
Diane<00:04:15.359> series<00:04:15.870> but<00:04:16.320> I'm<00:04:16.440> surprised<00:04:17.039> on<00:04:17.220> how

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
Diane series but I'm surprised on how

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.680 
Diane series but I'm surprised on how
good<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.639> is<00:04:17.669> because<00:04:18.060> I've<00:04:18.239> seen<00:04:18.450> some

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
good it is because I've seen some

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.000 
good it is because I've seen some
reviews<00:04:19.049> on<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.289> internet<00:04:19.590> about<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.829> and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
reviews on the internet about it and

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.409 
reviews on the internet about it and
people<00:04:20.099> are<00:04:20.459> saying<00:04:20.820> it's<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.060> piece<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.239> crap

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
people are saying it's a piece of crap

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.540 
people are saying it's a piece of crap
and<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:21.989> not<00:04:22.140> good<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.890> lot<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.430> other

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
and it's not good and a lot of other

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.790 
and it's not good and a lot of other
people<00:04:23.849> my<00:04:24.510> facebook<00:04:24.870> page<00:04:25.020> said<00:04:25.409> that<00:04:25.620> it

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
people my facebook page said that it

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.300 
people my facebook page said that it
wasn't<00:04:26.010> gonna<00:04:26.280> be<00:04:26.430> good<00:04:26.460> when<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.880> said<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.150> was

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
wasn't gonna be good when I said I was

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.860 
wasn't gonna be good when I said I was
can<00:04:27.400> order<00:04:27.669> it<00:04:27.790> but<00:04:27.970> it's<00:04:28.510> actually<00:04:28.660> really

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
can order it but it's actually really

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.840 
can order it but it's actually really
good<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.410> I<00:04:29.440> think<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:30.340> know<00:04:30.460> if<00:04:30.669> you

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
good and I think that you know if you

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.700 
good and I think that you know if you
come<00:04:31.030> from<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.360> Dian<00:04:31.690> cube<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.290> then<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.470> see

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
come from a Dian cube and then you see

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.470 
come from a Dian cube and then you see
this<00:04:32.919> Diana<00:04:33.340> cube<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.700> I<00:04:33.760> mean<00:04:34.180> you<00:04:34.300> come

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
this Diana cube like I mean you come

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.540 
this Diana cube like I mean you come
from<00:04:34.630> like<00:04:34.810> a<00:04:34.870> later<00:04:35.560> generation<00:04:35.740> like<00:04:36.370> you

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
from like a later generation like you

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.810 
from like a later generation like you
know<00:04:36.639> Illinois<00:04:37.570> or<00:04:38.130> zante<00:04:39.130> or<00:04:39.250> even<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.490> goof<00:04:39.700> on

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
know Illinois or zante or even a goof on

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.850 
know Illinois or zante or even a goof on
the<00:04:40.060> second<00:04:40.389> version<00:04:40.540> of<00:04:40.840> course<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:41.680> is

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
the second version of course this is

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.650 
the second version of course this is
gonna<00:04:41.980> be<00:04:42.190> bad<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:42.639> it<00:04:42.820> definitely<00:04:43.300> isn't<00:04:43.480> the

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
gonna be bad but it definitely isn't the

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.990 
gonna be bad but it definitely isn't the
worst<00:04:43.960> cube<00:04:44.350> out<00:04:44.500> there<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:45.190> would<00:04:45.550> say<00:04:45.850> that

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
worst cube out there I would say that

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.750 
worst cube out there I would say that
it's<00:04:46.180> definitely<00:04:46.720> better<00:04:46.870> than<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.580> let's<00:04:48.580> see

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
it's definitely better than a let's see

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.210 
it's definitely better than a let's see
a<00:04:49.210> cube<00:04:49.690> for<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.139> DIY<00:04:50.710> or<00:04:50.889> something<00:04:51.130> like

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
a cube for you DIY or something like

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.590 
a cube for you DIY or something like
that<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.550> was<00:04:51.669> my<00:04:51.820> first<00:04:52.090> big<00:04:52.240> cube<00:04:52.510> it's

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
that that was my first big cube it's

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.570 
that that was my first big cube it's
definitely<00:04:52.930> better<00:04:53.080> than<00:04:53.290> that<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:54.220> would<00:04:54.550> say

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
definitely better than that I would say

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.530 
definitely better than that I would say
out<00:04:54.790> of<00:04:54.820> all<00:04:55.150> my<00:04:55.360> speed<00:04:55.720> cubes<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:56.320> have

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
out of all my speed cubes that I have

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.360 
out of all my speed cubes that I have
you<00:04:58.540> know<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:58.870> is<00:04:58.930> definitely<00:04:59.590> it's<00:05:00.040> not<00:05:00.130> the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
you know this is definitely it's not the

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.120 
you know this is definitely it's not the
best<00:05:00.580> but<00:05:00.760> it's<00:05:00.940> it's<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:02.050> step<00:05:02.320> below<00:05:02.530> Diane<00:05:03.040> I

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
best but it's it's a step below Diane I

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.950 
best but it's it's a step below Diane I
like<00:05:03.310> Diane<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.790> best<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.270> then<00:05:04.360> it's<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.720> step

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
like Diane the best and then it's a step

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.840 
like Diane the best and then it's a step
below<00:05:05.200> all<00:05:05.590> those<00:05:05.860> you<00:05:06.280> know<00:05:06.310> those<00:05:06.550> better

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
below all those you know those better

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.820 
below all those you know those better
Diane's<00:05:07.389> I<00:05:07.690> think<00:05:08.260> it's<00:05:08.380> better<00:05:08.500> than<00:05:08.680> an

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
Diane's I think it's better than an

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.159 
Diane's I think it's better than an
alpha<00:05:09.100> five<00:05:09.370> I<00:05:09.940> do<00:05:10.180> think<00:05:10.630> it's<00:05:10.750> better<00:05:10.930> than<00:05:11.110> a

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
alpha five I do think it's better than a

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.990 
alpha five I do think it's better than a
whit<00:05:11.410> long<00:05:11.620> even<00:05:12.340> though<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:12.460> went<00:05:12.639> long<00:05:12.850> you

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
whit long even though I went long you

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.090 
whit long even though I went long you
know<00:05:13.090> it<00:05:13.120> does<00:05:13.600> corner<00:05:13.930> cut<00:05:14.139> really<00:05:14.410> wood<00:05:14.650> you

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
know it does corner cut really wood you

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.790 
know it does corner cut really wood you
know<00:05:15.220> really<00:05:15.520> well<00:05:15.700> as<00:05:15.940> well<00:05:16.210> I<00:05:16.990> just<00:05:17.470> like<00:05:17.650> the

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800

know really well as well I just like the
feeling<00:05:18.130> of<00:05:18.190> this<00:05:18.370> it's<00:05:18.520> a<00:05:18.639> little<00:05:18.760> bit<00:05:18.940> chunky

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
feeling of this it's a little bit chunky

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.610 
feeling of this it's a little bit chunky
it's<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:19.630> little<00:05:19.840> bit<00:05:19.930> blocky<00:05:20.169> I've<00:05:20.440> never

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
it's a little bit blocky I've never

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.740 
it's a little bit blocky I've never
actually<00:05:20.800> felt<00:05:21.160> a<00:05:21.370> cube<00:05:21.700> that<00:05:21.729> feels<00:05:22.540> like

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
actually felt a cube that feels like

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.629 
actually felt a cube that feels like
this<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.169> I<00:05:23.440> personally<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:24.280> don't<00:05:24.460> think

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
this and I I personally I don't think

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.750 
this and I I personally I don't think
that<00:05:24.940> it's<00:05:25.270> that<00:05:25.780> bad<00:05:26.050> of<00:05:26.200> a<00:05:26.290> cube<00:05:26.560> I<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:27.040> kind<00:05:27.639> of

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
that it's that bad of a cube I I kind of

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.270 
that it's that bad of a cube I I kind of
enjoy<00:05:28.060> solving<00:05:28.690> with<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:28.990> so<00:05:29.320> anyways<00:05:30.250> guys
