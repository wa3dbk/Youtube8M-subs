00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
galaxy s4 1080p resolution while the g2

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
galaxy s4 1080p resolution while the g2
comes<00:00:27.080> with<00:00:28.010> an<00:00:28.130> IPS<00:00:28.580> display<00:00:29.180> that's<00:00:29.539> an<00:00:29.900> LCD

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
comes with an IPS display that's an LCD

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.629 
comes with an IPS display that's an LCD
also<00:00:31.029> 1080p<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.449> resolution<00:00:33.050> but<00:00:33.339> 5.2<00:00:34.339> inch

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:36.369 
also 1080p the resolution but 5.2 inch
so<00:00:35.089> it's<00:00:35.359> a<00:00:35.449> little<00:00:35.539> bit<00:00:35.659> of<00:00:35.839> a<00:00:35.929> difference<00:00:36.289> in

which<00:03:00.540> once<00:03:00.870> again<00:03:01.080> gives<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.800> little<00:03:02.040> bit

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
which once again gives you a little bit

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.650 
which once again gives you a little bit
an<00:03:03.240> edge<00:03:03.600> over<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.410> s4<00:03:04.980> with<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.520> g2<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:06.120> terms

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
an edge over the s4 with the g2 in terms

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.220 
an edge over the s4 with the g2 in terms
of<00:03:06.810> battery<00:03:07.260> life<00:03:07.620> last<00:03:08.460> but<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:08.760> least<00:03:09.230> they

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
of battery life last but not least they

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.210 
of battery life last but not least they
are<00:03:10.320> almost<00:03:11.930> look<00:03:12.930> at<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:14.820> LG<00:03:15.740> g2<00:03:16.740> is

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
are almost look at this the LG g2 is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.490 
are almost look at this the LG g2 is
eight<00:03:17.520> point<00:03:17.820> nine<00:03:17.880> millimeters<00:03:18.540> thick<00:03:18.780> while

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
eight point nine millimeters thick while

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.370 
eight point nine millimeters thick while
the<00:03:19.650> samsung<00:03:20.070> galaxy<00:03:20.550> s4<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.090> was<00:03:21.630> like<00:03:21.840> seven

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
the samsung galaxy s4 it was like seven

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.740 
the samsung galaxy s4 it was like seven
point<00:03:22.680> six<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.490> know<00:03:23.640> we're<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.150> correct<00:03:24.660> me

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
point six you know we're just correct me

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.270 
point six you know we're just correct me
in<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.930> comments<00:03:25.260> if<00:03:25.560> I'm<00:03:25.680> wrong<00:03:25.890> with<00:03:26.100> this

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
in the comments if I'm wrong with this

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.640 
in the comments if I'm wrong with this
but<00:03:26.820> anyways<00:03:27.180> what<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:27.959> would<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> show

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
but anyways what I would like to show

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.760 
but anyways what I would like to show
you<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.459> general<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.390> once<00:03:30.630> again<00:03:30.780> look<00:03:31.500> at<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
you in general is once again look at the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.740 
you in general is once again look at the
sheer<00:03:32.010> size<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.550> these<00:03:32.880> devices<00:03:33.530> right<00:03:34.530> and

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
sheer size of these devices right and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.480 
sheer size of these devices right and
the<00:03:36.750> weight<00:03:37.020> well<00:03:37.320> unfortunately<00:03:37.740> actually

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
the weight well unfortunately actually

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.300 
the weight well unfortunately actually
was<00:03:38.670> revealing<00:03:39.150> any<00:03:40.140> specs<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.860> terms<00:03:41.070> of<00:03:41.190> the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
was revealing any specs in terms of the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.100 
was revealing any specs in terms of the
way<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:41.520> I<00:03:42.000> would<00:03:42.209> guess<00:03:42.239> it's<00:03:42.660> pretty<00:03:42.840> much

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
way but I would guess it's pretty much

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.440 
way but I would guess it's pretty much
the<00:03:43.230> same<00:03:43.410> roughly<00:03:43.800> around<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.310> hundred<00:03:44.820> forty

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
the same roughly around a hundred forty

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.690 
the same roughly around a hundred forty
grams<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.500> should<00:03:46.709> be<00:03:46.860> available<00:03:47.160> in<00:03:47.670> the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
grams and it should be available in the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.970 
grams and it should be available in the
next<00:03:47.940> four<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.570> eight<00:03:48.810> weeks<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.620> course<00:03:49.830> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
next four to eight weeks of course the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.250 
next four to eight weeks of course the
samsung<00:03:50.310> galaxy<00:03:50.340> s4<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.239> already<00:03:51.900> on<00:03:52.110> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
samsung galaxy s4 is already on the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.479 
samsung galaxy s4 is already on the
market<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:53.130> just<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.700> gives<00:03:54.300> you<00:03:54.480> an<00:03:54.570> idea

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
market but just this gives you an idea

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.830 
market but just this gives you an idea
after<00:03:56.489> some<00:03:56.760> difference<00:03:57.330> in<00:03:57.540> terms<00:03:57.750> of

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
after some difference in terms of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.500 
after some difference in terms of
specification<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.739> especially<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.850> terms<00:04:00.300> of

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
specification and especially in terms of

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.990 
specification and especially in terms of
the<00:04:00.630> size<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:01.200> that's<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.739> samsung<00:04:02.130> galaxy<00:04:02.160> s4

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
the size so that's the samsung galaxy s4

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.970 
the size so that's the samsung galaxy s4
