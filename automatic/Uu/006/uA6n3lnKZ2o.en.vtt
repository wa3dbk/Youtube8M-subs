you know Green Bay is definitely in

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.249 
you know Green Bay is definitely in
cruise<00:01:43.920> control<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.689> right<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
cruise control and right now I think the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.980 
cruise control and right now I think the
Giants<00:01:46.740> are<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> low<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:48.450> know<00:01:48.479> their<00:01:48.750> last

pittsburgh they definitely look bad
against<00:01:52.680> cincinnati<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:53.790> barely<00:01:54.000> won

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149
