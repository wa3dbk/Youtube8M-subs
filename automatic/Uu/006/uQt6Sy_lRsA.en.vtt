00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
says it's moderate coverage but you can

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.399 
says it's moderate coverage but you can
also<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.090> light<00:01:42.450> coverage<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.259> then

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
also have like a light coverage and then

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
also have like a light coverage and then
pretty<00:01:44.100> much<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.610> buildable<00:01:44.909> coverage<00:01:45.329> so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
pretty much it's a buildable coverage so

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.960 
pretty much it's a buildable coverage so
if<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.780> need<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.320> extra<00:01:46.649> coverage<00:01:46.970> you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
if you need like that extra coverage you

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.660 
if you need like that extra coverage you
can<00:01:48.180> build<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
can build it up so this is what the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.679 
can build it up so this is what the
bottle<00:01:51.299> looks<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:52.790> like<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.329> I

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
bottle looks like like that and I

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.520 
bottle looks like like that and I
believe<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.200> retails<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.770> 30<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> 50<00:01:56.700> plus<00:01:56.880> tax

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
believe it retails for 30 to 50 plus tax

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.350 
believe it retails for 30 to 50 plus tax
so<00:01:58.530> let<00:01:59.130> me<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.430> watch<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> cuz<00:01:59.969> I've<00:02:00.060> already

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.720 
because I am oily and since this is more
for<00:02:27.090> its<00:02:27.870> focus<00:02:28.620> more<00:02:29.010> on<00:02:29.040> fine<00:02:29.370> lines<00:02:29.580> and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
for its focus more on fine lines and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.979 
for its focus more on fine lines and
wrinkles<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.510> all<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.880> wrinkly<00:02:32.880> stuff<00:02:33.180> but

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
wrinkles and all that wrinkly stuff but

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.190 
wrinkles and all that wrinkly stuff but
it's<00:02:34.620> more<00:02:34.770> focused<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.489> mature<00:02:36.480> skin<00:02:36.750> or

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
it's more focused for mature skin or

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.860 
it's more focused for mature skin or
really<00:02:37.920> really<00:02:38.069> dry<00:02:38.459> skin<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:38.970> would<00:02:39.120> really

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
really really dry skin I would really

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.580 
really really dry skin I would really
recommend<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:41.400> dry<00:02:42.239> skin<00:02:42.630> or<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.470> know

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
recommend this for dry skin or you know

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.360 
recommend this for dry skin or you know
just<00:02:43.620> mature<00:02:44.280> skin<00:02:44.580> like<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.849> said<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.860> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
just mature skin like I said but if you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.270 
just mature skin like I said but if you
are<00:02:47.519> oily<00:02:47.940> or<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.600> combination<00:02:48.989> oily<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:50.010> would

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
are oily or a combination oily I would

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.640 
are oily or a combination oily I would
not<00:02:50.430> recommend<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.880> foundation<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:52.170> it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
not recommend this foundation because it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.520 
not recommend this foundation because it
will<00:02:52.890> make<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.340> more<00:02:54.060> oily<00:02:54.569> even<00:02:55.019> if<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.319> do

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
will make you more oily even if you do

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
will make you more oily even if you do
use<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.840> makeup<00:02:57.840> primer<00:02:58.049> before<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:59.610> makes<00:03:00.540> you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
use a makeup primer before it makes you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.979 
use a makeup primer before it makes you
really<00:03:01.440> really<00:03:01.650> oily<00:03:02.000> if<00:03:03.000> you've<00:03:03.209> experienced
