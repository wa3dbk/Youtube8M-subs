00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.700
 finish 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.129
 hi friends we are here in minecraft and 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.770
 today we are going to see two new elements of 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.290
 version 1.5 trancas 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.430
 trap chest that character of this 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.630
 forms a normal chest and a hook 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.590
 rope 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.380
 and it will give us 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.259
 the trap chest 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.510
 the concept is like a normal chest that 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.539
 are these 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.210
 but it differs from normal coffee in 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.519
 that has this thing rojilla here by the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.339
 edge you see this is like a little more 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.309
 red here is dark and as you see here 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.019
 we can put one next to the other if 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.369
 we put a normal comfort next to 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:56.019
 another with normal of the together if you put a 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:58.390
 clear a hole and this one we can 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.050
 put a coffee trap so that 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.750
 we can do things like this 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.930
 this is wonderful, a good part of that 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.290
 the trap chest gives a rest signal 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.850
 when we open it so 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.350
 if we take victor garber and a lamp 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.140
 you see 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.560
 I have done it too 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.750
 well you see it lights up when we open the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.550
 car 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.090
 therefore now we can do 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.570
 trapdoors as for example 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.570
 we can have 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.200
 we take the trap car we make a 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.020
 number on the floor we put tnt top 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.270
 like pams we put the catch the trap 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.189
 we open the trap 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.659
 and the poor pain even though I've seen the 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.289
 coffee trap flies through the air 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.289
 all right 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.680
 to talk about this other element that 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.800
 it's called 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.010
 comparator of recto is cartea of ​​this 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.950
 way 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.950
 quartz and torches and stone 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.349
 and you know and his sexting look has 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.269
 several qualities nowadays 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.269
 main thing that is to compare 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.610
 is characterized because youtube let's say 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.510
 that you apply gastón here and it will come out 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.200
 on this side 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.250
 but if you apply the rest here or 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.250
 around here it's indifferent 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.870
 with a higher intensity that is to say that 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.319
 be closer master that would be 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.569
 well here 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.130
 this is closer to this source of 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.860
 energy that is 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.569
 It will cut the current flow if 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.090
 I was farther 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.650
 I would not cut 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.490
 the passage of the current because the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.780
 current follows the current flows 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.380
 it also has another mode that is this I think 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.530
 what it does is subtract subtract the intensity 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:16.110
 of this minus this intensity then 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.770
 three minus 2 1 if here we put by 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.770
 example like this 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.219
 It will give more because we have increased 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:30.780
 is going to give 4 because here are 2 and here but 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:34.690
 come on 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 - 2 4 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.430
 Well, apart from this feature 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.650
 which is to subtract and compare 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.049
 we can also 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.550
 we put a chest for example a coffee 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.020
 trap works with both 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.670
 and we take fix so 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.900
 and we are going to place 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.220
 a lamp behind then right now 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.069
 we open and nothing happens because this is a 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.340
 cheat trap we keep something inside 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.460
 and as there is something inside this chest is 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.000
 a whole signal and turn on the 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.660
 the lamp will give a more intense signal 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.270
 how much more things for example right now 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.160
 is going to give a signal from a teacher 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.160
 but if we go putting 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.940
 more things are increasing the signal you see 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.450
 If we fill it, it will give a more signal 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.670
 Clear 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:35.169
 well this applies to chests and ornaments and 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.699
 other elements 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.990
 and a good part of this super 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.030
 characteristic 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.560
 not passed because you can know if your 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.870
 oven is full 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.480
 we can give 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.150
 the comparator with the repeater 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.150
 restaurant and do this 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.110
 we do like this like this like that because 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.570
 we put a lever 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.080
 So, if we activate the lever, 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.710
 nothing happens but if we activate in a way 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.380
 this subtracting sybase now for a 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.970
 rest watch 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.650
 If you do not know what the 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.230
 rest reds is not to light and 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.900
 turn off something 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.510
 the function for example more basic is 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.900
 turn a lamp on and off 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.900
 example 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.400
 you see 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.400
 we always turn on our front 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.020
 you see the shoulder feeling 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.820
 well up here the comparator and the 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.820
 cheat trap I hope you liked it 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.660
 national there are favorites and we subscribe 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.660
 bye Bye
