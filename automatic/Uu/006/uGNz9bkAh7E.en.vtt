00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.379 
these earrings on I think it'd be really
cute<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.230> um<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.849> probably<00:03:45.120> not

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
cute but um this is probably not

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.449 
cute but um this is probably not
something<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:46.079> I<00:03:46.109> would<00:03:46.200> wear<00:03:46.709> but<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.099> think

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
something that I would wear but I think

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.640 
something that I would wear but I think
that<00:03:47.639> was<00:03:47.760> very<00:03:47.880> very<00:03:48.269> generous<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.169> them<00:03:49.230> to

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
that was very very generous of them to

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.530 
that was very very generous of them to
send<00:03:49.889> these<00:03:50.010> products<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.669> have<00:03:51.120> me<00:03:51.329> review

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
send these products and have me review

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.020 
send these products and have me review

the<00:03:54.209> sunglass<00:03:54.660> case<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.380> these<00:03:56.370> are<00:03:56.430> nifty

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
the sunglass case and these are nifty

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.699

your<00:05:08.740> email<00:05:09.130> address<00:05:09.460> is<00:05:09.640> because<00:05:10.000> it's

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
your email address is because it's

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.780 
your email address is because it's
obviously<00:05:11.290> not<00:05:11.380> going<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:11.860> be<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.160> same<00:05:12.460> as

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
obviously not going to be the same as

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.810 
obviously not going to be the same as
your<00:05:13.450> YouTube<00:05:13.810> username<00:05:13.890> so<00:05:14.890> i<00:05:14.920> just<00:05:15.670> thought

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
your YouTube username so i just thought

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.370 
your YouTube username so i just thought
it<00:05:15.910> would<00:05:15.970> be<00:05:16.030> too<00:05:16.240> complicated<00:05:16.630> like<00:05:16.990> if<00:05:17.260> i

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
it would be too complicated like if i

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.870 
it would be too complicated like if i
chose<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.830> winner<00:05:17.920> then<00:05:18.220> i'd<00:05:18.340> have<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:18.520> find

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
chose the winner then i'd have to find

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.250 
chose the winner then i'd have to find
out<00:05:19.000> your<00:05:19.150> email<00:05:19.480> address<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:19.840> then<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.140> would

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
out your email address and then I would

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.650 
out your email address and then I would
have<00:05:20.290> to<00:05:20.410> check<00:05:20.710> with<00:05:20.860> them<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.340> see<00:05:21.610> if<00:05:22.110> that

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
have to check with them to see if that

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.420
