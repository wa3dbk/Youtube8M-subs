00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
up to your ankles and i think they're

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.370 
up to your ankles and i think they're
really<00:03:28.530> cute<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.250> they<00:03:29.820> were<00:03:29.880> only<00:03:30.390> six<00:03:31.140> bucks

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
really cute and they were only six bucks

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.420 
really cute and they were only six bucks
so<00:03:32.220> if<00:03:32.790> i<00:03:33.000> got<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.299> third<00:03:33.600> one<00:03:33.930> then<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:35.220> third

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
so if i got a third one then the third

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.100 
so if i got a third one then the third
one<00:03:35.489> would<00:03:35.760> have<00:03:35.910> been<00:03:36.030> half<00:03:36.269> off<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.079> be

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
one would have been half off but to be

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.060 
one would have been half off but to be
honest<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:38.540> didn't<00:03:39.540> really<00:03:39.600> like<00:03:40.590> any<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.950> the
