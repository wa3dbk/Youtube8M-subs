00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.070
 create two away games that looms in reindeer second of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.719
 championship behind nice competitor live one has the impression that if one 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.710
 do not tear back points from the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.300
 the art of gardens 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.570
 of a big thing of the future of science that will be played 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.259
 in the area 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.669
 we must believe all the forests is always very fit 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.140
 it's always possible 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.930
 that yesterday reindeer it's going to be a match which is difficult this says 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.250
 I am not here 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.570
 a penis 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.570
 we vote we go there we budget goals 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.360
 because it's a match we can say it's a duet competition 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.790
 it's a game you have to win 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.260
 today are you aware that the calendar that we 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.960
 wait will be complicated yasser moving to reindeer 4th nice the season 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.300
 toulouse there is the faith archbishop lyon and marseille 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.860
 run the race as it goes badly 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.120
 must not choose sends game 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 account that this team there 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 it's the only access 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.810
 it is difficult because we take all the set of this material of notes 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.800
 she is about to sit 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.080
 sean simpson promised m 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.610
 it means that against big teams there may be 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.260
 easier to approach my luck anyway we stop fit to 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.240
 to win 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.259
 yes I do not know if we think we will be at least equal in perpetuity 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.170
 I think all the points a little bit of maintenance 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.810
 This is another thing 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.120
 9the fausta by faux pas should not think against a false step 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.550
 I thought if we started panicked going to be harder still for them 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.730
 it's a clip 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.960
 to work 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.740
 to hasten what the coach 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.540
 raimondo way to do the test of fact all that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.130
 with discipline 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.950
 he conceded Saturday his match start 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.609
 to win matches you have to score goals for your club 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.609
 today it is mainly in this area that science scarcely 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.500
 at 7 o'clock you were unfortunate to come and mark my mark 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.620
 goals anyway 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.389
 unfortunately we have more weight alli 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.429
 I think that's because 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.679
 we do not want to say that 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.889
 the team is very compact 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.889
 before 2008 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.359
 that's what is not to score a lot of goals what has become of a 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:24.439
 match 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.819
 in the interval it takes for that and 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.829
 it's the abatement 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.949
 I hope me how I think coaches teammates 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.569
 how do we have to prospect to score on 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:39.939
 and why launches past marc 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.619
 this is bad luck and% of gestures that are not repeated enough to 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.319
 balloon training that happens badly 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.109
 to receive 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.309
 this maintenance point everyone starts to ask a lot a lot of 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:52.539
 Questions 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.869
 it's like that 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.169
 saÃ¯d to the world 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.319
 it's against saint-vallier 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.949
 if I drove had he said synagogue before many of the last two games 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.400
 we learn every day did not score the other matches without scoring c 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:10.209
 that's how it's life 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.209
 it's not who is the team does not score we do not score a lot 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.619
 there all the game in hand anyway
