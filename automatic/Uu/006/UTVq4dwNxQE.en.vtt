it's quite lucky to actually get him for
that<00:00:13.889> cheap<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.340> think<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.849> will<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.000> upselling

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
that cheap I think it will be upselling

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.269 
that cheap I think it will be upselling
monitor<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> round<00:00:16.049> under<00:00:16.470> 30k<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.220> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
monitor for a round under 30k just to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.590 
monitor for a round under 30k just to
route<00:00:17.490> probably<00:00:18.060> about<00:00:18.180> twenty<00:00:18.480> nine

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
route probably about twenty nine

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.420 
route probably about twenty nine
thousand<00:00:19.050> five<00:00:19.199> hundred<00:00:19.230> coins<00:00:19.650> or<00:00:20.189> something

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
thousand five hundred coins or something

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.650 
thousand five hundred coins or something
about<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.850> actually<00:00:20.939> check<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> market

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
about we do actually check on the market

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.029 
about we do actually check on the market
now<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.900> don't<00:00:22.199> think<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> cheapest<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:22.890> up

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
now I don't think the cheapest one up

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.160 
now I don't think the cheapest one up
was<00:00:23.699> around<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.240> mark<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:24.900> we'll

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
was around that mark so I think we'll

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.359 
was around that mark so I think we'll
probably<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.529> able<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.710> make<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> two<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
probably be able to make like a two to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.370 
probably be able to make like a two to
three<00:00:26.550> capable<00:00:26.730> front<00:00:27.029> him<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.140> most

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
three capable front him not the most

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.050 
three capable front him not the most
amazing<00:00:28.769> profit<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> player<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.820> you

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
amazing profit for a player that you

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.720 
amazing profit for a player that you
know<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.449> spent<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.720> 29<00:00:31.109> k<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.619> sorry<00:00:32.309> 26

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
know that we spent like 29 k on sorry 26

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.180 
know that we spent like 29 k on sorry 26
k<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.440> that's<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> best<00:00:35.040> but

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
k on so you know that's not the best but

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.209 
k on so you know that's not the best but
we<00:00:36.030> also<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.480> actually<00:00:36.750> pick<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.290> 24<00:00:38.010> K

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.770 
we also do actually pick up one for 24 K
which<00:00:38.460> isn't<00:00:38.790> actually<00:00:38.850> shown<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.629> this

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

which is kind of annoying but we do
actually<00:01:24.270> pick<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.840> Alexandra<00:01:25.470> songs<00:01:25.740> at

don't think you guys see that it's

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.319 
don't think you guys see that it's
really<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.850> final<00:01:42.210> bit<00:01:42.299> of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
really going to be the final bit of

really going to be the final bit of
footage<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.869> episode<00:01:43.079> i<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.530> only

footage in this episode i know it's only

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050 
footage in this episode i know it's only
about<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.460> under<00:01:44.700> two<00:01:44.850> minutes

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
about you know just under two minutes

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.030 
about you know just under two minutes
long<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.270> far<00:01:45.720> doesn't<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.409> their<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> fifa

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
points are there hundred points and that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.960 
points are there hundred points and that
doesn't<00:01:49.680> mean<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.890> i<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.130> open<00:01:50.399> packs<00:01:50.700> in

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
doesn't mean that i have open packs in

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.810 
doesn't mean that i have open packs in
on<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.659> account<00:01:52.220> since<00:01:53.220> making<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.670> video

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
on this account since making this video

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.850 
on this account since making this video
and<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:55.020> kind<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.229> annoying<00:01:55.409> because<00:01:55.710> i

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and it's kind of annoying because i

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.190 
and it's kind of annoying because i
don't<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.460> footage<00:01:56.689> to<00:01:57.689> prove<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
don't have the footage to prove that I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
don't have the footage to prove that I
did<00:01:58.259> make<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.560> 100k<00:01:59.100> bike<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> I'm<00:01:59.880> telling

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
did make the 100k bike and I'm telling

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.420 
did make the 100k bike and I'm telling
now<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.409> back<00:02:01.530> onto<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.920> first<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.399> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
now if you go back onto the first bit of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.859 
now if you go back onto the first bit of
footage<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> infant<00:02:03.299> Fellaini<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
footage with the infant Fellaini in that

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
footage with the infant Fellaini in that
and<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:04.860> trade<00:02:05.130> poem<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.729> in

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and you see my trade poem what is in

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.589 
and you see my trade poem what is in
there<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> star<00:02:07.560> d<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.149> have<00:02:09.149> about

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
there I have like a star d I have about

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.050 
there I have like a star d I have about
five<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.349> six<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.890> normal<00:02:11.129> goal<00:02:11.430> players<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
five to six of a normal goal players and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.610 
five to six of a normal goal players and
all<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.420> would<00:02:12.629> probably<00:02:12.780> make<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.050> round

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
all of that would probably make a round

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.460 
all of that would probably make a round
I<00:02:13.700> don't<00:02:14.700> know<00:02:14.760> 15<00:02:15.150> k<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.599> then<00:02:16.019> we<00:02:16.140> also<00:02:16.290> have

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
I don't know 15 k and then we also have

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.140 
I don't know 15 k and then we also have
the<00:02:16.590> Marilyn<00:02:16.920> Fellaini<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.519> she<00:02:17.700> sold<00:02:17.940> for

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
the Marilyn Fellaini that she sold for

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.240 
the Marilyn Fellaini that she sold for
about<00:02:18.209> 28<00:02:18.629> k<00:02:18.930> or<00:02:19.170> something<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:19.950> you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
about 28 k or something like that so you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.420 
about 28 k or something like that so you
know<00:02:20.459> them<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.819> put<00:02:21.000> together<00:02:21.269> is<00:02:21.510> around<00:02:22.230> 45<00:02:22.799> k

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
know them to put together is around 45 k

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.920 
know them to put together is around 45 k
and<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:24.060> did<00:02:24.209> actually<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.540> fifty<00:02:24.810> nine

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
and we did actually have fifty nine

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.320 
and we did actually have fifty nine
thousand<00:02:25.319> coins<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.769> that<00:02:26.040> clip<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:27.180> can

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
thousand coins in that clip so you can

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.140 
thousand coins in that clip so you can
kind<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.599> guess<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.049> 100k<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.890> there<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.970> did

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
kind of guess that 100k is there we did

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.460 
kind of guess that 100k is there we did
make<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.810> know<00:02:30.840> obviously<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.200> have

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
make it but you know obviously I have

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.649 
make it but you know obviously I have
nothing<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.890> prove<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.370> guys<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.659> this
