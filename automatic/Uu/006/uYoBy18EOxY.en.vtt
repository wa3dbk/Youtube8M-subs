00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
convinced to buy it on the pc now I

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.580 
convinced to buy it on the pc now I
probably<00:00:15.120> should<00:00:15.509> mention<00:00:15.750> before<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.230> start

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590

that<00:00:16.770> I'm<00:00:16.830> doing<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.190> commentary

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
that I'm doing this commentary

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.150 
that I'm doing this commentary
unscripted<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.690> normally<00:00:19.500> write<00:00:19.770> everything

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
unscripted I normally write everything

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.340 
unscripted I normally write everything
out<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.480> thought<00:00:21.539> I'd<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
out and I just thought I'd do this for a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.990 
out and I just thought I'd do this for a
bit<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.619> change<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.640> something

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
bit of a change because it's something

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.370 
bit of a change because it's something
that<00:00:24.119> I've<00:00:24.210> been<00:00:24.359> thinking<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that I've been thinking about for the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.650 
that I've been thinking about for the
last<00:00:25.410> couple<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.949> days<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.510> this

last couple of days if you like this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.210 
last couple of days if you like this

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
style of commentary better then make

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.560

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the pc yet and that's probably got a lot

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.990 
the pc yet and that's probably got a lot
to<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.070> fact<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.399> i'm<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.699> really

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000

that happy with battlefield 4 on the pc

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.840

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
probably won't buy it at launch most of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.789 
probably won't buy it at launch most of
you<00:01:06.299> guys<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.720> probably<00:01:06.840> thinking<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you guys are probably thinking that this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.960 
you guys are probably thinking that this
has<00:01:07.950> got<00:01:08.100> something<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
has got something to do with the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.820 
has got something to do with the
problems<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> 4<00:01:10.020> had<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.350> launch<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
problems that be a 4 had at launch I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.410 
problems that be a 4 had at launch I
guess<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.340> does<00:01:11.700> come<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> equation

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
guess that does come into the equation

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.170 
guess that does come into the equation
but<00:01:13.020> that's<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.770> whole<00:01:13.950> story<00:01:14.090> there's<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
but that's not the whole story there's a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.490 
but that's not the whole story there's a
few<00:01:15.450> things<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.869> I've<00:01:15.960> been<00:01:16.110> worried<00:01:16.439> about

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
few things that I've been worried about

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
few things that I've been worried about
with<00:01:16.890> battlefield<00:01:17.220> 4<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.150> aren't

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
with battlefield 4 that if they aren't

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.780 
with battlefield 4 that if they aren't
fixed<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.960> hardline<00:01:19.439> I'm<00:01:19.680> probably<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
fixed in hardline I'm probably going to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.940 
fixed in hardline I'm probably going to
give<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> miss<00:01:21.439> basically<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> things<00:01:22.799> that

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
give it a miss basically the things that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.109 
give it a miss basically the things that
I'm<00:01:23.040> worried<00:01:23.280> about<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> most<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
I'm worried about the most is the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.060 
I'm worried about the most is the
premium<00:01:24.570> subscription<00:01:25.290> system<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.860> fact

players<00:03:04.730> on<00:03:04.970> pc<00:03:05.420> but<00:03:05.450> players<00:03:06.019> across<00:03:06.350> the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
players on pc but players across the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.009 
players on pc but players across the
board<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.670> problem<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.540> in

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
board the problem is is that in

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.600 
board the problem is is that in
battlefield<00:03:09.530> 4<00:03:09.590> when<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.100> actually<00:03:10.310> go

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
battlefield 4 when you actually go

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.610 
battlefield 4 when you actually go
head-to-head<00:03:11.030> with<00:03:11.239> someone<00:03:11.810> there's<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.410> good

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
head-to-head with someone there's a good

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.110 
head-to-head with someone there's a good
chance<00:03:12.890> that<00:03:13.190> you're<00:03:13.310> going<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.549> either<00:03:13.700> trade

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
chance that you're going to either trade

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.819 
chance that you're going to either trade
or<00:03:14.420> they're<00:03:15.230> going<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.440> kill<00:03:15.680> you

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
or they're going to kill you

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.490 
or they're going to kill you
unrealistically<00:03:16.459> fast<00:03:16.870> now<00:03:17.870> that's<00:03:18.260> not<00:03:18.470> a

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
unrealistically fast now that's not a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.130 
unrealistically fast now that's not a
huge<00:03:18.829> issue<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:19.489> console<00:03:20.030> but<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.540> see<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.959> all

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
huge issue on console but I see it all

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.680 
huge issue on console but I see it all
of<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.530> time<00:03:21.560> on<00:03:21.769> PC<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.730> lot<00:03:23.209> of<00:03:23.299> people<00:03:23.570> like

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
of the time on PC a lot of people like

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.270 
of the time on PC a lot of people like
to<00:03:23.750> claim<00:03:24.079> that<00:03:24.320> it's<00:03:24.440> just<00:03:24.650> because<00:03:24.920> people

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
to claim that it's just because people

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.849 
to claim that it's just because people
can<00:03:25.430> aim<00:03:25.730> fire<00:03:26.060> start<00:03:26.420> with<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.750> mouse<00:03:26.959> but<00:03:27.680> I

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
can aim fire start with the mouse but I

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.020 
can aim fire start with the mouse but I
don't<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.160> that's<00:03:28.310> really<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.850> case

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
don't think that's really the case

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.789 
don't think that's really the case
because<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.510> think<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.049> can<00:03:30.200> actually<00:03:30.410> kill

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
because I think you can actually kill

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.130 
because I think you can actually kill
people<00:03:31.190> faster<00:03:31.760> with<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.239> auto-aim<00:03:32.780> on

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
people faster with the auto-aim on

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.380 
people faster with the auto-aim on
console<00:03:33.650> either<00:03:34.400> way<00:03:34.549> I<00:03:34.579> think<00:03:34.910> this<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.150> big

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
console either way I think this is a big

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.729 
console either way I think this is a big
issue<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:35.870> needs<00:03:36.049> to<00:03:36.170> be<00:03:36.290> fixed<00:03:36.500> for

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
issue that needs to be fixed for

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.620 
issue that needs to be fixed for
everyone<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.880> will<00:03:38.030> probably<00:03:38.209> be<00:03:38.480> the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
everyone and this will probably be the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.479 
everyone and this will probably be the
biggest<00:03:38.900> reason<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.920> won't<00:03:40.220> buy

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
biggest reason that I won't buy

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.130 
biggest reason that I won't buy
battlefield<00:03:40.790> hardline<00:03:41.480> at<00:03:41.630> launch<00:03:41.840> I'll

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
battlefield hardline at launch I'll

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.170 
battlefield hardline at launch I'll
probably<00:03:42.650> wait<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.220> couple<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.579> weeks<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:44.030> see

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
probably wait a couple of weeks and see

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.420 
probably wait a couple of weeks and see
if<00:03:44.299> it's<00:03:44.450> fixed<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:44.989> if<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.530> hasn't<00:03:45.950> well<00:03:46.190> I

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
if it's fixed and if it hasn't well I

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.580 
if it's fixed and if it hasn't well I
might<00:03:46.640> just<00:03:46.880> even<00:03:47.060> stick<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.660> ps4<00:03:47.930> version

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
might just even stick to the ps4 version

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.620 
might just even stick to the ps4 version
