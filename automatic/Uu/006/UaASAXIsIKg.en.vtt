Miller Lite home draft systems I've got

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.820 
Miller Lite home draft systems I've got
my<00:00:07.890> frosted<00:00:08.309> mug<00:00:08.429> ready<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:09.230> have<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.260> draft

my frosted mug ready I have the draft

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.259 
my frosted mug ready I have the draft
system<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.519> just<00:00:11.730> pulled<00:00:12.000> out<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
system that I just pulled out of the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.640 
system that I just pulled out of the
refrigerator<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:12.990> I've<00:00:13.110> never<00:00:13.349> looked<00:00:13.500> at

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
refrigerator but I've never looked at

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.959 
refrigerator but I've never looked at
the<00:00:13.710> instructions<00:00:14.280> I've<00:00:14.490> never<00:00:14.700> looked<00:00:14.880> at

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
the instructions I've never looked at

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:15.799 
the instructions I've never looked at
anything<00:00:15.269> about<00:00:15.450> it

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
anything about it

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.570 
anything about it
so<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.379> kind<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.800> wanted<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.160> how<00:00:17.400> long<00:00:17.520> it

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
so I kind of wanted to see how long it

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.390 
so I kind of wanted to see how long it
takes<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.119> go<00:00:18.240> from<00:00:18.560> box<00:00:20.900> to<00:00:21.900> ice-cold<00:00:22.590> beer<00:00:23.160> in

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
takes to go from box to ice-cold beer in

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.300 
takes to go from box to ice-cold beer in
my<00:00:23.550> draft<00:00:23.760> cup<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.859> anyway<00:00:25.859> let's<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.189> it

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
okay now we're getting somewhere

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.130 
okay now we're getting somewhere
so<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.510> attempt<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> follow

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so this now we will attempt to follow

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:32.870 
so this now we will attempt to follow
the<00:01:22.320> instructions<00:01:30.590> okay<00:01:31.590> first<00:01:31.920> off<00:01:32.130> remove

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the instructions okay first off remove

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.609 
the instructions okay first off remove
tab<00:01:33.509> piece<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.410> cake

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:58.940 

secondly<00:01:38.030> twist<00:01:39.030> two<00:01:39.630> line<00:01:39.869> arrows

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.350 

okay<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.369> got<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.549> twist<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:00.939> around<00:02:01.030> about

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
okay you got to twist it around about

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.410 
okay you got to twist it around about
360<00:02:02.140> degrees<00:02:02.469> to<00:02:02.880> align<00:02:03.880> these<00:02:04.000> little<00:02:04.270> tiny

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
360 degrees to align these little tiny

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.770 
360 degrees to align these little tiny
arrows<00:02:05.610> which<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.759> sounds<00:02:06.939> like<00:02:07.180> it<00:02:07.299> punctured

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
arrows which it sounds like it punctured

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.350 
arrows which it sounds like it punctured
perhaps<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.709> carbon<00:02:08.979> monoxide<00:02:12.030> third<00:02:13.030> step

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
perhaps the carbon monoxide third step

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.130 
perhaps the carbon monoxide third step
is<00:02:13.590> unlock<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:19.599> believe<00:02:19.989> that<00:02:20.200> will<00:02:20.319> unlock<00:02:20.819> and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
is unlock I believe that will unlock and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.920 
is unlock I believe that will unlock and
the<00:02:23.140> fourth<00:02:23.349> step<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.910> pull<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.269> pour<00:02:25.630> all

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the fourth step is pull and pour all

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.210 
the fourth step is pull and pour all
right<00:02:26.640> let's<00:02:27.640> see<00:02:27.790> how<00:02:27.910> this<00:02:28.090> works<00:02:28.239> out<00:02:29.220> if

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
right let's see how this works out if

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.650 
right let's see how this works out if
this<00:02:30.400> actually<00:02:30.610> works<00:02:30.790> that<00:02:31.209> was<00:02:31.330> much<00:02:31.630> easier

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
this actually works that was much easier

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:56.250 
this actually works that was much easier
than<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.140> expected

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.870 

very<00:02:56.950> nice
