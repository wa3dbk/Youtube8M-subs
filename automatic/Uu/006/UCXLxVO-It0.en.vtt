about<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.840> fucked<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
about that I really fucked with as a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710 
about that I really fucked with as a
villain<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.399> an<00:01:44.549> antagonist<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.360> whatever

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
villain or as an antagonist or whatever

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.179 
villain or as an antagonist or whatever
you<00:01:45.840> want<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> call<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.950> sad<00:01:47.159> because

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you want to call it and it's sad because

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.410 
you want to call it and it's sad because
that's<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.640> particular<00:01:47.850> point<00:01:48.210> where<00:01:48.299> her

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
that's this particular point where her

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.700 
that's this particular point where her
character's<00:01:48.810> development<00:01:48.869> where<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> went

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
character's development where it went

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.039 
character's development where it went
you<00:01:50.460> can't<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.810> without

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you can't really go back to that without

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.330 
you can't really go back to that without
it<00:01:52.200> being<00:01:52.350> ridiculous<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.100> point

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
it being ridiculous at this point

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.620 
it being ridiculous at this point
because<00:01:53.520> she's<00:01:53.670> already<00:01:53.790> had<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.360> major

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
because she's already had the major

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.319 
because she's already had the major
change<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.409> heirs<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.159> fairy<00:01:56.490> tale<00:01:56.790> changes

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
change and heirs and fairy tale changes

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.420 
change and heirs and fairy tale changes
so<00:01:57.450> even<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.350> wanted<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:59.009> character<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
so even if I wanted that character to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
so even if I wanted that character to
come<00:01:59.640> back<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.030> would<00:02:00.329> feel<00:02:00.509> redundant<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.200> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
come back it would feel redundant and it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.600 
come back it would feel redundant and it
will<00:02:01.439> feel<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.619> everything<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.460> has

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
will feel like everything that has

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.249 
will feel like everything that has
happened<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.299> point<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.930> change<00:02:04.079> her

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
happened up to this point to change her

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.929 
happened up to this point to change her
into<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.590> character<00:02:04.799> was<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.610> nothing<00:02:05.909> so

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
into this character was for nothing so

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.459 
into this character was for nothing so
it's<00:02:06.210> kinda<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.450> she<00:02:06.659> should<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.110> never

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
it's kinda like she should have never

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.080 
it's kinda like she should have never
became<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.009> character<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> begin<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
became this character to begin with I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.210 
became this character to begin with I
really<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.660> said<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.020> mean<00:02:10.349> ever<00:02:10.739> she<00:02:11.069> was

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
really just said I mean ever she was

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.400 
really just said I mean ever she was
like<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.580> badass<00:02:11.940> bitch<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.780> did<00:02:12.930> her<00:02:13.050> thing

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
like a badass bitch that did her thing

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.530 
like a badass bitch that did her thing
and<00:02:13.500> now<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.710> was<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.070> you're<00:02:14.580> apologizing

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and now I was like you're apologizing

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.050 
and now I was like you're apologizing
which<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:16.050> guess<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.460> then<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.670> course<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.910> big

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
which I guess and then of course the big

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.610 
which I guess and then of course the big
piece<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.390> chapter<00:02:18.780> rogue

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
piece of the chapter rogue

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.470 
piece of the chapter rogue
future<00:02:19.980> road<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.550> whole<00:02:20.700> revelation<00:02:21.360> and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
future road the whole revelation and

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.760 
future road the whole revelation and
everything<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> mission<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.290> he<00:02:22.410> had<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.650> go

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
everything the mission that he had to go

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.370 
everything the mission that he had to go
on<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.310> destroy<00:02:23.880> avatar<00:02:24.360> one<00:02:24.960> thing<00:02:25.200> I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
on to destroy avatar one thing I

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.040 
on to destroy avatar one thing I
definitely<00:02:25.500> got<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> note<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.660> this

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
definitely got a note is that if this

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.170 
definitely got a note is that if this
actually<00:02:28.800> happened<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.820> future

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
actually happened in that future

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.240 
actually happened in that future
timeline<00:02:30.750> or<00:02:30.930> whatever<00:02:31.170> then<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:31.860> safe<00:02:32.040> to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
timeline or whatever then it's safe to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.770 
timeline or whatever then it's safe to
say<00:02:32.280> unless<00:02:32.880> things<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.240> changed

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
say unless things have changed

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.200 
say unless things have changed
drastically<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.860> point<00:02:35.130> where<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.520> that

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
drastically to the point where in that

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.180 
drastically to the point where in that
timeline<00:02:36.540> maybe<00:02:36.930> grey<00:02:37.200> became<00:02:37.560> evil<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.100> in

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
timeline maybe grey became evil but in

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.100 
timeline maybe grey became evil but in
this<00:02:38.340> one<00:02:38.550> he<00:02:38.610> really<00:02:39.210> didn't<00:02:39.630> become<00:02:39.840> evil

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
this one he really didn't become evil

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.840 
this one he really didn't become evil
whatever<00:02:40.260> because<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.680> something<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.490> it's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
whatever because of something then it's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.910 
whatever because of something then it's
safe<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.180> say<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.330> grey<00:02:42.630> probably<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.410> evil

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
safe to say that grey probably is evil

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.740 
safe to say that grey probably is evil
if<00:02:44.010> he's<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.370> one<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.550> ultimately<00:02:45.360> kills

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
if he's the one that ultimately kills

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.200 
if he's the one that ultimately kills
that<00:02:45.960> goddamn<00:02:46.530> cat<00:02:46.860> then<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.880> assume<00:02:48.150> that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
that goddamn cat then we can assume that

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.480 
that goddamn cat then we can assume that
he<00:02:48.480> probably<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.380> really<00:02:49.860> evil<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.340> this

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
he probably is really evil in this

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.550 
he probably is really evil in this
timeline<00:02:51.240> as<00:02:51.420> well<00:02:51.450> unless<00:02:51.900> something<00:02:52.290> you

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
timeline as well unless something you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.840 
timeline as well unless something you
know<00:02:52.680> again<00:02:52.890> changed<00:02:53.340> because<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.790> how

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
know again changed because you know how

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.670 
know again changed because you know how
time<00:02:54.120> travel<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.630> all<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.840> was<00:02:54.990> like<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
time travel and all that was like the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680 
time travel and all that was like the
smallest<00:02:55.980> thing<00:02:56.220> could<00:02:56.370> change<00:02:56.520> things<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:56.940> we

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
smallest thing could change things so we

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.720 
smallest thing could change things so we
can<00:02:57.900> assume<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.200> grey<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.770> indeed<00:02:59.220> evil<00:02:59.580> and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
can assume that grey is indeed evil and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.190 
can assume that grey is indeed evil and
this<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.030> yet<00:03:00.150> again<00:03:00.270> Naruto<00:03:00.600> trying<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.050> save

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
this is yet again Naruto trying to save

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.720 
this is yet again Naruto trying to save
Sasuke<00:03:01.350> from<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.800> darkness<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.280> know<00:03:02.310> all

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
Sasuke from the darkness you know all

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.880 
Sasuke from the darkness you know all
that<00:03:02.850> good<00:03:03.060> shit<00:03:03.270> but<00:03:03.450> seriously<00:03:04.020> like<00:03:04.200> we<00:03:04.740> can

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
that good shit but seriously like we can

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.290 
that good shit but seriously like we can
assume<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.190> because<00:03:05.460> if<00:03:05.700> he<00:03:05.790> did<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.060> at<00:03:06.150> one

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
assume that because if he did it at one

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.690 
assume that because if he did it at one
timeline<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.140> things<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.920> leading<00:03:08.250> up<00:03:08.370> almost

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
timeline and things is leading up almost

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.300 
timeline and things is leading up almost
exactly<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.270> same<00:03:09.300> way<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:10.350> he<00:03:10.680> might<00:03:11.100> be

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
exactly the same way then he might be

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.130 
exactly the same way then he might be
evil<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.700> then<00:03:11.850> again<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:12.690> future

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
evil but then again in that future

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.960 
evil but then again in that future
timeline<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:14.100> gray<00:03:14.340> had<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.640> character

I<00:03:16.350> feel<00:03:16.590> like<00:03:16.710> I'm<00:03:16.830> just<00:03:16.860> wrapping<00:03:17.760> my<00:03:18.060> own

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
I feel like I'm just wrapping my own

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.520 
I feel like I'm just wrapping my own
head<00:03:18.390> around<00:03:18.570> some<00:03:18.780> crazy<00:03:19.050> shit<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.320> don't<00:03:19.410> even

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
head around some crazy shit I don't even

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.870 
head around some crazy shit I don't even

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
you get what I mean like unless

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500 
you get what I mean like unless
something<00:03:22.920> changed<00:03:23.400> then<00:03:23.760> grey<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.209> indeed

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
something changed then grey is indeed

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.510

evil<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.050> what<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.170> lot<00:03:25.380> being<00:03:25.560> said<00:03:25.620> good

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
evil and what a lot being said good

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.220 
evil and what a lot being said good
chapter<00:03:26.910> for<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.150> most<00:03:27.330> part<00:03:27.570> again<00:03:27.870> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
chapter for the most part again the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.660 
chapter for the most part again the
whole<00:03:28.380> thing<00:03:28.560> with<00:03:28.680> sting<00:03:28.920> being<00:03:29.160> fat<00:03:29.430> for

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
whole thing with sting being fat for

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.980 
whole thing with sting being fat for
five<00:03:29.850> seconds<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.360> then<00:03:30.480> being<00:03:30.660> skinny

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
five seconds and then being skinny

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.080 
five seconds and then being skinny
pointless<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.950> have<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.280> no<00:03:32.490> transformation

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
pointless to have that no transformation

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.330 
pointless to have that no transformation
bean<00:03:33.660> avarice<00:03:34.050> character<00:03:34.530> development<00:03:34.920> yeah

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
bean avarice character development yeah

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.770 
bean avarice character development yeah
it<00:03:35.610> works<00:03:35.820> because<00:03:36.120> that's<00:03:36.240> where<00:03:36.450> she's<00:03:36.630> been

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
it works because that's where she's been

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.750 
it works because that's where she's been
built<00:03:36.990> up<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.320> but<00:03:37.530> she's<00:03:38.340> not<00:03:38.459> mean<00:03:38.610> ever

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
built up to but she's not mean ever

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.790 
built up to but she's not mean ever
anymore<00:03:39.209> she's<00:03:39.570> not<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.959> evil<00:03:40.350> sadistic

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
anymore she's not the evil sadistic

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.890 
anymore she's not the evil sadistic
bitch<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.610> she<00:03:41.760> was<00:03:41.970> unless<00:03:42.390> he<00:03:42.540> comes<00:03:42.720> back

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
bitch that she was unless he comes back

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.420 
bitch that she was unless he comes back
and<00:03:43.110> if<00:03:43.170> she<00:03:43.290> does<00:03:43.470> again<00:03:44.040> at<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.280> point

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
and if she does again at this point

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.090 
and if she does again at this point
it'll<00:03:44.700> be<00:03:44.790> like<00:03:44.940> if<00:03:45.300> she<00:03:46.170> does<00:03:46.470> for<00:03:46.860> some

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
it'll be like if she does for some

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.940 
it'll be like if she does for some
reason<00:03:47.820> go<00:03:48.030> back<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.540> being<00:03:48.720> evil<00:03:49.110> stay<00:03:49.709> that

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
reason go back to being evil stay that

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.090 
reason go back to being evil stay that
way<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:50.760> stay<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.360> way<00:03:51.570> we<00:03:51.739> stay<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.010> I

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
way just stay that way we stay and I

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.740 
way just stay that way we stay and I
don't<00:03:53.160> necessarily<00:03:53.430> believe<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.180> things

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
don't necessarily believe that things

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.090 
don't necessarily believe that things
will<00:03:54.989> have<00:03:55.170> changed<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> point<00:03:55.920> where

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
will have changed to the point where

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.010 
will have changed to the point where
Frost<00:03:56.790> still<00:03:57.090> won't<00:03:57.300> die<00:03:57.540> against<00:03:57.810> gray

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
Frost still won't die against gray

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.170 
Frost still won't die against gray
because<00:03:58.200> while<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:58.650> know<00:03:58.800> Natsu<00:03:59.610> st.<00:03:59.910> stay

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
because while we know Natsu st. stay

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.949 
because while we know Natsu st. stay
here<00:04:00.420> in<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.600> city

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
here in the city

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.900 
here in the city
eventually<00:04:01.590> gray<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.220> avatar<00:04:02.610> could<00:04:02.760> come

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
eventually gray and avatar could come

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.330 
eventually gray and avatar could come
attack<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.360> city<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.780> Frost<00:04:04.770> will<00:04:04.950> still<00:04:05.130> die

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
attack the city and Frost will still die

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.670 
attack the city and Frost will still die
or<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:06.000> know<00:04:06.120> something<00:04:07.080> will<00:04:07.320> happen<00:04:07.560> where

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
or you know something will happen where

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.260 
or you know something will happen where
ro<00:04:07.830> will<00:04:08.040> go<00:04:08.160> anyway<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:08.520> he<00:04:09.000> didn't

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
ro will go anyway so he didn't

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.850 
ro will go anyway so he didn't
necessarily<00:04:09.360> change<00:04:10.110> things<00:04:10.350> by<00:04:10.500> telling

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
necessarily change things by telling

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.990 
necessarily change things by telling
them<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.010> stay<00:04:11.190> there<00:04:11.400> they<00:04:11.610> could<00:04:11.760> still

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
them to stay there they could still

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.120 
them to stay there they could still
follow<00:04:12.300> avatar<00:04:13.110> could<00:04:13.260> attack<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.650> city<00:04:13.860> so

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
follow avatar could attack the city so

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.150 
follow avatar could attack the city so
yeah<00:04:14.640> Natsu<00:04:15.209> he<00:04:15.630> his<00:04:16.320> best<00:04:16.620> course<00:04:16.980> if
