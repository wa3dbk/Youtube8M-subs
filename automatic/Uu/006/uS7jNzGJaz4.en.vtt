00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.290
 have you to herbal a video as he does not play any two 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.999
 and no review 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:12.579
 well one of these are already crucial because I want you 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.099
 to provide my values â€‹â€‹and for download 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.939
 I sleep again on an old creek described with day 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.439
 If you go out of my little brother now you can already see 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.300
 the brick class is moving forward 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.060
 Burgmeier therefore comes now also soldiers but then I noticed it now 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.840
 Geotop dared 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.760
 because it's a CEA glass dome in the middle of the desert where suddenly 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.200
 Tears are a lot of green 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.590
 although that's not quite true you still see a lot of sand here 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.100
 but as soon as you make your comeback I will notice the current version 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.090
 of course, too 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.330
 in it describes and posts 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.330
 so hopefully from December onwards, I'll come to the left 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.310
 something is being built further 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.340
 and 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.230
 I would be in March to put on the mater that bothers to take care of everything here 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.670
 To turn green 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.850
 I was seldom so pleased about being more passionate about it 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.360
 also makes available again and I like Open you can do something different 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.160
 People look like they're naked so that's not going to interest them both 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.700
 Amazed to answer the question, they now put their own or car everything 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.790
 to anticipate what's called Michael Phelps building from the mountain area place 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.000
 to have the dome I created with Anette Beat Dietschy here 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.570
 complete leaves around itself, however, would be the mental 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.320
 great help 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.120
 Wennigsen should make tutorial about why betting is going on 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.050
 write comments or write me separately 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.180
 if it comes across also interest if not go we go after 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.230
 and well I hope you will find enemies on this map 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.080
 her neighborhood is only the highest 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.549
 except two bream 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:10.859
 and 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:15.040
 Well, at this point I say just bye bye with my tournament 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.779
 been thrown 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.069
 if you like my videos but then with with 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.799
 while then it is sunny
