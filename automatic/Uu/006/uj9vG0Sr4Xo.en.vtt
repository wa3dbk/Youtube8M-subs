tablespoons of corn flour okay just a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.280 
tablespoons of corn flour okay just a
little<00:01:41.430> sprinkling<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.090> salt<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.570> season<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
little sprinkling of salt to season up a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.319 
little sprinkling of salt to season up a
bit<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.369> everything<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:45.090> in

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
bit if you have everything going in

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.249 
bit if you have everything going in

there few peppers a couple of mushrooms

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
there few peppers a couple of mushrooms
toss<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.409> around<00:01:49.500> ever<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.860> slightly<00:01:50.159> now

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
toss them around ever so slightly now

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.340 
toss them around ever so slightly now
the<00:01:50.759> idea<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.180> using<00:01:51.390> corn<00:01:51.810> flour<00:01:52.079> not

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the idea of using corn flour not

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.230 
the idea of using corn flour not
ordinary<00:01:52.740> flour<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.670> allows<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
ordinary flour that just allows to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.319 
ordinary flour that just allows to
become<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:55.140> crispy<00:01:55.939> what<00:01:56.939> about<00:01:57.149> our

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
become really crispy what about our

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.620 
become really crispy what about our
prawns<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.310> fresh<00:01:59.310> baby<00:01:59.820> spinach<00:01:59.969> leaves

there shake off any excess flour like

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.609 
there shake off any excess flour like
that<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.590> pop<00:02:04.799> them<00:02:05.009> straight<00:02:05.450> into<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:07.409> egg

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
that and pop them straight into your egg

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.080 
that and pop them straight into your egg
white<00:02:08.239> mixture<00:02:09.239> there

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
white mixture there

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.530

don't<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.900> know<00:02:26.019> this<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.319> something<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.769> I

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
don't you know this is something that I

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.640 
don't you know this is something that I
tend<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.180> rely<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:28.720> little<00:02:28.900> bit<00:02:29.200> because<00:02:29.379> it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
tend to rely on a little bit because it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.589 
tend to rely on a little bit because it
doesn't<00:02:30.010> look<00:02:30.280> particularly<00:02:30.849> good<00:02:31.060> as<00:02:31.390> quite

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
doesn't look particularly good as quite

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.600 
doesn't look particularly good as quite
a<00:02:31.629> class<00:02:31.900> actually<00:02:32.170> kind<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.220> gives<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.580> that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
a class actually kind of gives it that

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.699 
a class actually kind of gives it that
kind<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:33.940> Chevy<00:02:34.360> up<00:02:34.450> hill<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.140> yeah<00:02:35.290> it's<00:02:35.470> 10

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
kind of Chevy up hill and yeah it's 10
