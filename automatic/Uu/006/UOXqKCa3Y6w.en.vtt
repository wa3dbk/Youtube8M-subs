00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.549
 originally bred for hunting 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.080
 the dachshund is lovable 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.059
 family dog ​​blossomed 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.710

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.420
 playful little dog breed know 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.420
 you have to experience now in the video 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.750
 hmm 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.420
 the dachshund is a total family dog 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.060
 he is friendly he is adorable he 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.800
 is cuddly he is playful he goes 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.559
 very much like to walk 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.030
 long walks not only because you 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.739
 he says he has short legs he does not want 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.129
 no the wild hours of walking 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.010
 long 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.040
 yes but he shows it also has its own 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.910
 head for example, the way of the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.020
 I do not like it 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.520
 namely we do not take in now 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.140
 other way and he also manages you 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.590
 convince and that 's the kind of 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.590
 Dackels 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.199
 He is just as educated as you always are 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.940
 says that you do not have a dachshund 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.989
 You can tell a dachshund 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.540
 educate just like that 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.250
 he is just as in the opposite direction 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.320
 is happy even if he is required 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.790
 the more you ask of him is like that 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.009
 he is more pleased about it 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.350
 intelligent it has willing to learn though 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.000
 his thick head anyway is the 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.590
 dachshund willing to learn and enjoys 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.590
 everything that is required of him 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.320
 So the normal dachshund weighs like that 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.840
 9-13 kilo 14 is large has 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.490
 a chest circumference mostly around 40 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.260
 centimeters sometimes over it 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.330
 Miniature Dachshund the weighing between so 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.140
 five and seven seven and a half kilo has 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.310
 a breast size of 32 to 36 cm and 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.440
 The rabbit dachshund 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.940
 he weighs three three and a half sometimes 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.430
 four kilos but that is allowed one 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.100
 breast circumference of at most 30 cm 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.060
 everything over 30 cm is already in 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.060
 the dwarf area 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.270
 tried if the dachshund no negative 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.340
 has made experiences that is the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.700
 Dearest dog you can imagine 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.429
 can 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.080
 no matter who comes in here he will 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.210
 friendly if you are 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.970
 The dachshund wants to sit down immediately 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.100
 shot the wild roses of the wild play for 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.860
 every game ready an open one 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.760
 friendly little family-friendly 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.500
 wacker the skin care of the roof exists 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.510
 actually that's why it does not do anything 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.200
 except nails cut and ears 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.060
 clean up 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.160
 you give them really great 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.980
 Food is important and then you have 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.480
 it already bathing with the grooming completely 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.310
 very rarely only when they really are 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.260
 have brushed somewhere have brushed 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.490
 You do not need to be able to do that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.490
 baby docs you do not have to 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.940
 it's the dachshund they say it is 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.150
 The disease typical of the breed is the dachshund 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.290
 lame or rather the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.940
 disc prolapse 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.710
 but what about other customers? 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.360
 But there is more with the dachshund because of the 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.970
 dog is biased by this 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.040
 long back that is unfortunately so but the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.170
 you can really counteract with 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.150
 a lot of games on the moon 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.250
 just like a human being, he goes a lot 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.690
 moving is less vulnerable is a dog 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.240
 also less prone if he is good 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 is trained when he is running well 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.930
 Dachshund only from the sofa to the earth 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.790
 Let's jump back, that's for it 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.920
 prone to herniated disc 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.400
 but get that with every other dog 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.400
 just like that 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.709
 The dachshund is just as compatible as 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.870
 every other dog, too, so I children 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.220
 not a dachshund that is not 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.830
 happy when playing with other dogs 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.080
 can play around and conviviality is 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.090
 is the same with the dachshund about each 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.280
 Meet another dog for a walk 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.050
 other dogs play together 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.850
 So the dachshund needs it 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.720
 just like other dogs like 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.620
 everyone is resting so the claim of one 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.450
 Dachshunds in general of a dog is out 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.550
 walking a lot is more 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.930
 the better 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.459
 that's why there's no need for a garden to be there 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.080
 does not need a big flat though 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.580
 the dog comes out of the man needs 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.850
 not my talk apartment also sufficient 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.709
 a very small apartment so the dax 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.760
 is actually perfect for rental apartments 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.050
 I'm always occurs is the high in 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.850
 the apartment he is satisfied the main thing 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.620
 you often go for a walk with him 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.620
 everything else does not interest him
