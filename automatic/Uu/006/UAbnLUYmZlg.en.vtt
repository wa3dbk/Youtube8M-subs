00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 hello and welcome to sap 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.440
 I'm still at the cebit 2014 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.990
 and finally have that sony 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.029
 xperia z2 found I already have 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 I personally like that is so from 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.170
 the data her what you so on the paper 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.990
 reads something better than the samsung 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.430
 galaxy s 5 but now I have today 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 both times in the hand and what should I do 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.580
 say 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.990
 my first impression of sony xperia z2 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.669
 has actually confirmed me 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.620
 I like the device very much 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.360
 many did not think so 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.070
 a lot changed but what ever 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.379
 has changed and what you notice it is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.090
 no screen protector me here in front 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.110
 in my opinion very much 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.579
 nice because you just the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.289
 fingerprints are not visible anymore 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.210
 is not necessarily on it 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 reliant on this screen protector 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.809
 that is quite cool display is but one 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.750
 great catchword is it something again 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.520
 we got bigger now we have 52 inches 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.239
 and it's finally an ips panel 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.030
 still 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.100
 but the perspective of the color representation 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 and also the brightness are simple 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.900
 noticeably better than the sony xperia z1 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.700
 we are here for this and actually everyone 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.270
 meant that the display is much better 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.100
 looks 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.509
 that's the one anyway 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.430
 The edges were also here at the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.900
 Somewhat thin weigh travel up here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.270
 still relatively large 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.030
 You could change that as well 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.080
 still have sprint-aces here 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.340
 that's it for the most part already 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.890
 from the front 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.490
 we also want the side something 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.799
 take a closer look 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 Here we have the cards again 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.790
 lenders device is like the b57 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.829
 certified speaks against dust and 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.630
 also water protected here below 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.880
 Micro USB connection as well as the slot 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.100
 for the sim card here again the two 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 Connections for a docking station here 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.750
 below we have again 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.820
 31 on the right side then the camera 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.610
 I really like baking 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.350
 louder quieter becomes characteristic in the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.370
 sony but are a bit smaller 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.240
 than usual 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.830
 I like it pretty well, we have 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.660
 here also the slot for one 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.610
 micro sd memory card you can do that 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.540
 Internet storage so easily 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.490
 expand 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.800
 the frame itself is out again 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.180
 Aluminum is a bit more discreet now 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.130
 I like that much better 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.320
 and feels very very high quality 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.670
 By the way, the device will be in black and 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.370
 come white and probably or 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.230
 possibly also silver not silver 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.959
 violet guilty please on the top 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.700
 the 3.5 millimeter jack connection and 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.290
 With that we would now be at the back 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.459
 When you see it's the black one 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.370
 model we still have 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.050
 mineral glass feel a similar design 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.870
 of course very high quality here 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.360
 the 20 7 megapixel main camera now 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.740
 also have videos in 4k open as well 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.830
 Here again the marking in the 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.620
 is sexy and we have a 3200 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.390
 milliamps strong battery should 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.160
 He also am quite be in there where 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.620
 I'm pretty curious 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.209
 it was a lot of hardware now 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.220
 Turn the device around again quickly 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.800
 First we have the qualcomm 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.620
 snapdragon 800 1 2 3 ghz quad-core 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.330
 and three gigabytes of memory of 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.370
 nice man of sony again pointed 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.360
 that's a gigabyte more than that 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.610
 galaxy s 5 otherwise we have here like 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.570
 said the xperia should be one after 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.460
 before however android 4.4 makes kitkat 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.500
 Actually, he is fine 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.270
 this exploit always quite good 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.350
 I like it and accordingly I like it 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.760
 Again, very good 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.340
 I just want to do a few things 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.020
 show when we go to the app store 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.390
 there has not changed so much when 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.860
 We talk raised their notification 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.700
 shows has become something 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.650
 be converted here 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.850
 notifications and when we over 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.500
 Let's go to the fast 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.180
 Settings where you eg the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.590
 display brightness can adjust 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.480
 I have already mentioned in matters 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.940
 brightness pretty much pleases the display 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.920
 good and we have lift ours here 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.140
 day we want to go fast too 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.550
 go to the browser is again the 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.530
 chrome preinstalled and not showing 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.480
 you the surf performance is really 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.850
 great the picture is stung 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.650
 I also like the white who knows 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.660
 pretty good, although this is all 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.030
 not yet a finished device is but 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.560
 but everything should be production 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.570
 Of course always in the back of the head ready 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.000
 as I said dedicated from lesepaten for 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.650
 the camera i just want you again 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.260
 quickly show what we can do here on the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.750
 we have modes here now 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.359
 this new car mode where we are 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.430
 I can also record videos in 4k 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.960
 I'm pretty good or something with that mode 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.110
 background blur call that 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.490
 whole just the depth of field something 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.530
 could reduce the pictures in the 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.200
 act as if they were with for example 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.450
 a dslr added 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.820
 14 for example in the background by the way 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.650
 she could also have seen pretty well 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.180
 also the speakers revised at 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.770
 sony xperia 2 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.500
 but we can not really do that 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.690
 it is an impression here 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.280
 just too loud we have to wait 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.290
 but otherwise my first impression is 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.330
 really great why better display 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.640
 The device is still very much 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.160
 high-quality looks but weighs now 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.520
 but only apologize 158 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.260
 gram 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.650
 It is much better in the hand than 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.300
 the xperia z21 feels excused please 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.800
 but still as high quality 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.450
 in my opinion even something else 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.430
 the frame is thinner 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.480
 The device is a total of 82 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.920
 millimeters thinner 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.300
 the camera is very very much 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.580
 but we were able to promise that unfortunately 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.450
 we do not have to test that well yet 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.890
 of course check off 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.570
 the display has become bigger the 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.100
 Protective film is finally gone and me 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.180
 think you hear it already like it 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.250
 actually pretty good 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.070
 it was a first short shirt and from 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.540
 sony xperia 2 I'll get the device 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.250
 of course also test it as soon as it 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.420
 available one has just told us 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.310
 about in the 15th 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.020
 calendar week, it will at least to the 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.490
 dealer delivered you know that 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.890
 can always take a while 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.540
 but as I said it was a short first 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.950
 Hands-on I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.170
 of course thank me for watching 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.710
 and says in this sense until the 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.710
 next time
