00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
pretty sweet so all's I did I just did

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.139 
pretty sweet so all's I did I just did
the<00:01:00.129> trick<00:01:00.339> here<00:01:00.489> there<00:01:00.670> was<00:01:00.760> actually

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
the trick here there was actually

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.930 
the trick here there was actually
nothing<00:01:01.329> mayor<00:01:01.809> um<00:01:02.079> I<00:01:02.889> just<00:01:03.100> got<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.639> camera

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
nothing mayor um I just got the camera

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.000 
nothing mayor um I just got the camera
angle<00:01:04.089> right<00:01:04.390> so<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.659> think<00:01:04.809> could<00:01:04.989> um<00:01:05.199> cut<00:01:05.890> out

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
angle right so I think could um cut out

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.069 
angle right so I think could um cut out
the<00:01:06.040> ls<00:01:06.430> show<00:01:06.610> thing<00:01:06.880> when<00:01:07.090> I<00:01:07.120> do<00:01:07.270> when<00:01:07.840> I<00:01:07.869> did

this is my skate awesome skating and
then<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:48.429> just<00:01:48.820> recorded<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.390> with<00:01:49.539> no<00:01:49.659> green

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
then I just recorded it with no green

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.300 
then I just recorded it with no green
screen<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.229> then<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.530> turned<00:01:50.829> on<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:50.979> green

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
screen and then I turned on the green

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.849 
screen and then I turned on the green
screen<00:01:51.549> layer<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:52.030> then<00:01:52.869> I<00:01:53.259> basically<00:01:53.499> played

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
screen layer and then I basically played

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.760 
screen layer and then I basically played
the<00:01:53.979> exact<00:01:54.340> same<00:01:54.549> clip<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:55.990> what<00:01:56.439> this<00:01:56.590> will

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
the exact same clip now what this will

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.310 
the exact same clip now what this will
do<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:57.579> I<00:01:57.969> will<00:01:58.119> create<00:01:58.420> like<00:01:58.659> a<00:01:58.689> sandwich

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
do is that I will create like a sandwich

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.319 
do is that I will create like a sandwich
effect<00:01:59.890> kind<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.310> so<00:02:00.460> i'll<00:02:00.579> have<00:02:00.819> the<00:02:00.969> bottom

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
effect kind of so i'll have the bottom

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.300 
effect kind of so i'll have the bottom
layer<00:02:01.539> with<00:02:02.229> my<00:02:02.409> skater<00:02:02.770> which<00:02:02.979> you<00:02:03.249> don't

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
layer with my skater which you don't

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.709 
layer with my skater which you don't
even<00:02:03.490> need<00:02:03.700> your<00:02:03.819> skater<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:04.329> it<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.569> just

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
even need your skater in it you just

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.209 
even need your skater in it you just
need<00:02:04.929> some<00:02:05.109> type<00:02:05.259> of<00:02:05.289> background<00:02:05.590> plate<00:02:06.009> and

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
need some type of background plate and

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.550 
need some type of background plate and
then<00:02:06.789> with<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.270> exact<00:02:07.569> same<00:02:07.780> layer<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.530> i

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
then with the exact same layer you i

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.169 
then with the exact same layer you i
mean<00:02:08.860> with<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.130> exact<00:02:09.369> same<00:02:09.550> camera<00:02:09.940> angle

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
mean with the exact same camera angle

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.370 
mean with the exact same camera angle
you<00:02:10.300> would<00:02:10.420> turn<00:02:10.569> on<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.810> green<00:02:11.020> screen

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
you would turn on the green screen

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.650 
you would turn on the green screen
and<00:02:11.590> I'll<00:02:12.490> show<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> screenshot<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.300> that<00:02:13.390> kind

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and I'll show a screenshot of that kind

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.300 
and I'll show a screenshot of that kind
of<00:02:13.870> like<00:02:13.960> an<00:02:14.110> After<00:02:14.410> Effects<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.830> what<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.070> did

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
of like an After Effects and what I did

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.280 
of like an After Effects and what I did
and<00:02:15.490> then<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:16.000> could<00:02:16.060> place<00:02:16.390> effects<00:02:17.050> in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
and then I could place effects in

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.110 
and then I could place effects in
between<00:02:17.800> each<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> layers<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.760> then<00:02:19.090> I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
between each of the layers and then I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.180 
between each of the layers and then I
look<00:02:19.570> like<00:02:19.750> my<00:02:19.870> skater<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.320> going<00:02:20.650> past<00:02:20.920> them

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
look like my skater is going past them

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.130 
look like my skater is going past them
and<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.420> helps<00:02:22.570> because<00:02:22.810> then<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.110> don't

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
and this just helps because then I don't

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.840 
and this just helps because then I don't
have<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.440> mask<00:02:23.770> everything<00:02:24.280> out<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.670> just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
have to mask everything out and it just

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.150 
have to mask everything out and it just
creates<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.600> lot<00:02:25.840> more<00:02:25.990> easier<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:26.980> what<00:02:27.130> I

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
creates it a lot more easier so what I

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.410 
creates it a lot more easier so what I
did<00:02:27.370> for<00:02:27.550> each<00:02:27.760> um<00:02:28.270> I<00:02:28.980> guess<00:02:29.980> effect<00:02:30.430> for<00:02:30.760> to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
did for each um I guess effect for to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.150 
did for each um I guess effect for to
make<00:02:31.600> them<00:02:31.750> kind<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.110> look<00:02:32.200> like<00:02:32.230> 3d<00:02:32.650> objects

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
make them kind of look like 3d objects

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.450 
make them kind of look like 3d objects
in<00:02:33.280> MIT<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:33.670> space<00:02:34.560> what<00:02:35.560> i<00:02:35.590> did<00:02:35.770> i<00:02:35.800> just<00:02:35.890> left

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
in MIT and space what i did i just left

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.130 
in MIT and space what i did i just left
it<00:02:36.610> still<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.240> things<00:02:37.450> we're<00:02:37.660> never<00:02:37.810> moving

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
it still the things we're never moving

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.960 
it still the things we're never moving
and<00:02:38.410> i<00:02:38.770> just<00:02:38.950> created<00:02:39.100> this<00:02:39.370> green-screen

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
and i just created this green-screen

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.060 
and i just created this green-screen
stage<00:02:40.360> now<00:02:40.990> I<00:02:41.020> didn't<00:02:41.530> cover<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.950> entire

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
stage now I didn't cover the entire

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.220 
stage now I didn't cover the entire
green-screen<00:02:42.760> stage<00:02:43.090> because<00:02:43.510> if<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.020> did

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
green-screen stage because if I did

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.930 
green-screen stage because if I did
there'd<00:02:44.500> be<00:02:44.680> casting<00:02:45.130> shadows<00:02:45.370> which<00:02:45.760> that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
there'd be casting shadows which that

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.120 
there'd be casting shadows which that
would<00:02:46.060> ruin<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.540> green<00:02:47.260> screen<00:02:47.440> color<00:02:47.770> and

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
would ruin the green screen color and

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.000 
would ruin the green screen color and
that<00:02:48.400> would<00:02:48.490> end<00:02:48.640> up<00:02:49.050> ruining<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.470> green

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
that would end up ruining the green

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.560 
that would end up ruining the green
screen<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:52.270> just<00:02:52.870> make<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.080> look<00:02:53.320> all<00:02:53.410> goofy

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
screen and just make it look all goofy

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.240 
screen and just make it look all goofy
so<00:02:55.570> what<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> did<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.500> just<00:02:56.920> kind<00:02:57.190> of

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
so what I did is I just kind of

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.790 
so what I did is I just kind of
estimated<00:02:57.820> that<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.630> eye<00:02:58.870> bitch<00:02:59.530> would<00:02:59.740> be

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
estimated that the eye bitch would be

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.620 
estimated that the eye bitch would be
sitting<00:03:00.040> there<00:03:00.250> for<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.430> four<00:03:00.760> seconds<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.210> i

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
sitting there for like four seconds so i

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.570 
sitting there for like four seconds so i
just<00:03:01.780> created<00:03:01.990> a<00:03:02.200> four<00:03:02.380> second<00:03:02.740> thing<00:03:02.890> i<00:03:03.100> did

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
just created a four second thing i did

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.200 
just created a four second thing i did
this<00:03:03.700> tough<00:03:04.000> four<00:03:04.360> objects<00:03:04.900> um<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:06.090> then<00:03:07.090> I

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
this tough four objects um and then I

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.290 
this tough four objects um and then I
just<00:03:07.270> um<00:03:07.660> um<00:03:08.410> sink<00:03:09.130> two<00:03:09.280> men<00:03:09.640> when<00:03:09.970> my<00:03:10.120> guy

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
just um um sink two men when my guy

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.400 
just um um sink two men when my guy
would<00:03:10.480> land<00:03:10.720> they<00:03:10.870> would<00:03:10.990> just<00:03:11.020> start<00:03:11.230> flying

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
would land they would just start flying

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.350 
would land they would just start flying
in<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.800> air<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.160> then<00:03:12.310> what<00:03:12.520> i<00:03:12.550> did<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:12.910> i<00:03:13.090> sent
