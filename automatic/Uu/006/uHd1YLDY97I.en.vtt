different kind of screws for it and what

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.770 
different kind of screws for it and what
you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> basically<00:01:39.390> after

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
you can do here is that basically after

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.910 
you can do here is that basically after
you've<00:01:40.079> done<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.729> after<00:01:41.729> you're<00:01:42.030> screwed<00:01:42.420> in

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
you've done that after you're screwed in

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.100 
you've done that after you're screwed in
with<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.220> think<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.939> best<00:01:45.329> way<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.899> is

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
with I think the best way to go is

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.020 
with I think the best way to go is
Philips<00:01:46.500> screw<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.189> screw<00:01:47.520> drivers<00:01:47.880> like

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
Philips screw the screw drivers like

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.870 
Philips screw the screw drivers like
this<00:01:48.619> but<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.860> don't<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.430> yeah<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
this but if you don't have this yeah I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.330 
this but if you don't have this yeah I
think<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.710> make<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
think you can you can make do with the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.380 
think you can you can make do with the
regular<00:01:53.700> screwdriver

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
regular screwdriver

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.590 
regular screwdriver
what<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.810> basically<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> did<00:01:55.890> you

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
what do you basically do here is did you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.789 
what do you basically do here is did you
slide<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:58.020> this

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.620 

and<00:02:01.540> boom<00:02:02.890> that's<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.159> you're<00:02:05.119> ready<00:02:05.149> to<00:02:05.390> go
