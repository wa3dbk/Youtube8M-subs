00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:20.370
Go, go, go!

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:28.303
- Great to have you back.
- No better place to be.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:34.876
It can't be.

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:39.915
We were close once. We started
this whole Expendables thing together,

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.484
but we had a falling out.

00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:47.556
- What are you gonna do?
- Reload.

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:52.970
Welcome to the 21st century.

00:00:54.813 --> 00:00:55.931
I could do that.

00:00:57.073 --> 00:00:59.142
Want to slip on a dress
and give it a shot?

00:01:00.437 --> 00:01:02.412
This is it?
This is your team?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.508
- Short notice.
- Yeah, very short.

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:17.252
What the hell is that?

00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.770
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:30.599
You want 'em kids,
come get them.

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:37.447
You were stupid enough
to get yourself into this mess!

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.251
We're the only ones
scrazy enough to get you out of it!

00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:49.593
You couldn't take the stairs?

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:55.757
How hard can it be to kill 10 men?

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:00.637
Insane.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.931
Courageous, but insane.

00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:10.147
These guys are nuts.
