00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.000
 League the Schiller make I organize our fans with the help of 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.129
 Computer programs which too often become what can usually happen 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:15.789
 Weeds ITI plant these flowers in the known 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.789
 Computer games the Sims do the whole work the virtual ones 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.609
 Residents as players can enjoy the result of Eintracht Garten 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:25.230
 created 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.069
 then Bolzano is not 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.639
 to become real garden but of course prefer to lend a hand 

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:35.859
 plan their own garden and plant so-called 3d garden planners want it 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.430
 help 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.050
 yes there are now a good dozen such 3d garden planners and the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.030
 Everyone promises more or less the same thing, that's child's play 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.050
 is the market's own garden come 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.210
 or to plan and organize the terrace sounds promising 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.020
 but quite typical because before she can even go with the plan 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.940
 of course the bank's own garden must come complete the terrace 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.290
 because all the data must first be measured in the software 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.659
 be entered higher prepared depth 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.649
 where should the BT May this data have the software in it then step 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.690
 a virtual step by step 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.600
 Floor plan can arise 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.570
 that alone 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.880
 can take hours and some or the other in despair 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.620
 do it because you have to say clearly the tested programs this 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.400
 all not very user-friendly they are indeed very much in love detail 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.240
 just know everything exactly length wide height where are the beds where come 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539
 the WG in all of this has to ranks in the software 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.609
 but the programs do not reveal how to do that 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.890
 no help "no basis" data on which one could build there 

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:43.200
 is the user on his own must find out for himself how that in the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.659
 respective seduces 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.780
 works but if the data first in the software are then 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.130
 programs are definitely helpful and useful 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.830
 because the garden itself is first, so to speak, the floor plan in the computer 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.020
 You can start with the actual planning where could be a way 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.130
 where fits the garden shed out who likes can place garden furniture and 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.710
 set up the grill and set as later everything should look like 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.359
 of course, the plants are particularly important at the click of a mouse 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.159
 Trees shrubs bushes and grasses burst in the plan enter 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.609
 the 3d garden planners from Data Becker and Franz Liszt are renting huge libraries 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.700
 from which one can select the desired plants whether believes or 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.779
 Conifers shrubs and flowers climbing plants herbs grasses ferns 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.789
 Cactus palms orchids all clear 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:40.259
 The most important information about each plant appears in a kind of index card 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.229
 the much sunlight they need this water 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.589
 had to be honored 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.799
 because they look up enriched the 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.430
 are the real strength of the tested programs because you can do everything 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.760
 possible after Schlager you can see, for example, when the plants 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.770
 actually belong in the earth or even when they try 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.500
 which pests exist and what you can do against them 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.280
 Pests companies can be where they come from and much more 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.460
 possible useful information no question the one, however, too 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.610
 could look through from the internet or in any better data where 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.410
 from a computer program Pohlig actually expect quite concrete tips 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.230
 for my garden little on grandma elaborately created virtual where 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.120
 my lighting conditions taken into account my soil condition 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.450
 and when it is said which plants are compatible with each other 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.300
 Unfortunately, the programs do not offer that but you can do well from the like 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.860
 virtual plot from the basic course a chic 2 d 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.210
 and also in the 3 to make the view there you can 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.450
 his garden his balcony or terrace practically and everyone 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.409
 Direction of the star marvel at every angle 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.900
 take a look and see 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.030
 like the plants 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.979
 grow like the garden in a 2 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.579
 The three years it looks like this is natural 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.239
 quite chic and practical 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.449
 Most of the three cards planner for the PC 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.879
 the cost between 20 and 40 euros offer in my opinion but too little 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.029
 For money in all programs counts a good manual some even point 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.879
 Annoying shortcomings and expensive to use, they are all there 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.329
 Manufacturer urgently nachbessern so that the right fun and makes sense 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.039
 what a shame 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.579
 if you want more information to look up or DJ left to click on them 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.510
 our platform keeps worse 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.340
