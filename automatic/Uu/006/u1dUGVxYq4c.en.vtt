00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
situation here this is a marine tank

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.540 
situation here this is a marine tank
where<00:00:06.029> all<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.299> fish<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:07.010> very<00:00:08.010> dramatically

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
where all the fish of very dramatically

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.120 
where all the fish of very dramatically
just<00:00:08.849> died<00:00:09.030> now<00:00:09.900> there's<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.230> sleek<00:00:10.679> right

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
across the surface of the water I don't

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.570 
across the surface of the water I don't
know<00:00:13.320> if<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.500> coming<00:00:13.799> out<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.099> video<00:00:14.429> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
know if it's coming out on this video it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.439 
know if it's coming out on this video it
looks<00:00:14.759> like<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:16.699> it's<00:00:17.699> like<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> whitish

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
looks like it is and it's like a whitish

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.120 
looks like it is and it's like a whitish
slick<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.080> goes<00:00:19.230> across<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.740> top<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.769 
slick that goes across the top of the
tank<00:00:20.539> now<00:00:22.640> yesterday<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.029> tank<00:00:24.300> was<00:00:24.449> dosed

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
tank now yesterday the tank was dosed

quite a good product providing that you
have<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> protein<00:00:36.210> skimmer<00:00:36.469> this<00:00:37.469> tanks

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
have a protein skimmer this tanks

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.180 
have a protein skimmer this tanks
actually<00:00:37.950> run<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:39.690> canister<00:00:40.230> filter<00:00:40.559> so

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
actually run on a canister filter so

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.340 
actually run on a canister filter so
it's<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.640> important<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.360> you'd<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.079> very

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it's really important that you'd be very

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.310 
it's really important that you'd be very
careful<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.250> any<00:00:44.579> fish<00:00:45.059> anything<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.200> you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
careful with any fish anything that you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.250 
careful with any fish anything that you
add<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.489> tank<00:00:48.270> without<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.629> protein<00:00:49.079> skimmer

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
add to a tank without a protein skimmer

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.590 
add to a tank without a protein skimmer
because<00:00:50.219> there<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.520> various<00:00:51.000> products<00:00:51.480> on

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
because there are various products on

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.290 
because there are various products on
the<00:00:51.690> market<00:00:52.110> such<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.680> an<00:00:52.890> anti<00:00:53.640> red<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the market such as that an anti red and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
the market such as that an anti red and
various<00:00:54.750> products<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:55.739> need<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
various products that you really need to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.760 
various products that you really need to
have<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> skimmer<00:00:57.050> otherwise<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.530> create

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
have a skimmer otherwise that can create

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.490 
have a skimmer otherwise that can create
toxic<00:00:59.250> situations<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.989> thing<00:01:01.289> here

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
toxic situations so this thing here

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.889 
toxic situations so this thing here
grows<00:01:01.949> bacteria<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.940> gets<00:01:03.120> rid<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> nitrate

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
grows bacteria that gets rid of nitrate

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.200 
grows bacteria that gets rid of nitrate
and<00:01:04.019> phosphate<00:01:04.220> which<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.369> basically<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.880> great

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
and phosphate which is basically a great

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.870 
and phosphate which is basically a great
concept<00:01:07.130> providing<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.549> you've<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
concept providing that you've got a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
concept providing that you've got a
protein<00:01:09.330> skimmer<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.869> tank<00:01:10.280> because<00:01:11.280> this

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
protein skimmer on the tank because this

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.870 
protein skimmer on the tank because this
nitrate<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> phosphate<00:01:12.979> it's<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.490> need

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
nitrate and phosphate it's going to need

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.539 
nitrate and phosphate it's going to need
to<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.210> removed<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.159> you're<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> need

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
to be removed and you're going to need

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.190 
to be removed and you're going to need
to<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.869> sufficient<00:01:19.700> oxygen<00:01:20.700> levels

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
to have really sufficient oxygen levels

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
to have really sufficient oxygen levels
considering<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.950> you're<00:01:23.130> gonna<00:01:23.220> grow<00:01:23.460> all

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
considering that you're gonna grow all

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.249 
considering that you're gonna grow all
this<00:01:23.759> extra<00:01:24.090> bacteria<00:01:24.780> pretty<00:01:25.080> much

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
this extra bacteria pretty much

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.080 
this extra bacteria pretty much
artificially<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
artificially so this is just one of the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.399 
artificially so this is just one of the
risks<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:30.810> low-tech<00:01:32.810> tanks<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:34.200> good

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
risks of these low-tech tanks very good

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.780 
risks of these low-tech tanks very good

they were very healthy happy fish until

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.200 
they were very healthy happy fish until
today<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.460> little<00:01:44.579> bit<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> warning

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
today so just a little bit of a warning

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.560 
today so just a little bit of a warning
just<00:01:45.920> be<00:01:46.920> careful<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.460> add<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.240> tanks

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
just be careful what you add to tanks

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.550 
just be careful what you add to tanks
with<00:01:48.720> these<00:01:50.210> very<00:01:51.210> basic<00:01:51.450> filtration<00:01:52.259> just

with these very basic filtration just

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.660 
with these very basic filtration just
one<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.689> disadvantages<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:55.340> those<00:01:56.340> sorts

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
one of the disadvantages of those sorts

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
one of the disadvantages of those sorts

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
can't run these sorts of systems just

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.529 
can't run these sorts of systems just

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:20.610 

hello<00:02:07.539> dogie

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.710 

giving<00:02:21.250> an<00:02:21.310> eerie<00:02:21.430> sight<00:02:22.180> well<00:02:22.630> the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
giving an eerie sight well the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.559 
giving an eerie sight well the
invertebrates<00:02:23.260> seemed<00:02:23.470> fine

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
invertebrates seemed fine

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.080 
invertebrates seemed fine
what<00:02:25.620> what<00:02:26.620> he<00:02:26.709> had<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.010> corals<00:02:27.400> seemed<00:02:27.670> okay

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
what what he had of corals seemed okay

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.540 
what what he had of corals seemed okay
it<00:02:28.990> really<00:02:29.380> makes<00:02:29.590> me<00:02:29.740> think<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.160> all<00:02:30.310> she

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
it really makes me think it is all she
