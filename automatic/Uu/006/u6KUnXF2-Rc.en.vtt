00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
different pattern to that it's going to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.890 
different pattern to that it's going to
switch<00:02:50.930> between<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.680> first<00:02:51.890> high<00:02:52.100> hat<00:02:52.900> then

switch between the first high hat then

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.190 
switch between the first high hat then
the<00:02:54.050> second<00:02:54.410> high<00:02:54.530> hat<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.900> going<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.110> do

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
the second high hat it's going to do

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.620 
the second high hat it's going to do
that<00:02:57.260> again<00:02:57.620> but<00:02:57.950> then<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:59.120> going<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.390> go

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
that again but then it's going to go

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.289 
that again but then it's going to go
from<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.290> second<00:03:00.709> high<00:03:00.860> hat<00:03:01.130> for<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.060> first

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
from the second high hat for the first

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.110 
from the second high hat for the first
higher<00:03:02.570> hat<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:04.400> going<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.640> be<00:03:04.820> like<00:03:04.970> this

high hat pan but what we're going to do

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.680 
high hat pan but what we're going to do
is<00:03:24.579> this<00:03:25.579> one<00:03:25.820> we're<00:03:26.120> going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.450> load<00:03:26.600> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
is this one we're going to load the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.479 
is this one we're going to load the
velocity<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.680> velocity<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.250> basically

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
velocity of it the velocity is basically

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.720 
velocity of it the velocity is basically
the<00:03:28.730> tone<00:03:29.000> or<00:03:29.030> which<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.570> notes<00:03:29.750> being<00:03:29.989> played

so highlight the selected region you

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.729 
so highlight the selected region you
want<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.530> alter<00:03:34.360> yeah<00:03:35.390> then<00:03:35.690> hold<00:03:35.959> ctrl<00:03:36.500> key

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
want to alter yeah then hold ctrl key

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.729 
want to alter yeah then hold ctrl key
press<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.730> line<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.410> then<00:03:39.410> you'll<00:03:39.530> be<00:03:39.650> able

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
press the line and then you'll be able

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.420 
press the line and then you'll be able
to<00:03:39.980> edit<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.310> velocity<00:03:40.700> down<00:03:41.030> here<00:03:41.299> after<00:03:42.280> notes

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.310 

so<00:03:46.430> when<00:03:47.299> we<00:03:47.450> play<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.750> back<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.200> should

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
so when we play that back it should

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.440 
so when we play that back it should
sound<00:03:48.530> like<00:03:48.680> this

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.040

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
a ghost in there is because I just

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.190 
a ghost in there is because I just
figured<00:04:02.480> out<00:04:02.600> myself

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
figured out myself

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.170 
figured out myself
all<00:04:03.260> right<00:04:03.790> know<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:06.910> that's<00:04:07.910> basically

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
right now I'm going to make that a bit

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:51.780 
right now I'm going to make that a bit
longer<00:04:42.080> sucking<00:04:42.560> here<00:04:42.830> let<00:04:43.340> all<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.640> form

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.010 

right<00:04:52.790> and<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:53.210> don't<00:04:53.330> have<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.690> just<00:04:53.870> have<00:04:53.900> to

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
right and you don't have to just have to

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.469 
right and you don't have to just have to
go<00:04:54.290> snares<00:04:54.650> like<00:04:55.040> being<00:04:55.490> repetitive<00:04:55.760> because

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
go snares like being repetitive because

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.240 
go snares like being repetitive because
if<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.750> keep<00:04:56.900> doing<00:04:57.229> that<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.890> helped<00:04:58.130> that

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
if you keep doing that that helped that

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.520 
if you keep doing that that helped that
same<00:04:58.460> pan<00:04:58.729> for<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.360> whole<00:04:59.479> song<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.020> gonna

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
same pan for the whole song so gonna

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.680 
same pan for the whole song so gonna
start<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.830> get<00:05:00.950> repetitive<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:01.729> maybe<00:05:02.450> add<00:05:02.660> a

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
start to get repetitive so maybe add a

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.070 
start to get repetitive so maybe add a
few<00:05:02.780> ghost<00:05:03.169> nur's<00:05:03.440> in<00:05:03.710> some<00:05:04.669> extra<00:05:04.940> ones<00:05:05.080> like

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
few ghost nur's in some extra ones like

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.050 
few ghost nur's in some extra ones like
maybe<00:05:06.290> at<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.500> very<00:05:06.680> end<00:05:06.890> like<00:05:07.010> this<00:05:09.850> so<00:05:10.850> let's

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
maybe at the very end like this so let's

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:22.840 
maybe at the very end like this so let's
hear<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.240> one<00:05:18.850> I<00:05:19.850> don't<00:05:20.540> know<00:05:21.520> well<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.729> only

hear that one I don't know well the only
thing<00:05:22.940> really<00:05:23.270> to<00:05:23.450> add<00:05:23.570> to<00:05:23.720> this<00:05:23.810> beat<00:05:24.080> would

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
thing really to add to this beat would

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.170 
thing really to add to this beat would
be<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:24.410> ride<00:05:24.680> cymbal<00:05:25.190> Brad<00:05:25.610> cymbals<00:05:26.000> very

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
be a ride cymbal Brad cymbals very

simple all you do is find a ride first

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.560 
simple all you do is find a ride first
