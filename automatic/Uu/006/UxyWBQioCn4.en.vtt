00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.229 
overall there's some lag but i'm going
to<00:00:55.960> see<00:00:56.140> if<00:00:56.230> this<00:00:56.489> minimizes<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.610> lag<00:00:57.820> so<00:00:58.030> here

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
to see if this minimizes the lag so here

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.479

very<00:01:10.479> small<00:01:10.900> here<00:01:11.140> we<00:01:11.229> can<00:01:11.350> get<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.500> closer<00:01:11.740> look

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
very small here we can get a closer look

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.539 
very small here we can get a closer look
at<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:13.420> tiny<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:14.170> course<00:01:14.950> because<00:01:15.280> it

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
at it it's tiny of course because it

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.840 
at it it's tiny of course because it
doesn't<00:01:15.880> really<00:01:16.030> do<00:01:16.240> any<00:01:16.950> hard<00:01:17.950> disk<00:01:18.460> reading

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
doesn't really do any hard disk reading

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.340 
doesn't really do any hard disk reading
or<00:01:18.970> anything<00:01:19.240> all<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.510> does<00:01:19.659> is<00:01:19.840> play<00:01:20.110> the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
or anything all it does is play the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.600 
or anything all it does is play the
games<00:01:20.560> on<00:01:20.770> there<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.130> they<00:01:21.220> are<00:01:21.340> going<00:01:21.549> to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
games on there and they are going to

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.660
