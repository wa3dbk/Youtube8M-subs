00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
on the incline that's the best way to do

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.620 
on the incline that's the best way to do
is<00:00:28.800> glitch<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.880> once<00:00:30.119> you've<00:00:30.240> done<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.420> you

want have a friend standing next to the
gates<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.489> gate<00:00:32.640> will<00:00:32.790> always<00:00:33.059> stay

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
gates that the gate will always stay

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.299 
gates that the gate will always stay
open<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> guys<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.440> far<00:00:34.739> away<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
gate will close and it's really hard to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.240 
gate will close and it's really hard to
do<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.930> glitch<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.410> make<00:00:37.860> sure<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.219> the

next to the gate and I start a good
amount<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.649> lift<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.129> still<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.460> could<00:01:02.609> be

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
amount of lift but still it could be

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.189

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
there that you know the gate and at the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.039 
there that you know the gate and at the
right<00:01:17.970> angle<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.540> will<00:01:18.630> actually<00:01:18.750> throw

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
right angle and it will actually throw

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that any car can be done to do this

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.590 
that any car can be done to do this
glitch<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> heavier<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
glitch you know kind of the heavier the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
glitch you know kind of the heavier the
better<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.110> my<00:01:25.320> opinion<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.189> know<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
better in my opinion for you know the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.280 
better in my opinion for you know the
launch<00:01:26.610> I'm<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.360> something<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.810> one

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
launch I'm just like something like one

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.899 
launch I'm just like something like one
of<00:01:28.320> those<00:01:28.409> little<00:01:28.619> weenie<00:01:28.829> cars<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.759> can

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
of those little weenie cars they can

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.399 
of those little weenie cars they can
still<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.540> know<00:01:30.630> want<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.259> won't

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
still you know want you but they won't

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.170 
still you know want you but they won't
want<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.860> far<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.250> say<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> fire<00:01:32.729> truck<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
want you as far as say a fire truck and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
want you as far as say a fire truck and
this<00:01:33.540> makes<00:01:33.720> sure<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.350> guys<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
this makes sure that you guys have a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
this makes sure that you guys have a
heavy<00:01:34.979> car<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:36.090> used<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.600> block<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
heavy car on that is used to block the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.090 
heavy car on that is used to block the
gate<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.500> right<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.009> an

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
gate so like right there we have an

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.950 
gate so like right there we have an
ambulance<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.060> ever<00:01:39.210> use<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
ambulance but don't ever use like just a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.969 
ambulance but don't ever use like just a
regular<00:01:39.990> car<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.799> will<00:01:40.890> get

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
regular car because it will get

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
regular car because it will get
destroyed<00:01:41.130> very<00:01:41.549> very<00:01:41.700> easily<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.750> tends

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
destroyed very very easily as this tends

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
destroyed very very easily as this tends
to<00:01:43.380> make<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> car<00:01:43.860> freak<00:01:44.159> out<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
to make the car freak out that's you

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.179 
to make the car freak out that's you
being<00:01:45.390> used<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.810> block<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:47.100> instance

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
being used to block it so for instance

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.710 
being used to block it so for instance
like<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.729> influence<00:01:48.090> might<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.479> don't<00:01:48.600> get

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
like the influence might you don't get

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300 
like the influence might you don't get
shot<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.470> time<00:01:49.649> or<00:01:49.860> another<00:01:49.890> so

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
shot out of there one time or another so

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520 
shot out of there one time or another so
the<00:01:51.210> heavier<00:01:51.360> car<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> lot<00:01:52.110> rare<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the heavier car it's a lot rare to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.010
