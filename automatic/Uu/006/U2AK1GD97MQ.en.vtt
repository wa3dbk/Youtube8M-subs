right now I'm probably gonna stop my
driving<00:05:57.339> out<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:57.759> just<00:05:58.060> get<00:05:58.180> things<00:05:58.360> sorted<00:05:58.629> at

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
driving out to just get things sorted at

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.540 
driving out to just get things sorted at
the<00:05:58.990> end<00:05:59.110> of<00:05:59.199> this<00:05:59.289> year<00:05:59.589> ready<00:06:00.129> for<00:06:00.279> the<00:06:00.370> next

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
the end of this year ready for the next

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.459 
the end of this year ready for the next
year<00:06:00.759> but<00:06:01.180> yeah<00:06:01.389> just<00:06:01.750> I<00:06:01.930> think<00:06:02.199> either

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
year but yeah just I think either

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:03.899 
year but yeah just I think either
cycling<00:06:02.979> or<00:06:03.069> running<00:06:03.099> I'm<00:06:03.370> not<00:06:03.490> really<00:06:03.610> a<00:06:03.699> fan

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
cycling or running I'm not really a fan

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:05.309 
cycling or running I'm not really a fan
of<00:06:03.939> running<00:06:04.300> I've<00:06:04.419> never<00:06:04.599> been<00:06:04.870> a<00:06:04.899> fan<00:06:05.169> of

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
of running I've never been a fan of

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.439 
of running I've never been a fan of
running<00:06:05.500> it's<00:06:06.099> just<00:06:06.310> boring<00:06:06.909> it's<00:06:07.120> just<00:06:07.270> ball

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
running it's just boring it's just ball

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:08.939 
running it's just boring it's just ball
four<00:06:07.659> here<00:06:07.810> so<00:06:08.259> I<00:06:08.319> think<00:06:08.379> I'd<00:06:08.589> probably<00:06:08.710> go

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
four here so I think I'd probably go

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.579 
four here so I think I'd probably go
cycling<00:06:09.490> and<00:06:09.719> you<00:06:10.719> know<00:06:10.810> just<00:06:11.080> just<00:06:11.139> get<00:06:11.500> the

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:11.589 
cycling and you know just just get the

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.320 
cycling and you know just just get the
healthy<00:06:11.889> and<00:06:12.129> back<00:06:12.279> if<00:06:12.460> you're<00:06:12.580> not<00:06:12.610> living

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
healthy and back if you're not living

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.119 
healthy and back if you're not living
that<00:06:13.509> healthy<00:06:13.870> lifestyle<00:06:14.319> I<00:06:14.469> would<00:06:14.710> highly

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
that healthy lifestyle I would highly

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.619 
that healthy lifestyle I would highly
recommend<00:06:15.520> getting<00:06:15.639> into<00:06:15.939> one<00:06:16.060> if<00:06:16.149> you<00:06:16.240> if<00:06:16.509> you

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
recommend getting into one if you if you

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.089 
recommend getting into one if you if you
aren't<00:06:16.839> because<00:06:17.080> honestly<00:06:17.589> it<00:06:17.710> feels<00:06:17.919> great

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
aren't because honestly it feels great

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:19.619 
aren't because honestly it feels great
once<00:06:18.399> you<00:06:18.490> get<00:06:18.639> healthy<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:19.120> you<00:06:19.240> eat<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.539> you
