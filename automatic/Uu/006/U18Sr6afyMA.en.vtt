00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.350
 hello today we're going to see how to adjust the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.840
 rear shock absorber on a bike 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.230
 descent for it what we are going to use 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.949
 in this case it will be a pump 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.949
 suspensions 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.190
 Latin America to see 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.370
 to where it is marked 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:32.360
 In this case, what we are going to use is the 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:35.270
 pump since the shock absorber is air 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.640
 and it's not a dock if it was very demolished 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.450
 we would play with the preload of two of the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.430
 springs 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.960
 Well first, what are we going to do? 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.770
 put the cushion rubber just 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.360
 touching to stay like this when we go up from the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.530
 bike marks us well well where is the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.800
 travel 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.480
 nobody in fact this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.089
 gravity 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.370
 to go well we would have to go dressed 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.550
 of the extensive 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.580
 the protections like the helmet the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:18.570
 collar the breastplate of everything weighs more and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.570
 could vary the sac that we put 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.680
 or not a 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.920
 fluids 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.460
 we check 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.000
 all right 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.130
 we can always find them somewhere 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.720
 It's better than someone holding on 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.800
 humanity 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.390
 we stand up and we go ahead and 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.390
 back so soft 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.970
 and now we have 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.510
 here the indicator that will be the gummy 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.540
 scion where he has arrived 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.080
 and now we will have 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.560
 what the shock absorber has marked us 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.810
 this will be the bag how it is calculated to use 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.110
 well we can calculate it from the center 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.870
 to the center of shock absorber or with 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.170
 career that has the stem of the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.440
 shock absorber in this case are 76 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.440
 millimeters 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:41.250
 76 and if we want to go with 30% salt 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:47.130
 we would have here from here that will mark 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:53.400
 about 53 54 millimeters if we wanted to go 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:56.970
 with 35% of that then with from here to 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.930
 rubber there should be about 5 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.930
 centimeters 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.250
 in this case 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.250
 we have 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.320
 without account and 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.900
 that day 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:23.690
 30 percent 31 that if we want to go 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.690
 with mass then we take 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.240
 and with the air pump 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.240
 we play 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.890
 to take pressure off 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:51.540
 that is to say it marks us for example 150 we go down 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.540
 to 140 to see what it is that gives us 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.110
 we come back 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.110
 to go up 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.100
 Y 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.100
 today we are going to take the subway 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.480
 and we see that now he would be in a 34 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.840
 percent of salt 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.830
 apart from this it depends on how you notice the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.530
 bike you can play day with compression 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.790
 or the rebound but this is more 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:54.150
 specific and we'll talk another day 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.120
 Well now you have seen how to adjust the 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.280
 sac on your downhill bike 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.850
 you know what 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.639
 depends on what you want you can leave 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.860
 a little more than sac or less depends 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.290
 also of the circuit and how not 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.050
 we have another easy one since you owe it to him 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.110
 more can make the bike or go very 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.360
 nervous or go very slow and be very 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.340
 heavy at the time of moving 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.639
 I hope that you have been helpful and 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.639
 the next
