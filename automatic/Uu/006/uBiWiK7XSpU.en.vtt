00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.160
 I always say it's that much more. 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.650
 important what you will fail to 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.490
 eat than what you will get 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.370
 put on the blow begins to influence 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.850
 also the other aspects of your life is 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:26.510
 a mind and soul body detox 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.090
 in every act of sitting at the table and eating is 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.800
 an act of conscience is an act of 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.680
 connection 1 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.540
 the near food of the land my name is 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.239
 larger kaline I am chief 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.180
 live feed also 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.530
 known as raw feed or off 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.399
 road as it is known there in the states 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.230
 United a vegetarian diet and 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.390
 where people eat badly 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.899
 fruits brown vegetables and seeds 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.610
 germinated algae and small amount of 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.640
 healthy fats 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.649
 the greatest benefit of all is that a 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.130
 highly detoxifying feed 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.200
 for the reason that she is very rich in 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.760
 enzymes and nutrients by people 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.720
 is feeding the food in 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.450
 natura 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.260
 in the background case we do not cook 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.310
 no ingredient above 42 degrees 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.650
 that way we preserve the enzymes 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.820
 active ingredients already present in 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.070
 seeds in almonds and greens and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.049
 also when we germinate for years 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.250
 seeds and almonds we are 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.560
 activating the live food enzymes and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.540
 that way we 're not wearing out 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.409
 our own enzymes from our 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.299
 body 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.210
 we are receiving the vital energy 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.700
 of food enzymes and enzymes 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.420
 are catalysts of all processes 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.850
 of our body and thus in addition to being 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.850
 detox helps a lot of weight loss is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.009
 revitalizes and maintains the alkaline body 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.409
 in a very difficult alkaline body 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.590
 any disease develops and 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:11.140
 Acid body is where many bacteria and 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.140
 many viruses and many jeremy survive 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.290
 the globe to escape in a concept that I 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.709
 I have developed here in Brazil. 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.439
 is following some of the concepts of 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.260
 gulf a little on the side there the 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:31.799
 doctor who is studying the body 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.560
 individually and do not follow a 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.129
 that a certain line works for 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.129
 everyone 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.739
 the difference between the gulf of raw food and 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.260
 Jan graphic is that I was never a person 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.290
 which feeds 100% of the raw feed 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.019
 this person does not eat anything cooked who 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.930
 100% flame the fury goal I'm crude 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.700
 I live in general they do not cook and they 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.239
 use other techniques to maintain 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.220
 raw food like the fusion I realized that 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.489
 there are certain people who have difficulty 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.760
 in digesting certain sprouted grains 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.430
 very heavy and also gives a break is a 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.680
 people also ate a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.209
 But who had the night I see 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.790
 that at night there are many people who 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.730
 have difficulty reducing the amount of 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.310
 pace then southdown I use more or 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.449
 70 and 80 percent of the food in 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.720
 natura cruz and more or less 30% of 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:35.940
 canoes and other cooked grains and also 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.919
 many many tubers I like 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.269
 also use boiled as sweet potatoes 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.269
 beet in miami 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.290
 I am the boss, and because I have worked with 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.660
 many people individually I think 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.780
 that everyone can benefit as 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.810
 minimum introduction of at least one 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.970
 very colorful salad every day 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.090
 in this case when I say very colorful 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.530
 it is because every color of food in 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.230
 It's natura that we commissioned. 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.030
 different phytonutrients and in this way 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.610
 It's what I always tell people is 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.310
 the rainbow document every day 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.200
 so in this case I suggest every day a 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.320
 salad that this way we are 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.770
 introducing the enzymes of the live food 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:29.050
 and also start the day with the famous juice 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.140
 green juice that is actually the separated juice 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.320
 the fiber of vegetables and greens and 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.780
 in general also apple and in this case the 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.540
 importance of green juice is that how we 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.810
 we are only ingesting the juice already 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.720
 separated from fiber is instant nutrition 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.360
 in our blood in less than 30 minutes 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.610
 the green juice chlorophyll of green juice gives 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.950
 I oxygenate all the cells of the body 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.680
 and there is nothing more revitalizing than 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.530
 than starting the day with this 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.790
 Green juice and that's what I recommend 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.310
 daily who does not have time to do 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.380
 already has many delivery service in sÃ£o 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.170
 paulo and rio de janeiro and it is very 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.480
 easy to find the green juice I drink 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.770
 every day I recommend to 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.140
 Everyone at his base is apple cucumber and 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.900
 and in this case always 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.960
 added two or three vegetables as well 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.300
 dark colors such as cabbage catalonia 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.790
 leaf beet leaves 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.530
 broccoli and that juice to that am I 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.530
 I add ginger and lemon 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.560
 people often find that 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.110
 people are going to feed only on 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.740
 salads and fruit salad raw food 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.020
 no taste in this case the role 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.420
 of the fund manager is very important 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.620
 because we use different techniques of 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:55.720
 preparation of food that simulates an aspect 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.020
 cooked food so I use a lot 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.240
 techniques of marinating food with certain 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.350
 ingredients that give cooked appearance that 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.540
 soften the food and also use 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.050
 very dehydrating and in this case with 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.850
 hydrated d'or where I am 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.130
 dehydrating by removing moisture from food 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.770
 I can heat food in a 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.290
 room temperature I can create 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.080
 crack I can make cookies myself 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.090
 I create cookies in pizza dough then 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.370
 in this way we value pleasure and 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.370
 creativity in raw food 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:37.180
 raw food for me in my eyes and and 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:39.699
 in my opinion it is much more than one 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.280
 diet is more a lifestyle 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:44.530
 you become more aware of the 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.080
 What are you eating and why are you here? 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.440
 feeding on fresh foods 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.319
 you start to have a bigger contact and a 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.789
 major concern was a control in 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.569
 what you are putting on your 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.580
 dish 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.720
 you are approaching the food you 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.090
 you eat 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.190
 so it starts to become a 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.440
 lifestyle because it begins to 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.960
 also influence the other aspects of the 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.569
 your life is a body detox 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.400
 mind and soul is a reconnection with our 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:14.400
 planet through food
