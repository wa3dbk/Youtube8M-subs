00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.259
 dot ru 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.090
 link to it in the description and now 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.100
 I would like to begin to tell you how 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.020
 first to get myself because many 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.640
 really do not know and in this video 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.640
 still such a tutorial will be small 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.360
 sun boy what do you need to get to 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.549
 then myself to start and some myself on 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.619
 rpc server flamp that fly you need 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.350
 First you need to go to the new site and 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.200
 by the way friends on the new site we updated 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.539
 design 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.450
 I will add more abruptly you probably already 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.000
 noticed i like honest before it was 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.909
 not so cool and you need to push something 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.039
 start playing here i'm basically very 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.010
 simple instruction but also operation i 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.560
 I will retell the instructions here, I'm just 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.330
 it says well what is needed 1 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.430
 Need to download gta san andreas 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.010
 and there is a link to the jump for this 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.709
 you only need to download via a 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.329
 sorry pirate bay all matters before 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.780
 then you will need to download it yourself 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.989
 Sambo type client and install it here 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.560
 written project process is more precise installation 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.180
 you need to run it further 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.390
 set it on and on friends further 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.340
 important things you need to download files from ours 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.340
 by datso.fr 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.540
 and replace it with a file to feed on. 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.280
 because of which there is a class in the game for what 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.370
 it needs it needs to be done in order 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.810
 so that you may not have an error 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.760
 you can try running without 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.220
 of this but I at least had 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.220
 I replaced the errors now it became normal 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.410
 work on friends 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.260
 run the file itself when 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.530
 Itself further in the field on they need to specify 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.900
 Your name format is 7 last name 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.910
 accordingly just cream for example but 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.600
 I will have this finder not terk 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.790
 mini chat 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.090
 sometimes in the game you will be in the ender hour 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.370
 no need so pointing so playing here but 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.930
 rather choose another name for yourself so don't 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.300
 worry and preferably friends 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.950
 specify exactly what some well fracturing 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.209
 for example, i don't know james 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.190
 underline bond to name it 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.959
 It looked like a surname next 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.140
 click on the tick button 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.310
 server being added and all friends 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.170
 roughly speaking we can begin 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.709
 run 2 times click click 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.680
 connect 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.830
 we get friends to the server here we have 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.209
 pass a small registration 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.209
 registering is all easy enough 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.239
 quickly her friends after registering we 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.930
 get on the server well that's all friends i 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.060
