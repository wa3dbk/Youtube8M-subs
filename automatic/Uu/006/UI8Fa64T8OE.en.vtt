we're gonna discuss and I'm gonna show

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.410 
we're gonna discuss and I'm gonna show
you<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.890> little<00:00:08.040> bit<00:00:08.160> about<00:00:08.340> our<00:00:08.700> D<00:00:08.940> fic

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
you a little bit about our D fic

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.810 
you a little bit about our D fic
intercooler<00:00:10.160> this<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> first

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
intercooler this is the first

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.850 
intercooler this is the first
intercooler<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.810> the<00:00:12.900> market<00:00:13.350> for<00:00:13.560> the<00:00:13.620> mini

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
intercooler on the market for the mini

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.310 
intercooler on the market for the mini
that<00:00:14.310> changed<00:00:15.300> the<00:00:15.750> way<00:00:16.020> we're<00:00:16.289> thinking

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
that changed the way we're thinking

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.730 
that changed the way we're thinking
about<00:00:16.740> how<00:00:17.039> gonna<00:00:17.550> cool<00:00:18.089> down<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.900> incoming

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
about how gonna cool down the incoming

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.460 
about how gonna cool down the incoming
charger<00:00:20.519> up<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.269> point<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.839> where<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.079> had

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
charger up to the point of where we had

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.489 
charger up to the point of where we had
this<00:00:22.740> unit<00:00:23.640> coming<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.599> the<00:00:24.689> market<00:00:25.169> all<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499 
this unit coming on the market all the

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.700 
this unit coming on the market all the
intercoolers<00:00:26.429> basically<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.659> a<00:00:27.689> an<00:00:28.289> air

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
intercoolers basically have a an air

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.370 
intercoolers basically have a an air
path<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.609> vertical<00:00:29.999> and<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.140> mean

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
path that was vertical and what I mean

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
path that was vertical and what I mean
with<00:00:31.499> that<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.739> that<00:00:32.220> if<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.520> look<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:32.970> your

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
with that is that if you look at your

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
with that is that if you look at your
stock<00:00:33.810> intercooler<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:34.949> how<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.160> air

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
stock intercooler you see how the air

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.630 
stock intercooler you see how the air
comes<00:00:35.670> through<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.059> scoop<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.680> turns<00:00:38.039> 90

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
comes through the scoop it turns 90

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.580 
comes through the scoop it turns 90
degrees<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.510> goes<00:00:39.660> through<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> core<00:00:40.260> not

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
degrees and it goes through the core not

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.349 
degrees and it goes through the core not
a<00:00:40.620> problem<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.550> course<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:42.359 
a problem with that of course is that

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.599 
a problem with that of course is that
anytime<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.949> air<00:00:44.190> turns<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.239> slows<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:46.609> you

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
anytime the air turns it slows down you

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.029 
anytime the air turns it slows down you
get<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> lot<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.269> issues<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:49.230> turbulent<00:00:49.530> air

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
get a lot of issues with turbulent air

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.110 
get a lot of issues with turbulent air
in<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> throat<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.719> their<00:00:51.870> scoop<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
in the throat of the of their scoop and

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.040 
in the throat of the of their scoop and
all<00:00:54.120> those<00:00:54.859> dynamics<00:00:55.859> will<00:00:56.429> actually<00:00:57.420> slow

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
all those dynamics will actually slow

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.419 
all those dynamics will actually slow
down<00:00:58.079> and/or<00:00:59.839> minimize<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:01.350> cooling<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
down and/or minimize the cooling of the

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.899 
down and/or minimize the cooling of the
intercooler<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.839> can<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:05.280> air<00:01:05.489> path

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
intercooler as you can see the air path

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.260 
intercooler as you can see the air path
is<00:01:06.530> horizontal<00:01:07.530> through<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.100> core<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.119> air

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
is horizontal through the core the air

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
is horizontal through the core the air
will<00:01:09.450> come<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.829> straight<00:01:10.829> in<00:01:11.009> from<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430

the air to cool when it's going through
the<00:01:36.390> air<00:01:36.420> passages<00:01:37.640> now<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.700> other<00:01:38.939> thing

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
the air passages now the other thing

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.959 
the air passages now the other thing
that<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.479> did<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.890> lot<00:01:41.399> of<00:01:41.460> people<00:01:41.880> are

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
that we did that a lot of people are

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.580 
that we did that a lot of people are
appreciating<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:43.200> under<00:01:43.439> these
