00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
then we're going to talk about what we

00:00:30.160 --> 00:01:31.469 
then we're going to talk about what we
think<00:00:30.190> so<00:00:30.550> give<00:00:31.270> it<00:00:31.360> a<00:00:31.390> little<00:00:31.510> world

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.249 

it's<00:01:32.479> kind<00:01:32.719> of<00:01:32.780> quiet<00:01:32.960> at<00:01:33.549> the<00:01:34.549> base<00:01:34.789> I<00:01:35.299> think

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
it's kind of quiet at the base I think

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.990 
it's kind of quiet at the base I think
it<00:01:36.380> needs<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.710> be<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:36.829> little<00:01:37.130> richer<00:01:40.000> the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
it needs to be a little richer the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.020 
it needs to be a little richer the
feeling<00:01:41.539> is<00:01:41.869> actually<00:01:42.619> very<00:01:42.649> light<00:01:43.369> weighted

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
feeling is actually very light weighted

00:01:44.030 --> 00:02:24.280 
feeling is actually very light weighted
and<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:46.360> feels<00:01:47.360> really<00:01:47.539> nice

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.420 

that's<00:02:25.290> what<00:02:25.409> it's<00:02:25.620> real<00:02:25.769> buttery<00:02:26.069> it's<00:02:26.280> very

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
that's what it's real buttery it's very

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.429 
that's what it's real buttery it's very
smooth<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.000> doesn't<00:02:27.299> jump<00:02:27.510> out<00:02:27.659> it's<00:02:27.930> not<00:02:28.079> it's

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
smooth it doesn't jump out it's not it's

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.720 
smooth it doesn't jump out it's not it's
not<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.590> going<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> hammer<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.430> over<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
not like going to hammer you over the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.509 
not like going to hammer you over the
head<00:02:30.109> sounds<00:02:31.109> like<00:02:31.170> it'd<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.379> good<00:02:31.799> for<00:02:31.859> pretty

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519
