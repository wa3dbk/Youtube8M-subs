00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 and Matthew flights from car 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.430
 market and good the one that would be by 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.230
 seemingly throwing 2012 are going to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.510
 throwing that is what they say the most 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.010
 economic activity in Argentina where 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.769
 Most flights are started from 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.719
 close to 50 thousand pesos or above is 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.060
 this car that was seen in puerto madero 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.400
 is very small in hatred practically 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.949
 It has no trunk and is manufactured by this 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 traditional brand of motorcycles next to a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.660
 Chinese company but look at you is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.160
 very small is a very small car this one 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.219
 is specifically the model that was 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.380
 seen in puerto madero how much would 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.870
 there are some peculiarities for 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.570
 example has a front wheel and two 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 back , which I think is not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 the best scheme for streets that do not 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.850
 they are all right, but I was good 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.719
 by puerto madero there the streets are 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 more or less well has four doors 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.930
 curious for a car so small that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.780
 have four doors and it is estimated that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.600
 in 2012 to launch and that would cost 25 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.520
 thousand pesos the truth is a very 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.320
 achievable for many pockets and wins 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.600
 25 thousand pesos is usually the price one 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.790
 motorcycle for example there are no cheaper to 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.420
 motorcycles below 10 thousand pesos 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.030
 50,000 60,000 70,000 dollars but 25 thousand 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.790
 pesos per car is very cheap some 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.790
 comparisons for example with which 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.370
 compares good if it's by segment with the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.350
 tata nano from india were sold 70 thousand 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.930
 units was launched in 2008 and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.820
 it costs 2 thousand 700 dollars until each 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.810
 part that one would say interesting but 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.850
 70 thousand units in india is little which 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.350
 There are those who say that it is a car that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.960
 It has some problems 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.390
 important and that does not go well 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.910
 but of course it has a very low price no 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.400
 this 2 thousand 700 dollars are more or less 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.410
 about 12 thousand 13 thousand pesos would be half 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.420
 of the cheapest car in Argentina and 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.670
 well I to illustrate this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.759
 the plate chose a cutest photo of the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.250
 smart you can see the argentina I've seen 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.990
 several smart on the street and not only not 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.150
 only in high-income neighborhoods 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.750
 but in all smart federal capital in 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:07.040
 Argentina we have spoken the price is very 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.040
 striking and if you guys auto 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.150
 but whatever happens does not happen here 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.940
 the more europe is more what you have 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.560
 what a wonderful little boy in town 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.800
 spectacular has a great benefit 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.270
 of very little consumption but it is cheap clear 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.320
 I do not know what is present as soon as he has 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.150
 be for the 15 thousand dollars 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.400
 approximately in europe nor the car 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.700
 It is the first single bachelor car and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.450
 It is also very special for people 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.550
 that does not know how to park 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.590
 so you can put it anywhere 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.140
 you can put it anywhere but 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.230
 the end of the day when you leave argentina 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.510
 24,900 the cheapest and 26,900 the most 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.100
 expensive we say cousin rich poor cousin 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.720
 making a kind of joke because 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.060
 yellow well what is it really if 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.530
 one compares by car the most 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.510
 cheap that would occur in argentina 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.550
 competitiveness with the top one not with 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.680
 the one below but this one is not sold here 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.770
 the argentina tata nano does not sell the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.820
 Argentina yes good in India of course 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.350
 in other countries 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.900
 some comparison what are the most 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.150
 today to buy against the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.910
 25 thousand pesos that the zanella city would leave 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.580
 look you are a fiat one of 41,800 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.620
 this one is going goes away one goes away 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.330
 but of course it is a more expensive 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.330
 chevrolet class that is kind of 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.660
 thing with our name 48,800 and a 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.420
 volkswagen goal from 43 500 opponent now 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.310
 that when you see this price and quality 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.080
 Maybe the goal is a very good option 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.540
 when you have a hundred of course it is the 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.640
 base and to compare with motorcycles that 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.770
 also because you have to also enter 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.750
 because we think with our heads to 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.490
 Who lives in Buenos Aires, but there is no 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.870
 people who either cities of 10,000 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.850
 20,000 30,000 50 thousand 100 thousand inhabitants 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.070
 where those cities are 50 blocks from 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.350
 width and 60 blocks long for example 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.290
 it makes sense to have a small car is 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.910
 almost the substitute of a motorcycle this no no 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.860
 it's like here that you have to go forever 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.650
 great distances even for that 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.500
 we will work every morning notice 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.350
 you motorcycles for example a 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.820
 custom race comes out 26 thousand 500 pesos and 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.190
 a good principle zanella is the 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.769
 curiosity not like the same factory makes 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.519
 to produce a tricycle that comes out 25 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.930
 thousand pesos and a car that would leave 25 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.880
 thousand pesos good speculation is coming 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.920
 a lot about these economic models 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.280
 Argentina there is another project of a 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.430
 company called bravo bravo engine 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.560
 company or something like that what I say 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.150
 it's a very good idea it's always 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.630
 interesting that there is a first car for 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.800
 comfortable and fabian as is the first one 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.460
 check them some of his trip to 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.230
 students clear exactly is always 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.810
 a bigger idea but Argentina does not 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.760
 ends to be specified I say for now 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.320
 Well, I hope that some time it arrives 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.420
 at least the site is announced for the 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.740
 2012 for the second half of the year and 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.740
 it would cost 25 thousand pesos
