very<00:02:04.829> very<00:02:05.130> simple<00:02:05.899> I'm<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:06.960> gonna<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.469> ahead

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
very very simple I'm just gonna go ahead

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.290 
very very simple I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:02:07.680> speed<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.160> up<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:09.030> kind<00:02:09.239> of

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and speed this up because it's kind of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:18.309 
and speed this up because it's kind of
boring

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.110 

so<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.379> want<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.739> go<00:02:19.980> ahead<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.459> keep<00:02:20.640> an<00:02:20.849> eye

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
so you want to go ahead and keep an eye

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.360 
so you want to go ahead and keep an eye
on<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.720> how<00:02:22.110> long<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.860> bracelets<00:02:23.250> getting

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
on like how long the bracelets getting

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.500 
on like how long the bracelets getting
and<00:02:23.849> once<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.480> get<00:02:24.629> about<00:02:24.810> halfway<00:02:26.239> like<00:02:27.239> once

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
and once you get about halfway like once

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.809 
and once you get about halfway like once
the<00:02:27.659> length<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.079> half<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.709> how<00:02:29.220> long<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.640> want

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
the length is half of how long you want

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.850 
the length is half of how long you want
it<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.060> be<00:02:30.180> then<00:02:30.840> that's<00:02:31.200> when<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.560> put<00:02:31.769> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
it to be then that's when you put the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.309 
it to be then that's when you put the
charm<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.340> which<00:02:32.879> would<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.269> three<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.170> half

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
charm on which would be three and a half

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.670 
charm on which would be three and a half
inches<00:02:34.680> for<00:02:34.920> most<00:02:34.950> bracelets<00:02:36.260> okay<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.319> once

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
inches for most bracelets okay so once

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.380 
inches for most bracelets okay so once
you<00:02:37.769> put<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> charm<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.940> want<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.269> go

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you put the charm on you just want to go

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.330 
you put the charm on you just want to go
ahead<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.690> keep<00:02:40.409> putting<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.010> rest<00:02:41.129> of<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
ahead and keep putting the rest of the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:54.289 
ahead and keep putting the rest of the
beads<00:02:41.549> on<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.569> yeah

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.210 

so<00:02:55.299> once<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.569> have<00:02:55.720> beat<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.170> on<00:02:56.319> Ian<00:02:56.799> alpha

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
so once you have beat it on Ian alpha

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.710 
so once you have beat it on Ian alpha
beads<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:58.379> reach<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.769> desired<00:03:00.310> length<00:03:00.970> you

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
beads to reach the desired length you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.160 
beads to reach the desired length you
can<00:03:01.900> go<00:03:02.170> ahead<00:03:02.349> and<00:03:02.980> take<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.150> clip<00:03:04.629> off<00:03:04.870> if

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
can go ahead and take the clip off if

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.680 
can go ahead and take the clip off if
you<00:03:05.409> are<00:03:05.440> using<00:03:05.890> line<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:07.150> want<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.480> go

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
you are using line and you want to go

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.990 
you are using line and you want to go
ahead<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:07.930> like<00:03:08.170> kind<00:03:08.409> of<00:03:08.440> push<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.700> beads

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
ahead and like kind of push the beads

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.330 
ahead and like kind of push the beads
towards<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.780> middle<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.440> string<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.129> that

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
towards the middle of the string so that

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.490 
towards the middle of the string so that
there's<00:03:12.640> an<00:03:13.150> equal<00:03:13.480> amount<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.840> string<00:03:14.230> on

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
there's an equal amount of string on

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.530 
there's an equal amount of string on
both<00:03:14.890> sides<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:18.430> we're<00:03:19.000> going<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.209> go<00:03:19.390> ahead

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
both sides so we're going to go ahead

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.800 
both sides so we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:20.079> start<00:03:20.530> tying<00:03:20.890> it<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.670> first<00:03:21.909> you<00:03:22.209> want<00:03:22.420> to

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
and start tying it the first you want to

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.930 
and start tying it the first you want to
go<00:03:23.170> ahead<00:03:23.319> and<00:03:23.650> kind<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.069> get<00:03:24.220> your<00:03:24.310> super<00:03:24.730> glue

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
go ahead and kind of get your super glue

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.030 
go ahead and kind of get your super glue
or<00:03:25.269> crazy<00:03:25.569> glue<00:03:25.930> out<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:29.140> just<00:03:29.590> go<00:03:29.769> ahead<00:03:29.859> and

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
or crazy glue out and just go ahead and

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.979 
or crazy glue out and just go ahead and
put<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.430> side<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:31.500> you're<00:03:32.500> going<00:03:32.920> to

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
put it to the side so you're going to

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:41.760 
put it to the side so you're going to
tie<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.410> knot

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:48.300 

really<00:03:42.580> tightly<00:03:46.620> I'm<00:03:47.620> gonna<00:03:47.890> try<00:03:48.100> on<00:03:48.280> another

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
really tightly I'm gonna try on another

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.000 
really tightly I'm gonna try on another
not<00:03:48.880> really<00:03:49.240> tightly<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:50.140> very<00:03:50.530> important

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
not really tightly and very important

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.160 
not really tightly and very important
that<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.250> tie<00:03:51.640> it<00:03:51.700> tightly<00:03:52.180> because<00:03:52.540> if<00:03:52.990> not

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
that you tie it tightly because if not

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.130 
that you tie it tightly because if not
the<00:03:53.860> elasticity<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:55.150> string<00:03:55.690> will<00:03:55.990> make

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
the elasticity of the string will make

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.010 
the elasticity of the string will make
it<00:03:56.320> kind<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.590> pop<00:03:56.920> out<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.790> knot<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.930> it

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
it kind of pop out of the knot and it

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:06.510 
it kind of pop out of the knot and it
gets<00:03:59.170> kind<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.500> annoying<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:06.160> for<00:04:06.340> extra

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
gets kind of annoying so for extra

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.220 
gets kind of annoying so for extra
reinforcement<00:04:06.820> we're<00:04:07.450> just<00:04:07.630> going<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.870> kind

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
reinforcement we're just going to kind

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.060 
reinforcement we're just going to kind
of<00:04:08.320> like<00:04:08.590> put<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.370> dab<00:04:10.120> of<00:04:10.570> superglue<00:04:11.230> or<00:04:11.860> crazy

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
of like put a dab of superglue or crazy

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.750 
of like put a dab of superglue or crazy
glue<00:04:12.310> line<00:04:12.520> and<00:04:14.280> make<00:04:15.280> sure<00:04:15.400> it's<00:04:15.550> kind<00:04:15.730> of

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
glue line and make sure it's kind of

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.789 
glue line and make sure it's kind of
like<00:04:15.910> all<00:04:16.180> around<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.930> knot<00:04:17.080> to<00:04:17.290> seal<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.680> in

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
like all around the knot to seal it in

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.870 
like all around the knot to seal it in
and<00:04:18.760> then<00:04:19.630> you're<00:04:20.170> just<00:04:20.530> going<00:04:20.860> to<00:04:20.890> let<00:04:21.850> that

and then you're just going to let that

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.120 
and then you're just going to let that
dry<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.210> little<00:04:22.390> bit<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:22.630> then<00:04:22.900> tie<00:04:23.560> another

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
dry a little bit and then tie another
