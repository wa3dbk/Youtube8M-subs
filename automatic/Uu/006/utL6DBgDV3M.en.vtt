now<00:00:17.359> we<00:00:18.359> try<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> get<00:00:18.840> slowed<00:00:19.080> down<00:00:19.289> enough

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529

since<00:00:25.490> I've<00:00:25.640> been<00:00:25.670> here<00:00:26.030> in<00:00:26.150> 86<00:00:26.980> they've

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
since I've been here in 86 they've

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.680 
since I've been here in 86 they've
changed<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.490> numbers<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.090> i<00:00:29.120> might<00:00:29.390> not<00:00:29.510> be

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
changed the numbers so i might not be

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.820 
changed the numbers so i might not be
right<00:00:29.960> all<00:00:30.140> them

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
right all them

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.070 
right all them
but<00:00:31.010> now<00:00:31.340> we're<00:00:31.670> probably<00:00:31.940> up<00:00:32.210> in<00:00:32.480> third<00:00:32.780> gear

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
but now we're probably up in third gear

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.970 
but now we're probably up in third gear
at<00:00:33.980> a<00:00:34.940> fairly<00:00:35.900> good<00:00:36.140> page<00:00:36.380> here's<00:00:36.680> where<00:00:36.860> you

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
at a fairly good page here's where you

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.420 
at a fairly good page here's where you
need<00:00:37.160> some<00:00:37.400> really<00:00:37.670> good<00:00:37.790> bricks<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.890> I<00:00:39.890> think

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
need some really good bricks and I think

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.240 
need some really good bricks and I think
we're<00:00:40.640> going<00:00:40.760> around<00:00:41.000> four<00:00:41.330> and<00:00:42.010> pretty<00:00:43.010> quick

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
we're going around four and pretty quick

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.189 
we're going around four and pretty quick

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
for it by all of a sudden you got to

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.810 
for it by all of a sudden you got to
slow<00:00:48.379> down<00:00:48.559> use<00:00:48.830> some<00:00:49.040> more<00:00:49.190> break<00:00:49.520> right<00:00:49.790> here

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
slow down use some more break right here

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.380 
slow down use some more break right here
to<00:00:50.300> get<00:00:50.449> into<00:00:50.780> this<00:00:50.930> corner<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:52.519> then<00:00:53.059> we're

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
to get into this corner and then we're

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.670 
to get into this corner and then we're
heading<00:00:54.160> up<00:00:55.160> here<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:56.320> this<00:00:57.320> is<00:00:57.379> a<00:00:57.559> good

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
heading up here and this is a good

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.070 
heading up here and this is a good
passing<00:00:58.430> point<00:00:58.640> after<00:00:59.000> you<00:00:59.239> get<00:00:59.420> through<00:00:59.449> here

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
passing point after you get through here

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.180 
passing point after you get through here
if<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.710> can<00:01:00.860> keep<00:01:01.040> your<00:01:01.220> car<00:01:01.460> in<00:01:01.489> tight<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:03.190> be

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
if you can keep your car in tight to be

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.670 
if you can keep your car in tight to be
swinging<00:01:04.640> out<00:01:04.760> wide<00:01:05.120> and<00:01:05.449> we've<00:01:06.170> got<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.409> new

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
swinging out wide and we've got a new

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.750 
swinging out wide and we've got a new
corner<00:01:07.130> down<00:01:07.310> here<00:01:07.340> that's<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.200> pretty<00:01:09.200> wide

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
corner down here that's a pretty wide

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.430 
corner down here that's a pretty wide
good<00:01:10.760> passing<00:01:11.270> point<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.659> get<00:01:11.810> up<00:01:11.900> lungs<00:01:12.170> up

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
good passing point to get up lungs up

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.899 
good passing point to get up lungs up
side<00:01:12.890> somebody<00:01:14.860> this<00:01:15.860> car<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:16.310> not<00:01:16.490> too<00:01:16.700> good

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
side somebody this car is not too good

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.140 
side somebody this car is not too good
at<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.150> corners<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.310> now<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.729> is<00:01:19.970> really

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
at the corners and now this is really

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.940 
at the corners and now this is really
starting<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.990> straightaway<00:01:21.440> I<00:01:21.650> think

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
starting to the straightaway I think

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.789 
starting to the straightaway I think
we're<00:01:22.130> at<00:01:22.330> seven<00:01:23.330> now<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:24.409> can<00:01:24.560> start

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
we're at seven now and you can start

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.570 
we're at seven now and you can start
really<00:01:25.340> go<00:01:25.580> on<00:01:25.760> cutting<00:01:26.540> across

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
really go on cutting across

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.400 
really go on cutting across
this<00:01:28.120> is<00:01:28.330> longer<00:01:28.690> than<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.870> front<00:01:29.140> shoot

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
this is longer than the front shoot

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.890 
this is longer than the front shoot
because<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:29.920> got<00:01:30.070> a<00:01:30.100> good<00:01:30.400> start<00:01:30.790> on<00:01:30.940> it<00:01:31.090> and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
because you got a good start on it and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.750 
because you got a good start on it and
right<00:01:32.230> around<00:01:32.350> here<00:01:32.770> you're<00:01:32.980> you<00:01:33.460> get<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
right around here you're you get the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.570 
right around here you're you get the
movement<00:01:33.910> you're<00:01:34.270> probably<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:35.500> would<00:01:36.430> say

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
movement you're probably I would say

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.050 
movement you're probably I would say
probably<00:01:37.710> 150<00:01:38.710> mile<00:01:39.100> an<00:01:39.130> hour<00:01:39.370> before<00:01:39.790> we<00:01:39.910> get

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
probably 150 mile an hour before we get

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.390 
probably 150 mile an hour before we get
down<00:01:40.120> there

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
down there

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.240 
down there
and<00:01:41.550> about<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.330> though

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
and about here though

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.790 
and about here though
400<00:01:43.970> or<00:01:44.120> the<00:01:44.210> 300<00:01:44.750> mark<00:01:44.780> you've<00:01:45.230> really<00:01:45.590> got<00:01:45.770> to

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
400 or the 300 mark you've really got to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.640 
400 or the 300 mark you've really got to
start<00:01:46.130> an<00:01:46.220> anchor<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.550> down<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.500> kind<00:01:48.500> of

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
start an anchor and down and kind of

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.130 
start an anchor and down and kind of
jumped<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:48.980> curb<00:01:49.250> over<00:01:49.640> here<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.510> then<00:01:50.570> you

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
jumped the curb over here and then you

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.380 
jumped the curb over here and then you
jump<00:01:51.410> another<00:01:51.770> curve<00:01:52.100> on<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.270> side<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:55.390> you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
jump another curve on this side and you

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.540 
jump another curve on this side and you
can<00:01:56.510> barely<00:01:56.810> stay<00:01:57.229> off<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.650> grass<00:01:57.860> here<00:01:58.340> and

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
can barely stay off the grass here and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.300 
can barely stay off the grass here and
then<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:58.940> really<00:01:59.300> want<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.570> get<00:02:00.010> come<00:02:01.010> out<00:02:01.160> of

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
then you really want to get come out of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.230 
then you really want to get come out of
this<00:02:01.430> corner<00:02:01.820> good<00:02:02.030> over<00:02:02.660> to<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.020> wall<00:02:03.200> and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
this corner good over to the wall and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.180 
this corner good over to the wall and
now<00:02:05.240> you're<00:02:05.450> full<00:02:05.780> all<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.470> way<00:02:06.650> down<00:02:06.950> the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
now you're full all the way down the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.730 
now you're full all the way down the
straightaway

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.290 

you<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:13.070> know<00:02:14.070> where<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.460> get<00:02:14.610> stopped<00:02:14.970> down
