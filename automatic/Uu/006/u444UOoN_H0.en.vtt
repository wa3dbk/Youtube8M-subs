wavelength<00:05:26.410> as<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.730> q50<00:05:28.830> no<00:05:30.060> do<00:05:31.060> I<00:05:31.120> want<00:05:31.180> one

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820

wavelength as the q50 no do I want one
let<00:05:33.820> me<00:05:33.850> have<00:05:34.060> one<00:05:34.270> more<00:05:34.540> go<00:05:35.160> with<00:05:36.160> that<00:05:36.310> v6<00:05:36.820> and

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
let me have one more go with that v6 and

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.120 
let me have one more go with that v6 and
there

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
there

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.940
