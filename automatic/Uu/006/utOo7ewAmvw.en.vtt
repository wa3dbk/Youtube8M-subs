00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.390
 Greetings and hammering for all 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.120
 Titan hammers again in the world 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.040
 minecraft I have a different world to 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.830
 bring you a kind of death long ago that 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.470
 I did not share with you this is a 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.689
 map generator called animated 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.570
 the rain have a good listener as you are 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.840
 seeing I have a mountain behind me 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.960
 huge there is a surprising gap and 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.270
 good here surrounded surrounded by animals and 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.690
 surrounded by flowers wall with heidi let's go 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.569
 to fly us and fix or some 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.089
 of the things he does so that what 

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:41.649
 does it modify us the code of the 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.579
 generation of minecraft maps by 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.530
 defect and they set here the lake so cool 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.010
 and so incredible that there are 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.260
 mountains here in this valley the mountains 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.260
 that I have here behind of course 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.809
 snowfall at the top and I've 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.600
 brought this way and not another as per 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.089
 example could be saw better plenty or 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.610
 biomes xl also better world ' 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.000
 generator of which I have already reviewed 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.500
 long time 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.900
 and that if you want I will not leave them the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.810
 description for your interest also and 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.450
 as I say I've done a review of this what 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.570
 I have chosen because more than focusing on 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.870
 generate much more biomass add biomes 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.290
 what it does is modify us the 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.380
 normal minecraft with the code with a 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.200
 new code to do it much more 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.750
 different with a different topology already 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.180
 You see that everything is full, for example, 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.110
 streams create churros falling down 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.110
 mountains and as I say it focuses on 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.509
 everything in that for example in the mountains 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.060
 Obviously higher is everything 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.520
 full of snow the area let's say you are 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.899
 Near the sea they usually have languages 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.850
 warm 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.960
 while in the interior inter areas 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.479
 usually have cold biomes or dry biomes 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.570
 and now here we have for example another 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.660
 riachuelo the truth that is very beautiful 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.729
 all areas of the coasts and all 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.350
 the edges are all very smooth 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.200
 there are also incredible mountains 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.750
 As you can see here we have another area 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.750
 also age and also note here the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.310
 amount of water that is here falling 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.060
 that we're going to continue here for the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.030
 area of â€‹â€‹the coast so you can see the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.210
 edges of the beaches and others that like 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.630
 I am very careful, it is very nice 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.700
 they set to look at this area this is why 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.740
 example an added that is not 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.810
 obviously in the normal mangrove is a few 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.810
 zones and rocky with different types of 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.590
 rocks like that has gravel has stone 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.050
 It has clay but it is not the biome 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.570
 but it is another different because there 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.210
 areas of the mountains that obviously 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.940
 see the rocky areas here for example 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.910
 we have the flower biome set everything 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.470
 full of flowers and if you look at the biome 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.110
 of flowers then on a mountain in a 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.970
 hill and I will go teaching too 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.400
 other biomes so you can see how they are 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.450
 here we have for example as I what 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.540
 I call a dark forest 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.209
 in the forest with the oaks that are 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.540
 four trunks together I said is 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.720
 practically super dense in fact I think 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.629
 which is even denser than that of the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.540
 normal minecraft and fix for example 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.120
 this area here with a small lagoon 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.239
 inside the river going down from here 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.569
 up the truth that is very cool and 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:45.080
 here a desert area with mountains 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.930
 included that in the desert I also 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.890
 fixed that add some sources of 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.890
 water also extra and as I say then 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.230
 I'll leave it in the description 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.110
 for your worlds keep in mind that 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.020
 yes that these types of mods sometimes have 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.910
 problems with mods what 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.200
 what generates 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.770
 creatures and others that were still creatures 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.230
 in the world so before deciding to 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.060
 use it I recommend you to do tests 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.160
 to check that he is not going to have 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.890
 no problem and that fabian 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.410
 correctly in all biomes or at 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.170
 less in a good part of them for 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.540
 that you can play as you do 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.250
 we usually go with the installation 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.620
 as always I recommend making a 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.120
 clean installation from scratch so 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.210
 we're going to app data percentage 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.039
 percentage 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.729
 and the continuum of the minecraft folder 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.889
 well we move it to another folder another route 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.759
 or else we change the name to the 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:51.020
 folder to do the installation in a 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:54.560
 that was pointed minecraft clean and empty 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.780
 the next thing will be to run the launcher 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.550
 We need the profile to select 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.980
 the version that we are going to install 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.660
 I was before at 172 so why 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.090
 example I will teach now with the 164 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.580
 but you are going to see what exactly 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.070
 same we give to 6 we give the button 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.300
 play and we install all the files 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.880
 needed then the game opens 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.550
 and we close it now let's install 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.350
 forge in the event that 172 were 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.980
 1060 being the 164 the 965 we extract it 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.890
 here 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.580
 and we give you right click to open with java 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.439
 platform 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.689
 the installation path is that of 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:37.990
 default either the malice prize launcher 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:40.950
 that lvp so we give it to accept 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.890
 we install the forks files 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.880
 we give him to accept again and now 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.920
 we run the launcher again 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.960
 to select the new profile of 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.690
 force 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.780
 we check here in edit profile that 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.960
 is 1 649 65 or the one 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.990
 correspond we give the play button and 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.330
 return to open the game again 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.210
 then we close it and now we are going to 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.110
 leave the mode here we have alternate the 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.539
 rain generator for 164 and for 272 as 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.979
 you see are hard files when I upload it 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.340
 the links will have the description 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:21.560
 when I upload it, I'm going to compress it and 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.070
 you decompress and you take 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:29.480
 directly the hard we go here another 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:33.700
 time to percentage to pepe data percentage 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.700
 minecraft mods and we paste it 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.600
 we would have the game again and here what 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.610
 you have here are the defaults and here 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.210
 is the mold of alternate the rain 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:48.180
 generator to knit to make a new 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.940
 map we would have a single player create a 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.970
 new map we give you more options and 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.550
 here in the kind of world we will have to 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.730
 select this walk type a tg 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.139
 alternate we should accept if we want 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.230
 put now we can put here a 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:06.110
 seed and then also in that apart 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.250
 from here you can change the mode of 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.160
 map if we want to be creative 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.530
 survival or whatever it is that is going to 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.720
 give no problem if you liked 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.640
