 we're going to need now let's go to the most 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.090
 easy preparation 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.970
 the first step is to dilute in 750 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.410
 milliliters of water boiling the envelope of 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.410
 powder to prepare gelatin 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.220
 the next step is very simple what 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.930
 only that we are going to place in our 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.740
 blender is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.930
 the gelatin already prepared 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.570
 all the butter 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.660
 condensed milk should be clarified that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.500
 out condensed milk you go 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.720
 putting to the optional taste also you 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.630
 we can put a little bit of juice 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.330
 syrup this is optional liquefy and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.100
 we return in a jelly mold or 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.500
 in which you have in house what 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.900
 let's make it really simple let's 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.490
 grease all our mold so that it does not 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.070
 stick our gelatin the moment of 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:02.240
 Then, what we have 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.240
 We are going to put it in the mold 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.440
 this is optional if you want to put 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.630
 pieces of pineapple or fruit that you 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.069
 more you like you can place the truth 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.480
 I'm putting pieces of pineapple 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.150
 because I find it interesting that at 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.430
 time to bite him perceive those 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.500
 pieces of fruit 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.870
 this we are going to take to the refrigerator 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.579
 for about two or three hours until the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.129
 we are going to be checking 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.590
 depending on your refrigerator once 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.920
 that is curdled let's unmold and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.920
 ready 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.690
 once disassembled we have left this 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.970
 way the truth that remains in two layers 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.560
 the layer below from milk and the part 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.990
 from above that is the gelatin of had 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.570
 transparent and we can see it there 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.540
 but you can clearly see the 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.150
 squares of the pineapple in syrup so 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.710

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.150
