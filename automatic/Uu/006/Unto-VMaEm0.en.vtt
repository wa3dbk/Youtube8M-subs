00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.940
 In this country even harvest bananas this thought fascinates many 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.600
 People north of the Alps 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.079
 Bananas are not just because of their fruits 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.399
 but especially thanks to its pretty leaves very decorative 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.949
 In the following we would like to give you some banana variations from the 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.949
 Imagine assortment of Flower Tuscany 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.130
 Here a Japanese fiber banana shows off its attractive flowers and fruit 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.869
 was standing 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.499
 the fruits are quite by themselves and tasty 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.220
 but contain many large nuclei 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.300
 That's why they are first and foremost an optical pleasure 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.270
 Father bananas can tolerate severe frost and can last forever with winter protection 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.270
 be planted in the garden 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.810
 The same applies to the victory in bananas whose leaves are more or less many 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.310
 some red spots are also common green 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.850
 In the autumn one piles out at Maxim clear the trunks 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.450
 buffed hoc with leaves that stepped from a rabbit and held four posts 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.180
 becomes 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.250
 Golden Lotus bananas were already considered extinct before being given theirs 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.230
 Chinese homeland discovered some remnants and in the twentieth century 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.360
 took in culture 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.360
 the windproof Blatter 10 with a pretty blue silvery mold 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.010
 overdrawn 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.060
 a bay are the inflorescences that bloom for nine months 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 right nine months does not belong to weeks 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.420
 also to the ornamental bananas CLG types Motherwell and Tina and must also Notter 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.060
 they carry much narrower leaves and stems than those previously presented 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.110
 Species and thereby appear very creative 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.110
 her attractive pink or red inflorescences 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.960
 They develop very early in the age of two to four years in 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 the summer months 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.690
 for a hefty extra protection driver already on the ornamental banana Maori too 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.020
 I have never called her protection of her "Nana" 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.359
 their leaves show an intense mix of red and green in one piece 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.899
 Tropical feeling in your living room or in the conservatory brings 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.709
 The bananas should be exactly what the fruits are in Cavendish 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.719
 Grocery for example, as the kicker bananas can buy the 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.109
 Leaves are large and green and make strong with their place styles 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.019
 Strains from those in our climate averaged five to five years 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.019
 seven years to reach the cool and fruit ripeness 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.919
 We hope you have our little tour through the world of bananas
