00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
missed a lot of opportunities of scoring

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.950 
missed a lot of opportunities of scoring
and<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:11.040> shouldn't<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.939> when<00:01:12.479> you're

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and you shouldn't do that when you're

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
and you shouldn't do that when you're
playing<00:01:13.320> home<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.340> should<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.700> really

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
playing home you should be really

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.260 
playing home you should be really
careful<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:16.580> Monica<00:01:17.580> scored<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> first

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
careful because Monica scored the first

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.450 
careful because Monica scored the first
goal<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.020> after<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.799> should<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:20.189> really

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
goal and after that you should be really

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.359 
goal and after that you should be really
careful<00:01:20.610> how<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> attack<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.509> opened<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.409> so

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
careful how to attack and opened up so

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.789 
careful how to attack and opened up so
badly<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:25.380> will<00:01:25.560> talk

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
badly so I think that we will talk

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.980 
badly so I think that we will talk
another<00:01:25.950> game<00:01:26.759> about<00:01:27.060> another<00:01:27.360> gaming<00:01:27.750> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
another game about another gaming this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.109 
another game about another gaming this
one<00:01:28.200> yeah<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> expecting<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
one yeah what are you expecting on the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.760 
one yeah what are you expecting on the
pitch<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.450> time<00:01:30.689> around<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.439> Arsenal

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
pitch this time around can Arsenal

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.569 
pitch this time around can Arsenal
overturned<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.909> 3-1<00:01:33.299> deficit<00:01:34.130> after<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
overturned a 3-1 deficit after the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.280 
overturned a 3-1 deficit after the
result<00:01:35.939> from<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:36.509> match<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.170> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
result from the first match I think that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
result from the first match I think that
Arsenal<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.920> thinking<00:01:38.310> only<00:01:38.460> about<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
Arsenal is thinking only about the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.569 
Arsenal is thinking only about the
revenge<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> second<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:41.009> won<00:01:41.250> four

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
revenge for the second one they won four

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.190 
revenge for the second one they won four
consecutive<00:01:41.759> games<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.899> know<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
consecutive games you know the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.260 
consecutive games you know the
competition<00:01:43.860> scoring<00:01:44.250> at<00:01:44.430> least<00:01:44.460> two<00:01:45.030> times

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
competition scoring at least two times

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.080 
competition scoring at least two times
in<00:01:45.869> every<00:01:46.259> match<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> attack<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.670> very

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
in every match so the attack is very

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.600 
in every match so the attack is very
solid<00:01:48.570> from<00:01:48.810> my<00:01:48.960> point<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.380> view<00:01:49.549> they<00:01:50.549> were

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
solid from my point of view they were

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.899 
solid from my point of view they were
going<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.450> France<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.320> qualify<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.159> they

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
going in France to to qualify but they

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
going in France to to qualify but they
need<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.210> score<00:01:54.360> three<00:01:54.750> times<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.259> order<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
need to score three times in order of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.550

wait Arsenal is very determined from
what<00:02:45.740> I<00:02:45.770> saw<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.220> team<00:02:46.580> were<00:02:46.790> playing<00:02:46.940> in<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
what I saw the team were playing in the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.410 
what I saw the team were playing in the
last<00:02:48.020> matches<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.340> think<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:49.970> from<00:02:50.270> the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
last matches and I think that from the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.920 
last matches and I think that from the
goals<00:02:50.660> market<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.880> also<00:02:53.240> this<00:02:53.570> time<00:02:53.780> you

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
goals market that also this time you

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.200 
goals market that also this time you
will<00:02:54.050> assist<00:02:54.350> at<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.530> no<00:02:54.800> 4<00:02:55.010> 2.5<00:02:55.610> goals<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
will assist at the no 4 2.5 goals in the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.449 
will assist at the no 4 2.5 goals in the
match<00:02:56.240> priced<00:02:57.020> at<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.320> game<00:02:57.530> at<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.740> lot<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.190> two

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
match priced at the game at a lot of two

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.510 
match priced at the game at a lot of two
so<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.300> can<00:02:59.510> double<00:02:59.720> our<00:02:59.930> money<00:03:00.170> with<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.680> but

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
so we can double our money with that but

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.300 
so we can double our money with that but
I<00:03:02.060> think<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.720> also<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.290> tonsillar<00:03:03.800> will<00:03:04.010> score

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
I think it also the tonsillar will score

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.540 
I think it also the tonsillar will score
over<00:03:04.760> 1.5<00:03:05.480> volts<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.530> mesh<00:03:06.740> price<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.310> at
