00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
should be we need to find the track so

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.950 
should be we need to find the track so
you<00:02:17.670> want<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.000> find<00:02:18.180> out<00:02:18.360> how<00:02:18.510> quick<00:02:18.810> this

there's<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.540> perception<00:02:22.310> turbo<00:02:23.310> isn't<00:02:23.610> as<00:02:23.700> much

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
there's a perception turbo isn't as much

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.120 
there's a perception turbo isn't as much
fun<00:02:23.880> as<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> gt3<00:02:24.630> or<00:02:24.840> even<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.320> career<00:02:25.560> or<00:02:25.860> prayer

going between the corners of course
I<00:03:13.450> just<00:03:14.140> think<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.790> perception<00:03:16.210> of<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:16.600> turbo

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
I just think the perception of a turbo

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.670 
I just think the perception of a turbo
bit<00:03:18.010> softer<00:03:18.520> a<00:03:18.550> bit<00:03:18.790> heavier<00:03:19.440> bit<00:03:20.440> less

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
bit softer a bit heavier bit less

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.280 
bit softer a bit heavier bit less

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
focused more of a sort of warm weather

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
getting anywhere near the Ferrari

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.330 
getting anywhere near the Ferrari
special<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:05.560> then<00:05:05.650> it'll<00:05:05.830> be<00:05:05.890> somewhere

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
special a and then it'll be somewhere

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.710 
special a and then it'll be somewhere
around<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.180> Miss<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.480> qtr

especially<00:05:11.720> our<00:05:11.810> 114<00:05:12.440> -<00:05:12.740> but<00:05:13.009> have<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:13.220> driven

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
especially our 114 - but have you driven

it<00:05:13.669> now<00:05:14.229> each<00:05:15.229> field<00:05:15.830> on<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.550> money<00:05:16.729> it's

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
it now each field on the money it's

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.469 
it now each field on the money it's
going<00:05:17.720> to<00:05:17.780> be<00:05:18.069> really<00:05:19.069> really<00:05:19.789> quick<00:05:20.300> around

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
going to be really really quick around

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:28.809 
going to be really really quick around
there<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:20.870> think<00:05:26.800> so<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:28.099> moment<00:05:28.340> of<00:05:28.550> truth

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
there I think so the moment of truth

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.510 
there I think so the moment of truth
just<00:05:29.539> how<00:05:29.720> quick<00:05:30.080> is<00:05:30.289> a<00:05:30.319> turbo<00:05:30.800> S<00:05:30.949> on<00:05:31.190> this

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
just how quick is a turbo S on this

00:05:31.520 --> 00:06:49.189 
just how quick is a turbo S on this
brilliant<00:05:32.150> circuit

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.779 

so<00:06:50.199> we<00:06:50.349> thought<00:06:50.499> the<00:06:50.709> turbo<00:06:51.069> s<00:06:51.189> would<00:06:51.399> be<00:06:51.519> quick

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 
so we thought the turbo s would be quick

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:54.719 
so we thought the turbo s would be quick
and<00:06:51.999> so<00:06:52.509> it<00:06:52.659> proved<00:06:53.019> this<00:06:53.499> Turbo<00:06:53.979> S<00:06:54.189> had<00:06:54.459> no

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:54.729 
and so it proved this Turbo S had no

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:57.149 
and so it proved this Turbo S had no
