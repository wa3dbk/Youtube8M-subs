occur on the would cause it to break and
so<00:01:29.820> anyway<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.329> simple<00:01:30.689> setup<00:01:31.250> very

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
so anyway very simple setup very

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.399 
so anyway very simple setup very
effective<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.950> completely<00:01:35.549> removable

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
effective it is completely removable

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.880 
effective it is completely removable
of<00:01:37.409> course<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> motor<00:01:37.979> itself<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
of course the motor itself but also the

entire bracket and one of the PVC joints

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.319 
entire bracket and one of the PVC joints
is<00:01:47.119> not<00:01:48.119> glued<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.290> simply<00:01:50.149> undo<00:01:51.149> that

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
is not glued and I simply undo that

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.450 
is not glued and I simply undo that
joint<00:01:51.689> that's<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> furthest<00:01:52.829> joint<00:01:53.040> from<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
joint that's the furthest joint from the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.120 
joint that's the furthest joint from the
motor<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.110> pull<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.549> entire<00:01:56.549> mount<00:01:56.850> out

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
motor and pull the entire mount out

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.310 
motor and pull the entire mount out
that's<00:01:59.130> it
