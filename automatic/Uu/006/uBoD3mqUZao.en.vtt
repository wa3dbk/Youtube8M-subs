the first place we're going to go back

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.010 
the first place we're going to go back
and<00:01:25.320> find<00:01:26.250> where<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> actual<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> is

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and find where the actual there it is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
and find where the actual there it is
sorry<00:01:28.290> about<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.470> guys<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.729> see

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
sorry about that guys so as you can see

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.670 
sorry about that guys so as you can see
it<00:01:29.970> also<00:01:30.090> makes<00:01:30.299> use<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.380> level

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it also makes use of the the level

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.859 
it also makes use of the the level
slider<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.340> sense<00:01:32.579> too<00:01:32.880> again<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
slider in this sense too again not a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.929 
slider in this sense too again not a
terrible<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.530> design<00:01:34.979> flaw<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:35.610> again<00:01:35.700> we

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
terrible a design flaw but then again we

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.789 
terrible a design flaw but then again we
are<00:01:35.970> kind<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.329> sick<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.750> however<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
are kind of sick of it however the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.100 
are kind of sick of it however the
gameplay<00:01:38.189> itself<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.150> fantastic<00:01:39.900> that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
gameplay itself is so fantastic that

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.039 
gameplay itself is so fantastic that
it's<00:01:40.530> pretty<00:01:40.680> hard<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.100> knock<00:01:41.659> will<00:01:42.659> go<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> an

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it's pretty hard to knock will go to an

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's pretty hard to knock will go to an
easier<00:01:43.409> level<00:01:43.740> I'm<00:01:43.979> thinking<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.700> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
easier level I'm thinking about just so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.090 
easier level I'm thinking about just so
it's<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.119> slightly<00:01:45.689> more<00:01:46.290> simplistic<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
it's a slightly more simplistic on the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.880 
it's a slightly more simplistic on the

style event we're to show you a slightly
more<00:02:29.420> complex<00:02:29.810> level<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.410> get<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> feel<00:02:30.770> for

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
more complex level so you get a feel for

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.980 
more complex level so you get a feel for
it<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.520> here<00:02:31.730> we've<00:02:31.880> got<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.570> thing<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.930> I

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
it like here we've got this thing and I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.720 
it like here we've got this thing and I
don't<00:02:33.080> quite<00:02:33.290> remember<00:02:33.350> how<00:02:33.770> it<00:02:33.920> works<00:02:34.130> but

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
don't quite remember how it works but

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.030 
don't quite remember how it works but
it's<00:02:35.090> it's<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.480> good<00:02:35.660> example<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.140> how<00:02:36.350> it's

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
it's it's a good example of how it's

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.260 
it's it's a good example of how it's
actually<00:02:37.190> functions<00:02:37.850> there's<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.090> lot<00:02:38.240> of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
actually functions there's a lot of

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.520 
actually functions there's a lot of
different<00:02:38.390> design<00:02:38.840> elements<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.260> are<00:02:39.320> put

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
different design elements that are put

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.040 
different design elements that are put
into<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:39.830> sliding<00:02:40.190> things<00:02:40.610> lots<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.540> swirls

into this sliding things lots of swirls

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.080 
into this sliding things lots of swirls
there's<00:02:42.590> also<00:02:42.740> some<00:02:43.010> swings<00:02:43.340> involved<00:02:43.850> all<00:02:43.940> in

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
there's also some swings involved all in

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.850 
there's also some swings involved all in
all<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.360> lot<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.750> innovation<00:02:45.260> for<00:02:45.500> such<00:02:45.650> a

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
all it's a lot of innovation for such a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.460 
all it's a lot of innovation for such a
relatively<00:02:46.700> simplistic<00:02:47.240> idea<00:02:47.510> we're<00:02:48.290> big

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
relatively simplistic idea we're big

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.990 
relatively simplistic idea we're big
fans<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.010> we're<00:02:49.220> also<00:02:49.310> big<00:02:49.550> fans<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.880> the

fans of that we're also big fans of the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.790 
fans of that we're also big fans of the
fact<00:02:50.240> that<00:02:50.330> this<00:02:50.510> game<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.780> just<00:02:50.930> plain<00:02:51.620> fun

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
fact that this game is just plain fun

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.620 
fact that this game is just plain fun
that's<00:02:52.760> something<00:02:53.000> we'd<00:02:53.120> forgotten<00:02:53.360> that

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
that's something we'd forgotten that
