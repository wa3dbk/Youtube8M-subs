00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
that she was using a trackball mouse

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.889 
that she was using a trackball mouse
with<00:00:44.390> a<00:00:44.420> limited<00:00:44.929> space<00:00:45.429> and<00:00:46.429> she<00:00:47.269> uses<00:00:47.690> the

repetitive use of the mouse create pain
for<00:00:54.079> her<00:00:54.260> it<00:00:54.559> might<00:00:54.769> create<00:00:55.069> pain<00:00:55.339> for<00:00:55.550> others
