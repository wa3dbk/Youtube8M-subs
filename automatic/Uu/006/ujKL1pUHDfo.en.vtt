00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:16.361
 The return of the dead to life seems frightening. 

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:19.376
 But it can be a wonderful opportunity for scientists. 

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:22.320
 Of course, we are not talking about living dead. 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.199
 Instead, this opportunity was unlikely 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.068
 In the form of slow-moving and large fish called Silcant. 

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:33.242
 This stranger returns to 360 million years, 

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:36.662
 It is believed to have been extinct during the period of mass extinction 

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:40.492
 Who spent dinosaurs 65 million years ago. 

00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:45.382
 For geologists and fossils, these creatures are very old and wonderful 

00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:50.265
 But they are fully extinct fish, forever fossilized. 

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:54.211
 This was until 1938 when Marjorie Courtenaya-Leitmer, 

00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:56.501
 She is the curator of a museum in South Africa, 

00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:01.981
 Discover a brilliant blue fish from prehistoric times at nearby ports. 

00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:06.895
 She had the feeling that this strange specimen of a length of one and a half meters was important 

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:10.960
 But was unable to maintain them in time for study and embalming. 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.004
 Finally when I managed to reach the local fish expert GPL Smith 

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:20.088
 He was able to confirm, and at first glance it was a silicanth fish. 

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:24.640
 It took another 14 years before a live specimen was found in the Comoros, 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.436
 Allowing scientists to study closely the creature 

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:30.437
 Barely evolved over 300 million years. 

00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:32.953
 Live fossilization. 

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:36.437
 Several decades later, a second species was found near Indonesia. 

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:39.604
 The existence of creatures we thought they extinct long ago 

00:01:39.604 --> 00:01:42.960
 Is considered one of the most important discoveries of the century. 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.937
 But the fact that Silicanth returned from death 

00:01:45.937 --> 00:01:48.482
 Not the only fact that makes this fish very spectacular 

00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:52.442
 The most interesting is that they are genetically and formally 

00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:55.507
 Have commonalities with quadratic vertebrates 

00:01:55.507 --> 00:02:00.264
 More than any other fish, its tiny DNA is ideal for studying. 

00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:04.868
 This makes silicanth fish a strong link between wild and marine vertebrates, 

00:02:04.868 --> 00:02:09.516
 A living record for its transformation from water to land millions of years ago. 

00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:12.576
 The secret of this transformation lies in the fins. 

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:17.085
 While most of the fish in the ocean fall into the category of finfish, 

00:02:17.085 --> 00:02:21.801
 Silicanth is part of a smaller, more distinct and more finite collection. 

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.417
 Which is known as finfish fish. 

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:28.909
 Six of the silicanth fins contain bones arranged in much the same way as our limbs. 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.459
 With one bone connecting the fin to the body, 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.850
 And two other bones connect the bone to the fin's limbs, 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.329
 And several bones as small as the fingers on the tip. 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.220
 These fins are not organized in pairs to move in a synchronized way, 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.815
 Celicanth species share the same genetic sequence 

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:47.520
 Which works on the development of limbs in wild vertebrates. 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.413
 Although silicanth fish in themselves are not wild, 

00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:53.215
 But her fins do not resemble her relatives in the first place 

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.854
 Whose land initially attracted their bodies 

00:02:55.854 --> 00:02:58.411
 With the help of these powerful and flexible plaits, 

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:02.182
 As an evolutionary bridge to the earth lovers who followed it. 

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:06.200
 So this prehistoric fish helps explain the evolutionary movement 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.517
 Of vertebrates from water to land. 

00:03:08.517 --> 00:03:12.948
 This transformation over millions of years has led to the spread of quadruple animals, 

00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:14.744
 Called quad-legs, 

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:19.267
 Such as amphibians, birds and even our predecessors of mammals. 

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:21.331
 Another strong idea 

00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:24.422
 Is that the silicanth fish Unlike most fish do not lay eggs, 

00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:28.189
 Instead, they breed like mammals and give birth to a small chick. 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.736
 These prehistoric fish will continue to provide us with great information 

00:03:32.736 --> 00:03:38.003
 About the migration of vertebrates from the ocean more than 300 million years ago. 

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:42.379
 The journey ultimately led to the evolution of our staying and being. 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.808
 Today, the silicanth is still a symbol of the mysteries that science has yet to reveal. 

00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:50.555
 With much of what we do not know about this fish, 

00:03:50.555 --> 00:03:52.895
 On the depth of oceans and evolution itself, 

00:03:52.904 --> 00:03:57.514
 Who knows what lies hidden secrets of our future discoveries may reveal!
