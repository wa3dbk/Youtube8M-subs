it like that a lot of styles and now

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.250 
it like that a lot of styles and now
hold<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:23.150> tight<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:27.550> X<00:01:28.550> Rho<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.180> going<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.170> be

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
okay now this is going to be a little

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.310 
okay now this is going to be a little
bit<00:02:05.939> tricky<00:02:06.359> because<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.929> to<00:02:07.049> get<00:02:07.170> this

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
bit tricky because we have to get this

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.969 
bit tricky because we have to get this
brown<00:02:07.619> one<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.950> stay<00:02:08.220> here<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.080> we're<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
brown one to stay here so we're going to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.690 
brown one to stay here so we're going to
do<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.519> actually<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.989> tie<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:14.040> ground<00:02:14.489> one

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
do is actually just tie this ground one

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.539 
do is actually just tie this ground one
to<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.360> right<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.040> take<00:02:17.310> them<00:02:17.459> back

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
to this one right here so take them back

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.030 
to this one right here so take them back

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
all you kind of know about the tying the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.420 
all you kind of know about the tying the
beads<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.680> little<00:02:31.890> bit<00:02:32.010> confusing

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
beads on but it's a little bit confusing

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.640 
beads on but it's a little bit confusing
so<00:02:32.790> take<00:02:33.000> your<00:02:33.120> string<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.900> smaller<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.500> and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so take your string the smaller one and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.770 
so take your string the smaller one and
put<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.280> through<00:02:35.579> this<00:02:35.790> brown<00:02:36.390> bead<00:02:36.599> right

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
put it through this brown bead right

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.890 
put it through this brown bead right
here<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.670> then<00:02:38.670> put<00:02:39.060> your<00:02:39.180> other<00:02:39.329> round<00:02:39.660> bead

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
here and then put your other round bead

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.130 
here and then put your other round bead
on<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.200> string<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.329> just<00:02:42.329> tight<00:02:42.660> right<00:02:43.530> there

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
on a string and just tight right there

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.240 
on a string and just tight right there
yeah<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.230> then<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.440> will<00:02:46.560> tie<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:46.829> like<00:02:46.950> this

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
yeah and then that will tie it like this

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.360 
yeah and then that will tie it like this
and<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:48.540> will<00:02:48.569> be<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:48.989> place<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.590> next<00:02:49.950> low

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
and it will be in place for the next low

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.940 
and it will be in place for the next low
pretty<00:02:52.970> confusing<00:02:53.450> only<00:02:53.870> because<00:02:54.200> sometimes

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
pretty confusing only because sometimes

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.890 
pretty confusing only because sometimes
will<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.400> do<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> flat<00:02:56.120> peyote<00:02:56.330> stitch<00:02:56.569> like

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
will you do a flat peyote stitch like

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.899 
will you do a flat peyote stitch like
this<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.590> beads<00:02:58.010> don't<00:02:58.280> line<00:02:58.519> up<00:02:58.549> exactly

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
this the beads don't line up exactly

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.149 
this the beads don't line up exactly
perfectly<00:02:59.659> and<00:03:00.049> there's<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.470> an<00:03:00.620> odd<00:03:00.830> bead

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
perfectly and there's like an odd bead

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.420 
perfectly and there's like an odd bead
and<00:03:01.659> when<00:03:02.659> that<00:03:02.840> happens<00:03:02.870> then<00:03:03.650> either<00:03:03.890> you

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
and when that happens then either you

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.640 
and when that happens then either you
have<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.700> do<00:03:05.170> ok<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.620> do<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.129> with<00:03:07.310> both<00:03:08.650> once

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
have to do ok so do that with both once

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.500 
have to do ok so do that with both once
it's<00:03:09.890> done<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.310> put<00:03:10.610> your<00:03:10.700> strings<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.269> do<00:03:11.360> it

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
it's done to put your strings to do it

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.259 
it's done to put your strings to do it
justice<00:03:11.870> there<00:03:12.430> if<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.610> now<00:03:13.730> run<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.150> the

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
justice there if you now run to the

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.490 
justice there if you now run to the
other<00:03:14.329> side<00:03:14.629> cut<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.409> a<00:03:15.440> small<00:03:15.829> stream<00:03:16.220> and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
other side cut you a small stream and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:30.050 
other side cut you a small stream and
tie<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:18.560> beat<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.459> one<00:03:19.670> right<00:03:20.180> here

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.710 

and<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:31.110> think<00:03:32.010> from<00:03:32.819> looking<00:03:32.910> at<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.360> pattern

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
and I think from looking at the pattern

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.589 
and I think from looking at the pattern
this<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.260> only<00:03:34.410> one<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.910> only<00:03:35.940> 2i<00:03:36.360> guess

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
this is the only one the only 2i guess

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.110 
this is the only one the only 2i guess
speeds<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.770> will<00:03:38.280> be<00:03:38.400> needing<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.730> be<00:03:38.910> tied

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
speeds that will be needing to be tied

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.600 
speeds that will be needing to be tied
at<00:03:39.300> all<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:40.500> rest<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.830> them<00:03:40.950> should<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.400> you

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
at all the rest of them should just you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.690 
at all the rest of them should just you
know<00:03:41.640> stitch<00:03:42.060> normal<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.890> like<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.310> said<00:03:44.370> every

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
know stitch normal but like I said every

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.750 
know stitch normal but like I said every
once<00:03:44.849> in<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.000> while<00:03:45.180> dish<00:03:45.450> just<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.810> random<00:03:46.230> these

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
once in a while dish just a random these

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.309 
once in a while dish just a random these
that<00:03:47.760> doesn't<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.300> work<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.900> just<00:03:49.019> kind<00:03:49.290> of

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
that doesn't really work it just kind of

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.580 
that doesn't really work it just kind of
like<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.620> out<00:03:49.830> there<00:03:50.569> so<00:03:51.569> this<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.230> what<00:03:52.500> you

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
like it out there so this is what you

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.860 
like it out there so this is what you
have<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.739> do<00:03:53.900> hope<00:03:54.900> that's<00:03:55.140> not<00:03:55.230> too<00:03:55.470> confusing

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
have to do hope that's not too confusing

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.360 
have to do hope that's not too confusing
it's<00:03:57.870> really<00:03:57.959> easy<00:03:58.200> it's<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.680> time<00:03:58.950> would<00:03:59.190> be

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
it's really easy it's this time would be

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.330 
it's really easy it's this time would be
to<00:03:59.610> another<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:00.300> it's<00:04:00.420> not<00:04:00.599> really<00:04:00.660> even

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
to another so it's not really even

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.340 
to another so it's not really even
difficult<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.730> all<00:04:02.760> at<00:04:03.660> least<00:04:03.720> in<00:04:04.049> this<00:04:04.140> one

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
difficult at all at least in this one

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.750 
difficult at all at least in this one
attack<00:04:04.620> man<00:04:04.830> why<00:04:04.950> did<00:04:05.100> we<00:04:05.190> had<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.459> tie<00:04:05.610> like

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
attack man why did we had to tie like

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.979 
attack man why did we had to tie like
the<00:04:05.850> building<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.269> all<00:04:06.330> but<00:04:06.569> this<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.840> this

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
the building and all but this is this

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.640 
the building and all but this is this
one<00:04:07.170> can<00:04:07.890> put<00:04:08.100> your<00:04:08.220> strength<00:04:08.489> through<00:04:08.670> and

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
one can put your strength through and

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.620 
one can put your strength through and
tighten<00:04:11.450> okay<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.660> next<00:04:12.870> row<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:14.630> going

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
tighten okay now the next row is going

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.550 
tighten okay now the next row is going
to<00:04:15.840> be<00:04:17.329> brown<00:04:18.329> so<00:04:18.690> just<00:04:18.870> put<00:04:19.049> your<00:04:19.200> brand<00:04:19.350> on

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
to be brown so just put your brand on

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.960 
to be brown so just put your brand on
and<00:04:19.829> then<00:04:19.919> don't<00:04:20.190> put<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.459> through<00:04:20.609> this<00:04:20.729> one

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
and then don't put it through this one

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.200 
and then don't put it through this one
just<00:04:21.150> put<00:04:21.389> it<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.600> same<00:04:21.840> place<00:04:23.270> okay

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.580 

now<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.330> brown<00:04:28.510> one<00:04:28.750> drive<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.020> first<00:04:29.290> and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
now the brown one drive is first and

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.650 
now the brown one drive is first and
then<00:04:30.310> pink<00:04:30.790> through<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.240> middle

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.770 

okay<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:36.720> we'll<00:04:37.050> just<00:04:37.080> paint<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:38.010> then<00:04:38.280> T<00:04:38.780> then

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
okay so we'll just paint and then T then

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.180 
okay so we'll just paint and then T then
we'll<00:04:39.930> stop<00:04:40.260> right<00:04:40.470> there<00:04:42.950> okay

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.400 

and<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:48.000> one<00:04:48.240> on<00:04:48.480> this<00:04:48.630> row<00:04:48.870> since<00:04:49.110> we<00:04:49.200> had<00:04:49.350> to

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
and this one on this row since we had to

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.350 
and this one on this row since we had to
try<00:04:49.560> that<00:04:49.590> bead<00:04:49.950> it<00:04:50.160> can't<00:04:50.700> be<00:04:50.820> as<00:04:50.910> tight<00:04:51.180> as

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
try that bead it can't be as tight as

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.670 
try that bead it can't be as tight as
the<00:04:51.480> rest<00:04:51.630> of<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.870> road<00:04:52.020> could<00:04:52.260> look<00:04:52.470> when<00:04:52.590> I

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
the rest of the road could look when I

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.660 
the rest of the road could look when I
pull<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:52.980> really<00:04:53.070> tight<00:04:53.160> look<00:04:53.520> what<00:04:53.640> that

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
pull it really tight look what that

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.750 
pull it really tight look what that
because<00:04:54.090> these<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:55.560> pull<00:04:55.980> it<00:04:56.100> tight<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.580> then

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
because these so pull it tight and then

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.090 
because these so pull it tight and then
fix<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:57.540> bead<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.080> leave<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.680> at<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:58.890> time

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
fix that bead and leave it at that time

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.970 
fix that bead and leave it at that time
it<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.200> stays<00:05:01.470> where<00:05:01.770> it's<00:05:01.920> supposed

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
it so that it stays where it's supposed

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.850 
it so that it stays where it's supposed
to<00:05:02.280> be<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:03.270> tide<00:05:03.510> on<00:05:03.540> beads<00:05:03.900> get<00:05:04.140> kind<00:05:04.800> of

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
to be the tide on beads get kind of

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.340 
to be the tide on beads get kind of
confusing<00:05:04.980> as<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.610> can<00:05:05.760> see<00:05:05.940> okay<00:05:06.930> so<00:05:07.080> then

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
confusing as you can see okay so then

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.790 
confusing as you can see okay so then
you<00:05:07.440> put<00:05:07.620> on<00:05:07.710> your<00:05:07.860> brown<00:05:08.070> one<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:09.770> put<00:05:10.770> it

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
you put on your brown one and put it

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.380 
you put on your brown one and put it
through<00:05:11.070> this<00:05:11.220> pink<00:05:11.580> one<00:05:11.640> on<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:11.970> other<00:05:12.000> side

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
through this pink one on the other side

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.830 
through this pink one on the other side
and<00:05:12.690> then<00:05:12.900> do<00:05:13.110> this<00:05:13.350> paint<00:05:13.740> next<00:05:16.400> and<00:05:17.840> then

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
and then do this paint next and then

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.330 
and then do this paint next and then
this<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:19.290> one<00:05:19.590> where<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:19.860> put<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.130> pink

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
this is the one where you put the pink

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.250 
this is the one where you put the pink
on<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:20.970> then<00:05:21.480> you<00:05:21.600> put<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.840> other<00:05:21.960> change

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
on and then you put the other change

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.490 
on and then you put the other change
your<00:05:22.440> opposite<00:05:24.530> okay<00:05:25.530> so<00:05:25.590> just<00:05:26.100> ask<00:05:27.500> tighten

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
your opposite okay so just ask tighten

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.090 
your opposite okay so just ask tighten
this<00:05:28.650> side<00:05:28.920> and<00:05:29.190> then<00:05:29.310> fix<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.850> geez<00:05:30.240> and<00:05:31.100> let

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
this side and then fix this geez and let

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.490 
this side and then fix this geez and let
it<00:05:32.130> say<00:05:33.090> okay<00:05:34.100> now<00:05:35.100> on<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.750> all<00:05:36.750> right<00:05:37.260> now<00:05:37.440> the

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
it say okay now on to all right now the

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.400 
it say okay now on to all right now the
next<00:05:38.130> two<00:05:38.340> rows<00:05:38.550> are<00:05:38.850> all<00:05:39.150> just<00:05:39.720> Browns<00:05:40.080> and

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
next two rows are all just Browns and

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.440 
next two rows are all just Browns and
then<00:05:40.680> we're<00:05:40.800> done<00:05:40.940> we'll<00:05:41.940> start<00:05:42.210> with<00:05:42.330> this

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
then we're done we'll start with this

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.700 
then we're done we'll start with this
transistor<00:05:42.930> right<00:05:43.200> here<00:05:43.410> and<00:05:43.920> just<00:05:44.910> thread<00:05:45.180> on

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
transistor right here and just thread on

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:54.989 
transistor right here and just thread on
brown<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:48.260> then<00:05:49.260> Brown<00:05:50.000> here

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:54.999 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:06:01.029 

and<00:05:55.999> then<00:05:56.449> brown<00:05:57.409> on<00:05:57.589> the<00:05:57.680> other<00:05:57.830> side<00:05:59.740> hey<00:06:00.740> so

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
and then brown on the other side hey so

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:09.730 
and then brown on the other side hey so
we<00:06:01.159> do<00:06:01.309> brown<00:06:03.520> brown<00:06:04.520> and<00:06:05.029> brown<00:06:07.180> this<00:06:08.180> one<00:06:08.740> hey

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
we do brown brown and brown this one hey

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.379 
we do brown brown and brown this one hey
make<00:06:09.949> sure<00:06:09.979> those<00:06:10.249> holes<00:06:10.550> high<00:06:10.819> but<00:06:11.210> be

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
make sure those holes high but be

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.379 
make sure those holes high but be
careful<00:06:11.809> for<00:06:11.990> these<00:06:12.139> side<00:06:12.469> ones<00:06:13.059> so<00:06:14.059> that<00:06:14.089> they

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
careful for these side ones so that they

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.059 
careful for these side ones so that they
don't<00:06:14.569> flip<00:06:15.499> out<00:06:17.439> okay<00:06:18.439> and<00:06:18.710> then<00:06:18.830> our<00:06:18.919> last

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:19.069 
don't flip out okay and then our last

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.950 
don't flip out okay and then our last
row<00:06:19.369> is<00:06:19.399> this<00:06:19.759> for<00:06:20.059> brown<00:06:20.330> one<00:06:20.539> so<00:06:20.719> we're<00:06:20.869> going

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
row is this for brown one so we're going

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.480 
row is this for brown one so we're going
to<00:06:21.050> skip<00:06:21.379> right<00:06:21.589> here<00:06:21.800> we're<00:06:21.979> not<00:06:22.099> going<00:06:22.309> to<00:06:22.369> go

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
to skip right here we're not going to go

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.980 
to skip right here we're not going to go
through<00:06:22.729> which<00:06:22.999> going<00:06:23.180> to<00:06:23.240> put<00:06:23.360> it<00:06:23.449> sees<00:06:23.629> no

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
through which going to put it sees no

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.619 
through which going to put it sees no
beat<00:06:24.199> and<00:06:24.439> go<00:06:24.589> to<00:06:24.800> the<00:06:24.889> zoo<00:06:24.919> right<00:06:25.159> there<00:06:25.629> so

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629 
beat and go to the zoo right there so

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.679 
beat and go to the zoo right there so
put<00:06:27.080> your<00:06:27.169> string<00:06:27.439> through<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:28.389> then<00:06:29.389> do

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
put your string through and then do

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:38.019 
put your string through and then do
brown<00:06:30.879> and<00:06:32.169> brown<00:06:36.129> okay<00:06:37.129> and<00:06:37.370> then<00:06:37.520> tighten<00:06:37.819> up

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:38.029 
brown and brown okay and then tighten up

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:39.790 
brown and brown okay and then tighten up
this<00:06:38.180> rope<00:06:38.479> course<00:06:38.779> when<00:06:39.020> you<00:06:39.169> go<00:06:39.349> through<00:06:39.620> you

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
this rope course when you go through you

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.459 
this rope course when you go through you
don't<00:06:39.979> we<00:06:40.069> have<00:06:40.219> to<00:06:40.430> say<00:06:40.699> in<00:06:41.080> when<00:06:42.080> you<00:06:42.169> skip

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:42.469 
don't we have to say in when you skip

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:46.540 
don't we have to say in when you skip
these<00:06:43.930> okay<00:06:44.930> and<00:06:45.259> then<00:06:45.709> make<00:06:45.919> sure<00:06:46.129> the<00:06:46.249> speed

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
these okay and then make sure the speed

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.480 
these okay and then make sure the speed
isn't<00:06:46.729> being<00:06:47.059> crazy<00:06:47.389> because<00:06:47.689> it<00:06:47.899> usually<00:06:48.110> is

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
isn't being crazy because it usually is

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.239 
isn't being crazy because it usually is
okay<00:06:49.490> then<00:06:49.669> the<00:06:49.789> same<00:06:49.969> thing<00:06:50.149> on<00:06:50.270> the<00:06:50.360> side

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:51.249 
okay then the same thing on the side

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:54.489 
okay then the same thing on the side
gets<00:06:52.249> through<00:06:52.580> you'll<00:06:53.539> be<00:06:53.719> just<00:06:53.990> go<00:06:54.199> through

00:06:54.489 --> 00:06:54.499 
gets through you'll be just go through

00:06:54.499 --> 00:07:01.059 
gets through you'll be just go through
and<00:06:55.430> then<00:06:55.699> do<00:06:55.879> brown<00:06:57.249> and<00:06:59.469> brown<00:07:00.469> this<00:07:00.800> last

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069 
and then do brown and brown this last

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:02.709 
and then do brown and brown this last
one<00:07:01.249> is<00:07:01.399> the<00:07:01.459> one<00:07:01.699> where<00:07:01.879> the<00:07:02.029> string<00:07:02.300> you

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:02.719 
one is the one where the string you

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:04.239 
one is the one where the string you
usually<00:07:02.899> go<00:07:03.199> through<00:07:03.469> the<00:07:03.680> since<00:07:03.889> our<00:07:04.069> last

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:04.249 
usually go through the since our last

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:05.439 
usually go through the since our last
bead<00:07:04.550> we're<00:07:04.729> just<00:07:04.879> going<00:07:04.999> to<00:07:05.029> tie<00:07:05.209> it<00:07:05.270> right

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449 
bead we're just going to tie it right

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:08.559 
bead we're just going to tie it right
here<00:07:05.889> so<00:07:06.889> pull<00:07:07.370> this<00:07:07.550> tight<00:07:07.759> tight<00:07:08.089> since<00:07:08.449> we

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:08.569 
here so pull this tight tight since we

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:13.389 
here so pull this tight tight since we
skipped<00:07:11.259> and<00:07:12.259> make<00:07:12.589> sure<00:07:12.620> that<00:07:12.889> be<00:07:13.039> formal

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:13.399 
skipped and make sure that be formal

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.110 
skipped and make sure that be formal
crazy<00:07:13.699> everything<00:07:14.360> is<00:07:14.449> fine

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
crazy everything is fine

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.700 
crazy everything is fine
and<00:07:16.740> cut<00:07:17.740> off<00:07:17.830> the<00:07:18.010> extra<00:07:18.280> string<00:07:18.880> and<00:07:19.330> then<00:07:20.229> hi

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
and cut off the extra string and then hi

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.540 
and cut off the extra string and then hi
right<00:07:20.949> here<00:07:21.160> and<00:07:21.720> this<00:07:22.720> is<00:07:22.780> the<00:07:23.080> end<00:07:23.370> and<00:07:24.370> then

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
right here and this is the end and then

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.460 
right here and this is the end and then
when<00:07:24.729> you're<00:07:24.820> all<00:07:24.880> done<00:07:25.120> tying<00:07:25.510> you're<00:07:26.229> done

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:26.470 
when you're all done tying you're done

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.260 
when you're all done tying you're done
just<00:07:26.889> make<00:07:27.070> sure<00:07:27.100> you<00:07:27.250> stick<00:07:27.520> that<00:07:27.699> side<00:07:27.970> beads

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
just make sure you stick that side beads

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.969 
just make sure you stick that side beads
so<00:07:28.479> that<00:07:28.630> it's<00:07:28.750> not<00:07:28.930> but<00:07:29.410> when<00:07:29.530> we<00:07:29.620> tied<00:07:29.860> on

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:29.979 
so that it's not but when we tied on

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:32.219 
so that it's not but when we tied on
let's<00:07:30.460> not<00:07:30.639> going<00:07:30.850> all<00:07:30.970> crazy<00:07:31.090> and<00:07:31.510> you're<00:07:32.020> all

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:32.229 
let's not going all crazy and you're all

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:34.860 
let's not going all crazy and you're all
the<00:07:32.320> way<00:07:32.410> to<00:07:32.470> and<00:07:33.040> there<00:07:33.970> you<00:07:34.060> have<00:07:34.090> peyote

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
the way to and there you have peyote
