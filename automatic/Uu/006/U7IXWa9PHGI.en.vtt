there<00:01:40.930> we<00:01:41.080> go<00:01:41.560> all<00:01:42.250> right<00:01:42.520> well<00:01:42.850> little

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
there we go all right well little

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.390 
there we go all right well little
idiosyncrasies<00:01:45.180> all<00:01:46.180> right<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.720> there<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:48.250> the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
idiosyncrasies all right so there is the

you<00:01:52.690> have<00:01:52.870> to<00:01:52.990> figure<00:01:53.230> out<00:01:53.260> how<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.560> get<00:01:53.710> that

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
you have to figure out how to get that

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.920 
you have to figure out how to get that
put<00:01:54.160> on<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.400> front<00:01:55.140> I'm<00:01:56.140> thinking<00:01:56.980> of<00:01:57.220> moving

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
put on the front I'm thinking of moving

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.280 
put on the front I'm thinking of moving
the<00:01:58.930> spare<00:01:59.230> tire<00:01:59.590> you<00:02:00.370> know<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:01.110> getting<00:02:02.110> the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
the spare tire you know and getting the

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.150 
the spare tire you know and getting the
spare<00:02:02.590> tire<00:02:02.830> mounted<00:02:03.370> on<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.730> back<00:02:04.300> door<00:02:05.160> if

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
spare tire mounted on the back door if

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.389 
spare tire mounted on the back door if
that's<00:02:06.460> doable<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:07.270> think<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.690> will<00:02:07.810> be<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.250> that

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
that's doable I think it will be so that

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.780 
that's doable I think it will be so that
way<00:02:09.490> I'll<00:02:09.640> have<00:02:09.790> more<00:02:10.000> room<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.209> put<00:02:10.479> my<00:02:11.790> Li

market tables in the back here so the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
tables are fitting just fine in there so

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.449 
tables are fitting just fine in there so
this<00:02:20.590> one<00:02:20.830> has<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.130> hitch<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:24.160> we're<00:02:24.310> off<00:02:24.430> to

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.900 
and I found out there is a choke choke
4:00<00:05:06.510> in<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.660> morning<00:05:07.110> when<00:05:07.460> it's<00:05:08.460> starting

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
4:00 in the morning when it's starting

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.330 
4:00 in the morning when it's starting
not<00:05:09.090> right<00:05:09.750> okay<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:12.139> I<00:05:13.139> guess<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:13.979> got<00:05:14.099> to<00:05:14.220> put

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
not right okay and I guess I got to put

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.450 
not right okay and I guess I got to put
this<00:05:14.460> one<00:05:14.699> in<00:05:14.880> neutral<00:05:15.889> so<00:05:16.889> that<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:18.570> 4x4

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
this one in neutral so that the the 4x4

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.430 
this one in neutral so that the the 4x4
light<00:05:20.460> will<00:05:20.669> go<00:05:20.910> off<00:05:20.940> all<00:05:21.510> right<00:05:21.750> let's<00:05:22.050> hit

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
light will go off all right let's hit

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.330 
light will go off all right let's hit
the<00:05:22.500> road<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:23.010> go<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.340> DMV<00:05:23.639> a<00:05:24.060> second<00:05:24.960> time

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
the road and go to the DMV a second time

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.640 
the road and go to the DMV a second time
so<00:05:26.340> I<00:05:26.370> have<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.669> clutch<00:05:26.940> in<00:05:26.970> it's<00:05:27.449> like<00:05:27.660> the

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
so I have the clutch in it's like the

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.300 
so I have the clutch in it's like the
4x4<00:05:29.430> one<00:05:29.849> is<00:05:30.030> like<00:05:30.270> okay<00:05:30.810> whatever<00:05:31.349> let's<00:05:32.160> see

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
4x4 one is like okay whatever let's see

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.350 
4x4 one is like okay whatever let's see
if<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.460> can<00:05:32.639> figure<00:05:32.789> it<00:05:33.000> out<00:05:33.120> so

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.210 

that's<00:05:39.360> four<00:05:40.290> I<00:05:41.330> guess<00:05:42.330> that's<00:05:42.540> it<00:05:43.040> feels<00:05:44.040> like

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
that's four I guess that's it feels like

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.640 
that's four I guess that's it feels like
neutral<00:05:44.700> okay<00:05:45.210> let's<00:05:45.480> see<00:05:45.720> so<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.970> 4x4<00:05:48.650> white

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
neutral okay let's see so the 4x4 white

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.570 
neutral okay let's see so the 4x4 white
is<00:05:49.920> still<00:05:50.250> on<00:05:51.320> let's<00:05:52.320> see<00:05:52.620> I<00:05:52.950> had<00:05:53.730> a<00:05:53.760> wonderful

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.550 

before<00:05:57.580> L<00:05:57.850> had<00:05:58.630> to<00:05:58.720> turn<00:05:58.930> out<00:05:59.080> with<00:05:59.260> actually

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
before L had to turn out with actually

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.700 
before L had to turn out with actually
published<00:06:00.130> on<00:06:00.370> one<00:06:00.610> of<00:06:00.640> the

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
published on one of the

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.940 
published on one of the
okay<00:06:04.600> alright<00:06:05.600> so<00:06:05.990> I<00:06:06.350> guess<00:06:06.530> it's<00:06:06.830> in

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
okay alright so I guess it's in

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:15.340 
okay alright so I guess it's in
two-wheel<00:06:07.280> drive<00:06:07.520> now<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:14.360> then<00:06:14.630> just<00:06:15.110> wait

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
two-wheel drive now and then just wait

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.430 
two-wheel drive now and then just wait
down<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.770> same<00:06:16.010> crappy<00:06:16.490> dirt<00:06:16.640> road<00:06:17.290> so<00:06:18.290> let's

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
down the same crappy dirt road so let's

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.270 
down the same crappy dirt road so let's
see<00:06:18.650> how<00:06:18.800> it<00:06:18.980> does<00:06:19.190> in<00:06:19.490> two-wheel<00:06:20.420> drive<00:06:20.810> I

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
see how it does in two-wheel drive I

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.700 
see how it does in two-wheel drive I
need<00:06:22.280> to<00:06:22.460> get<00:06:22.610> on<00:06:22.760> a<00:06:22.790> Suzuki<00:06:23.180> Samurai<00:06:23.810> forum

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.140 
need to get on a Suzuki Samurai forum
and<00:06:25.390> figure<00:06:26.390> out<00:06:26.450> this<00:06:26.960> four<00:06:27.470> wheel<00:06:27.680> drive<00:06:28.150> two

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
and figure out this four wheel drive two

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.320 
and figure out this four wheel drive two
wheel<00:06:29.330> drive<00:06:29.360> step<00:06:30.460> so<00:06:31.460> it's<00:06:31.640> off<00:06:31.850> with<00:06:32.120> the

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
wheel drive step so it's off with the

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.200 
wheel drive step so it's off with the
Idaho<00:06:32.780> boots<00:06:33.230> and<00:06:33.590> on<00:06:34.400> with<00:06:34.760> the<00:06:34.880> Nevada
