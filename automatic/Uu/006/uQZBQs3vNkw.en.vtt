really retro but it's really cool and it

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.690 
really retro but it's really cool and it
has<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.349> little<00:03:10.620> bit<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.860> lining<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.580> inside

has a little bit of lining on the inside

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.030
