00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.849
 Today's 30th let's talk about this base here 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.969
 that the base cult effect like brown 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.429
 two go there then to you who are me 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.859
 requesting neither the review of this 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.960
 Monday, saying that I do not 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.609
 I really liked her, it's like always 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.740
 Brazilian industry do not know what 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.510
 problem that there is a Brazilian industry 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.180
 that they do not want or can not 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.560
 to build a foundation for black skin on the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.630
 warmer background 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.770
 no matter how hard the companies 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.989
 they still can not reach the tone and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.540
 because with this you will realize 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.200
 that as I apply the spy base 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.440
 year 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.620
 already gives the cold 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.980
 my skin it is already grayish because 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 there are the yellow oranges pigments that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.170
 are not enough to do it. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.829
 a coverage with a sudden or hot 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.829
 like mine 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:50.770
 i girls who have the skin of my 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.600
 tone a little more but my consumer 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.180
 my hot that my 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.570
 maybe she can work out I'll show 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.710
 for you how she stayed here how is aa 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.140
 texture was a liquid base 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.780
 she has a good coverage 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.489
 really is very good is a kind of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.610
 coverage that disguises well the 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.830
 allowing imperfections until no 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.530
 accurate both corrective 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.830
 but in my case my skin is black 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.920
 To consume a very warm tone, I found it 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.959
 Shit, the grayish effect, I'm 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.450
 using her at the time did this makeup 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.830
 using it the effect was even slightly 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.030
 worse 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.640
 Let's say but then I picked it up and spat a little 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.850
 darkest dailus which is coffee with 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.060
 24 that even is the glass I usually do 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.100
 the contours on my face and I went to 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.310
 see if I burned a little more this 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.519
 base left in the air a little more 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.790
 darkened 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.489
 I need to pay $ 24 90 in a drugstore. 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.360
 there the center of the city scene in the 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.060
 Central subway Brazil excuse is 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.489
 as I said to you right as always 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.910
 try to be more objective more outspoken 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.360
 possible is a 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.430
 yes to what vult released vult as 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.060
 other Brazilian companies that have 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.970
 or know how to develop products for 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.700
 black skin you need to study more and 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.950
 understand how the operation of 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.380
 Brazilian black skin that is not the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.270
 same thing as black African skin 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.400
 which is not the same with the skin 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.580
 European and American 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.130
 Brazilian black skin I perceive and who 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.410
 say this is not me because the scholars 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.020
 that it has a different specificity 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.630
 even our climate until recently by 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.420
 temperature all these are factors 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.780
 which directly influence the skin and 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.040
 color is not only body is the light that falls 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.290
 about her 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.540
 So for me to say that this thing is 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.660
 because there is a texture of a 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.880
 color there is a texture and there is a 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.710
 set of light and temperature that 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.960
 is on this street and can 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.030
 modify it then the tip is there if 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.300
 you suddenly have a 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.459
 style say hot than my 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.790
 it's worth a try because coverage 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.190
 her is good the texture of her is good her 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.290
 not really the matt effect or been 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.680
 It is almost summer that we 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.560
 We can handle the day and without having 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.980
 many faults but for the feat 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.520
 up tone I found that left to be desired 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.140
 Okay, I hope you liked it. 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.030
 kiss in your heart stay with 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.660
 God, bye, bye to the next video. 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.660
 thank you
