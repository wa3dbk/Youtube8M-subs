00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.730
 how are all I am lancer we are in 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.860
 the boyfriend of the black ops 2 and good what 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.710
 they are going to see is a pretty good game 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.570
 and it is the number 4 building of the best 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.150
 classes of blacos 2 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.160
 I think that 4 if they have not seen 3 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.369
 past episodes I will leave you a 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.920
 link of the three episodes that if not the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.840
 have seen those who want to see it done as 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.040
 let's say that the analysis of the ap 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.870
 double um the m 27 affected and good is the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.540
 turn of the mp7 that is to say me 27 of the 27 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.000
 a pretty good submachine gun is in fact 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.650
 the first they give you and good at 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.660
 beginning of the game a lot of people were getting 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.550
 extreme because it weighs they thought it was 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.980
 the best because in becoming 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.890
 it was the best weapon in the game then 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.860
 this one because people thought it was going to be 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.350
 the same here was not not as good as 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.030
 No modern warfare 3 but it was not bad 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.729
 I had quite a setback but correction 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.990
 it was not very bad it had enough damage and 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.600
 well after the first 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.390
 updates this were 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.920
 getting worse little by little because what 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.679
 wants to bring che the game is made very 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.369
 balanced each weapon when that a weapon 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.830
 it's not so good that it's another 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.940
 have for example that the mp7 have something 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.640
 good 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.260
 the against the wwe and vice versa that the fart 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.210
 blue I have something good with the mp 7 by 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.550
 example the most bullets are not 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.620
 let's say this but good is already 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.180
 right now they 're going like this 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.100
 update is already returned to 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.980
 improve I do not know why they have deparado 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.530
 improving it they improved it again and it's 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.630
 a weapon is a very good weapon indeed 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.300
 I liked it more than the epe w because right now 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.010
 you will already know that the double p is a garbage 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.990
 completely it's a trash in serious it 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.660
 moves too much the only thing so I 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.520
 the flooring is in case you did not know 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.490
 who drive from August flood 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.240
 because the number of bullets is very 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.660
 advantageous in a submachine gun has 50 bullets 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.220
 because from all the weapons I think 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.680
 which is the one that has more bullets in what 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.390
 refers to the assault rifle and his rifle 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.810
 because light drugs already know that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.430
 they have 100 120 and all that but good 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.840
 this I think that's why people get the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.740
 continues to put in from time to time 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.970
 amount of bullets because it takes away that 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.430
 need to wear chargers 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.190
 extended to the quick charger and it will give you 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.660
 because you have to wear another accessory 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.940
 reflux with the ape w imposed another 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.130
 accessory instead of fast charger or 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.450
 anchored loaders no but good ya 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.300
 is speaking in the prologue when 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.600
 I should be talking in the mp7 what 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.120
 which are the accessories are not so 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.500
 important let's say as I say 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.660
 already after all the updates 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.520
 is the nava varying this 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.020
 I have a silencer as you can see it is 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.340
 indispensable for the model of each 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.920
 who can remove it in the same way 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.780
 pretty well obviously move a lot 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.250
 less without a silencer but good I 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.830
 I used to muffler and as you see 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.090
 here a long distance is pretty good 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.730
 sometimes if they know against if they know 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.590
 control the cut of science or 20 is 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.690
 very good hip not so much from the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.940
 hip is not so good from m away 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.340
 Sometimes, as I say, they have to be 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.920
 not control this training because from a 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.840
 go more or less this and good the second 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.030
 I know what I wear is fast carabobo 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.290
 I tell them you can change this ex but for 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.570
 an extended charger that does not do is not 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.180
 so useful because they understand 40 bullets is not 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.320
 so necessary that we say but good 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.850
 It's never never bad to take others 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.590
 This good buts that I have not 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.920
 they also do not affect the weapon that 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.580
 It would be hard line to help me get out 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.580
 the streaks I have 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.299
 bulletproof vest I was already 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.040
 forgetting on this map pretty well in 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.170
 the flag must because the way of seeing 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.610
 with which the meeting point of all 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.680
 the enemies obviously because everything 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.970
 critical world this flag and if 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.830
 you try to capture you will get to 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.349
 flags everywhere because I like the 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.940
 map is very symmetric let's say in 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.579
 what refers to the two flags the 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.419
 from there it is but good enough 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.729
 ok this because this bulletproof vest 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.260
 took car snows in the second section 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.880
 of parks that for me already know that it is 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.280
 indispensable to get a game 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.669
 with many casualties and few deaths and I carry 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:36.010
 skill that is not as useful as 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.510
 I preferred to wear a tactical mask but 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.190
 good this with I tell you this weapon is not 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.190
 requires many accessories not what 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.389
 many special Persians let's say 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.810
 because I was doing pretty well just with 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.870
 muffler 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.000
 I'm going to tell you only one accessory 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.710
 where good the accessory that I 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.350
 I think that in this case it is the best 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.480
 accessory is the flu in this example not 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.210
 I wear it but I have already put the flu 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.510
 in being medium pretty well seriously from 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.630
 the best weapons and they put grip on him that he does not 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.400
 moves a lot moves if you move a 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.350
 little bit up but moves to 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.690
 up rights so he pointed to be 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.780
 enemy to the eggs that goes up 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.820
 to the weapon you based on the head and a here 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.169
 I need a good one less an assistance 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.760
 to get me out again the orbital is 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.300
 looking for the enemies I did not find them 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.770
 and he just left the ball when I 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.860
 I stayed at an attendance of the second 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.300
 orbital this good so I got two 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.030
 times the orbital twice the unit 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.440
 canine is twice the swarm and the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.820
 result I do not know if to those who told them 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.530
 it's a 44 40 and 35 just do not remember very 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.320
 well because in the end I did not put the 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.000
 markers in step sorry but this one 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.610
 as I say pretty good the game 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.180
 this weapon does not require much flu is very 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.860
 good accessory for this weapon 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.920
 As I already told you, I hope that 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.390
 are ruined because I say that here 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.860
 how things are until now 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.830
 updates how are the weapons 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.590
 now the persecution is quite 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.550
 well the game this the only bad one of 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.230
 game 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.030
 in this way if neither of you know what cuts the 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:13.190
 short game in the games but good 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.980
 here as you see depending flags by 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.590
 Everywhere is one for the second unit 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.450
 canine after and cultural which no no 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.400
 just killed because it's over 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.220
 starting by points we should not have 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.530
 let that then if we had left that 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.590
 they will capture some flag so that 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.030
 will last longer is this but good with the 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.190
 I say pretty good the game the 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.140
 need pretty good on maps not so 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.880
 big in cardiel is not so good 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.890
 weapons and good is a matter of knowing 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.590
 controlling this weapon will depend on each 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.120
 who the grip for me the best advisers 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.430
 to be one that kills in the fifth 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.860
 low brings me is already about to 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.490
 finish the game and kill me this but 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.650
 good 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.300
 up to here the fourth episode of the mp7 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.580
 of in life please if they comment and we 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.580
 we see in the next one untied 2
