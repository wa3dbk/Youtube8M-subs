00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010 
cross-cultural psychology class was
amazing<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.759> eye-opening<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.750> taught

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
amazing it was so eye-opening it taught

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.590 
amazing it was so eye-opening it taught
me<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.380> much<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.560> culture<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.400> I'm<00:01:39.360> just

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
me so much about culture and I'm just

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
me so much about culture and I'm just
realizing<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.140> everyone<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:41.130> different

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
realizing that everyone is different

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
realizing that everyone is different
based<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.060> where<00:01:42.210> they've<00:01:42.390> grown<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.840> from<00:01:43.140> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
based on where they've grown up from and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.530 
based on where they've grown up from and
people<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.130> things<00:01:44.369> differently<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.299> we

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
people see things differently and we

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.850 
people see things differently and we
learn<00:01:45.810> things<00:01:46.079> differently<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.590> we

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
learn things differently and we

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.289 
learn things differently and we
shouldn't<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.520> quick<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> judge<00:01:48.090> if

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
shouldn't just be quick to judge if

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.240 
shouldn't just be quick to judge if
someone's<00:01:48.600> different<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.560> rude<00:01:49.829> when

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
someone's different now it's rude when

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.230 
someone's different now it's rude when
we<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:52.250> don't<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.340> base<00:01:53.850> someone

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
we like I don't know base someone

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.080 
we like I don't know base someone
because<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.540> where<00:01:54.960> they're<00:01:55.140> from<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
because of where they're from and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.280 
because of where they're from and
because<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.479> believed<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.140> we

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
because of what they believed in or we

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.590 
because of what they believed in or we
have<00:01:59.040> these<00:01:59.219> stereotypes<00:01:59.850> without<00:02:00.210> actually

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
have these stereotypes without actually

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.990 
have these stereotypes without actually
meeting<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.110> people<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.850> been

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
meeting the people so it's been

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.459 
meeting the people so it's been
interesting<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.630> see<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.439> I

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
interesting to see that then really I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.020 
interesting to see that then really I
open

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
open

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.889 
open
and<00:02:06.430> it's<00:02:07.430> been<00:02:07.580> cool<00:02:07.790> even<00:02:08.060> like<00:02:08.300> Americans

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
and it's been cool even like Americans

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.010 
and it's been cool even like Americans
we<00:02:09.170> have<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:09.530> many<00:02:09.709> stereotypes<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:11.600> it's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
we have so many stereotypes and it's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.720 
we have so many stereotypes and it's
been<00:02:12.170> interesting<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:12.980> hear<00:02:13.250> them<00:02:13.459> to

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
been interesting to like hear them to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.510

don't like to take the metro because um

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.440 
don't like to take the metro because um
we<00:07:04.510> don't<00:07:04.720> have<00:07:04.900> a<00:07:04.930> lot<00:07:05.320> of<00:07:05.350> passes<00:07:05.890> and<00:07:06.450> also

we don't have a lot of passes and also

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.330 
we don't have a lot of passes and also
it's<00:07:07.630> really<00:07:07.870> expensive<00:07:08.080> to<00:07:08.410> buy<00:07:08.650> the<00:07:08.710> passes
