00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.599
 I spent a lot of time thinking about what 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.700
 for a video I'll give you more or more today 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.559
 less successful should have it in the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.719
 Last time not so the cow lapd me 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.550
 you necessarily want to show and thought 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.980
 I just kiss my new category 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.990
 1 is called tips and tricks in the me 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.269
 just pass on your tips 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.099
 many do not know that yet 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.220
 Today I have video for part 1 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.720
 mm found out we know what knows 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 he bought more and more widespread its 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.760
 his iphone is quite expensive but 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.070
 used on ebay amazon or english 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.840
 offer that you can test if this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.280
 iphone is also 100 percent original 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.469
 I have an original display 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.309
 probably the iphone ever opened or 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.350
 like 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.039
 I have reached it though by 5 can 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.340
 however, the single indicators 10 indicate 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.920
 quite similar to the whole iphones speak 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.920
 you can also do it with the fours. ps 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.329
 or 3gs will apply through it a lot 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.699
 enjoy the video and see you 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.650
 then after that again tip number one 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.810
 is how you find out if you are with you 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.850
 installed an original display has the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.260
 This is true for both the iphone 5 and the iphone 4s 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.820
 at iphone 4 still at iphone 3gs 3g s 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.740
 is something with caution to enjoy it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.330
 can definitely try this out 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.900
 iphone has one on the front 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.729
 coating really like that 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.830
 unique and how conti as test ob 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.340
 it is a display normal original 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.490
 post it sticks on your iphone on it 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 and keep your iphone upright when 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.970
 this post drops off after one 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.799
 certain time then you have one 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.750
 original iphone that can ever 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.340
 what a poster you have 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.810
 really take some time in demanding 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.299
 Proverbs can then easily 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.340
 but stand by and wait for this 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.369
 percent decrease then that is a whole 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.930
 clear indication that you are one 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.450
 original display from there just this 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.340
 fine coating on it is here 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.680
 see who is responsible for that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.000
 the display is so smooth that that 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.860
 does not cost too long to lift 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.810
 Indiz number two you always have to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.239
 look at the grid I tried it 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.040
 now as good as it is to capture 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:16.189
 in the normal case with the iphone 5 4 s 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.019
 and 4 also at the 3gs and 3g all 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.519
 feinmaschig say here we have a 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.400
 black that's why the whole thing is not 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.420
 quite so good is that very fine mesh 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.370
 can you assume that one 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.409
 original is the display has been 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.989
 even exchanged even fell on this 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.310
 grid or are a very rough king what 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.109
 for you really a very clear 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.000
 indiz may be that the iphone 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.370
 ever been opened and that the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.599
 Display was exchanged another 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.250
 Indiz are the screws 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.200
 always look closely at the screws 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.989
 in the best case, they are completely unused 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.670
 so you can immediately realize that 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.859
 your display resp 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.329
 housing was never opened clear 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.040
 can not rob but swap those 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.000
 Most hobby handicraftsmen then theirs 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.470
 open iphone once 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.299
 Of course we used the same ones 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.409
 because it is not so easy the original ones 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.030
 to raise screws 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.500
 and if you then with the models you 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.269
 Look closely at the screws and the screws 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.370
 we can completely undamaged 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.739
 assume that your iphone has never been 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.970
 open was another tip is always 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.950
 to see if your device is one 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.870
 liquid damage you have both 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.409
 in the headphones connection at the iphone 5 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.930
 iphone 4s at iphone 4 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.120
 and also the iphone 3g s one 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.319
 Liquid indicator is a small one 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.250
 White dot I'm here now 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.599
 unfortunately can not show 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.879
 you can just flashlights 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.370
 shine when he knows you know that 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.750
 everything is clean is the red is that 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.229
 device in contact with fluid 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.569
 come 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:34.099
 at iphone 4s and we have that too 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.049
 still see the wide dock connector 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.090
 another indicator i have it 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.280
 not show the iphone 5 here 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.379
 but the iphone 5 has one more 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.540
 more if you on the side of the 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.040
 open south ring if I have no 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.049
 look and tilt the whole thing 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.790
 a small white dot is this 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.379
 wise, you can also see that 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.900
 does not get in contact with liquid 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.849
 came the red we know that at all 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.949
 there is a liquid damage 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.290
 Also a good indication always the 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.879
 Brightness sensor in the black iphone 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.189
 for example, apart from the 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.049
 Camera nothing at all because white 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.449
 iphones indeed have this black bar 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.759
 and the sensors looks the most obvious 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.650
 it is when the 3GS then you see also 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.479
 through the glass a lot of sensors 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.049
 more clearly than the original display 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.849
 the case is 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.070
 that is, always check up here 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.690
 if the sensors are so far in order 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.850
 which she should check, of course 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.280
 is the housing are debates original 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.560
 who use themselves perfectly or 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.480
 It looks like all the missed laos could 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.430
 always notice that your iphone is still 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.480
 never open and avoid it 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.460
 if you have all these tips 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.990
 observe and notice if you have one 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.850
 used iphone from the internet 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.800
 Buy then you are actually safe 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.450
 side so you can really rule out 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.100
 that you open your iphone ever 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.720
 was and that modifications 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.250
 were made and then 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.290
 For example, if you have problems 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.910
 you should have rejected by apple 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.730
 just because the support 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.470
 That's why it expired if you just 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.390
 buy the first thing she does jack this 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.370
 points from then you are really absolutely 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.930
 on the safe side and show you 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.030
 then sure she has an iphone what 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.180
 in the original condition is and what else 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.840
 no water damage has so so it will 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.430
 the video 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.620
 I think you see it pretty easy 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.170
 Find out if your iphone ever 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.090
 opened was modified or 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.490
 not recommend by all means 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.110
 to apply these tips and tricks though 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.970
 you needed an iphone about that 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.070
 You can buy internet as well 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.380
 Realize that everything is 100 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.610
 that's what it should be 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.110
 Do not be the case and I have one 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.820
 problems with your iphone 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.620
 then it is so that we are not 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.330
 You have support, you can indeed 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.200
 go to an apple store or that 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.150
 send all the way 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.950
 but you will then become more or 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.480
 less rejected because no 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.430
 original parts are more installed here 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.330
 so that the iphone does nothing more 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.890
 can at apple 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.360
 if you like the video and the new one 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.500
 has liked the tips and category 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.180
 Tricks I would be very about one 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.190
 thumbs high and euro happy 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.660
 you can all the video I also 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.920
 happy to share with friends known 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.720
 to make it a little bit more popular 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.730
 if you have a nice one 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.480
 weekend and we'll see each other 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.480
 next week again
