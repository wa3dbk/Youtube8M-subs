one<00:00:32.189> releases<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.030> maybe<00:00:33.900> expect<00:00:34.560> that<00:00:34.710> this

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
one releases so maybe expect that this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
tax I think that adding tax on it I

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.450 
tax I think that adding tax on it I
think<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.870> that's<00:01:16.230> the<00:01:16.380> only<00:01:16.770> bad<00:01:17.010> thing<00:01:17.070> about

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
think so that's the only bad thing about

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.760 
think so that's the only bad thing about
that<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.690> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:19.050> like<00:01:19.170> real<00:01:19.410> money

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that if it's going to be like real money

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
that if it's going to be like real money
money<00:01:21.260> apparently<00:01:22.260> there's<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:22.680> be

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
money apparently there's going to be

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.640 
money apparently there's going to be
taxed<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:24.110> don't<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.230> if<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
taxed so I don't know if it's going to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.040 
taxed so I don't know if it's going to
be<00:01:25.800> more<00:01:26.159> than<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> microsoft<00:01:27.510> points<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:27.960> the
