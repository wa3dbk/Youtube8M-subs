Carioca that never made it into
production<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:17.250> don't<00:01:17.400> think<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.700> were<00:01:17.790> even

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
production I don't think there were even

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.630

any<00:01:18.150> prototype<00:01:18.540> cars<00:01:19.020> working<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.009> think

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
any prototype cars working but I think

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.230 
any prototype cars working but I think

steel<00:01:56.009> he<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:56.969> competing<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.570> resources

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
steel he was competing for resources

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350 
steel he was competing for resources
when<00:01:58.680> everything<00:01:59.100> else<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.520> being<00:01:59.729> used<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
when everything else was being used and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.420 
when everything else was being used and
he<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> new<00:02:00.899> kid<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> block<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.340> he

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
he was the new kid on the block so he

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.980 
he was the new kid on the block so he
just<00:02:02.640> really<00:02:03.030> didn't<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> chance<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.810> get

it going my background has been in

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.760 
it going my background has been in

manufacturing and when I look at this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.320 
manufacturing and when I look at this
car<00:02:08.009> there's<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> tremendous<00:02:08.970> amount<00:02:09.090> of

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
eliminate the damage from people if they

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.070 
eliminate the damage from people if they
were<00:02:17.489> in<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.760> collision<00:02:18.060> or<00:02:18.450> what<00:02:18.690> they<00:02:18.810> called

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
you look at the roof it's got you know

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.089 
you look at the roof it's got you know
doors<00:02:33.060> cut<00:02:33.450> up<00:02:33.569> into<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.409> from<00:02:34.980> an

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
doors cut up into it like from an

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.369 
doors cut up into it like from an
aviation<00:02:35.310> influence<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.989> give<00:02:37.170> people

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
aviation influence but to give people

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.339 
aviation influence but to give people
better<00:02:38.370> access<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.420> out<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.780> he<00:02:39.959> had<00:02:40.079> many

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
better access in and out so he had many

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.030 
better access in and out so he had many
very<00:02:40.650> creative<00:02:41.250> ideas<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:42.090> his<00:02:42.329> time<00:02:42.599> so<00:02:43.319> if

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
very creative ideas in his time so if

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.430 
very creative ideas in his time so if
this<00:02:44.310> was<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.579> fraud<00:02:44.940> somebody<00:02:45.900> put<00:02:46.109> a<00:02:46.140> lot<00:02:46.200> of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
this was a fraud somebody put a lot of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.470 
this was a fraud somebody put a lot of
effort<00:02:46.739> into<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.579> motor<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> big<00:02:48.299> deal

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
effort into it the motor is a big deal

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.890 
effort into it the motor is a big deal
on<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.959> talk<00:02:49.769> about<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.690> a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
on this talk about that it's the it's a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.830 
on this talk about that it's the it's a
flat<00:02:52.349> six<00:02:52.769> very<00:02:53.430> similar<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> Corvair<00:02:54.599> a

flat six very similar to a Corvair a
Porsche<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.409> portions<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.640> was

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
Porsche and portions and it is was

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.149 
Porsche and portions and it is was
manufactured<00:02:58.049> by<00:02:58.170> Franklin<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:58.980> was

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
manufactured by Franklin and it was

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.830 
manufactured by Franklin and it was
actually<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.549> world<00:02:59.849> war<00:03:00.060> two<00:03:00.269> surplus

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
actually a world war two surplus

Franklin<00:03:03.780> had<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> specialty<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.709> air-cooled

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
Franklin had a specialty of air-cooled

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.069 
Franklin had a specialty of air-cooled
engines<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.819> their<00:03:05.970> cars<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.390> their<00:03:06.720> airplane

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.470 
engines the Tucker engineers developed
water<00:03:10.440> jackets<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.220> turned<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.239> into<00:03:12.329> a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
water jackets and turned it into a

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.920 
water jackets and turned it into a
water-cooled<00:03:13.200> radiator<00:03:13.769> cool<00:03:14.160> car<00:03:14.660> but<00:03:15.660> it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
water-cooled radiator cool car but it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.960 
water-cooled radiator cool car but it
was<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.109> very<00:03:16.440> torquey<00:03:16.859> engine<00:03:17.040> they<00:03:17.639> had<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> lot

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
was a very torquey engine they had a lot

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.430 
was a very torquey engine they had a lot
of<00:03:18.060> power<00:03:18.269> in<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.599> thing<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.900> they<00:03:19.049> early

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
of power in the thing and they early

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.080 
of power in the thing and they early
cars<00:03:19.680> they<00:03:19.859> had<00:03:19.950> trouble<00:03:20.130> snapping<00:03:20.700> axles

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
cars they had trouble snapping axles

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.580 
cars they had trouble snapping axles
because<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:21.510> engine<00:03:21.810> had<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.079> much<00:03:22.200> torque

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
because the engine had so much torque

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.949 
because the engine had so much torque
but<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.430> fire<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.389> sounds<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.810> lot

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
but you fire it up and it sounds a lot

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.390 
but you fire it up and it sounds a lot
like<00:03:25.019> an<00:03:25.290> oversized<00:03:25.709> Corvair<00:03:26.250> ah<00:03:26.599> so<00:03:27.599> the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
like an oversized Corvair ah so the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.550 
like an oversized Corvair ah so the
value<00:03:29.400> on<00:03:29.430> these<00:03:29.790> over<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.239> last<00:03:30.530> 15<00:03:31.530> years

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
value on these over the last 15 years

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.629 
value on these over the last 15 years
has<00:03:32.750> gone<00:03:33.750> up<00:03:33.989> gone<00:03:34.230> down<00:03:34.530> gone<00:03:34.950> up<00:03:35.160> gone<00:03:35.370> down

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
has gone up gone down gone up gone down

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.970 
has gone up gone down gone up gone down
and<00:03:35.940> now<00:03:36.090> it's<00:03:36.329> way<00:03:36.690> up<00:03:36.870> well<00:03:37.169> they've<00:03:37.470> gone<00:03:37.709> up

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
and now it's way up well they've gone up

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.640 
and now it's way up well they've gone up
and<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:39.540> know<00:03:39.660> it's<00:03:39.840> one<00:03:40.079> of<00:03:40.199> those<00:03:40.290> things

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
and you know it's one of those things

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.259 
and you know it's one of those things
