00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.500
 And the discussion tomorrow about the mediator will be Candy Crowley 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.250
 Wah ... It's a city hall shape where 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.760
 Members of the public have to ask this question and Candy Crowley Wood Pellet 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.159
 Mike was basically the audience again to ask that question 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.589
 The neck and he recently had a blog on TV and video it 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:21.279
 He wants to follow up the questions and you'll find out if you find these phones will not ask 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.309
 The question you know is that I will once say a chance for me to follow up 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:28.340
 He said hey what works so why will the A to Z 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.329
 Anyway I let go to the show bar and explained why she imagined her role in 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.130
 Have sex in the day 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.389
 Do not try on me 

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:36.770
 This is why keep 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.020
 When this is you about this or do not think it's not about yours 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.880
 It is what these two players can go and think you will definitely do 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.690
 He was s_ and he was like parenting 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.300
 Know if you ever decide you ever had to do something then 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.079
 You find yourself doing after I also think it helps when they see past Rockingham 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.659
 Here's a great lecture 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.099
 Right here in the courtyard while something looked f_y_i_ which is really William 

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:02.159
 As if I were in a room what was to be obeyed by him when Dylard was last 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:02.809
 It was 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.490
 The miles are wide but kind to shrink that 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.910
 None of the kind doing things matter is gonna sneak off for you 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.970
 Then what I think I have accepted is that this is all that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.820
 I bet on doing so there's never any show that passes there ever a piece 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.550
 To write that I do not look back to what happened in the gospel without it 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.130
 Starting to ask follow-up questions will cause this a major problem with 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.870
 Campaigns I think that is what happened ah ... Jod Commission 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.700
 The dates of which is in fact 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.850
 It is not a nonpartisan committee 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.220
 This people is actually I think it was the right of the two-party commission gap 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.830
 The whole point of the commission is to make the sides look good, and they do 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.020
 Not once a month some reporters rolling out he still has a full-size 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.549
 I came out thinking about what 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.539
 With strong complaints about Crowley's statements to our dessert and want to 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.279
 In your car and make sure they do not ask follow-up questions 

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:53.709
 They want her to be basically a growth microphone moving from person to person 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:54.629
 Delivered 

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:56.540
 I do not quite know what the purpose of it is 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.189
 But she does not want any follow-ups 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.469
 They will not want to have bait as a chance for them 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.870
 Points of dialogue that 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.170
 This comes from no Obama as well as MIT Romney I think this is from 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.960
 right 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.260
 When I see this from the left side I must say I am very disappointed 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.450
 Well the right one people do not understand is the way they used to do 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.319
 And Pitts 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.319
 The league of women voters would now organize discussions and ask that would 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.680
 Candidates were the ones who pretty much 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.060
 The whole show ran well as soon as I figured we might be gonna do 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.450
 Discuss every time there is an electrician until the elections have decided 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.680
 To take on any sense that they are politicians of the Democrats 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.970
 Republicans in and eliminated the league debates women voters 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.010
 They decided to have the body that is the peak of purchase does not 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.930
 Bipartisan participation is not the same thing 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.330
 So decide that it was the easiest way what shape we look at 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.700
 The best that will cause is the most harmless Lisa Mona Harmony chose it 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.489
 And then get to choose a broker 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.280
 The truth is on this story 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.599
 Ah ... Candy Crowley comes out and says she'll ask for follow-up 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.690
 questions 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.980
 Both campaigns get wind from them 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.810
 And they do not know whether we have no reports that even agreement 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.790
 They did not have a great dessert with Crowley and there was a consensus with 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.520
 c_n_n_ have an agreement with each other so that they are going to make the euthanasia 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.090
 Brooke's Obama campaigns agreed what was going to happen and they did and did not even 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.889
 The trouble of asking a person for news is how much this news 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.599
 This is a symbol of the problem we have in America today 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.329
 Our political process is completely dominated by no existence 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.379
 Honest discussion of ideas all about who has uh better best ... aesthetics 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.450
 The best photos are better but our optics will be said 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.720
 So you have uni so you need to have a urine filter you can have it 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.769
 Can not be short they need uh ... know you looked like the president 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:42.969
 It's all about 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.219
 Uh ... in a style more than content rather than having a strong discussion 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.849
 Where we can understand her thoughts and here we are just talking point and 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.859
 Which I could not believe the two sides are happy and the fact that 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.419
 They want to 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.999
 The media that is not docile asks any question to follow any fluctuations in the East on 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.279
 Cancer in a news move on this day what they want, that's what they are 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:06.899
 Get to get to work 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:10.599
 I mean we did not see on the east side to go one after 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.219
 Uh ... candidates 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.369
 It's very rarely done too, when they do 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:16.370
 Very strong 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.659
 You talk about the fold media on the job do not ask curly 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.940
 Politicians came to the fire I think I prefer 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.159
 I also said that before the presentation the problem is that the media good news 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.559
 Uh ... The way our system is set up is to hit the media like a check on 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:31.380
 Energy 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.559
 Not only the political power but also the right companies power 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.960
 What happened was these people news 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.790
 The cover of political investigation in the investigation of companies 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.330
 Corporate law so I am sick and tired of them I will go by those 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.180
 newspeople 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.530
 So bought in newspeople and then bought the government now so it is 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.680
 All large companies are run unilaterally 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.190
 Uh ... it's one big big monopoly companies that run everything up to the rain 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.020
 this is the reason 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.659
 All you get there is no press that happens infrequently 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.860
 It never happened and that's why 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.770
 Uh ... we have a system that we have so this is what we stress on 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.900
 The problems of the problem is that the people that it was 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.020
 But not our IEA what is old tells our fox 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.619
 Guarding the chicken house 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:13.889
 This is true even with people who should be investigated 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.909
 In fact the investigators 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.289
 This is what we give people like uh ... 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.169
 David Gregory and John Stossel v. Wah ... 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.819
 Candy and Crowley know I mean I do not know much about it I want to beat 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.889
 To belittle it pretended it was doing a bad job 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.659
 But who 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.979
 But I'm guessing she'll what this means oh ... this is one of the other 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.830
 Minds I think he was going so I want you guys to think about this guy I am 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.309
 Not sure 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:41.069
 Uh ... they were saying they waited for Keno Musharraf to come along before 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:42.809
 But they were jumping 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.229
 With this kind of uh ... you know I think is an earlier attack line for them to do 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.860
 That discussion is saying 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.949
 Source sessions will automatically drop this other woman 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.529
 Journalist X says the observers are ever hoping they will climb up like women's rights 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.979
 But the thing they do is do it to the male supervisor and say before you are you 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.039
 going to 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.219
 Do it this way because we need you to bend your Dennis 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.160
 In the standard on BIOS 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.840
 I count on the split is to stay that we were just had just the rest of Martha 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.139
 One other incredible side was attacked by her and Xia 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.300
 If you have a rat that actually does its job I think I actually asked 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.479
 Kind of such a good follow-up questions 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.619
 And now they're coming after Candy Crowley's suggestion is that 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:26.569
 Maybe she will do it because she will not be a mother ... I am 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.919
 Not sure about what I mean by opinion whether it is a man or a woman 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:30.789
 But 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.740
 Clearly what they are doing is 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.719
 Acting themselves Crowley Paula said Martha direct Yeah we did like it at 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:39.300
 All yes if you want to go back to being Jim to Harr with Yes
