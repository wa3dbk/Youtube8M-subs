00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
before i put it up on you know did it

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.139 
before i put it up on you know did it
post<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.649> did<00:01:55.799> video<00:01:55.950> about<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.549> but

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
post about it or did video about it but

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
post about it or did video about it but
um<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.570> might<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.899> able<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.140> find<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.860> other

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
um you might be able to find the other

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.310 
um you might be able to find the other
ones<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.579> energy<00:02:00.200> apparently<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
ones like the energy apparently the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.709 
ones like the energy apparently the
super<00:02:01.619> beat<00:02:01.799> energies<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.460> even<00:02:02.670> cheaper

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
super beat energies are even cheaper

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.380 
super beat energies are even cheaper
than<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.079> super<00:02:04.530> omega-3s<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.729> i<00:02:06.060> think<00:02:06.149> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
than the super omega-3s so i think that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.390 
than the super omega-3s so i think that
on<00:02:07.970> CBS<00:02:08.970> com<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:09.660> 999<00:02:10.440> my<00:02:10.770> store<00:02:11.009> was<00:02:11.220> out<00:02:11.340> of

on CBS com there 999 my store was out of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.090 
on CBS com there 999 my store was out of

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
I don't even recall what the price was
