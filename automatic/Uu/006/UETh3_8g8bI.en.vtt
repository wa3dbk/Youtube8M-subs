going<00:00:08.640> to<00:00:08.790> look<00:00:08.910> at<00:00:09.090> thick<00:00:09.360> skin<00:00:10.340> this<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.400> a

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
going to look at thick skin this is a

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.879 
going to look at thick skin this is a
histological<00:00:12.420> section<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.960> thick<00:00:13.320> skin<00:00:13.650> and

underneath the epidermis this lighter
pink<00:00:29.310> area<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.180> dermal<00:00:30.630> layer<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.080> skin

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
pink area is the dermal layer of skin

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.639 
pink area is the dermal layer of skin
you<00:00:32.600> should<00:00:33.600> know<00:00:33.749> that<00:00:33.929> it's<00:00:34.050> made<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.409> of<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
you should know that it's made up of a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.529 
you should know that it's made up of a
connective<00:00:35.159> tissue<00:00:35.399> dense<00:00:35.850> irregular

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
connective tissue dense irregular

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.779 
connective tissue dense irregular
connective<00:00:36.690> tissue<00:00:37.409> and<00:00:38.219> has<00:00:38.370> lots<00:00:38.639> of

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
connective tissue and has lots of

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.119 
connective tissue and has lots of
collagen<00:00:39.269> fibers<00:00:39.299> and<00:00:39.870> some<00:00:40.079> elastic<00:00:40.679> fibers

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
collagen fibers and some elastic fibers

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.329 
collagen fibers and some elastic fibers
to<00:00:41.309> give<00:00:41.339> it<00:00:41.579> resiliency<00:00:43.039> underneath<00:00:44.039> the

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
to give it resiliency underneath the

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.110 
to give it resiliency underneath the
dermis<00:00:44.729> we<00:00:45.299> have<00:00:45.479> the<00:00:45.899> hypodermis<00:00:46.319> or

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
dermis we have the hypodermis or

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.389 
dermis we have the hypodermis or
subcutaneous<00:00:48.120> tissue<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.859> this<00:00:49.859> is<00:00:50.039> made<00:00:50.219> up

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
subcutaneous tissue and this is made up

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.219 
subcutaneous tissue and this is made up
mostly<00:00:50.909> of<00:00:51.030> adipose<00:00:51.629> tissue

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
mostly of adipose tissue

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.949 
mostly of adipose tissue
there's<00:00:53.219> also<00:00:53.429> areolar<00:00:53.940> tissue<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.749> but

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:54.959 
there's also areolar tissue in here but

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:56.539 
there's also areolar tissue in here but
you<00:00:55.260> can't<00:00:55.499> really<00:00:55.709> visualize<00:00:55.889> it<00:00:56.369> in<00:00:56.459> this

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:56.549 
you can't really visualize it in this

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:59.869 
you can't really visualize it in this
image<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.319> hypodermis<00:00:58.699> which<00:00:59.699> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
image so this is hypodermis which is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.439 
image so this is hypodermis which is
adipose<00:01:00.329> tissue<00:01:01.729> this<00:01:02.729> is<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.059> dermis<00:01:03.420> which

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
adipose tissue this is the dermis which

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.789 
adipose tissue this is the dermis which
is<00:01:04.170> dense<00:01:04.670> irregular<00:01:05.670> tissue<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
is dense irregular tissue and this is

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.399 
is dense irregular tissue and this is
the<00:01:08.430> epidermis<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.359> in<00:01:09.899> terms<00:01:10.079> of<00:01:10.229> tissue

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the epidermis and in terms of tissue

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.029 
the epidermis and in terms of tissue
types<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.219> is<00:01:11.630> stratified<00:01:12.630> squamous

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
types this one is stratified squamous

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.330 
types this one is stratified squamous
epithelium<00:01:14.960> let's<00:01:15.960> move<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.469> close-up<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
epithelium let's move to a close-up of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.789 
epithelium let's move to a close-up of
the<00:01:17.579> epidermis<00:01:18.359> and<00:01:18.539> we'll<00:01:19.170> talk<00:01:19.350> about<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the epidermis and we'll talk about the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.490 
the epidermis and we'll talk about the
five<00:01:20.039> layers<00:01:20.969> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.359> epidermis<00:01:21.539> that<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.289> see

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
five layers of the epidermis that we see

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.819 
five layers of the epidermis that we see
with<00:01:22.679> thick<00:01:22.920> skin<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.750> bottom<00:01:25.229> most<00:01:25.439> layer

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
with thick skin the bottom most layer

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.539 
with thick skin the bottom most layer
down<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.810> kind<00:01:28.109> of<00:01:28.170> curls<00:01:28.469> through<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
down here that kind of curls through the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.709 
down here that kind of curls through the
image<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.560> called<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.679> basal<00:01:32.189> layer<00:01:32.719> the

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
image is called the basal layer the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.020 
image is called the basal layer the
basal<00:01:34.200> layer<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:34.799> cells<00:01:35.219> are<00:01:35.429> dividing

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
basal layer is where cells are dividing

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.149 
basal layer is where cells are dividing
the<00:01:36.359> skin<00:01:36.630> stem<00:01:36.990> cells<00:01:37.289> are<00:01:37.499> dividing<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the skin stem cells are dividing and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.730 
the skin stem cells are dividing and
giving<00:01:38.399> rise<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:39.060> skin<00:01:39.420> cells<00:01:39.740> which

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
giving rise to more skin cells which

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.480 
giving rise to more skin cells which
contribute<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.990> epidermis<00:01:43.340> once<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
contribute to this epidermis once the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130 
contribute to this epidermis once the
cells<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:44.880> produced<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.479> move<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:45.899> through

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
cells are produced they move up through

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.359 
cells are produced they move up through
these<00:01:46.289> other<00:01:46.499> layers<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.920> we'll<00:01:47.189> discuss

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
these other layers that we'll discuss

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.880 
these other layers that we'll discuss
and<00:01:47.939> ultimately<00:01:48.450> leave<00:01:48.810> off<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.679> top

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and ultimately leave off of the top

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.700 
and ultimately leave off of the top
layer<00:01:50.179> we<00:01:51.179> lose<00:01:51.420> cells<00:01:51.899> off<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> surface

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
layer we lose cells off of the surface

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.580 
layer we lose cells off of the surface
of<00:01:53.009> our<00:01:53.100> skin<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.520> day<00:01:53.549> long

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
of our skin all day long

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.679 
of our skin all day long
so<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.159> stratum<00:01:56.759> basale<00:01:56.939> down<00:01:57.329> here

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
so that's the stratum basale down here

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.349 
so that's the stratum basale down here
the<00:01:58.679> stratum<00:01:59.009> spinosum<00:01:59.249> is<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.819> next<00:02:00.149> layer

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
the stratum spinosum is the next layer

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.080 
the stratum spinosum is the next layer
and<00:02:00.600> most<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> living<00:02:01.979> cells<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.549> skin<00:02:02.880> are

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and most of the living cells of skin are

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.629 
and most of the living cells of skin are
in<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.389> layer<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.280> stratum

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:05.639 
in this layer so this is stratum

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.320 
in this layer so this is stratum
spinosum<00:02:06.950> stratum<00:02:07.950> granulosum<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.759> next<00:02:09.179> it's

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
spinosum stratum granulosum is next it's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.390 
spinosum stratum granulosum is next it's
here<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.409> can<00:02:10.590> see<00:02:10.799> that<00:02:10.950> these<00:02:11.099> cells

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
here and you can see that these cells

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.420 
here and you can see that these cells
look<00:02:11.730> more<00:02:11.970> granular<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.930> appearance

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
look more granular in appearance

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.130 
look more granular in appearance
above<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.580> stratum<00:02:15.910> granulosum<00:02:15.990> we<00:02:16.990> have

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
above the stratum granulosum we have

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.180 
above the stratum granulosum we have
stratum<00:02:17.560> lucidum<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> more

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
stratum lucidum this is a more

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.930 
stratum lucidum this is a more
translucent<00:02:22.000> layer<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:24.580> above<00:02:24.820> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
translucent layer and then above the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.900 
translucent layer and then above the
stratum<00:02:25.300> lucidum<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.860> have<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.520> stratum

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
stratum lucidum we have the stratum

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.980 
stratum lucidum we have the stratum
corneum<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:30.090> thick<00:02:31.090> layer<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.720> dead

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
corneum a thick layer of dead

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.040 
corneum a thick layer of dead
keratinized<00:02:32.800> flattened<00:02:33.490> cells<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.270> makes<00:02:34.870> up

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
keratinized flattened cells and makes up

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.840 
keratinized flattened cells and makes up
a<00:02:35.170> very<00:02:35.350> tough<00:02:35.740> outer<00:02:36.340> part<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.150> skin<00:02:38.850> so

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
a very tough outer part of the skin so

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.450 
a very tough outer part of the skin so
those<00:02:40.000> are<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.270> layers<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.560> epidermis<00:02:41.740> as

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
those are the layers of the epidermis as

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.180 
those are the layers of the epidermis as
long<00:02:43.420> as<00:02:43.600> we're<00:02:43.780> on<00:02:43.810> epidermis<00:02:44.770> let<00:02:44.950> me<00:02:45.040> show

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
long as we're on epidermis let me show

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.350 
long as we're on epidermis let me show
you<00:02:45.250> some<00:02:45.490> other<00:02:45.640> structures<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.270> can

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
you some other structures that you can

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.710 
you some other structures that you can
see<00:02:46.660> in<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:46.900> image<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> meissner's

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
see in this image this is a meissner's

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.050 
see in this image this is a meissner's
corpuscle<00:02:50.290> or<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.970> tactile<00:02:51.970> corpuscle<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.910> is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
corpuscle or a tactile corpuscle it is

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.300 
corpuscle or a tactile corpuscle it is
used<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.630> detect<00:02:55.930> touch<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.830> surface<00:02:57.160> of

used to detect touch on the surface of

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.550 
used to detect touch on the surface of
our<00:02:57.430> skin<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.690> thick<00:02:58.960> skin<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.440> your

our skin and in the thick skin of your

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.950 
our skin and in the thick skin of your
fingertips<00:03:00.160> especially<00:03:00.790> there<00:03:01.330> are<00:03:01.360> lots<00:03:01.750> of

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
fingertips especially there are lots of

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.480 
fingertips especially there are lots of
these<00:03:02.110> meissner's<00:03:02.680> corpuscles<00:03:04.170> in<00:03:05.490> this

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
these meissner's corpuscles in this

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.380 
these meissner's corpuscles in this
image<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:06.970> can<00:03:07.150> also<00:03:07.330> see<00:03:07.840> pigmentation<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
image you can also see pigmentation the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.040 
image you can also see pigmentation the
darker<00:03:10.930> area<00:03:11.350> here<00:03:11.770> is<00:03:12.390> produced<00:03:13.390> by<00:03:13.540> melanin

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
darker area here is produced by melanin

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.340 
darker area here is produced by melanin
and<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:15.130> cell<00:03:15.430> here<00:03:15.970> maybe<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.510> Milano<00:03:16.960> site

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
and this cell here maybe a Milano site

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.710 
and this cell here maybe a Milano site
that's<00:03:17.620> making<00:03:18.070> those<00:03:18.310> pigment<00:03:19.060> granules<00:03:19.540> I'm

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
that's making those pigment granules I'm

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.390 
that's making those pigment granules I'm
not<00:03:19.840> positive<00:03:20.380> though<00:03:20.530> but<00:03:21.280> they're

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
not positive though but they're

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.500 
not positive though but they're
certainly<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.790> Milano<00:03:22.120> site<00:03:22.360> in<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
certainly a Milano site in the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.580 
certainly a Milano site in the
neighborhood<00:03:22.930> when<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.260> see<00:03:23.410> this

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
neighborhood when you see this

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.970 
neighborhood when you see this
pigmentation<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:25.350> think<00:03:26.350> that's<00:03:26.530> about<00:03:26.650> all<00:03:26.860> we

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
pigmentation I think that's about all we

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.900 
pigmentation I think that's about all we
can<00:03:27.130> see<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.640> this<00:03:28.200> higher<00:03:29.910> magnification

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
can see in this higher magnification

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.700 
can see in this higher magnification
let's<00:03:31.480> go<00:03:31.630> back<00:03:31.810> down<00:03:32.020> here<00:03:32.260> we'll<00:03:32.410> move<00:03:32.560> away

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
let's go back down here we'll move away

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.790 
let's go back down here we'll move away
from<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.190> epidermis<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.030> go<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.380> dermal

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
from the epidermis and go to the dermal

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.130 
from the epidermis and go to the dermal
layer<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.310> skin<00:03:36.550> so<00:03:37.330> this<00:03:37.480> is<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.750> dermis

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
layer of the skin so this is the dermis

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.530 
layer of the skin so this is the dermis
and<00:03:38.290> again<00:03:38.710> it's<00:03:39.010> dense<00:03:39.700> irregular

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
and again it's dense irregular

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.750 
and again it's dense irregular
connective<00:03:40.660> tissue<00:03:41.320> lots<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.460> lots<00:03:42.610> of

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
connective tissue lots and lots of

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.300 
connective tissue lots and lots of
collagen<00:03:43.300> fibers<00:03:43.330> here<00:03:43.990> but<00:03:44.800> also<00:03:44.920> some

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
collagen fibers here but also some

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.490 
collagen fibers here but also some
elastic<00:03:45.790> fibers<00:03:46.210> to<00:03:46.360> give<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.630> resiliency

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.680 

structures<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.680> are<00:03:51.060> thought<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.270> be<00:03:52.420> in<00:03:52.660> the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
structures that are thought to be in the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.610 
structures that are thought to be in the
epidermis<00:03:54.090> sweat<00:03:55.090> glands<00:03:55.540> which<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.230> can<00:03:56.440> see

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
epidermis sweat glands which you can see

these sweat glands are said to have
their<00:04:16.299> home<00:04:16.510> in<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.960> dermal<00:04:17.320> layer<00:04:17.470> but<00:04:17.710> you

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
their home in the dermal layer but you

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.860 
their home in the dermal layer but you
