this is the final part of my series on
why<00:00:11.429> can't<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.820> lose<00:00:12.059> weight<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.950> today's<00:00:13.950> part

why can't I lose weight and today's part

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.109 
why can't I lose weight and today's part
what<00:00:14.759> I'm<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> be<00:00:15.389> discussing<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.230> how

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
what I'm going to be discussing is how

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.760 
what I'm going to be discussing is how
estrogen<00:00:18.140> particularly<00:00:19.140> synthetic

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
estrogen particularly synthetic

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.260 
estrogen particularly synthetic
estrogens<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.520> chemicals<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.970> mimic

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
estrogens and chemicals that mimic

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.540 
estrogens and chemicals that mimic
estrogen<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:22.529> interfere<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.460> ability

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
estrogen can interfere with your ability

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.570 
estrogen can interfere with your ability
to<00:00:23.820> lose<00:00:24.119> weight<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:25.039> we<00:00:26.039> discussed<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
to lose weight as we discussed in the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.070 
to lose weight as we discussed in the
last<00:00:26.609> video<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> things<00:00:27.930> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
last video one of the things that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.299 
last video one of the things that
happens<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:29.330> as<00:00:30.330> excess<00:00:31.109> estrogen

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
happens is that as excess estrogen

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.950 
happens is that as excess estrogen
particularly<00:00:32.309> synthetic<00:00:32.880> estrogen<00:00:33.420> can

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
particularly synthetic estrogen can

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
particularly synthetic estrogen can
block<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.590> receptor<00:00:35.100> sites<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.880> cells

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
block the receptor sites on the cells

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.720 
block the receptor sites on the cells
for<00:00:36.510> thyroid<00:00:36.660> hormone<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.550> even<00:00:38.550> though<00:00:38.670> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
for thyroid hormone and even though you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.950 
for thyroid hormone and even though you
have<00:00:38.820> perfectly<00:00:39.570> normal<00:00:40.110> thyroid<00:00:40.290> levels<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
have perfectly normal thyroid levels the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.389 
have perfectly normal thyroid levels the
function<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.110> thought<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.829> read<00:00:44.010> hormone

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
function of that thought I read hormone

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.209 
function of that thought I read hormone
may<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.610> low<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.750> let's<00:00:46.469> call<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.070> you

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
may be low and then let's call this you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.549 
may be low and then let's call this you
to<00:00:47.430> gain<00:00:47.670> some<00:00:47.910> weight<00:00:48.140> but<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.289> are<00:00:49.350> other

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
to gain some weight but there are other

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.400 
to gain some weight but there are other
aspects<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.129> estrogen<00:00:50.579> ranking<00:00:50.940> also

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
aspects of estrogen ranking also

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
aspects of estrogen ranking also
estrogen<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.980> itself<00:00:53.399> even<00:00:53.789> natural

estrogen in and of itself even natural
estrogen<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.860> fat<00:00:56.489> storing<00:00:56.969> type<00:00:57.149> of

estrogen is a fat storing type of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.709 
estrogen is a fat storing type of
hormone<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:59.340> know<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.699> women<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.239> is

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
hormone it's you know for women it is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.100 
hormone it's you know for women it is
there<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:02.309> high<00:01:02.550> levels<00:01:03.030> primarily<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
there in high levels primarily to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.609 
there in high levels primarily to
support<00:01:05.450> childbirth<00:01:06.450> flexors<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.320> that's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
support childbirth flexors that's that's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.300 
support childbirth flexors that's that's
what<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.860> there<00:01:07.890> for

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
what it's there for

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.760 
what it's there for
men<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.630> estrogen<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:10.290> well<00:01:10.500> it's

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
men do you have estrogen as well it's

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.250 
men do you have estrogen as well it's
produced<00:01:11.070> by<00:01:11.100> their<00:01:11.340> adrenal<00:01:11.729> plants<00:01:12.260> versus

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
produced by their adrenal plants versus

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.770 
produced by their adrenal plants versus
in<00:01:13.439> women<00:01:14.310> who<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.729> pre<00:01:15.000> menopausal<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.720> is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
in women who are pre menopausal it is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.969 
in women who are pre menopausal it is
produced<00:01:16.110> by<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> ovaries<00:01:16.409> in

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
produced by the ovaries in

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.310 
produced by the ovaries in
postmenopausal<00:01:17.909> women<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.869> produced

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
postmenopausal women it's produced

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.670 
postmenopausal women it's produced
mostly<00:01:19.950> by<00:01:20.159> again<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.720> men<00:01:21.930> by<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
mostly by again just like in men by the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.800 
mostly by again just like in men by the
adrenal<00:01:23.130> glands<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:26.460> problems<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.090> most

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
adrenal glands so the problems that most

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.890 
adrenal glands so the problems that most
people<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.950> excess<00:01:29.670> estrogen<00:01:29.900> are

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
people have with excess estrogen are

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.719 
people have with excess estrogen are
actually<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.680> usually<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.310> synthetic

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
actually do usually to synthetic

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.170 
actually do usually to synthetic
estrogens<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.100> this<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> form<00:01:36.090> of

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
estrogens and this can be in the form of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.590 
estrogens and this can be in the form of
birth<00:01:36.990> control<00:01:37.020> pills<00:01:38.030> hormone<00:01:39.030> replacement

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
birth control pills hormone replacement

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
birth control pills hormone replacement
therapy<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.470> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.950> women<00:01:41.159> are<00:01:41.250> taking

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
therapy that a lot of women are taking

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
therapy that a lot of women are taking
at<00:01:41.850> least<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.659> synthetic<00:01:43.170> hormone

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
at least the the synthetic hormone

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.510 
at least the the synthetic hormone
replacement<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:45.530> when<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.159> excess

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
replacement and when you get this excess

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
replacement and when you get this excess
estrogen<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.479> air<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:48.840> thyroid

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
estrogen they can air for your thyroid

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.870 
estrogen they can air for your thyroid
function<00:01:49.290> as<00:01:49.770> we've<00:01:49.920> already<00:01:50.130> discussed<00:01:50.310> it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
function as we've already discussed it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.200 
function as we've already discussed it
also<00:01:51.420> tends<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> cause<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.439> body<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:53.280> deposit

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
also tends to cause the body to deposit

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.690 
also tends to cause the body to deposit
weight<00:01:54.600> around<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.229> pelvic<00:01:55.590> area<00:01:55.770> yeah<00:01:56.490> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
weight around the pelvic area yeah this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.780 
weight around the pelvic area yeah this
is<00:01:56.850> how<00:01:57.030> related<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:58.189> childbirth<00:01:59.189> functions

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
is how related to childbirth functions

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.420 
is how related to childbirth functions
you<00:02:00.180> basically<00:02:00.659> are<00:02:00.840> trying<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:02.369> know

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you basically are trying to you know

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.999 
you basically are trying to you know
support<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.450> pelvis<00:02:04.110> which<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.770> where

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
support the the pelvis which is where

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.670 
support the the pelvis which is where
you're<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:07.200> issues<00:02:07.469> with

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
you're going to have the issues with

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.710 
you're going to have the issues with
childbirth

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
childbirth

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.160 
childbirth
so<00:02:10.180> estrogen<00:02:11.180> causeless<00:02:11.570> you<00:02:11.690> beginning<00:02:11.990> wait

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
so estrogen causeless you beginning wait

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
people buy organic I know that that's a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.160 
people buy organic I know that that's a
more<00:04:27.100> expensive<00:04:27.490> way<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:27.880> shop<00:04:28.570> for<00:04:28.810> produce

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
there better than others in terms of how

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.940 
there better than others in terms of how
much<00:04:36.880> or<00:04:37.210> little<00:04:37.470> pesticide<00:04:38.470> residue<00:04:38.920> you

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
much or little pesticide residue you

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.610 
much or little pesticide residue you
find<00:04:39.340> on<00:04:39.550> them<00:04:39.870> things<00:04:40.870> like<00:04:41.050> broccoli<00:04:41.260> are

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
find on them things like broccoli are

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.710 
find on them things like broccoli are
usually<00:04:41.950> pretty<00:04:42.190> good<00:04:42.280> things<00:04:43.270> like<00:04:43.420> lettuce

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
usually pretty good things like lettuce

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.430 
usually pretty good things like lettuce
are<00:04:43.990> usually<00:04:44.320> pretty<00:04:44.530> bad<00:04:44.830> but<00:04:45.610> basically<00:04:46.600> you

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
are usually pretty bad but basically you

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.650 
are usually pretty bad but basically you
know<00:04:47.530> if<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.770> don't<00:04:47.950> want<00:04:48.130> to<00:04:48.190> buy<00:04:48.310> organic

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
know if you don't want to buy organic

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.120 
know if you don't want to buy organic
then<00:04:49.660> you<00:04:49.840> want<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.050> make<00:04:50.200> sure<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:50.770> you

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
then you want to make sure that you you

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.670 
then you want to make sure that you you
wash<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.940> fruits<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.020> vegetables<00:04:53.110> very

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
wash the fruits and vegetables very

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.159 
wash the fruits and vegetables very
thoroughly<00:04:54.070> before<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:55.120> consume<00:04:55.540> them<00:04:55.690> it

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
thoroughly before you consume them it

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.570 
thoroughly before you consume them it
doesn't<00:04:56.620> solve<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.919> problem<00:04:57.250> all<00:04:57.340> together

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
doesn't solve the problem all together

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.670 
doesn't solve the problem all together
you're<00:04:58.150> still<00:04:58.360> far<00:04:58.570> better<00:04:58.720> off<00:04:58.990> with<00:04:59.169> organic

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
you're still far better off with organic

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.380 
you're still far better off with organic
but<00:05:00.370> at<00:05:00.669> least<00:05:00.790> it<00:05:01.030> reduces<00:05:01.510> the<00:05:01.750> issue<00:05:03.390> other

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
but at least it reduces the issue other

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.270 
but at least it reduces the issue other
things<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.960> are<00:05:05.110> there<00:05:05.410> involved<00:05:05.919> is<00:05:06.070> just

they contain synthetic estrogens in them
as<00:05:41.350> well<00:05:41.380> so<00:05:41.950> again<00:05:42.840> better<00:05:43.840> government<00:05:44.110> order

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
as well so again better government order

as well so again better government order
well<00:05:44.890> in<00:05:44.979> the<00:05:45.070> case<00:05:45.190> of<00:05:45.370> meat<00:05:45.490> you<00:05:45.610> wonder<00:05:45.880> what

well in the case of meat you wonder what

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.550 
well in the case of meat you wonder what
natural<00:05:46.360> meats<00:05:46.540> things<00:05:46.780> have<00:05:46.930> been<00:05:47.080> raised

natural meats things have been raised
with<00:05:47.680> Alpes<00:05:48.310> hormones<00:05:49.050> same<00:05:50.050> with<00:05:50.200> dairy

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
with Alpes hormones same with dairy

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.090 
with Alpes hormones same with dairy
products<00:05:50.830> if<00:05:51.010> possible<00:05:52.050> but<00:05:53.050> that's<00:05:53.320> that's

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
products if possible but that's that's

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.280 
products if possible but that's that's
basically<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:55.000> approach<00:05:55.390> there<00:05:55.840> as<00:05:55.960> you<00:05:56.080> want

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
to avoid these extra estrogens as much

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.120 
to avoid these extra estrogens as much
as<00:05:59.350> you<00:05:59.470> can<00:06:00.390> for<00:06:01.390> those<00:06:01.600> people<00:06:02.200> who<00:06:02.470> have<00:06:02.800> a
