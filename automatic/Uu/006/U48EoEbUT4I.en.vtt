00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the speaker's over here from JBL display

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.920 
the speaker's over here from JBL display
there's<00:00:45.420> your<00:00:46.820> webcam<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.850> let's<00:00:48.450> go<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
there's your webcam and let's go to the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.190 
there's your webcam and let's go to the
desktop<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.100> check<00:00:50.400> out<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.480> screen

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
desktop so we can check out the screen

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.380 
desktop so we can check out the screen
resolution<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.220> it's<00:00:53.520> full<00:00:54.000> HD<00:00:54.950> 1920<00:00:55.950> x<00:00:56.100> 1080

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
resolution so it's full HD 1920 x 1080

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.460 
resolution so it's full HD 1920 x 1080
pixels<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:59.900> think<00:01:00.900> there<00:01:01.019> will<00:01:01.110> be<00:01:01.260> many

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
pixels I think there will be many

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.740 
pixels I think there will be many
configurations<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:03.120> particular<00:01:03.269> model

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
configurations but this particular model

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.560 
configurations but this particular model
has<00:01:03.900> an<00:01:04.170> intel<00:01:04.559> core<00:01:04.589> i5<00:01:04.920> processor<00:01:06.050> 45-10<00:01:07.050> you

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
has an intel core i5 processor 45-10 you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.219 
has an intel core i5 processor 45-10 you
two<00:01:09.140> point<00:01:09.350> six<00:01:09.920> years<00:01:10.250> in<00:01:11.240> turbo<00:01:11.630> modes<00:01:11.930> maybe

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
two point six years in turbo modes maybe

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.469 
two point six years in turbo modes maybe
and<00:01:12.590> right<00:01:12.860> now<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.100> two<00:01:13.520> big<00:01:13.729> yards<00:01:14.000> and

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
and right now the two big yards and

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.360 
and right now the two big yards and
eight<00:01:14.750> gigs<00:01:15.110> over<00:01:15.350> em

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.610 

so<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.360> specs<00:01:19.600> are<00:01:19.750> pretty<00:01:19.960> interesting<00:01:20.110> we

see

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
see

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.399 
see
this<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:20.980> how<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.250> looks<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.689> can<00:02:22.870> just

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
this is how it looks but you can just

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.949 
this is how it looks but you can just
twist<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.159> around<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:25.030> have<00:02:25.209> this<00:02:25.390> angled

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
twist it around and have this angled

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.729 
twist it around and have this angled
position<00:02:26.140> which<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:26.709> much<00:02:27.670> better<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.739> using

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
position which is much better for using

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.190
