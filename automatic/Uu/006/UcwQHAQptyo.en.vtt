00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
through done and done well actually if I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.240 
through done and done well actually if I
go<00:02:28.950> ahead<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.520> destroy<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.780> door<00:02:31.319> minecraft

go ahead and destroy this door minecraft

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.449 
go ahead and destroy this door minecraft
actually<00:02:32.819> realizes<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.870> gap<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.410> no<00:02:34.830> matter

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
actually realizes the gap and no matter

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.479 
actually realizes the gap and no matter
how<00:02:35.910> many<00:02:36.270> times<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:37.020> put<00:02:37.050> down<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.980> painting

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
how many times I put down this painting

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.380 
how many times I put down this painting
it<00:02:38.670> will<00:02:39.269> not<00:02:39.780> jump<00:02:40.469> over<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:41.219> gap<00:02:41.579> so<00:02:41.849> what

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
it will not jump over that gap so what

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.040 
it will not jump over that gap so what
we<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:42.750> to

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
we have to

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.490 
we have to
do<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.380> trick<00:02:44.370> minecraft<00:02:45.210> into<00:02:45.870> thinking<00:02:46.470> that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
there are blocks there and we trick it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.030 
there are blocks there and we trick it
with<00:02:49.890> another<00:02:50.280> block<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:51.210> is<00:02:51.600> able<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.770> you

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
with another block that is able that you

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.830 
with another block that is able that you
as<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> player<00:02:53.640> are<00:02:53.790> able<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.180> walk<00:02:54.570> through

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
as a player are able to walk through

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.160 
as a player are able to walk through
like<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.560> door<00:02:56.000> now<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:57.840> achieved

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
like a door now this can be achieved

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.730 
like a door now this can be achieved
with<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.710> few<00:02:59.070> other<00:02:59.340> things<00:02:59.430> like<00:03:00.000> signs<00:03:00.750> over

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
with a few other things like signs over

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.180 
with a few other things like signs over
here<00:03:01.950> we<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.460> Finn's<00:03:03.150> gates<00:03:03.600> uh<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.860> can

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
here we have Finn's gates uh and you can

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.270 
here we have Finn's gates uh and you can
use<00:03:05.610> these<00:03:05.880> things<00:03:06.240> but<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.800> use<00:03:07.830> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
use these things but I like to use the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.190 
use these things but I like to use the
door<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.000> reason<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.570> like<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.780> use<00:03:09.960> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
door and the reason I like to use the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.310 
door and the reason I like to use the
door<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.680> because<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.910> be<00:03:12.090> either<00:03:12.360> closed

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
door is because it can be either closed

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.400 
door is because it can be either closed
or<00:03:14.030> open<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.210> top<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:19.140> can

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
or open on top of that you can you can

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.640 
or open on top of that you can you can
control<00:03:20.160> that<00:03:20.550> with<00:03:20.940> redstone<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:22.020> little<00:03:22.500> bit

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
control that with redstone a little bit

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.320 
control that with redstone a little bit
