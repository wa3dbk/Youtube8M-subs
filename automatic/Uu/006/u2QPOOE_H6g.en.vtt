 Top Fishing Tips Offering Dynamic 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.639
 dynamic fishing kits and in this 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 Top tips board We are here at 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.679
 shop search where you already find 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 several models know that as soon as 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.859
 this one is perfect for the ones 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.350
 research staff if I had 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.689
 I brought this fishery this I was going to kill 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.490
 because it imitates the orange group sagu or 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.109
 red was catching up so this one 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.109
 here the craft and what I'm using 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.000
 is this kit here from here a sakineh but only 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.189
 with a very tiny sun also 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.620
 you can buy pasta zinho 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.079
 artificial flavored cheese do you use the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.790
 normal and just hope it goes too 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.020
 Take it, let's show you how I'm doing. 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.809
 fishing here 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.629
 so in this neighbor kit ac asac comes 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.890
 with a lead generator and such will you 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.910
 pulling the knots here the 152 is pulling 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.980
 always from the turner to the front 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.620
 the way it comes is ready to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.320
 you use as food is not the case we 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.270
 we are fishing with know how to stick 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.580
 telescope then you reserve this 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.470
 lead guard for the occasion and uses a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.510
 Here's lead research then you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.760
 It counts on olive zeal that will work 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.619
 for the balance of this sentence has 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.420
 that being balanced you can put 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.040
 also counted putting a zone to tip 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.220
 but here I am not going to show only for 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.350
 you just stay with you know you are normal 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.350
 or give the mode knot your preference 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.140
 Sumbe attack such are five alone and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.299
 here a spinner I always play him I think 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.729
 very large generator for the smallest and 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.320
 Now we'll tie a line does not 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.340
 knows that advice that you use a 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 line at least18 using 0 to 21 hours 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.470
 piabinha at this time here is on offer 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.409
 in research a stick of the ideal size 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.689
 for you to fish in capivari and taquÃ¡ 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.000
 Real twists and ninety cents is that 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.850
 inexpensive in itself will measure the size of the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.450
 now but you can not forget to cash 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.049
 You know I leave the 20 centimeters to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.090
 more 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.099
 This is going to be more or less now. 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.259
 to teach you the little thing for you very simple 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.290
 it's because it 's a hanged wireless here 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.469
 inside makes 10 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.750
 look here a zeal of the 4 turn thus and makes 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:24.040
 a shape of 18 passes in the bottom hole 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.189
 and passes into the top hole 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.170
 There you cut the surplus cut ready 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.560
 the hangman that is for you to tie 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.629
 generator at oes neps and others places 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.239
 someone in here makes a 10 way 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.489
 keep rosol generator down 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:49.459
 Then you make a shape of 18 I did not 18 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:53.150
 here now four turns four routes 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.280
 finally the tip in the hole under the 28 gives 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.090
 A little adjustment is going to go. 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.299
 it's going to not close before you close 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.419
 back in the top 8 hole but only 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.579
 hold the tip and adjust 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:11.379
 so this is a very simple name and 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:14.209
 efficient with a safety margin of 96% 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.609
 annual hanged gossip 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.500
 then you cut two to three millimeters 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.629
 saw only make that knot 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.639
 so it's there you can use it so much 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.519
 for the sun pepsi generators 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:28.909
 so here is the float right now 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.040
 lead the generator the abic and the pellet 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.109
 underneath you can also as I already said 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.919
 or fishing put another blue with 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.500
 this is natural 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:38.299
 So this is the system for you to fish. 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.970
 you will spend one baby set highlighted 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.709
 in the search maximum 20 reais 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.810
 depending on who you are buying ok 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.799
 we will go back there in capivari with more 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.799
 places for you
