hello<00:00:00.989> in<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.530> segment<00:00:01.740> we're<00:00:02.010> going<00:00:02.100> to

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hello in this segment we're going to

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.880 
hello in this segment we're going to
cover<00:00:02.750> automotive<00:00:03.750> chains<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.560> different

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
cover automotive chains the different

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.639 
cover automotive chains the different
styles<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.490> their<00:00:05.700> their<00:00:06.359> appropriate<00:00:07.290> uses

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
styles and their their appropriate uses

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.160 
styles and their their appropriate uses
basically<00:00:08.639> we<00:00:09.240> have<00:00:09.389> two<00:00:09.630> different<00:00:09.780> style

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
basically we have two different style

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.350 
basically we have two different style
chains<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.889> there's<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.700> lot<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.059> different

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
chains and there's a lot of different

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.910 
chains and there's a lot of different
variations<00:00:12.929> out<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> market<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.799> these

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
variations out on the market of these

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.440 
variations out on the market of these
chains<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:14.820> basically<00:00:15.179> two

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
chains but it's just basically two

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.150 
chains but it's just basically two
different<00:00:15.750> styles<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.199> are<00:00:16.320> are<00:00:16.560> most

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
different styles that are are most

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.910 
different styles that are are most
commonly<00:00:18.320> referred<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.500> automotive

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
commonly referred to as automotive

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.470 
commonly referred to as automotive
chains<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.520> being<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.820> cable<00:00:21.270> chain

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
chains and that being the cable chain

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.170 
chains and that being the cable chain
and<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.769> standard<00:00:23.220> chain<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.760> then

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and in this the standard chain and then

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.790 
and in this the standard chain and then
you've<00:00:24.330> got<00:00:24.510> various<00:00:24.869> combinations<00:00:25.619> of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you've got various combinations of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.519 
you've got various combinations of
mixtures<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.460> both<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.140> basic

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
mixtures of both and that the basic

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.099 
mixtures of both and that the basic
difference<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.580> standard<00:00:30.060> chain<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.810> made

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
difference is the standard chain is made

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.100 
difference is the standard chain is made
as<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.890> see<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.700> made<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.149> chain<00:00:33.420> it's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
as as you can see all made of chain it's

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.380 
as as you can see all made of chain it's
much<00:00:34.350> heavier<00:00:34.590> built<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.340> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.969> times<00:00:36.180> you'll

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
much heavier built a lot of times you'll

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290 
much heavier built a lot of times you'll
have<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:37.430> welded<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.550> portion<00:00:39.030> through<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
have a welded on portion through the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
have a welded on portion through the
center<00:00:39.600> links<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.320> hardened<00:00:40.739> material<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
center links of a hardened material to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.510 
center links of a hardened material to
give<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> better<00:00:42.360> bite<00:00:42.719> into<00:00:43.620> ice<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.370> also

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
give a better bite into ice and it also

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
give a better bite into ice and it also
gives<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.120> longer-lasting

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
gives a longer-lasting

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.930 
gives a longer-lasting
because<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.489> hardened<00:00:47.820> material

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
because it's a hardened material

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.209 
because it's a hardened material
generally<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.440> got<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> much<00:00:50.039> more

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
generally it's got a much more

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
generally it's got a much more
aggressive<00:00:50.370> bite<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.570> lot<00:00:52.110> better

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
aggressive bite to it a lot better

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.950 
aggressive bite to it a lot better
traction<00:00:53.039> capabilities<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.480> also<00:00:54.629> much

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
traction capabilities but it's also much

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.529 
traction capabilities but it's also much
bigger<00:00:55.230> much<00:00:55.980> heavier<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.480> see

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
bigger much heavier and as you can see

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.650 
bigger much heavier and as you can see
in<00:00:57.899> size<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.680> design<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.609> this<00:01:00.090> wrap<00:01:00.390> around

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
in size and design that this wrap around

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.000 
in size and design that this wrap around
your<00:01:00.840> tire<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> give<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> much

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
your tire is going to give you a much

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.130 
your tire is going to give you a much
rougher<00:01:02.280> ride<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:03.090> you're<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> smooth

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
rougher ride if you're on a smooth

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740 
rougher ride if you're on a smooth
surface<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:05.010> per<00:01:05.369> se<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.760> cable<00:01:06.240> chain<00:01:06.450> next

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
surface then per se the cable chain next

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.789 
surface then per se the cable chain next
to<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:09.119> these<00:01:09.479> are<00:01:09.540> commonly<00:01:10.020> used<00:01:10.350> mostly

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
to it and these are commonly used mostly

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.020 
to it and these are commonly used mostly
on<00:01:10.920> trucks<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.840> automotive<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:14.100> well<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
on trucks and automotive as well if you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.370 
on trucks and automotive as well if you
live<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> situation<00:01:15.720> where<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.290> gonna

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
live in a situation where you're gonna

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.020 
live in a situation where you're gonna
be<00:01:16.530> driving<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.189> snow<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.610> bad<00:01:17.790> weather

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
be driving in the snow and bad weather

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
be driving in the snow and bad weather
eight<00:01:18.570> or<00:01:18.780> nine<00:01:18.960> months<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> year<00:01:19.860> on

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
eight or nine months out of the year on

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.300 
eight or nine months out of the year on
unpaved<00:01:20.939> roads<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.689> maintained<00:01:22.439> roads<00:01:22.770> then

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
unpaved roads on maintained roads then

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
unpaved roads on maintained roads then
these<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:23.700> definitely<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.210> better<00:01:24.710> fit<00:01:25.710> for

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
these are definitely a better fit for

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.490 
these are definitely a better fit for
you<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.640> actual<00:01:27.240> change<00:01:27.930> themselves

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you this the actual change themselves

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.560 
you this the actual change themselves
will<00:01:28.650> last<00:01:28.890> longer<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.610> give<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.390> more

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
will last longer and give you more

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
will last longer and give you more
mileage<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.500> lot<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:31.740> aggressive<00:01:32.100> bite

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
mileage and a lot more aggressive bite

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.569 
mileage and a lot more aggressive bite
but<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:34.110> people<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:34.829> temporary<00:01:35.310> driving

design<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.350> cables<00:01:53.159> versus<00:01:53.549> chains<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.509> are

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
design of cables versus chains that are

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.319 
design of cables versus chains that are
much<00:01:54.810> smoother<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> much<00:01:55.890> quieter<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.240> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
much smoother and much quieter so it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.410 
much smoother and much quieter so it
gives<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.659> lot<00:01:58.079> better<00:01:58.700> ride<00:01:59.700> quality<00:01:59.729> than

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
gives you a lot better ride quality than

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.569 
gives you a lot better ride quality than
the<00:02:00.540> chains<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.860> suffers<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> little

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the chains would but it suffers a little

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.139 
the chains would but it suffers a little
bit<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> traction<00:02:03.439> capabilities<00:02:04.439> this

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
bit in the traction capabilities this

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.280

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the real high quality ones which gives

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.690 
the real high quality ones which gives
you<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> ability<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.929> replace<00:02:10.700> individual

design<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.340> way<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.790> basically<00:02:15.600> it's<00:02:15.780> all

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
design that way and basically it's all

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.870

just<00:02:16.080> put<00:02:16.260> together<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.880> aircraft-grade

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
just put together with aircraft-grade

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.820 
just put together with aircraft-grade
cable<00:02:18.600> what<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.110> see<00:02:19.320> on<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> actual

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830

traction<00:02:20.340> links<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.760> wrap<00:02:20.970> around<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.570> tire

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
traction links that wrap around the tire

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.220 
traction links that wrap around the tire
these<00:02:22.470> are<00:02:22.710> sections<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.670> spring<00:02:24.600> which<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.200> a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
these are sections of spring which is a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.920 
these are sections of spring which is a
hardened<00:02:25.710> material<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.450> real<00:02:27.630> hard

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
hardened material so it's a real hard

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.110 
hardened material so it's a real hard
just<00:02:28.590> cut<00:02:28.800> up<00:02:28.920> sections<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.460> spring<00:02:29.700> put<00:02:30.000> on

just cut up sections of spring put on

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.880 
just cut up sections of spring put on
there<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.990> will<00:02:31.080> give<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> better<00:02:31.410> bite

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
there and that will give a better bite

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.580 
there and that will give a better bite
into<00:02:32.220> ice<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.720> snow<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.990> because<00:02:34.410> it's

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
into ice and snow and because it's

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.130 
into ice and snow and because it's
hardened<00:02:34.950> it'll<00:02:35.310> last<00:02:35.520> longer<00:02:35.850> than<00:02:36.390> wear<00:02:36.690> on

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
hardened it'll last longer than wear on

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.350 
hardened it'll last longer than wear on
the<00:02:37.260> cable<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.400> those<00:02:38.580> are<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.820> basic<00:02:39.210> two

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the cable and so those are the basic two

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.330 
the cable and so those are the basic two
types<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.900> chains<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.500> are<00:02:40.560> available<00:02:40.950> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
types of chains that are available and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.740 
types of chains that are available and
out<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.850> market<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.390> automotive

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.730 
systems and they both have their pros
and<00:02:45.330> cons<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.720> we'll<00:02:45.870> get<00:02:46.050> more<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.380> detail
