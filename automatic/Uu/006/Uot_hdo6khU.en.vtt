00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
yeah I just wanted to make this short

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.509 
yeah I just wanted to make this short
video<00:00:04.910> demonstrating<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.240> Qi<00:00:06.839> way<00:00:07.049> how<00:00:07.319> to

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
video demonstrating a Qi way how to

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.470 
video demonstrating a Qi way how to
mount<00:00:08.519> your<00:00:08.910> audio<00:00:09.599> recorder<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.429> pole<00:00:12.030> be

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
mount your audio recorder to a pole be

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.650 
mount your audio recorder to a pole be
that<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.929> sample<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:14.040> not<00:00:14.490> all<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.820> fancy<00:00:15.360> I

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
that a sample I'm not all that fancy I

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.109 
that a sample I'm not all that fancy I
don't<00:00:15.839> even<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> cell<00:00:16.440> phone<00:00:16.619> yet<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.130> think

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
don't even have a cell phone yet I think

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.010 
don't even have a cell phone yet I think
it's<00:00:18.330> quite<00:00:18.510> cool<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.320> see<00:00:21.020> different

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
it's quite cool and I see different

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.290 
it's quite cool and I see different
options<00:00:22.350> for<00:00:22.680> how<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.760> lot<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
options for how to do it but a lot of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.390 
options for how to do it but a lot of
them<00:00:24.510> are<00:00:24.689> quite<00:00:25.080> expensive<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.980> came<00:00:26.250> to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
them are quite expensive like I came to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.330 
them are quite expensive like I came to
think<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.760> some<00:00:27.050> cheaper<00:00:28.050> ways<00:00:28.199> one<00:00:28.800> way<00:00:29.099> would

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
think of some cheaper ways one way would

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.420 
think of some cheaper ways one way would
be<00:00:29.400> using<00:00:30.260> these<00:00:31.260> kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:32.899> it's<00:00:33.899> called<00:00:34.430> ultra

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
be using these kind of it's called ultra

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.600 
be using these kind of it's called ultra
pot<00:00:35.640> they<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.780> ultra<00:00:37.140> part<00:00:37.320> 1<00:00:37.500> &amp;<00:00:37.620> 2

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
pot they have ultra part 1 &amp; 2

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.299 
pot they have ultra part 1 &amp; 2
I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> ultra<00:00:39.510> part<00:00:39.690> 2<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.140> around<00:00:40.320> $16

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
I think the ultra part 2 is around $16

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.680 
I think the ultra part 2 is around $16
and<00:00:41.790> ultra<00:00:42.480> pot<00:00:42.629> 1<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.559> smaller<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.100> round

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
and ultra pot 1 it's smaller is round

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.729 
and ultra pot 1 it's smaller is round
$10<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.860> figured<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.200> actually<00:00:49.320> use

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
$10 so I figured you can actually use

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.790 
$10 so I figured you can actually use
that<00:00:49.770> instead<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:51.539> these<00:00:51.960> more<00:00:52.260> expensive

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
that instead of these more expensive

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.479 
that instead of these more expensive
things<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.530> let<00:00:55.530> me<00:00:55.710> demonstrate

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
things so let me demonstrate

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.020 
things so let me demonstrate
yep<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:58.379> fact<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.219> said<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.579> don't<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
yep in fact as I said I don't have a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.310 
yep in fact as I said I don't have a
boom<00:01:00.300> pole<00:01:01.489> myself<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.719> should<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
boom pole myself but it should be the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
boom pole myself but it should be the
same<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.559> anything<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.640> had<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.500> came<00:01:07.820> which

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
same for anything I had this came which

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.649 
same for anything I had this came which
I'm<00:01:09.000> gonna<00:01:09.210> try<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.200> 2<00:01:10.260> 2<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.330> this<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.390> how

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I'm gonna try it's a 2 2 so this is how

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.380 
I'm gonna try it's a 2 2 so this is how
it<00:01:12.750> goes<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.409> snap<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.119> do

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
it goes you just snap it on like you do

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.840 
it goes you just snap it on like you do
with<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.860> ultra<00:01:16.860> put<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
with the ultra put it's actually the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.940 
with the ultra put it's actually the
same<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:19.369> it's<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> Saints<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.830> ultra<00:01:22.830> hood

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
same for it's the Saints for ultra hood

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.450 
same for it's the Saints for ultra hood
1<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.400> also<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.759> Rotary<00:01:24.030> Club<00:01:24.060> -<00:01:25.250> whoops<00:01:26.780> and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
1 and also the Rotary Club - whoops and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.289 
1 and also the Rotary Club - whoops and
I<00:01:30.530> should<00:01:31.530> cure<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.549> it's

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I should cure it like that and it's

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.499 
I should cure it like that and it's
actually<00:01:33.900> pretty<00:01:34.770> sturdy<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.939> course<00:01:36.240> yeah

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
actually pretty sturdy of course yeah

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.010 
actually pretty sturdy of course yeah
can<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> touch<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:38.210> well<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> zoom

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
can I touch it as well I have the zoom

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.210 
can I touch it as well I have the zoom
h1<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.740> goes<00:01:41.250> also<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> switch

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
h1 but this goes also for the switch

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
h1 but this goes also for the switch
whoops<00:01:44.220> zoom<00:01:46.640> h4n<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:48.090> think<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.930> called<00:01:49.140> I'm

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
whoops zoom h4n I think it's called I'm

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.350 
whoops zoom h4n I think it's called I'm
not<00:01:49.500> too<00:01:49.860> sure<00:01:50.840> yeah<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.770> attach<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.690 

like<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.950> has<00:02:01.980> some<00:02:02.520> nice

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
like this so and it has some nice

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.490 
like this so and it has some nice
features<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:04.250> take<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.370> around<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
features that you can take it around and

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.240 
features that you can take it around and
do<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.670> have<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.790> like<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.180> want<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.510> have<00:02:09.660> it

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
do it have it like you want to have it

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.300 
do it have it like you want to have it
so<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:11.880> touch<00:02:12.300> here<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.980> should<00:02:14.190> be

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
so I have it now touch here it should be

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.790 
so I have it now touch here it should be
the<00:02:14.430> same<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.640> guess

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
the same I guess

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.740 
the same I guess
and<00:02:16.800> actually<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.160> would<00:02:17.340> really<00:02:17.790> also<00:02:18.480> just

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
and actually I would really also just

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.440 
and actually I would really also just
want<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.990> show<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.550> even<00:02:20.550> cheaper<00:02:20.910> option<00:02:21.330> it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
want to show you even cheaper option it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.960 
want to show you even cheaper option it
so<00:02:22.380> yeah<00:02:22.650> she<00:02:23.160> had<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> gorilla<00:02:23.610> pod

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
so yeah she had a gorilla pod

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.320 
so yeah she had a gorilla pod
you<00:02:24.120> could<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.390> course<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.290> same

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
you could of course have it the same

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.430 
you could of course have it the same
your<00:02:27.330> good<00:02:27.420> touching<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.990> like<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:31.880> whoops

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
your good touching it like that whoops

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.790 
your good touching it like that whoops
yeah<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.180> course<00:02:36.420> much<00:02:36.900> less<00:02:37.170> dirty

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
yeah this is of course much less dirty

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:46.280 
yeah this is of course much less dirty
but<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:42.540> yeah<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:43.790> could<00:02:44.790> potentially<00:02:45.290> work

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
but but yeah it could potentially work

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.080 
but but yeah it could potentially work
like<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.860> guess<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.520> want<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.760> really

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
like that I guess if you want to really

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.280 
like that I guess if you want to really
achieve<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.450> option<00:02:48.690> if<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.870> already<00:02:48.990> have

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
achieve you option if you already have

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.900 
achieve you option if you already have
it<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.370> don't<00:02:50.550> have<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.820> spend<00:02:51.240> $20<00:02:52.230> $30<00:02:52.910> $40

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
it so we don't have to spend $20 $30 $40

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.310 
it so we don't have to spend $20 $30 $40
on<00:02:54.210> something<00:02:54.990> to<00:02:55.110> attach<00:02:56.690> attach<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:58.080> sound

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
on something to attach attach a sound

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.370 
on something to attach attach a sound
recorder<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:58.890> your<00:03:00.380> ear<00:03:01.380> boom<00:03:02.070> Pole
