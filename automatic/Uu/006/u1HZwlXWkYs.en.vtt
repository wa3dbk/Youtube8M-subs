drilling the holes ok going to drill the
small<00:00:16.529> hole<00:00:16.770> first

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.900 

normally<00:00:25.950> you<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.100> take<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.610> drill<00:00:26.880> press

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
normally you just take the drill press

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.300 
normally you just take the drill press
and<00:00:27.150> go<00:00:27.630> down<00:00:27.960> onto<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.680> through<00:00:29.040> the<00:00:29.160> wood

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and go down onto the through the wood

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
can get those rods through the blade and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.590 
can get those rods through the blade and
both<00:02:20.750> handles<00:02:21.230> as<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:22.100> can<00:02:22.250> tell<00:02:22.459> I've<00:02:22.790> been

both handles as you can tell I've been

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.050 
both handles as you can tell I've been
testing<00:02:24.020> mine<00:02:24.170> out<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.970> everything<00:02:25.970> is

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
testing mine out and everything is

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.520 
testing mine out and everything is
lining<00:02:26.270> up<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.780> fine<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:29.050> after<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:30.170> point

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
lining up just fine so after this point

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.699 
lining up just fine so after this point
I'm<00:02:30.770> going<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.010> put<00:02:31.220> glue<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:32.320> put<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.470> pins

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
I'm going to put glue on it put the pins

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.070 
I'm going to put glue on it put the pins
in<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.370> then<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:34.580> have<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.790> let<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.060> set<00:02:35.360> which

y'all<00:02:46.310> at<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:46.700> point<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.300> have<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.570> cut<00:02:47.900> these

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
y'all at this point I have to cut these

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.120 
y'all at this point I have to cut these
pins<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:49.550> I'm<00:02:50.480> going<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.660> cut<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.050> pins<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
pins so I'm going to cut the pins to the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.210 
pins so I'm going to cut the pins to the
right<00:02:52.310> length<00:02:53.050> each<00:02:54.050> one<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.410> these<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:55.190> go

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
right length each one of these to go

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.380 
right length each one of these to go
through<00:02:55.610> here<00:02:55.850> now<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.600> deal<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.730> at<00:02:58.730> this

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
through here now the deal is at this

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.570 
through here now the deal is at this
point<00:02:59.690> I<00:03:00.019> can<00:03:00.200> change<00:03:00.440> my<00:03:00.530> mind<00:03:00.920> i<00:03:01.130> can<00:03:01.280> switch

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
point I can change my mind i can switch

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.729 
point I can change my mind i can switch
this<00:03:01.850> over<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.540> use<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.080> different<00:03:03.260> side<00:03:03.709> of

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
this over and use the different side of

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.000 
this over and use the different side of
the<00:03:04.100> grain<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.700> wood<00:03:05.590> but<00:03:06.590> if<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.800> look

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
the grain of the wood but if you look

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.120 
the grain of the wood but if you look
right<00:03:07.310> there<00:03:08.290> i'm<00:03:09.290> going<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.680> go<00:03:09.830> with<00:03:09.980> the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
right there i'm going to go with the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.490 
right there i'm going to go with the
yellow<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.760> when<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.000> sand<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.750> down<00:03:11.810> I'm

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
yellow so when I sand this down I'm

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.060 
yellow so when I sand this down I'm
hoping<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.400> brown<00:03:14.530> if<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.709> see<00:03:15.890> that

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
hoping that that brown if you see that

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.910 
hoping that that brown if you see that
brown<00:03:16.310> as<00:03:16.610> ice<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.209> down<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.079> surface<00:03:18.680> that

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
brown as ice and down this surface that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.590 
brown as ice and down this surface that
Brown<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.489> going<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.700> make<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.910> line<00:03:20.180> right<00:03:20.570> down

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
Brown is going to make a line right down

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.460 
Brown is going to make a line right down
the<00:03:21.019> center<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.670> blade<00:03:22.970> as<00:03:23.320> opposed<00:03:24.320> to

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
the center of the blade as opposed to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.170 
the center of the blade as opposed to
having<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.799> big<00:03:24.980> wide<00:03:25.280> blade<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.670> little

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
having the big wide blade a little

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.509 
having the big wide blade a little
yellow<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.720> want<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.110> lot<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.500> yellow<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.010> a

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
little brown and I'm hoping it's going

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.420 
little brown and I'm hoping it's going
to<00:03:32.180> come<00:03:32.299> out<00:03:32.360> looking<00:03:32.780> really<00:03:33.049> good<00:03:33.430> see

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
to come out looking really good see

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.090 
to come out looking really good see
there<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.750> I'll<00:03:35.840> probably<00:03:36.079> extend<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:36.799> that

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
there and I'll probably extend that that

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.009 
there and I'll probably extend that that
Brown<00:03:37.310> will<00:03:37.519> prob<00:03:37.670> extend<00:03:38.090> right<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.810> end

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
Brown will prob extend right to the end

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.580 
Brown will prob extend right to the end
as<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:40.130> can<00:03:40.220> see<00:03:40.459> it<00:03:40.549> right<00:03:40.670> there<00:03:40.730> see<00:03:41.590> and

as you can see it right there see and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.289 
as you can see it right there see and
it's<00:03:42.980> just<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.280> grain<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.700> wood<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:44.150> just

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
it's just the grain of the wood you just

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.810 
it's just the grain of the wood you just
got<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.450> kind<00:03:44.660> of<00:03:44.840> guesstimate<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.709> see<00:03:46.700> what

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
got to kind of guesstimate and see what

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
got to kind of guesstimate and see what
you<00:03:46.910> want<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.150> do<00:03:48.100> okay<00:03:49.100> time<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.780> connect<00:03:50.780> the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
handles to the blade what you're going

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.750 
handles to the blade what you're going
to<00:03:52.790> need<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.209> some<00:03:53.440> two-part<00:03:54.440> epoxy<00:03:54.950> some

to need is some two-part epoxy some
two-ton<00:03:56.269> epoxy<00:03:57.220> now<00:03:58.220> just<00:03:58.430> follow<00:03:58.579> the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
two-ton epoxy now just follow the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.289 
two-ton epoxy now just follow the
direction<00:03:59.090> she<00:03:59.570> just<00:03:59.750> mix<00:03:59.959> it<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.170> 50-50<00:04:00.829> mix

guesstimate the hell out of it be
alright<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:18.320> gotta<00:04:18.500> mix<00:04:18.709> it

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
put the epoxy on the wood on the blade

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.520 
put the epoxy on the wood on the blade
and<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:30.080> would<00:04:32.750> get<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.870> all<00:04:33.990> down<00:04:34.199> in<00:04:34.259> those

and the would get it all down in those

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.850 
and the would get it all down in those
holes<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:35.550> want<00:04:35.729> this<00:04:35.850> stuff<00:04:36.120> everywhere

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
onto the pins just right next to the

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.810 
onto the pins just right next to the
pins<00:05:25.280> you<00:05:26.280> see<00:05:26.490> now<00:05:26.729> set<00:05:27.030> this<00:05:27.210> up<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:28.820> 24

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
metal to the handle and then you shape

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.030
