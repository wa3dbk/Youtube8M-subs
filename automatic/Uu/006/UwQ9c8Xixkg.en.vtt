00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.280 

Gables<00:02:47.470> fit<00:02:47.710> perfectly<00:02:48.550> fine<00:02:48.960> they're<00:02:49.960> tight

Gables fit perfectly fine they're tight
but<00:02:50.650> they<00:02:50.800> fit<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.690> moving<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:53.050> guess

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
but they fit so moving on I guess

underneath there and then this back fan
here<00:04:12.610> is<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.840> Xigmatek<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:14.379> can't<00:04:15.010> think<00:04:15.159> of<00:04:15.190> the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
here is a Xigmatek I can't think of the

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.800 
here is a Xigmatek I can't think of the
model<00:04:15.519> number<00:04:15.940> but<00:04:16.150> it's<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.530> 78<00:04:17.530> CFM<00:04:18.280> fan<00:04:18.810> so

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
model number but it's a 78 CFM fan so

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.719 
model number but it's a 78 CFM fan so
it's<00:04:20.620> pretty<00:04:20.799> loud<00:04:21.040> when<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.370> gets<00:04:21.549> all<00:04:21.699> the

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
it's pretty loud when it gets all the

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.640 
it's pretty loud when it gets all the
way<00:04:21.910> going<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.300> usually<00:04:22.600> run<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.930> about<00:04:23.350> half

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
way going I usually run it about half

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.040 
way going I usually run it about half

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.159 
a view of the back of that there so we
got<00:04:42.880> a<00:04:42.910> faint<00:04:43.210> controller<00:04:43.630> everything's

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
got a faint controller everything's

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.080 
got a faint controller everything's
hidden<00:04:44.440> pretty<00:04:44.830> much<00:04:45.100> as<00:04:45.250> good<00:04:45.460> as<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.729> could<00:04:45.789> do

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
hidden pretty much as good as I could do

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.260 
hidden pretty much as good as I could do
it<00:04:47.130> there's<00:04:48.130> our<00:04:48.250> cables<00:04:48.699> running<00:04:48.940> there<00:04:49.240> and

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
it there's our cables running there and

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.450 
it there's our cables running there and
it<00:04:49.690> was<00:04:49.810> just<00:04:49.960> almost<00:04:50.169> impossible<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:51.039> get<00:04:51.280> all

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
it was just almost impossible to get all

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.750 
it was just almost impossible to get all
those<00:04:51.580> kit<00:04:51.910> cables<00:04:52.570> from<00:04:53.310> running<00:04:54.310> through

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
those kit cables from running through

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.400 
those kit cables from running through
the<00:04:54.850> where<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.090> holes<00:04:55.270> are<00:04:55.510> there's<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.169> few

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
the where the holes are there's a few

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.400 
the where the holes are there's a few
places<00:04:56.530> where<00:04:56.979> they<00:04:57.070> run<00:04:57.250> through<00:04:57.870> just<00:04:58.870> 24

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
places where they run through just 24

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.770 
places where they run through just 24
pin<00:04:59.680> they<00:04:59.889> sit<00:05:00.130> tucked<00:05:00.400> back<00:05:01.530> for<00:05:02.530> SATA<00:05:03.479> 6<00:05:04.479> pin

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.420 
pin they sit tucked back for SATA 6 pin
that<00:05:04.990> comes<00:05:05.139> through<00:05:05.440> there

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
that comes through there

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.430 
that comes through there
and<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.610> pretty<00:05:07.850> much<00:05:08.090> is<00:05:08.300> almost<00:05:08.690> perfect

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
and the pretty much is almost perfect

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.350 
and the pretty much is almost perfect
with<00:05:10.400> your<00:05:10.430> front<00:05:10.760> panel<00:05:11.030> cables<00:05:12.310> to<00:05:13.310> HD<00:05:14.150> audio

the<00:05:15.050> front<00:05:15.380> panel<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:17.360> then<00:05:17.480> the<00:05:17.600> 810<00:05:18.050> is

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
the front panel and then the 810 is

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.170 
the front panel and then the 810 is
sandwiched<00:05:19.040> all<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.030> way<00:05:20.150> up<00:05:20.270> there<00:05:20.510> and<00:05:22.180> it

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
sandwiched all the way up there and it

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.800 
sandwiched all the way up there and it
pretty<00:05:23.510> much<00:05:23.600> turned<00:05:24.050> out<00:05:24.170> great<00:05:24.380> except

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
pretty much turned out great except

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.740 
pretty much turned out great except
these<00:05:26.810> cables<00:05:27.380> down<00:05:27.560> here<00:05:28.160> I<00:05:28.450> just<00:05:29.450> kind<00:05:29.660> of

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
these cables down here I just kind of

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.650 
these cables down here I just kind of
lost<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:31.130> well<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.550> keep<00:05:31.730> going<00:05:31.970> after<00:05:32.330> about

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
lost the well to keep going after about

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.240 
lost the well to keep going after about
two<00:05:32.870> or<00:05:32.900> three<00:05:33.050> hours<00:05:33.200> of<00:05:33.530> doing<00:05:33.710> this<00:05:33.950> like<00:05:34.130> I

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
two or three hours of doing this like I

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.680 
two or three hours of doing this like I
said<00:05:34.280> I<00:05:34.490> don't<00:05:34.790> remember<00:05:34.940> how<00:05:35.210> long<00:05:35.270> exactly

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
said I don't remember how long exactly

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.800 
said I don't remember how long exactly
it<00:05:36.020> was<00:05:36.170> but<00:05:36.560> I<00:05:36.800> pretty<00:05:37.730> much<00:05:37.880> tore<00:05:38.450> everything

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
it was but I pretty much tore everything

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.960 
it was but I pretty much tore everything
out<00:05:39.140> and<00:05:39.320> redid<00:05:39.680> everything<00:05:39.860> so<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.670> took<00:05:40.790> me

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
out and redid everything so it took me

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.060 
out and redid everything so it took me
quite<00:05:41.000> a<00:05:41.240> bit<00:05:41.390> of<00:05:41.480> time<00:05:41.690> there's<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.910> TX<00:05:45.070> 755

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
quite a bit of time there's the TX 755

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.510 
quite a bit of time there's the TX 755
