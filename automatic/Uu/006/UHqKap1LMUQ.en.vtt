00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.250
 very good all guys here masternaut 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.019
 today I bring you my first story or 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 narration based on the anime and manga of 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.279
 one piece with the only spirit and objective 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.329
 to entertain and have a good time if 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.400
 I see that he likes or attracts attention 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.140
 we will create more chapters I will be inspired 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.909
 as I said in one piece but the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.529
 History wants to focus on how I 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.310
 I imagine it is not about any 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.349
 theory 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.329
 said this I start with chapter 1 of 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.890
 the life or the past of petapa all 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.630
 started in the territory of the big line 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 on a remote island of paradise 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.340
 practically uninhabited an island that 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.200
 characterized by its low temperature and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.840
 an unpleasant climate in which he denied 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.790
 constantly whose name was karakuri 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.860
 the birthplace of a young man from 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.870
 strong attitude curious about what 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.370
 he was in the rest of the world and an orphan 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.320
 after the abandonment of their parents by 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.390
 unknown causes this young man is called 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.770
 punk sheep said name he put it his 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 grandfather who always took care of him always 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.970
 that came from the cabin they lived 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 They had to be very warm to such an extent 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.479
 that in the mind of the young vega punk 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.979
 the precedents of 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.400
 devise methods that solve their 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.470
 problems 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.420
 even though there was no kind of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.310
 education in karakuri the boy was very 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 intelligent and enterprising but he had the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.690
 advantage that his grandfather had been a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.910
 independent researcher and he had a 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.740
 remarkable technology was thanks to this 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.720
 how he designed a heating system in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 the island to favor human life 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.710
 there although due to the shortage of 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.050
 material they owned did not reach 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.180
 complete your project however to the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.710
 age of 16 years his grandfather decided 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.110
 tell him the truth about the incident 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.850
 that his parents had in his day 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.950
 he said they left the island and he 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.510
 they left him in charge of the child plus the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.880
 truth was that some pirates stayed 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.920
 to the population in a time ago that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.380
 they received karakuri and left her besieged 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.940
 in addition the climate worsened the situation of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 the few people left in the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.690
 island the cause of not explaining the truth 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.460
 it was for his protection and that he did not 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.690
 will cause any kind of trauma in a 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.490
 near future 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.960
 vega punk totally believed his grandfather and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.330
 decided to study the technology that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.220
 I had to carry out studies on everything 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.900
 who did not know about that island and leave 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.759
 of that to have any 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.830
 opportunity to find answers to your 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.200
 past and the reason for the murder of his 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.340
 parents because of the attack of those 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.959
 pirates 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.670
 It was the only thing he had left with his 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.890
 grandfather and without her I could never have 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.599
 survive in such a cold environment a 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.610
 year later after having planned his 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.620
 future the island of snow was still without the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.239
 heating system that japan you 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.370
 he promised his grandfather that one day 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.870
 would install with his return now he was 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 full of all kinds of animals 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.190
 robotic and goats emerged from the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.080
 experiments of the young scientist with the 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.599
 objective of expanding the security of 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.250
 small village and its people this fact made 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.110
 that during the pirate era the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.299
 people will consider this island as 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.700
 coming from the future and character 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.440
 dismal before he started his journey 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.239
 the dear grandfather of vega punk him 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.360
 gave away a family treasure to this 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.310
 that he had kept between his father he and 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.170
 the father when they sailed that a box 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.360
 strong whose content turned out to be something 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.910
 I miss a fruit blue sky blue 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.099
 with numerous eddies on its surface 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.390
 and a lighter stem to a grandfather told him 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.890
 that it was dangerous to have one of those 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.260
 fruits but that if it was in 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.730
 you will not hesitate to eat it in addition 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.709
 He indicated that there was a fruit 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.299
 similar that he will not approach her since 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.220
 the closeness between strange fruits of that 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.200
 guy could come to invoke some 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.970
 demon of the seven evils beta punk no 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.770
 he paid much attention to this last 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.450
 without thinking too much about it but 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.580
 leaving aside this was in a 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.680
 problem did not know how to get out of that 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.750
 hellish island but like his grandfather was a 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.550
 man full of resources and in his day he was 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.470
 a popular scientist in his advances 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.540
 referents in navigation and all kinds 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.310
 of water transport explained that 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.470
 in the port of the island there was a 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.290
 wooden boat that included a system 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.510
 propeller a candle and an appearance liner 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.310
 metallic with something rough texture that 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.170
 covered the sides and worked on the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.190
 boat last put the only thing that 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.500
 he had called attention to the young 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.750
 scientist else decided to suppress it 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.550
 changing it for other materials by 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.020
 pieces from his grandfather's laboratory and 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.570
 with the help of robots and animals 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.040
 alive further accelerates the process 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.110
 swiss of fate was marin for 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.850
 advised by his grandfather since so 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.770
 seen it was the safest place known 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.630
 by man all over the world in 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.610
 addiction could have more possibilities 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.410
 to show the world government its 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.700
 talent as a scientist and get 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.900
 information about the killer of his 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.130
 parents and become someone 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.900
 necessary in the world of 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.430
 investigation after a week to the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.650
 drift in the sea because of an accident 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.630
 that he had for clumsiness with the doctor that 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.550
 it fell into the sea was weakened by 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.480
 the storms that suffered the changes of 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.610
 tide 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.830
 by banks had a hunger side and the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.630
 thirst but despite all this the young 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.610
 he did not feel at all sorry for his 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.960
 decision since I knew no loneliness 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.000
 that having spent his childhood 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.250
 whole on an island where the 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.810
 conditions for life were terrible and 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.970
 not having the company and the 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.590
 knowledge of his lost parents his 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.750
 Hope lasted until one morning 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.060
 of sun and few clouds appeared three 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.550
 large vessels of large sails in the 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.470
 that you could read marine the person who 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.940
 He made sure that his health remained 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.890
 in good condition and that it was good 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.240
 attended on his next trip was the 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.240
 famous monkey flirt
