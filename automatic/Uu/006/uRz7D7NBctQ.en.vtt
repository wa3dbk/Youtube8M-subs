00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
be a very epic boss fight but I did go

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.910 
be a very epic boss fight but I did go
to<00:00:12.000> want<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> ask<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.599> guys<00:00:12.630> which<00:00:13.110> raid<00:00:13.440> you

let's<00:00:16.560> get<00:00:16.770> into<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.130> first<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.180> have

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
let's get into it first of all we have

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.689 
let's get into it first of all we have
the<00:00:18.359> vault<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.930> glass<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.619> Venus<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.580> an

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the vault of glass on Venus this is an

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.300 
the vault of glass on Venus this is an
absolutely<00:00:21.359> massive<00:00:21.720> space<00:00:22.199> under<00:00:22.710> Venus<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
absolutely massive space under Venus and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.279 
absolutely massive space under Venus and
the<00:00:23.369> scariest<00:00:24.180> thing<00:00:24.330> about<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.900> rain<00:00:25.140> in

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the scariest thing about this rain in

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.290 
the scariest thing about this rain in
general<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.160> Veck<00:00:26.369> have<00:00:26.820> kind<00:00:27.150> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
general is that the Veck have kind of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.509 
general is that the Veck have kind of
control<00:00:27.750> over<00:00:27.930> time<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> physics<00:00:29.039> within<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
control over time and physics within the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.890 
control over time and physics within the
vault<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.820> glass<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.300> everything<00:00:30.720> they<00:00:30.840> do

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
vault of glass so everything they do

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.889 
vault of glass so everything they do
every<00:00:31.619> bus<00:00:31.859> fight<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.369> re<00:00:32.550> calls<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.329> Gorgons

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
every bus fight the re calls the Gorgons

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.290 
every bus fight the re calls the Gorgons
a<00:00:34.260> Theon<00:00:34.559> himself<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:35.610> controlled<00:00:35.910> by<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
a Theon himself is all controlled by the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.479 
a Theon himself is all controlled by the
fact<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.620> control<00:00:37.980> physics

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
fact that they can control physics

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.799 
fact that they can control physics
within<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> vault<00:00:39.030> glass<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.480> change

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
within the vault glass that can change

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.170 
within the vault glass that can change
reality<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> why<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.520> really<00:00:42.030> like

reality now that is why I really like

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.880 
reality now that is why I really like
the<00:00:42.390> vaulted<00:00:42.540> glass<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.500> makes<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the vaulted glass and it's what makes it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.590 
the vaulted glass and it's what makes it
truly<00:00:44.190> terrifying<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.450> quick

truly terrifying so that's a quick
breakdown<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> vault<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.559> glass<00:00:46.590> then

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
breakdown of the vault of glass then

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.459 
breakdown of the vault of glass then
we've<00:00:47.550> got<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> temple<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> crota<00:00:48.629> obviously

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
we've got the temple of crota obviously

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.709 
we've got the temple of crota obviously
leading<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> crow<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> busboy<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:51.570> at

leading up to the crow a busboy right at
the<00:00:51.840> end<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.440> pretty<00:00:52.739> chunky<00:00:53.280> space

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the end it is a pretty chunky space

emissions and then further down we have

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.860 
emissions and then further down we have
the<00:00:58.949> abyss<00:00:59.309> leading<00:00:59.940> onto<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> bridge<00:01:00.570> and

for me the coolest part about the raid

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.240 
for me the coolest part about the raid
in<00:01:15.689> kroger<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.290> general<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.799> definitely

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
in kroger in general is definitely

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
in kroger in general is definitely
killing<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> boss<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.990> absolutely

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
killing the boss is what is absolutely

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.140 
killing the boss is what is absolutely
you<00:01:19.710> know<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.100> most<00:01:20.280> awesome<00:01:20.640> bit<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.970> for

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
you know the most awesome bit of it for

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
you know the most awesome bit of it for
me<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.659> having<00:01:22.259> kind<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.740> broken<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.220> down

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
me so having kind of broken that down

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280 
me so having kind of broken that down
roughly<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.030> want<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> say<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.900> guys<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.080> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
roughly I want to say to you guys that I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
roughly I want to say to you guys that I
personally<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> vault<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.549> glass<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
personally think the vault of glass is a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.749 
personally think the vault of glass is a
better<00:01:27.689> rate<00:01:28.049> than<00:01:28.080> crotas<00:01:28.710> end<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.009> think<00:01:29.579> it's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
better rate than crotas end I think it's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.730 
better rate than crotas end I think it's
kind<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.270> lot<00:01:30.509> more<00:01:30.689> fun<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.140> play<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.530> lot

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
kind of a lot more fun to play a lot

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.289 
kind of a lot more fun to play a lot
more<00:01:31.860> technically<00:01:32.369> challenging<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:33.090> well

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
more technically challenging as well
