also has a flip top lid and also has the
weighted<00:03:45.630> straw<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:47.090> it's<00:03:48.090> not<00:03:48.270> as<00:03:48.480> flexible

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
weighted straw so it's not as flexible

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.430 
weighted straw so it's not as flexible
as<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.860> in<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.070> baby<00:03:50.250> cup<00:03:50.550> but<00:03:51.240> there's<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.660> way

as the in a baby cup but there's a way
here<00:03:52.680> at<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.800> bottom<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.340> if<00:03:53.910> they<00:03:54.060> turn<00:03:54.270> the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
here at the bottom so if they turn the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.170 
here at the bottom so if they turn the
cup<00:03:54.570> upside<00:03:54.780> down<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:56.100> straw<00:03:56.340> will<00:03:56.850> not<00:03:57.000> go

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
cup upside down the straw will not go

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.580 
cup upside down the straw will not go
down<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.660> liquid<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.350> baby

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
down in the liquid like the in a baby

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.010 
down in the liquid like the in a baby
one<00:03:58.830> but<00:03:59.400> if<00:03:59.610> they<00:03:59.730> just<00:03:59.910> tilt<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.420> then<00:04:00.900> it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
one but if they just tilt it then it

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.710 
one but if they just tilt it then it
does<00:04:01.170> stay<00:04:01.440> in<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.680> liquid<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:03.300> other<00:04:03.480> thing

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
does stay in the liquid the other thing

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.740 
does stay in the liquid the other thing
I<00:04:03.870> found<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.500> it's<00:04:05.040> really<00:04:05.340> hard<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:06.090> screw<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750

right now it doesn't want to go through

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.990 
right now it doesn't want to go through
