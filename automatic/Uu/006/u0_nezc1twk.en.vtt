00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.269
 once you have done the fantastic bike you know the road configuration 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.559
 the supertopa so strong because it starts from an excellent base is entrusted with austin 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.630
 fantastic we remember that this tvtb seraphim foti 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.999
 health in which dominated the last 3 editions of the superstock world cup 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.249
 he has a great driver like hilton badovini 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:28.119
 and therefore it is a bike that is surprised dominating the first four races and here at 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.320
 own way made first opened by arriving on the podium also with the other 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.200
 pilot daniele berretta 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.649
 it's a motorcycle or a fantastic one 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.760
 maintains the strata kinship with the road one but it is better the whole lot 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.790
 exact prices really impressive the speed with which trento in curve 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.410
 and with which the character of the engine can be braked even with the bike folded 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.200
 stops the same at low and mid-range speeds 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.610
 but Reggio becomes very brutal, very bad 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.020
 the bike pushes up the speed of this bike a lot up to 14,000 rpm 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.490
 it is surprising and by reference you think that diamond ayrton badovini more angered 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.320
 strong of the provider that of the pilots of the Italian super bike inside e 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.240
 the civ level is particularly high so it's a bike that goes there 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.140
 really good surprising impressed traction controls that 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.390
 change while in the street bike is a count and traction more than safety 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.370
 I cutlet action that allows you 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.970
 the spin to use it pro limit to have the skills of the pilots that dominate the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.970
 I'm 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.420
 I say with kind of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.080
 different of motorcycle a type that goes very well anyway because the ducati 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.090
 yara the strong text in the large ones in the great copy of the twin 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.590
 then 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.429
 at low mids rising regimes the ducats from the best of themselves 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.560
 this is the German motorbike however with Japanese philosophy because the dev has 

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:56.889
 challenged the Japanese with a 4-cylinder line engine that the engine that 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.619
 distinguishes all the Japponese motorcycles currently on the market 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.000
 promoter who demeure Ã¹Ã¹ 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.639
 it has done better because it is starting from a similar base watercolors 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.099
 Japanese trimotor perhaps even using the great technology they have 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.489
 cars this bike has 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.650
 sofa stands in the m3 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.220
 the system your gnv see system have managed to make a motorcycle gedi pur 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.150
 having a conventional apostate engine structure 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.840
 it is very well balanced 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.370
 hahaha fantastic electronics above all 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.859
 the street version I think it is 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.959
 the bike with the best electronics because it has the ability to have 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.429
 so the dawn is the same as one 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:41.859
 dedicated electronics with various maps a very nice thing about this bike in the 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.349
 street version fb 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.550
 you can sew on any type of anti-pilot fight 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.719
 - expert 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.669
 is able to exploit this bike that is very strong but the bike takes care of the 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.909
 stock inveze version I said to you before electronic electronics changes a lot 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.069
 that helps you but the pilot must manage it very cool 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.809
 on the right wrist then 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.809
 the superstock version is made for pilots 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:18.629
 turn of track very large turin upper city I present them you arrive 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.349
 very strong it comes off a moment later 200 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.519
 meters down this long sunbed where 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.870
 pro mt you reach higher speeds than all world super bike is one 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.080
 broken off because you pass from the sixth to the second for fonts are 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.560
 this variant variant that has been modified by itself better than before 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.469
 black busca 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:42.709
 2nd 3rd 4th 5th you enter the towns that become almost full the very fast cubone that 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.110
 puts the brakes on the docks again second 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.790
 it is important the braking of the wheel to be disconnected late but to be a lot 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.410
 quick to straighten the bike to accelerate culinary care asmo 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.680
 of her unique asmo 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.000
 a very important very beautiful curve after the cost-free fury goes into 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.430
 succession finish head 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.610
 if the detached compression of the ascari variant here must be 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.199
 Enough to grapple because 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.080
 the rubber does not work as much on the left side 15 as it is very aggressive 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.330
 entering wire. remembered states 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.790
 one must have sensitivity 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.790
 i know what type front tire 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.529
 effect 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.029
 bleating of the right ata because the gum is not little pradamano 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:28.779
 it is not very hot and we see how the new tires we need one 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.219
 very constant temperature stable 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.860
 not the last suicide album and then I go to you valentino rossi proof that the rubber 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.430
 let it be slightly cooled then be careful 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.479
 at the entrance lascari 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.590
 second open you exit the scart 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.580
 translator the temple over 68 so fan all the blankets. important 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.180
 the refer file host is text 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.840
 reach top speed again before the parabolic party 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.840
 split around you 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.220
 para paper between parabolic can still pigati fourth fifth and sixth this 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.700
