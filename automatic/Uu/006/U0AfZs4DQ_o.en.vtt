00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.589
 you can always have fun at the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.240
 detail in all its forms 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.820
 we did it before you and we 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.080
 came back empty-handed 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.570
 in fact it is during an acceleration 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.289
 banal all stupid we had the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.320
 chip to the ear 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.330
 undeniably 7,309 gti accelerates very 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.520
 strong the investigation therefore deserves to be 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.169
 proceed proceed by order 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.619
 and how do you first open 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.619
 the hood 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.480
 no doubt it is there a turbo that has 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 priori has nothing to do here a kit we 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 will explain your which costs 40 thousand francs 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.750
 and that brings the maximum power to 165 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.809
 horses and the couple at 24 m kg he in 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.300
 performance 220 km / hour speed of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.160
 tip but especially 27 seconds 5 to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.070
 1000 m departure, that is to say close 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 one second less than a bmw m3 or 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.270
 urinary 21 turbo we actually have 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 to make a small race car 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.320
 that it is necessary to put turn 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.860
 analysis in the hands of an expert in 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.430
 steering 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.229
 it's a very good car maybe 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.390
 its major flaw is a lack of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.300
 obvious motor skills because of moving from 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.440
 120 horses to 160 horses without changing 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.840
 the train before it poses some 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.040
 problems 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.850
 and then can be a little 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 braking problem 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 I think it would at least put 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.729
 some more discs a little bit more 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.150
 great and change the quality of 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.220
 platelets 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.960
 otherwise I think someone who wants 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.450
 having fun with this car can very well 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.450
 do it and it really has 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.280
 rather amazing accelerations but on 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.390
 the road is still 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.590
 we must always be very suspicious and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.900
 I think we still need to 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.659
 experience to be able to use it at 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.190
 I think his domain is 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.080
 certainly the little road since 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.430
 already I learned that it consumes is a 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.360
 little bit on the highway so it's not 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.310
 easy to use 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.380
 and then it's really nice 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.530
 between each turn to accelerate and then 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.399
 2 despite a small skating it is when 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.360
 even a kick in the buttocks 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.159
 nice nice also this whistle of 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.299
 turbo that we hear very well even 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.729
 with the windows closed 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.380
 he alone would almost forget 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.209
 defects of this car but be careful 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.570
 all the same, not to be too much 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.570
 intoxicate
