00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.940
 the gameplay I kind of moved a little bit and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.250
 I feel relatively normal and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.830
 so look at the four games that 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.840
 I could still take it away for you so 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.349
 The first game for today is called totem 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 runner 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.060
 This is a chillingo runner but 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.820
 quite original so don't say 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.010
 before fufuf time because it 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.199
 insanely original Shiro world in the first place 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.480
 he is very beautifully made very beautiful 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.400
 animation and secondly there is a very 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.669
 original and control here is not for you 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.100
 You need to jump to jump or 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.380
 on the contrary to bend down here your 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.600
 the character can turn either warl 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.239
 either in the boar and for example if you 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.129
 need to fly over the cliff 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.079
 must turn warlock 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.960
 if you need to carry some 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.899
 devil plants break through 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.180
 some creepers or destroy some 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.520
 rival then you need to turn into 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.219
 great green carbonate which 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.370
 accelerates runs very fast and blows 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.979
 everything is on its way by the way here in 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.280
 each mission of the Germans checkpoints form 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.670
 totems running through which they light up 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.619
 and we if in case if we 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.630
 tire out then we start it here with 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.479
 this totem is not the beginning 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.790
 mission namely from this place here by the way 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.840
 these enemies of which I spoke of which 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.670
 also with the help of a boar you need to demolish me 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.369
 runner really liked me 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.860
 the fact that he is not on infinity she mission 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.420
 and each mission is becoming 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970
 more sophisticated 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.299
 you need to work properly and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.250
 Do not be stupid great rimer free 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.079
 available in google play maxi therefore 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.220
 download don't miss such 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.130
 opportunity 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.110
 second game italy sniper simulator and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.689
 let's look at her right away and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.909
 there are several game modes and this 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.250
 story mode and endless mode in 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.219
 which you respectively will be without 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.469
 end and edge will need to perform 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.810
 assignments are very assignments just to kill 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.299
 people so let's start with the first mission 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.729
 we need some kind of base here 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.550
 take off all our 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.040
 horns which are cooked for us so 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.650
 how management feels necessary 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.659
 Tap it is now necessary like this 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.870
 way to put things in the head and preferably 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:25.110
 make a call also with us 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.299
 aiming away and we can see where 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.560
 still located our rivals so 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:35.879
 let's 1 still volume so a little bit dumb 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.239
 so take aim and let's shoot up 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:42.530
 ready to headshots you can immediately aim at 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.970
 other and make a shot also here 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.430
 there are bonuses that are needed 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.010
 collect for example this one slightly higher 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.840
 is bond let's try it 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.010
 now collect this bonus gives us 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.049
 additional time 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.900
 and then there is extra money because 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.209
 the sooner we will all enemies of the film 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.069
 we need to earn more money 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.160
 consider what time is needed here 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.190
 at recharge time as it is known 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.340
 money and cost a lot after that 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.440
 how we cleaned out at a certain angle 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.109
 our character's location moves to 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.750
 side again generated opponents 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.819
 which we need to shoot again in 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.859
 overall this is the game to whom 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.799
 game like it download also 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:28.530
 free available in google play 3 game 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.930
 Chief Dan George called this game did 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.950
 gameplay companies this runner is certainly not 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.870
 as cool as minion rush but still 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.569
 The most advantage of this runner is 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.269
 the fact that there is not so cool graphics I 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.060
 I think thanks to this this runner will go 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.549
 literally on any device whatever 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.069
 what is your power even if 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.639
 honestly on schedule me this game for some reason 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.079
 remind i will win than some 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.599
 heaped android game but still 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.370
 you can play this game with something she told me 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.739
 resembles a sample of uranium probably its 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.310
 the atmosphere and the fact that we play for 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.049
 some kind of indiana johns and we run here 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.299
 we will not run on a straight road 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.489
 here will be a fork we will fall into 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.680
 some caves in general in principle 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.170
 runner for 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.810
 bored but still here it is 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.060
 implementation he did not like everything 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.250
 Slavs on the rest of the runners and therefore 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.410
 probably many will not like it 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.539
 and so who liked the game who do not 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.910
 too powerful hunting device 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.370
 play something new download 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.740
 runner free google play 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.620
 and so the last game for today 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.699
 called knockdown boxing with what 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.289
 represents this game 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.840
 originally this game is for me 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.110
 recalled angry birds but still it is not 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.560
 what's the other one yes here too slingshot balls too 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.080
 but we need to knock down the boxes that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.900
 located completely in different places 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.870
 they can be left and right they are so 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.300
 like this engri birds where everything is strictly in 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.000
 one direction is located and extremely 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.729
 I can say that very simple some 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.370
 mission cause difficulty why 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.320
 should on so at the initial stage and most 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.990
 the main thing is that we are not shown here 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.240
 sight that is where we shoot we don't 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.250
 know but see the flight path 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.669
 controlling our ball to us in 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.340
 principle helps to navigate and 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.030
 correct our radius and directions 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.250
 throw 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.560
 Here is such a simple arcade to 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.409
 probably many will like it and 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.650
 by the way here still need to use 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:36.099
 these are the functions of photo 1 this mission 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.320
 here is some kind of peculiar from 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.840
 attraction and goes to this box apparently 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.590
 this box with a magnet and you need 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.050
 so calculate your flight path 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.900
 mychat so that this ball could still 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.030
 bring down this box in general to whom 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.460
 liked the arcade download and I'm on 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.500
 Today I say goodbye to you all 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.270
