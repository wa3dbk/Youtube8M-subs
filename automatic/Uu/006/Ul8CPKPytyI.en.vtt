00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Whaddup

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.100
-Everything alrighty?  -Everything alrighty?

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.100
Look at that, our Patreon Clerics took a break from generic systems

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.440
And if you want to be our Patreon and help the Formation grow take a look at the description

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.560
And then you'll be able to be one of these bros that decide videos weekly videos on our channels

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.040
And some other good stuff

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.320
Anyways, to the video!

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.640
We're talking about a fancy medieval fantatisc RPG

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.180
A simple, good and cheap system!

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.960
We're putting the link on the description so you can get yours

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.120
Anyways, how does this system work?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.540
Basically, you'll narrate the actions of your character [inovation!]

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.120
And to see if it worked or not, you roll 2d6, add modifiers, compare to the defined difficulty [only the new stuff here]

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.460
Well, it actually looks a lot with dungeon world-

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.320
[the famous more-like-pushing-your-face-slap]

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.620
NO

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.200
Mighty Blade is something completely different

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.900
They're are alike, but they're different [logic? Where have you gone?]

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.900
Back to it

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.080
This is how it works:

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.200
What makes it so rad is the way it's organized

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.760
You'll have 4 attributes

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.660
Strenght, Agility, Intelligence and Will

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.620
Strenght is your physical fitness

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880
[sound credits: some trashy chinese movie]

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120
[there's an easter egg on this scene]

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.700
Agility is your speed and accuracy

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.300
[there's was no easter egg on the previous scene - Bazzinga!]

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.360
[but there might be one in this scene]

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.700
fuckin-

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.260
Intelligence is your magical skills and your IQ

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.340
You call this a punch?

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.460
I can defend and counter attack with more than 14 different ways, which leads me to think:

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.500
What would be the best way so this bruiser will never-ouch

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.580
So much pain

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.820
ow god, staph

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.620
It hurts

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.020
And Will is your ability to resist magical attacks

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.240
Fireball!

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.420
[please tell me you stopped to search for easter eggs]

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.180
Magical Missiles

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.220
Dominate: Man

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.840
[Cause the real one is about to come]

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.500
Basically, the combination between class and race will define the ability scores

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
And then you'll choose your class [wait, what?]

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.040
You class abilities and you're good to go

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.300
So, what are you gonna play?

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.400
I'm gonna play an elf

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.440
I'll be a ranger

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.940
I'll shoot 2 arrows an want to sprint fast

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.640
Ok, your sheet is done, let's play

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.140
Great

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.580
This speed caught the attention of a lot of people to this system

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.900
He is really quick and easy to learn

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.100
Like, really fast and kind of obvious actually

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.940
With the basic book you can build the most diverse adventures

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.340
He is suited for masters and for players

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600
As a player you build your character quickly

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.600
As DM you make your adventures quickly

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.700
Ok, I'm done with my sheet

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.860
So can I take the book?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.560
Sure, but why?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.900
To build the adventure, it's not done yet

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.380
But in 5 miin the bro will finish his sheet and we should start

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.320
Yeah, I'll finish the  [mumble,mumble,mumble]

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.640
In 5 min?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.860
Yeap

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.780
It's fast, isn't it?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.280
Yeah, it's fast as fuck

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.760
Mighty Blade is a great system for beginners!

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.400
There's more about Mighty Blade on the description

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.620
Have a nice week, and nice rolls

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.620
[There are no easter eggs, just like there is no cake]

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.780
K byee, hope you ain't mad :P
