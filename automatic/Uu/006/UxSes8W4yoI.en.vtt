00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.740
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.710
 so let's go kidding 21 of the 6 to 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.190
 Sunday at the beach for a good trip 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.540
 4th in-store kayak fishing tournament 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.540
 that lives in niterói 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.289
 there the people organizing themselves on the beach 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:33.300
 a lot of people went from 150 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:35.820
 kayaks today thank you paulinho né 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.710
 aquatic owner who one of the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.780
 event organizers 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.780
 ball show but failed 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.040
 Then Jesus eats bread dropping robalinho 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.120
 Pebinha hit 30 centimeters more 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.820
 would count on the championship but even 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:07.410
 thus by the attitude of the john the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.660
 steal you while enjoying the galley is lit 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.170
 but then I wanted to talk a little bit 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:18.000
 is not to criticize anyone in organization 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:22.110
 nothing not only for us to help 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.020
 to improve the quality of tournaments that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.619
 come every day here in the river of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.420
 January 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:34.979
 it's a new thing a kayak tournament 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.000
 in the river then it is of course some 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.590
 rules 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.920
 is in my opinion still a little 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 say failure or could be 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.810
 better to avoid finally avoiding 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.190
 exaggerated killing 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.409
 Anyway, we could in the next 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.060
 tournaments there is only one suggestion once more 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.130
 it's not critical or anything 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.290
 I believe that in the next tournaments the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.390
 could elaborate rules a bit 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:13.650
 more rigid separation separation 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.440
 form of artificial fishing or bait 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.320
 Natural number of species 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.110
 captured and captured specimens 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.610
 it is in the viability of certain 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:31.350
 species are for example is to blame 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.440
 coroca ubarana he is the capture of this 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.440
 species 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.640
 to avoid capturing an exaggerated cap and 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.390
 an amount of a mouse pad only 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.530
 to take a maximum of 15 copies of cádiz 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.820
 asks you have to think only as a 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.230
 middle suggestion 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:00.110
 I believe that the next of organizations 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.220
 It's cool to think of this kind of rule. 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:10.220
 to leave the tournament but increasingly 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.080
 of high standard and that's it guys, it's not 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.450
 is not critical to the tournament with a 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.720
 excellent tournament everyone had fun 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.870
 very good weather in the world there is only one 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.660
 suggestion upcoming independent tournaments 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.470
 and organized by the coach or by any 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.080
 someone else I also spoke in the tournament 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.500
 organized by column of the day 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.200
 And so I think it's only for me to 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.160
 add up with us to make this separation 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.830
 in an official and natural letter because 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.380
 fishery very different from 500 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.120
 perhaps make a separation between the 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.280
 engineers and the personnel who 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.780
 it goes on the arm too 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:58.460
 Anyway, just suggestions and I have some 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.400
 rules already have a championship in ubá well 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.960
 written everything cute with 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.110
 all the rules 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.770
 I can not organize and for now 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.500
 but who knows and who wants some 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.590
 organizer that is pinging and using 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.870
 Your rules that I have already written at will. 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.730
 open to suggestions 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.510
 This, I'm going to stop talking a little bit already. 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.390
 I talked a lot with the images there the route 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.260
 and now part more important to me 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.480
 of the tournament 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.270
 I'll get there on the beach measuring the fish. 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.530
 quickly make the two of you 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.740

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.270
