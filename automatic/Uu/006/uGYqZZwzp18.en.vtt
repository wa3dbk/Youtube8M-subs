painting it can be a quick landscape
about<00:00:12.200> water<00:00:13.200> cloud<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.250> some<00:00:14.790> mountain<00:00:15.089> it's

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
about water cloud and some mountain it's

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.810 
about water cloud and some mountain it's
just<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> really<00:00:16.500> quick<00:00:16.890> one<00:00:17.070> so

just going to be a really quick one so
let's<00:00:18.210> get<00:00:18.330> started<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.900> usually<00:00:19.080> when<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> do

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
let's get started I usually when I do

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.950 
let's get started I usually when I do
landscape<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.250> usually<00:00:20.640> start<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> you

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
landscape I usually start as like a you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.250 
landscape I usually start as like a you
know<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.109> long<00:00:22.410> screen<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:24.060> then<00:00:24.960> I'm<00:00:25.080> just

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
know a long screen and then I'm just

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.970 
know a long screen and then I'm just
kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:26.599> trying<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.289> making<00:00:28.710> shapes

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
kind of trying to you know making shapes

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.749 
kind of trying to you know making shapes
and<00:00:29.429> sort<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.300> things<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.460> remember<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and sort of things and remember the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.600 
and sort of things and remember the
closer<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.840> object<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.559> darker<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.219> kind<00:00:35.520> of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
closer the object the darker is kind of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.450 
closer the object the darker is kind of
become<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> more<00:00:36.329> contrast<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.370> there<00:00:38.370> we

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
become or the more contrast and there we

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.490 
become or the more contrast and there we
go<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.180> having<00:00:39.660> two<00:00:39.840> mountains<00:00:40.230> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
go I'm just having two mountains and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500 
go I'm just having two mountains and
then<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.010> use<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> soft<00:00:41.520> brush<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.940> create<00:00:42.180> some

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
then I use a soft brush to create some

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.770 
then I use a soft brush to create some
kind<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.750> cloud<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.940> kind<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.000> adding<00:00:45.570> some

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
kind of cloud and kind of adding some

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
kind of cloud and kind of adding some
lighter<00:00:46.260> value<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:47.100> there<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.480> like

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
lighter value in there just kind of like

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.970 
lighter value in there just kind of like
the<00:00:49.170> lighter<00:00:50.129> cloud<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.030> things<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.329> that

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
the lighter cloud and things like that

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.369 
the lighter cloud and things like that
so<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.670> sped<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.510> actually

might get bored you saw like the whole

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.870 
might get bored you saw like the whole
thing<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.660> real-time<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.640> it's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
thing in real-time it's going to be it's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.330 
thing in real-time it's going to be it's
pretty<00:01:06.450> long<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.170> anyways<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.950> kind<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> like

like<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:19.250> have<00:01:20.250> some<00:01:20.490> kind<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.820> straight

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
like that and have some kind of straight

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.700 
like that and have some kind of straight
down<00:01:22.189> vertical<00:01:23.189> line<00:01:23.369> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.700> helps<00:01:24.000> um

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
down vertical line kind of helps um

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.010 
down vertical line kind of helps um
creating<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:25.890> sort<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.659> dimension<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
creating some sort of a dimension to the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.120 
creating some sort of a dimension to the
clip<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.540> where<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.780> separate<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.950> stuff

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
clip and where is it separate and stuff

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.710 
clip and where is it separate and stuff
like<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.850> bottom<00:01:33.150> right<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:33.420> what

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
like that and the bottom right now what

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.260 
like that and the bottom right now what
I'm<00:01:33.810> doing<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.430> shadow<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.670> come<00:01:35.909> down<00:01:36.119> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
I'm doing is a shadow that come down to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.160 
I'm doing is a shadow that come down to
the<00:01:36.360> water<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.840> water<00:01:38.780> kind<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:39.960> they're

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the water and water kind of like they're

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.710 
the water and water kind of like they're
having<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.490> really<00:01:42.360> high<00:01:42.450> contrast

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
having this really high contrast

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.469 
having this really high contrast
reflection<00:01:43.500> around<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:45.360> you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
reflection around it and when you

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.020 
reflection around it and when you
landscape<00:01:46.020> or<00:01:46.740> environmental<00:01:47.579> painting<00:01:47.850> it's

going to shape rather than a drawing
itself<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.549> important<00:02:03.049> that

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
itself because it's more important that

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
itself because it's more important that
you<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> lighting<00:02:04.619> correct<00:02:05.070> rather<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you get the lighting correct rather and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.719 
you get the lighting correct rather and
right<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.509> lighting<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.020> shape<00:02:07.229> correct

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
right it lighting in a shape correct

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.160 
right it lighting in a shape correct
then<00:02:08.909> your<00:02:09.390> whole<00:02:09.509> picture<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:10.019> to<00:02:10.110> be

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
then your whole picture is going to be

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.860 
then your whole picture is going to be
fine<00:02:10.409> and<00:02:10.670> now<00:02:11.670> I'm<00:02:11.819> kind<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.120> zooming<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
fine and now I'm kind of zooming in and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.160 
fine and now I'm kind of zooming in and
trying<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:13.799> refined<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.819> shape

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
trying like you know refined in shape

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.410 
trying like you know refined in shape
using<00:02:16.170> mostly<00:02:16.409> 100%<00:02:17.099> opacity<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.090> always

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
using mostly 100% opacity if you always

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.140 
using mostly 100% opacity if you always
have<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.629> question<00:02:18.810> about<00:02:19.110> opacity<00:02:19.650> but<00:02:20.430> focus

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
have a question about opacity but focus

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.259 
have a question about opacity but focus
on<00:02:21.299> like<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:22.069> degradation<00:02:23.069> or<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.879> value<00:02:24.209> of

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
on like the degradation or the value of

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.809 
on like the degradation or the value of
the<00:02:24.659> picture<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.440> then<00:02:26.280> I'm<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.549> kind<00:02:26.790> of

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
the picture and then I'm just kind of

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.150 
the picture and then I'm just kind of
like<00:02:27.290> painting<00:02:28.290> things<00:02:28.500> around<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.920> now<00:02:29.040> I'm

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
like painting things around and now I'm

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.509 
like painting things around and now I'm
trying<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.489> do<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> reflection<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> water

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
trying to do a reflection on the water

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.289 
trying to do a reflection on the water
in<00:02:32.519> there<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:33.269> kind<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.599> sparkling<00:02:34.319> around

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
in there it's kind of sparkling around

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.740 
in there it's kind of sparkling around
adding<00:02:36.299> some<00:02:37.579> contrast<00:02:38.579> sort<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.599> almost

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
adding some contrast sort of almost

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.869 
adding some contrast sort of almost
white<00:02:40.170> around<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.799> making<00:02:41.010> some<00:02:41.549> kind<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.819> a

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
white around to making some kind of a

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.000 
white around to making some kind of a
wave<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.420> water<00:02:42.629> or<00:02:43.440> something<00:02:43.500> or<00:02:46.010> some

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
wave on the water or something or some

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.819 
wave on the water or something or some
kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.780> what<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.900> call<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.140> wave<00:02:49.530> and

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
kind of a what do you call that wave and

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.880 
kind of a what do you call that wave and
the<00:02:50.489> water<00:02:51.060> coming<00:02:51.359> up<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.690> down<00:02:51.840> right<00:02:52.470> there

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
the water coming up and down right there

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.910 
the water coming up and down right there
I<00:02:52.920> think<00:02:53.849> some<00:02:54.030> more<00:02:54.269> squid<00:02:54.930> certain<00:02:55.290> kind<00:02:55.829> of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
I think some more squid certain kind of

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.490 
I think some more squid certain kind of
wavelength<00:02:56.549> wavelength<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.629> things<00:02:58.349> like

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
wavelength wavelength and things like

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.440 
wavelength wavelength and things like
that<00:02:58.730> and<00:03:00.709> making<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:02.099> darker<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.120> now<00:03:03.269> it's

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
that and making it darker so now it's

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.750 
that and making it darker so now it's
kind<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.720> look<00:03:03.900> somewhat<00:03:04.410> like<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.620> water<00:03:04.950> but

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
kind of look somewhat like a water but

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.490 
kind of look somewhat like a water but
we're<00:03:05.910> going<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> go<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.569> kind<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.079> fix<00:03:07.319> it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
we're going to go in and kind of fix it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.520 
we're going to go in and kind of fix it
later<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.859> and<00:03:08.400> now<00:03:08.519> I'm<00:03:08.609> using<00:03:08.819> blue<00:03:09.530> overlay

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
later on and now I'm using blue overlay

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.339 
later on and now I'm using blue overlay
would<00:03:10.769> be<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:10.980> easiest<00:03:11.690> just<00:03:12.690> put<00:03:12.900> overlay<00:03:13.230> on

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
would be the easiest just put overlay on

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.400 
would be the easiest just put overlay on
and<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:13.799> add<00:03:14.069> some<00:03:14.459> kind<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.410> little

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
and then add some kind of a little

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.339 
and then add some kind of a little
reddish<00:03:16.919> dirt<00:03:17.419> onto<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.510> mountain<00:03:18.810> color<00:03:19.019> and

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
reddish dirt onto the mountain color and

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.170 
reddish dirt onto the mountain color and
reflect<00:03:20.040> down<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.549> water<00:03:20.760> on<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:21.060> other

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
reflect down to the water on the other

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.559 
reflect down to the water on the other
side<00:03:22.430> but<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:23.669> kind<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:23.970> look<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.269> a

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
side but it's kind of look like a a

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.259 
side but it's kind of look like a a
beach<00:03:25.049> rather<00:03:25.470> than<00:03:25.680> water<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.370> left-hand

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
beach rather than water on the left-hand

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.839 
beach rather than water on the left-hand
side<00:03:27.329> but<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.560> okay<00:03:28.799> it's<00:03:29.579> going<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.790> be

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
side but that's okay it's going to be

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.580 
side but that's okay it's going to be
like<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:30.450> quick<00:03:30.569> one<00:03:30.780> now<00:03:31.470> I'm

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
like a really quick one now I'm

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.259 
like a really quick one now I'm
switching<00:03:31.829> brushes<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.579> kind<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.120> like

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
switching brushes and kind of like

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.080 
switching brushes and kind of like
playing<00:03:33.480> around<00:03:33.720> with<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.109> adding<00:03:34.980> some<00:03:35.880> kind

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
playing around with it adding some kind

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.319 
playing around with it adding some kind
of<00:03:36.230> sort<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.319> plantation<00:03:37.859> again<00:03:38.099> that<00:03:38.430> really

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
of sort of plantation again that really

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.559 
of sort of plantation again that really
dark<00:03:39.510> kind<00:03:40.109> of<00:03:40.230> climbing<00:03:41.130> around<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.519> now<00:03:42.480> I'm

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
dark kind of climbing around and now I'm

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.479 
dark kind of climbing around and now I'm
trying<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.959> create<00:03:43.410> some<00:03:43.829> sort<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.250> edge

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
trying to create some sort of edge

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.250 
trying to create some sort of edge
between<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.359> sky<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:48.329> cliff<00:03:48.780> because

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
between the sky and the cliff because

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.960 
between the sky and the cliff because
the<00:03:49.650> harder<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.040> edge<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.579> more<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.849> can

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
the harder the edge the more you can

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.629 
the harder the edge the more you can
separate<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.450> object<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:52.280> as<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.400> can<00:03:53.519> see

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
separate the object and as you can see

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.849 
separate the object and as you can see
the<00:03:53.790> sky<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.450> edge<00:03:54.780> between<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.470> clip<00:03:55.680> on

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
the sky and the edge between the clip on

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.440 
the sky and the edge between the clip on
the<00:03:55.950> left-hand<00:03:56.280> side<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.639> really<00:03:57.030> really

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
the left-hand side is really really

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.640 
the left-hand side is really really
sharp

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
sharp

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.059 
sharp
and<00:03:59.739> now<00:04:00.310> I'm<00:04:00.459> going<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.849> cloud<00:04:02.069> the

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
and now I'm going to the cloud the

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.369 
and now I'm going to the cloud the
clouds<00:04:03.310> can<00:04:03.610> be<00:04:03.640> sort<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.090> like<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.299> soft<00:04:05.170> edge

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
clouds can be sort of like a soft edge

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.920 
clouds can be sort of like a soft edge
and<00:04:05.739> hard<00:04:06.010> edge<00:04:06.159> kind<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.519> blend<00:04:06.700> together<00:04:06.930> and

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
and hard edge kind of blend together and

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.250 
and hard edge kind of blend together and
then<00:04:08.260> add<00:04:08.560> some<00:04:08.890> some<00:04:09.310> color<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.849> plow<00:04:10.260> to

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
then add some some color to the plow to

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.350

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
paying on normal layers I don't usually

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.620 
paying on normal layers I don't usually
use<00:04:23.919> a<00:04:24.400> lot<00:04:24.639> of<00:04:24.729> fancy<00:04:24.910> layer<00:04:25.210> when<00:04:25.479> I'm

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
and trying to in creating some rock but

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.820 
and trying to in creating some rock but
the<00:05:27.250> value<00:05:27.580> is<00:05:27.669> not<00:05:27.849> there<00:05:28.380> so<00:05:29.380> now<00:05:29.500> I'm<00:05:29.620> just

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
kind of trying to find a value to figure

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.080 
kind of trying to find a value to figure
out<00:05:31.930> what<00:05:32.650> kind<00:05:33.190> of<00:05:33.280> value<00:05:33.550> I<00:05:33.610> should<00:05:33.789> put<00:05:33.970> in

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
out what kind of value I should put in

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.330 
out what kind of value I should put in
now<00:05:35.020> I'm<00:05:35.139> adding<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.500> little<00:05:35.620> darker<00:05:36.070> value

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
now I'm adding a little darker value

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.520 
now I'm adding a little darker value
under<00:05:36.690> here<00:05:37.690> on<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:37.960> other<00:05:38.050> side

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
under here on the other side

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.570 
under here on the other side
oops<00:05:39.310> that's<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.849> little<00:05:40.030> too<00:05:40.210> dark

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.070 

and<00:05:43.000> then<00:05:43.180> I'm<00:05:43.270> kind<00:05:43.510> of<00:05:43.540> like<00:05:43.660> you<00:05:43.840> know<00:05:43.930> just

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
and then I'm kind of like you know just

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.650 
and then I'm kind of like you know just
kind<00:05:44.320> of<00:05:44.650> play<00:05:44.800> around<00:05:44.920> and<00:05:45.430> figure<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.450> out

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
kind of play around and figure it out

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.730 
kind of play around and figure it out
value<00:05:47.230> and<00:05:47.440> sort<00:05:48.070> of<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.600> lot<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:50.320> more<00:05:50.500> you<00:05:50.620> do

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
value and sort of a lot the more you do

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.670 
value and sort of a lot the more you do
the<00:05:50.920> better<00:05:50.950> you<00:05:51.250> get<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:53.350> thing<00:05:53.530> is

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
the better you get and the thing is

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.100 
the better you get and the thing is
practice<00:05:54.310> if<00:05:55.000> you<00:05:55.150> draw<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.360> figure<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:55.720> lot<00:05:55.870> then

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
practice if you draw a figure a lot then

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.390 
practice if you draw a figure a lot then
you're<00:05:56.260> going<00:05:56.380> to<00:05:56.440> get<00:05:56.560> greater<00:05:56.770> figure<00:05:57.130> you

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
you're going to get greater figure you

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.820 
you're going to get greater figure you
draw<00:05:57.640> a<00:05:57.910> landscape<00:05:58.420> a<00:05:58.450> lot<00:05:58.660> and<00:05:59.350> you<00:05:59.470> can<00:05:59.650> get

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
draw a landscape a lot and you can get

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.020 
draw a landscape a lot and you can get
good<00:05:59.950> a<00:06:00.010> landscape<00:06:00.580> but<00:06:01.240> so<00:06:01.570> here<00:06:01.960> is<00:06:02.080> a<00:06:03.030> quick

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
good a landscape but so here is a quick

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.900 
good a landscape but so here is a quick
one<00:06:04.150> and<00:06:04.830> when<00:06:05.830> i<00:06:06.130> zoom<00:06:06.160> in<00:06:06.520> you're<00:06:06.730> going<00:06:06.850> to

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
one and when i zoom in you're going to

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.580 
one and when i zoom in you're going to
see<00:06:06.970> a<00:06:07.090> bunch<00:06:07.330> of<00:06:07.420> like<00:06:07.600> you<00:06:07.750> know<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:08.080> bunch<00:06:08.440> of

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
see a bunch of like you know a bunch of

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.280 
see a bunch of like you know a bunch of
squiggly<00:06:08.860> line<00:06:09.130> but<00:06:09.400> when<00:06:09.520> i<00:06:09.550> zoom<00:06:09.610> out<00:06:10.290> you

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
squiggly line but when i zoom out you

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.110 
squiggly line but when i zoom out you
can<00:06:11.320> see<00:06:11.470> like<00:06:11.920> you<00:06:12.280> know<00:06:12.310> it's<00:06:12.730> actually

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
can see like you know it's actually

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.500 
can see like you know it's actually
looked<00:06:13.330> like<00:06:13.390> that<00:06:14.010> sort<00:06:15.010> of<00:06:15.100> like<00:06:15.190> a<00:06:15.510> better

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
looked like that sort of like a better

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.150 
looked like that sort of like a better
painting<00:06:17.080> because<00:06:17.380> you<00:06:17.500> don't<00:06:17.680> see<00:06:17.860> a<00:06:17.890> lot<00:06:18.130> of

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
painting because you don't see a lot of

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.040 
painting because you don't see a lot of
brushstroke<00:06:18.670> and<00:06:18.940> the<00:06:19.210> point<00:06:19.450> is<00:06:19.570> use<00:06:19.780> big

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
brushstroke and the point is use big

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.110 
brushstroke and the point is use big
brush<00:06:20.260> and<00:06:20.290> so<00:06:20.740> you<00:06:20.800> can<00:06:21.010> kind<00:06:21.250> of<00:06:21.280> like<00:06:21.370> going

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
brush and so you can kind of like going

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.930 
brush and so you can kind of like going
in<00:06:22.240> and<00:06:22.420> this<00:06:22.570> is<00:06:22.750> like<00:06:22.900> a<00:06:22.930> really<00:06:23.380> quick<00:06:23.940> speed

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
in and this is like a really quick speed

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.020 
in and this is like a really quick speed
painting<00:06:25.180> so<00:06:26.170> it's<00:06:26.590> a<00:06:26.920> good<00:06:27.070> practice<00:06:27.220> kind<00:06:27.970> of

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
painting so it's a good practice kind of

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.550 
painting so it's a good practice kind of
like<00:06:28.150> you<00:06:28.300> know<00:06:28.330> figuring<00:06:28.840> out<00:06:28.990> lighting<00:06:29.290> and

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
like you know figuring out lighting and

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.050 
like you know figuring out lighting and
things<00:06:29.710> like<00:06:29.830> that<00:06:29.890> and<00:06:30.280> you<00:06:30.310> can<00:06:30.580> always<00:06:30.850> go

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
things like that and you can always go

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.630 
things like that and you can always go
back<00:06:31.090> in<00:06:31.450> and<00:06:31.690> if<00:06:32.170> you<00:06:32.380> some<00:06:32.950> of<00:06:33.040> them<00:06:33.160> turn<00:06:33.610> out

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
back in and if you some of them turn out

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.310 
back in and if you some of them turn out
well<00:06:33.970> then<00:06:34.240> you<00:06:34.390> might<00:06:34.570> want<00:06:34.900> to<00:06:34.930> refine<00:06:35.290> it

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
well then you might want to refine it

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.150 
well then you might want to refine it
and<00:06:35.650> make<00:06:36.400> it<00:06:36.430> look<00:06:36.900> presentable<00:06:37.900> also<00:06:38.500> but

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
and make it look presentable also but

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.370 
and make it look presentable also but
this<00:06:39.700> is<00:06:39.850> the<00:06:40.120> distant<00:06:40.660> that<00:06:40.810> it<00:06:41.050> should<00:06:41.260> be

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
this is the distant that it should be

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.860 
this is the distant that it should be
present<00:06:42.010> that<00:06:42.210> from<00:06:43.210> you<00:06:43.450> know<00:06:43.570> the<00:06:43.720> big<00:06:43.840> one

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
present that from you know the big one

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.710 
present that from you know the big one
that<00:06:44.170> you<00:06:44.260> saw<00:06:44.470> from<00:06:44.770> the<00:06:45.070> painting<00:06:45.370> but<00:06:45.970> as

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
that you saw from the painting but as

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.900 
that you saw from the painting but as
you<00:06:46.840> can<00:06:46.960> see<00:06:47.020> the<00:06:47.290> wave<00:06:48.100> and<00:06:48.340> things<00:06:48.550> in<00:06:48.820> the

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
you can see the wave and things in the

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.050 
you can see the wave and things in the
sky<00:06:49.150> in<00:06:49.300> the<00:06:49.330> cloud<00:06:49.600> whatever<00:06:49.990> and<00:06:50.640> it<00:06:51.640> gave<00:06:51.910> it

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
sky in the cloud whatever and it gave it

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.180 
sky in the cloud whatever and it gave it
a<00:06:52.120> possession<00:06:52.420> of<00:06:52.720> death<00:06:53.200> and<00:06:53.440> practicing

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
a possession of death and practicing

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.300 
a possession of death and practicing
lighting<00:06:54.550> and<00:06:55.320> give<00:06:56.320> sense<00:06:56.680> of<00:06:56.800> depth<00:06:57.010> it's<00:06:57.220> a

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
lighting and give sense of depth it's a

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.010 
lighting and give sense of depth it's a
good<00:06:57.490> practice<00:06:57.640> when<00:06:58.000> you<00:06:58.120> do<00:06:58.450> a<00:06:58.480> painting<00:06:58.900> and

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
good practice when you do a painting and

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.690 
good practice when you do a painting and
things<00:06:59.080> like<00:06:59.230> that<00:06:59.290> okay<00:06:59.740> thanks<00:07:00.100> thanks<00:07:00.220> for
