mask<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.289> use<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.220> minimize<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
mask that you can use to minimize the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.689 
mask that you can use to minimize the
appearance<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> pores<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:29.010> your<00:00:29.039> face<00:00:29.160> and

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
warm water actually opens up your pores

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.470 
warm water actually opens up your pores
and<00:05:11.770> after<00:05:12.310> you're<00:05:12.430> done<00:05:12.640> you<00:05:12.850> can<00:05:13.060> even<00:05:13.240> use

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
and after you're done you can even use

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.270 
and after you're done you can even use
like<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.690> little<00:05:14.050> cube<00:05:14.290> of<00:05:14.410> ice<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:14.920> just<00:05:14.980> you

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
like a little cube of ice and just you

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.340 
like a little cube of ice and just you
know<00:05:15.310> rub<00:05:15.670> it<00:05:15.790> everywhere<00:05:16.360> where<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.080> feel

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
know rub it everywhere where you feel

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.990 
know rub it everywhere where you feel
that<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:17.740> have<00:05:17.920> open<00:05:18.280> pores<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.730> everything

that you have open pores and everything

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.320 
that you have open pores and everything
so<00:05:19.120> if<00:05:19.270> that<00:05:19.900> also<00:05:20.230> helps<00:05:20.680> close<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.850> pores<00:05:22.090> up

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330
