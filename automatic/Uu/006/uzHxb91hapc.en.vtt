exam calm no more fear from exam so
natives<00:00:10.410> first<00:00:10.710> talk<00:00:11.219> about<00:00:11.509> biases<00:00:12.509> so

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
natives first talk about biases so

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.120 
natives first talk about biases so
biases<00:00:14.130> include<00:00:15.059> all<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.960> fishes<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.920> will

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
biases include all the fishes so it will

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.580 
biases include all the fishes so it will
include<00:00:17.369> all<00:00:17.609> types<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.119> fishes<00:00:18.570> with<00:00:19.170> jaws

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
include all types of fishes with jaws

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.439 
include all types of fishes with jaws
because<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.100> jaalin<00:00:20.369> specious<00:00:20.970> were<00:00:21.150> already

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
because the jaalin specious were already

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.500 
because the jaalin specious were already
discussed<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.140> Agnetha<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.119> includes

you would have seen fishes in your real
life<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.030> know<00:00:36.300> how<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.750> look<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
life so you know how they look like and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.380 
life so you know how they look like and
how<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.620> their<00:00:37.770> structure<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.850> scales<00:00:39.149> are

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
how is their structure the scales are

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.569 
how is their structure the scales are
present<00:00:39.750> over<00:00:39.870> their<00:00:40.110> body

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
present over their body

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.560 
present over their body
respiration<00:00:41.579> happens<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> help<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
respiration happens with the help of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020 
respiration happens with the help of
gills<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.590> where<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> grills<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.730> fields

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
gills so where are the grills the fields

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.930 
gills so where are the grills the fields
are<00:00:45.180> present<00:00:45.500> somewhere<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.940> somewhere

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
are present somewhere here somewhere

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.310 
are present somewhere here somewhere
here<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.239> will<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.960> gills<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
here you will have the gills so the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.350 
here you will have the gills so the
gills<00:00:52.559> help<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.010> absorbing<00:00:53.430> oxygen<00:00:53.789> which

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
gills help in absorbing oxygen which

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.200 
gills help in absorbing oxygen which
remains<00:00:54.719> dissolved<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> water<00:00:56.210> talking

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
remains dissolved in the water talking

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.520 
remains dissolved in the water talking
about<00:00:57.449> their<00:00:57.629> movements<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
about their movements they have a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
about their movements they have a
streamlined<00:00:59.160> body<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.820> muscular<00:01:00.000> tail

the aeroplanes the shape of the
aeroplanes<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> observe<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.729> is

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
aeroplanes if you observe that that is

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.550 
aeroplanes if you observe that that is
also<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.240> similar<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> shape<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
also very similar to the shape of the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.260 
also very similar to the shape of the
fishes<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> also<00:01:17.850> known<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
fishes so that is also known as a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.510 
fishes so that is also known as a
streamlined<00:01:18.869> body<00:01:19.170> which<00:01:19.409> helps<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.950> in

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
streamlined body which helps it in

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
streamlined body which helps it in
moving<00:01:21.060> through<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> air<00:01:23.930> they<00:01:24.930> are

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
moving through the air they are

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.410 
moving through the air they are
cold-blooded<00:01:25.560> animals<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> mean<00:01:27.299> by

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
cold-blooded animals what do you mean by

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.539 
cold-blooded animals what do you mean by
cold-blooded<00:01:28.200> there<00:01:28.829> are<00:01:28.950> two<00:01:29.100> types<00:01:29.369> of

the example of human beings human beings
are<00:01:43.290> warm-blooded<00:01:43.710> animals<00:01:44.399> batters<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:45.390> can

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
are warm-blooded animals batters we can

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.200 
are warm-blooded animals batters we can
regulate<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.590> temperature<00:01:47.130> inside<00:01:47.310> our<00:01:47.790> body

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
regulate the temperature inside our body

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
regulate the temperature inside our body
for<00:01:48.479> example<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.070> very<00:01:50.250> hot<00:01:50.579> outside

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
for example when it is very hot outside

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.580 
for example when it is very hot outside
when<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> temperature<00:01:51.840> outside<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.530> very

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
when the temperature outside is very

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.789 
when the temperature outside is very
high<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.310> happens<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:54.630> start<00:01:54.869> sweating<00:01:55.409> why

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
high what happens we start sweating why

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.590 
high what happens we start sweating why
do<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.100> sweat<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:57.030> when<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.360> start

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
do we sweat because when we start

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.920 
do we sweat because when we start
sweating<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.619> actually<00:01:59.219> tend<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.479> give<00:02:00.719> out

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
sweating we actually tend to give out

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.859 
sweating we actually tend to give out
water<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.219> surface<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> our<00:02:03.000> body<00:02:03.329> when

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
water on the surface of our body when

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.980 
water on the surface of our body when
you<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.170> water<00:02:04.500> bite<00:02:04.920> by<00:02:05.479> giving<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.630> water

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you have water bite by giving up water

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.830 
you have water bite by giving up water
or<00:02:07.229> by<00:02:07.320> releasing<00:02:07.649> water<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
or by releasing water the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.170 
or by releasing water the
inside<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.440> our<00:02:09.619> body<00:02:09.920> feels<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.519> little<00:02:10.700> cool

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
inside of our body feels a little cool

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.930 
inside of our body feels a little cool
so<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.930> temperature<00:02:12.379> of<00:02:12.560> our<00:02:12.709> body<00:02:13.129> decreases

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
so the temperature of our body decreases

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.420 
so the temperature of our body decreases
to<00:02:14.330> some<00:02:14.510> extent<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.709> how<00:02:15.890> we<00:02:15.950> can

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
to some extent so that is how we can

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.400 
to some extent so that is how we can
actually<00:02:16.670> regulate<00:02:17.269> our<00:02:17.840> internal

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
actually regulate our internal

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.559 
actually regulate our internal
temperature<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.489> such<00:02:19.700> animals<00:02:20.239> which<00:02:20.390> can

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
temperature so such animals which can

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.210 
temperature so such animals which can
regulate<00:02:20.870> their<00:02:21.200> body<00:02:21.379> temperature<00:02:21.560> are

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
regulate their body temperature are

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.339 
regulate their body temperature are
known<00:02:22.400> as<00:02:22.580> warm-blooded<00:02:23.330> whereas<00:02:23.930> others

known as warm-blooded whereas others

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.110 
known as warm-blooded whereas others
which<00:02:24.769> cannot<00:02:25.220> regulate<00:02:25.610> their<00:02:25.940> body

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
which cannot regulate their body

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.690 
which cannot regulate their body
temperature<00:02:26.299> are<00:02:26.930> known<00:02:27.319> as<00:02:27.700> cold-blooded

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
temperature are known as cold-blooded

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.449 
temperature are known as cold-blooded

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.410 
pata ledge waters but they are all
connective<00:02:54.980> tissues<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.549> we<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.120> spoken

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
connective tissues and we have spoken

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.650 
connective tissues and we have spoken
about<00:02:56.690> them<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.440> detail<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:58.129> your<00:02:58.540> lesson<00:02:59.540> in

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
about them in detail in your lesson in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.089 
about them in detail in your lesson in
class<00:02:59.900> ninth<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:02.720> now<00:03:02.840> let<00:03:03.079> us<00:03:03.260> talk<00:03:03.500> about<00:03:03.530> the

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
class ninth so now let us talk about the

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.670 
class ninth so now let us talk about the
circulatory<00:03:04.610> system<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:05.390> biases<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.110> little

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
circulatory system of biases in little

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.400 
circulatory system of biases in little
more<00:03:06.860> detail<00:03:07.310> as<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.760> said<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.420> biases<00:03:08.959> have<00:03:09.200> a

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
more detail as I said that biases have a

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.289 
more detail as I said that biases have a
two<00:03:09.590> chambered<00:03:09.829> heart<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.819> we<00:03:10.970> will<00:03:11.150> actually

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
two chambered heart so we will actually

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.470 
two chambered heart so we will actually
see<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.019> process<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.590> circulation<00:03:13.370> blood<00:03:13.549> how

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
see the process of circulation blood how

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.509 
see the process of circulation blood how
this<00:03:14.720> process<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.230> circulation<00:03:15.889> happens<00:03:16.310> in

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
this process of circulation happens in

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.629 
this process of circulation happens in
case<00:03:16.819> of<00:03:16.870> fishes<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:21.200> let<00:03:21.380> us<00:03:21.410> look<00:03:21.739> at<00:03:21.980> the

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
case of fishes so let us look at the

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.849 
case of fishes so let us look at the
functioning<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.989> closed<00:03:24.230> circulatory

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
functioning of the closed circulatory

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.240 
functioning of the closed circulatory
system<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.700> Isis<00:03:26.209> or<00:03:26.420> fishes<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.620> fishes<00:03:28.040> have

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
system of Isis or fishes the fishes have

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.759 
system of Isis or fishes the fishes have
a<00:03:28.489> two<00:03:28.760> chambered<00:03:29.060> heart<00:03:29.389> so<00:03:30.319> what<00:03:30.470> are<00:03:30.650> those

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
a two chambered heart so what are those

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.059 
a two chambered heart so what are those
two<00:03:31.519> chambers<00:03:32.000> one<00:03:32.900> article<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.680> one

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
two chambers one article and one

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.580 
two chambers one article and one
ventricle<00:03:34.609> so<00:03:35.120> what<00:03:35.269> does<00:03:35.450> Oracle<00:03:35.989> article<00:03:36.470> is

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
ventricle so what does Oracle article is

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.289 
ventricle so what does Oracle article is
the<00:03:36.709> receiving<00:03:37.160> chamber<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.849> heart<00:03:38.000> and

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
the receiving chamber of the heart and

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.050 
the receiving chamber of the heart and
ventricle<00:03:39.169> is<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.590> pumping<00:03:40.280> chamber<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.880> is

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
ventricle is the pumping chamber that is

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.360 
ventricle is the pumping chamber that is
the<00:03:41.150> chamber<00:03:41.480> with<00:03:41.690> same<00:03:41.959> spell<00:03:42.349> and<00:03:42.560> Oracle

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
the chamber with same spell and Oracle

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.409 
the chamber with same spell and Oracle
is<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.609> chamber<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.450> receives<00:03:44.930> blood<00:03:46.419> so

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
is the chamber that receives blood so

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.659 
is the chamber that receives blood so
there<00:03:47.599> is<00:03:47.780> one<00:03:48.079> receiving<00:03:48.829> chamber<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.489> one

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
there is one receiving chamber and one

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.240 
there is one receiving chamber and one
pumping<00:03:50.180> chamber<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:50.840> one<00:03:51.380> Oracle<00:03:52.069> and

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
pumping chamber that is one Oracle and

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.170 
pumping chamber that is one Oracle and
one<00:03:53.000> ventricle<00:03:54.099> single<00:03:55.099> circulation<00:03:55.880> have

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
one ventricle single circulation have

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.229 
one ventricle single circulation have
takes<00:03:56.569> place<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.169> case<00:03:57.380> of<00:03:57.410> Pisces<00:03:58.340> so<00:03:58.519> here<00:03:59.060> we

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
takes place in case of Pisces so here we

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.270 
takes place in case of Pisces so here we
will<00:03:59.419> actually<00:03:59.569> see<00:04:00.079> how<00:04:00.349> this<00:04:00.680> circulation

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
will actually see how this circulation

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.460 
will actually see how this circulation
actually<00:04:02.090> takes<00:04:02.419> place<00:04:03.549> so<00:04:04.549> let<00:04:04.700> us<00:04:04.730> suppose

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.780 

so<00:04:09.470> let<00:04:09.620> us<00:04:09.650> see<00:04:09.919> how<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.280> circulation

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
so let us see how the circulation

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.039 
so let us see how the circulation
actually<00:04:11.630> takes<00:04:12.200> place<00:04:13.419> now<00:04:14.419> let<00:04:14.660> us<00:04:14.690> suppose

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
actually takes place now let us suppose

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.509 
actually takes place now let us suppose
this<00:04:15.700> is<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.859> heart<00:04:19.190> of<00:04:19.489> the

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
this is the heart of the

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.990 
this is the heart of the
so<00:04:21.329> this<00:04:21.510> heart<00:04:21.810> will<00:04:22.110> have<00:04:22.320> one<00:04:23.010> Oracle<00:04:23.760> and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
so this heart will have one Oracle and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.470 
so this heart will have one Oracle and
one<00:04:25.070> ventricle<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:26.190> inside<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.820> art<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.450> have

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
one ventricle so inside the art you have

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.570 
one ventricle so inside the art you have
these<00:04:28.290> two<00:04:28.620> chambers<00:04:28.890> Oracle<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:29.940> ventricle

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
these two chambers Oracle and ventricle

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.770 
these two chambers Oracle and ventricle
right<00:04:33.350> now<00:04:34.350> these<00:04:34.860> are<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.340> gills<00:04:35.640> these<00:04:36.480> are

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
right now these are the gills these are

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.890 
right now these are the gills these are
different<00:04:37.500> parts<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.400> body<00:04:38.910> now<00:04:39.630> what

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
different parts of the body now what

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.850 
different parts of the body now what
happens<00:04:40.410> is<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:42.600> gills<00:04:42.930> of<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.260> fishes

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
happens is that the gills of the fishes

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.950 
happens is that the gills of the fishes
these<00:04:44.760> bills<00:04:45.240> will<00:04:45.990> absorb<00:04:46.740> oxygen<00:04:47.960> from

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
these bills will absorb oxygen from

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.930 
these bills will absorb oxygen from
water<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:49.980> oxygen<00:04:50.310> which<00:04:50.610> remains

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
water so the oxygen which remains

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.330 
water so the oxygen which remains
dissolved<00:04:51.240> in<00:04:51.690> water<00:04:51.900> they<00:04:52.560> are<00:04:52.590> absorbed<00:04:53.160> by

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
dissolved in water they are absorbed by

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.390 
dissolved in water they are absorbed by
the<00:04:53.400> gills<00:04:54.060> so<00:04:54.660> now<00:04:54.870> gills<00:04:55.680> have<00:04:56.040> a<00:04:56.070> more

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
the gills so now gills have a more

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.300 
the gills so now gills have a more
oxygen<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.570> this<00:04:57.810> oxygen<00:04:57.990> gets<00:04:58.560> dissolved<00:04:58.830> in

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
oxygen so this oxygen gets dissolved in

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.900 
oxygen so this oxygen gets dissolved in
the<00:04:59.460> blood

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
the blood

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.500 
the blood
so<00:05:00.600> this<00:05:00.980> oxygenated<00:05:01.980> blood<00:05:02.310> which<00:05:02.850> is<00:05:03.060> rich

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
so this oxygenated blood which is rich

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.200 
so this oxygenated blood which is rich
in<00:05:03.540> oxygen<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.650> then<00:05:05.310> sent<00:05:05.790> to<00:05:06.090> different

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
in oxygen is then sent to different

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.120 
in oxygen is then sent to different
parts<00:05:06.840> of<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.050> body<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:08.250> this<00:05:08.580> is<00:05:09.080> oxygenated

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
parts of the body so this is oxygenated

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.900 
parts of the body so this is oxygenated
blood<00:05:11.360> so<00:05:12.360> blood<00:05:12.630> which<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.050> rich<00:05:13.980> in<00:05:14.400> oxygen

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
blood so blood which is rich in oxygen

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.300 
blood so blood which is rich in oxygen
so<00:05:15.630> this<00:05:15.840> blood<00:05:16.140> will<00:05:16.410> reach<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.919> different

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
so this blood will reach to different

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.840 
so this blood will reach to different
parts<00:05:17.669> of<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:18.060> body<00:05:18.860> now<00:05:19.860> in<00:05:19.890> different<00:05:20.550> parts

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
parts of the body now in different parts

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.400 
parts of the body now in different parts
of<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.120> body<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.510> blood<00:05:21.780> will<00:05:21.990> reach<00:05:22.169> and

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
of the body that blood will reach and

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.010 
of the body that blood will reach and
then<00:05:23.010> from<00:05:23.400> these<00:05:23.760> different<00:05:24.330> parts<00:05:24.690> of<00:05:24.810> the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
then from these different parts of the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.680 
then from these different parts of the
body<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.890> deoxygenated<00:05:26.580> blood<00:05:27.030> that<00:05:27.360> is<00:05:27.540> the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
body the deoxygenated blood that is the

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.080 
body the deoxygenated blood that is the
oxygen<00:05:28.230> will<00:05:28.380> get<00:05:28.530> utilized<00:05:28.890> for<00:05:29.610> different

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
oxygen will get utilized for different

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.090 
oxygen will get utilized for different
activities<00:05:30.240> which<00:05:30.840> take<00:05:30.870> keep<00:05:31.500> on<00:05:31.740> taking

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
activities which take keep on taking

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.670 
activities which take keep on taking
place<00:05:32.310> inside<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.910> cells<00:05:33.120> so<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.110> now<00:05:34.650> the

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
place inside the cells so the now the

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.750 
place inside the cells so the now the
blood<00:05:35.100> is<00:05:35.280> has<00:05:35.520> less<00:05:35.970> oxygen<00:05:36.620> but<00:05:37.620> more<00:05:38.040> carbon

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
blood is has less oxygen but more carbon

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.780 
blood is has less oxygen but more carbon
dioxide<00:05:39.330> so<00:05:39.810> this<00:05:40.169> deoxygenated<00:05:41.100> blood<00:05:41.280> from

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
dioxide so this deoxygenated blood from

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.150 
dioxide so this deoxygenated blood from
different<00:05:42.510> parts<00:05:42.870> of<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.080> body<00:05:43.440> will<00:05:43.740> come<00:05:43.979> to

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
different parts of the body will come to

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.070 
different parts of the body will come to
the<00:05:44.280> Oracle<00:05:44.550> so<00:05:45.000> Oracle<00:05:45.419> is<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:45.660> receiving

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
the Oracle so Oracle is the receiving

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.620 
the Oracle so Oracle is the receiving
chamber<00:05:46.440> so<00:05:46.860> Oracle<00:05:47.430> will<00:05:47.610> receive<00:05:48.060> the

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
chamber so Oracle will receive the

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.020 
chamber so Oracle will receive the
deoxygenated<00:05:49.470> blood<00:05:50.010> so<00:05:50.550> this<00:05:50.729> is<00:05:50.880> the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
deoxygenated blood so this is the

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.540 
deoxygenated blood so this is the
deoxygenated<00:05:51.570> blood<00:05:52.040> Oracle<00:05:53.040> will<00:05:53.220> receive

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
deoxygenated blood Oracle will receive

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.240 
deoxygenated blood Oracle will receive
the<00:05:53.760> deoxygenated<00:05:54.510> blood<00:05:54.690> from<00:05:55.080> Oracle<00:05:56.070> this

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
the deoxygenated blood from Oracle this

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.120 
the deoxygenated blood from Oracle this
blood<00:05:56.520> will<00:05:56.760> go<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:57.330> ventricle<00:05:58.229> and<00:05:58.470> from

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
blood will go to the ventricle and from

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.790 
blood will go to the ventricle and from
ventricle<00:05:59.820> it<00:06:00.030> will<00:06:00.270> go<00:06:00.570> to<00:06:00.630> the<00:06:00.960> gills

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
ventricle it will go to the gills

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.820 
ventricle it will go to the gills
so<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.490> deoxygenated<00:06:02.970> blood<00:06:03.390> will<00:06:03.990> go<00:06:04.530> to<00:06:04.590> the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
so the deoxygenated blood will go to the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.330 
so the deoxygenated blood will go to the
gills<00:06:06.050> again<00:06:07.050> the<00:06:07.200> gills<00:06:07.470> will<00:06:07.680> absorb<00:06:08.070> oxygen

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
gills again the gills will absorb oxygen

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.909 
gills again the gills will absorb oxygen
from<00:06:08.940> water<00:06:09.000> so<00:06:09.780> it<00:06:09.870> will<00:06:10.050> turn<00:06:10.560> the

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
from water so it will turn the

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.340 
from water so it will turn the
deoxygenated<00:06:11.460> blood<00:06:11.910> into<00:06:12.390> oxygenated<00:06:13.140> blood

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
deoxygenated blood into oxygenated blood

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.440 
deoxygenated blood into oxygenated blood
and<00:06:13.560> it<00:06:13.710> will<00:06:13.890> again<00:06:14.190> transfer<00:06:14.760> it<00:06:14.910> to<00:06:15.060> the

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
and it will again transfer it to the

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.240 
and it will again transfer it to the
different<00:06:15.600> parts<00:06:16.050> of<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.290> body<00:06:16.500> so<00:06:17.010> this

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
different parts of the body so this

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.070 
different parts of the body so this
circulation<00:06:17.880> process<00:06:18.510> will<00:06:18.660> keep<00:06:18.870> on

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
circulation process will keep on

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.590 
circulation process will keep on
continuing<00:06:19.470> so<00:06:20.160> here<00:06:20.400> if<00:06:20.550> you<00:06:20.669> see<00:06:20.880> there<00:06:21.450> is

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
continuing so here if you see there is

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.540 
continuing so here if you see there is
one<00:06:21.780> single<00:06:22.169> circulation<00:06:22.979> that<00:06:23.100> means<00:06:23.340> the

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
one single circulation that means the

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.000 
one single circulation that means the
blood<00:06:23.760> passes<00:06:24.330> through<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.660> heart<00:06:24.930> only<00:06:25.500> once

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
blood passes through the heart only once

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.700 
blood passes through the heart only once
so<00:06:26.460> only<00:06:26.700> once<00:06:26.910> it<00:06:27.210> crosses<00:06:27.419> the<00:06:27.870> heart<00:06:28.410> that

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
so only once it crosses the heart that

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.279 
so only once it crosses the heart that
is<00:06:28.860> why<00:06:28.979> it<00:06:29.160> is<00:06:29.190> known<00:06:29.490> as<00:06:29.550> single<00:06:30.450> circulation

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
is why it is known as single circulation

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:32.660 
is why it is known as single circulation
in<00:06:31.470> this<00:06:32.099> kind<00:06:32.400> of

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
in this kind of

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.550 
in this kind of
circulatory<00:06:33.330> system<00:06:33.870> there<00:06:34.350> is<00:06:34.380> no

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
circulatory system there is no

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.590 
circulatory system there is no
separation<00:06:35.370> of<00:06:35.670> oxygenated<00:06:36.330> and

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
separation of oxygenated and

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.770 
separation of oxygenated and
deoxygenated<00:06:36.710> blood<00:06:37.940> so<00:06:38.940> this<00:06:39.150> happens<00:06:39.630> in

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
deoxygenated blood so this happens in

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.170 
deoxygenated blood so this happens in
case<00:06:39.990> of<00:06:40.020> cold-blooded<00:06:40.860> animals<00:06:41.280> like<00:06:41.490> fishes

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
case of cold-blooded animals like fishes

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.420 
case of cold-blooded animals like fishes
so<00:06:42.570> this<00:06:42.750> is<00:06:42.930> how<00:06:43.110> single<00:06:43.350> circulation<00:06:44.160> takes

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
so this is how single circulation takes

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.650 
so this is how single circulation takes
place<00:06:44.670> in<00:06:44.880> fishes<00:06:45.270> with<00:06:45.480> two<00:06:45.780> chambered<00:06:46.290> heart

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
place in fishes with two chambered heart

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.450 
place in fishes with two chambered heart
so<00:06:48.660> let<00:06:48.780> us<00:06:48.810> now<00:06:49.080> look<00:06:49.110> at<00:06:49.500> the<00:06:49.560> examples<00:06:50.310> of

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460
