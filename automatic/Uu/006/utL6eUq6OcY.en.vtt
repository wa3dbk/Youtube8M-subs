00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
okay I got a 399 rotox type 401 motor

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.270 
okay I got a 399 rotox type 401 motor
right<00:00:06.899> here<00:00:06.960> I'm<00:00:07.170> working<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.560> came<00:00:07.950> out<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.220> an

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
right here I'm working on came out of an

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.720 
right here I'm working on came out of an
old<00:00:08.340> rat<00:00:08.670> sled<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.240> bought<00:00:10.400> it<00:00:11.400> wasn't

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
old rat sled that I bought it wasn't

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.879 
old rat sled that I bought it wasn't
running<00:00:11.969> right<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.780> could<00:00:12.990> get<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.500> kind<00:00:13.769> of

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
running right I could get it to kind of

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.860 
running right I could get it to kind of
run<00:00:14.130> but<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.910> points<00:00:15.269> are<00:00:15.389> getting<00:00:15.660> dirty

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
run but the points are getting dirty

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
run but the points are getting dirty
losing<00:00:16.440> spark<00:00:16.830> all<00:00:17.130> my<00:00:17.310> tech<00:00:17.550> jazz<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.119> I

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
losing spark all my tech jazz so I

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.109 
losing spark all my tech jazz so I
suspected<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.490> points<00:00:20.820> need<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.029> be

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
suspected that the points need to be

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.269 
suspected that the points need to be
cleaned<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.650> know<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.010> seals

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
cleaned and then that you know the seals

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.060 
cleaned and then that you know the seals
being<00:00:23.550> checked<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.779> type<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> jazz<00:00:25.289> but

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
being checked all that type of jazz but

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.040 
being checked all that type of jazz but
in<00:00:26.220> order<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> seals<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:27.750> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
in order to get at the seals or to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.570 
in order to get at the seals or to
reseal<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.650> motor<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:29.039> gonna<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.460> get

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
reseal this motor I'm gonna have to get

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.970 
reseal this motor I'm gonna have to get
this<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.390> clutch<00:00:30.660> off<00:00:30.900> which<00:00:31.260> screws<00:00:31.679> on

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
this this clutch off which screws on

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340 
this this clutch off which screws on
it's<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.210> screw<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.480> clutch<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it's a it's a screw on clutch and to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.049 
it's a it's a screw on clutch and to
tighten<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.010> clockwise<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.790> done

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
tighten it up it's clockwise and done

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.670 
tighten it up it's clockwise and done
tighten<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.540> counterclockwise<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.320> like

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
tighten it is counterclockwise just like

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.790 
tighten it is counterclockwise just like
I<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> bowl<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.090> anyways<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:39.960> from

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
I not in a bowl so anyways they from

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
I not in a bowl so anyways they from
Rotax<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.460> did<00:00:41.670> put<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> hole<00:00:42.750> through<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
Rotax they did put a hole through the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
Rotax they did put a hole through the
clutch<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> end<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.040> that's<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.969> some

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
clutch at the end and that's for some

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.410 
clutch at the end and that's for some
sort<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.230> puller<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.950> fits<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.250> top<00:00:47.420> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
sort of puller that fits over top and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.510 
sort of puller that fits over top and
it's<00:00:48.660> got<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> hole<00:00:48.989> through<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.710> pin<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it's got a hole through it you pin it a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.500 
it's got a hole through it you pin it a
so<00:00:50.850> here's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> good<00:00:51.809> example<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.480> get<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
so here's a good example is you get a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.900 
so here's a good example is you get a
pin<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.410> pin<00:00:55.649> goes<00:00:55.860> through<00:00:55.910> but

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
pin like this the pin goes through but

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
pin like this the pin goes through but
something<00:00:57.660> else<00:00:57.750> was<00:00:57.899> over<00:00:58.320> top<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.890> pin

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
something else was over top and you pin

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
something else was over top and you pin
it<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.489> instead<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.539> marring<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.199> shaft

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it and instead of marring up the shaft

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.410 
it and instead of marring up the shaft
here<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> pipe<00:01:02.789> wrench<00:01:03.000> or

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
here you can get a pipe wrench or

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.700 
here you can get a pipe wrench or
whatever<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.019> anyways<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.439> decided<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.510> use<00:01:06.510> my

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
whatever so anyways I decided to use my

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.570 
whatever so anyways I decided to use my
research<00:01:08.630> old<00:01:09.630> Toyota<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.950> seems<00:01:11.430> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
research old Toyota because it seems to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.399 
research old Toyota because it seems to
fit<00:01:11.700> pretty<00:01:11.880> nice<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.990> doesn't<00:01:13.290> fit

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
fit pretty nice on there it doesn't fit

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.340 
fit pretty nice on there it doesn't fit
real<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:13.970> enough<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.540> don't<00:01:15.750> more<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
real good enough so I don't more up the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.679 
real good enough so I don't more up the
shaft<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> clutch<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> pin<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> right

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
shaft of the clutch so I pin it right

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.100 
shaft of the clutch so I pin it right
get<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> pin<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.810> could<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
get the pin on there you could use a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
get the pin on there you could use a
bolt<00:01:22.500> instead<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> proper<00:01:23.610> fitting<00:01:23.850> bolt

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
bolt instead like a proper fitting bolt

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.990 
bolt instead like a proper fitting bolt
but<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> didn't<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> turn<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.610> until<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
but I didn't so so you turn it until the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.890 
but I didn't so so you turn it until the
motor<00:01:27.930> stops<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:29.400> stop<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
motor stops and then stop because of the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.090 
motor stops and then stop because of the
rope<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> get<00:01:31.950> your

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
rope is in there and then you get your

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
rope is in there and then you get your
pipe<00:01:32.250> wrench<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.729> there<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.290> basically<00:01:35.750> you

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
pipe wrench on there and basically you

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.429 
pipe wrench on there and basically you
know<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.159> give<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> couple<00:01:38.490> turns

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
know just give it a couple turns

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.539 
know just give it a couple turns
it'll<00:01:40.439> take<00:01:40.590> more<00:01:40.770> pressure<00:01:41.070> than<00:01:41.340> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it'll take more pressure than that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.539 
it'll take more pressure than that
obviously<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.420> had<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> off<00:01:43.130> there<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> go

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
obviously I just had it off there you go

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.990 
obviously I just had it off there you go
let's<00:01:44.759> try<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> get<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.950> clutch<00:01:46.950> off<00:01:47.220> one
