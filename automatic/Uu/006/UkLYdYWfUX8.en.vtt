00:03:39.910 --> 00:04:25.850 
ripped and put to work in them so both
targets<00:03:40.360> have<00:03:40.480> been<00:03:40.569> assassinated

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.160 

they're<00:04:26.860> summoning<00:04:27.370> rats<00:04:27.690> once<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.840> rats<00:04:29.020> are

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
they're summoning rats once the rats are

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.890 
they're summoning rats once the rats are
in<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.350> world<00:04:29.560> there<00:04:29.860> are<00:04:29.890> like<00:04:30.100> little<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.520> is

in the world there are like little a is

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.270 
in the world there are like little a is
so<00:04:31.900> sometimes<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.380> guards<00:04:32.530> win<00:04:32.830> some<00:04:33.100> time

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
so sometimes the guards win some time

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.280 
so sometimes the guards win some time
the<00:04:33.400> rats<00:04:33.580> win<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.540> here<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.840> player<00:04:35.050> has

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
the rats win and here the player has

possessed one of his own rats is now

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.900 
possessed one of his own rats is now
getting<00:04:37.270> away

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.880 

and<00:04:46.120> that's<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.780> end<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.080> violent<00:04:47.500> messy

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
and that's the end of the violent messy

00:04:47.890 --> 00:05:01.500 
and that's the end of the violent messy
playthrough<00:04:48.370> of<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.520> golden<00:04:48.640> cat<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:01.390> is

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
playthrough of the golden cat so this is

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.060 
playthrough of the golden cat so this is
a<00:05:01.540> very<00:05:01.750> different<00:05:01.930> area<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.470> previous<00:05:02.800> area

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
with Vash and pretty this is like

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.980

that we did not plan for but players
found<00:06:27.670> it<00:06:27.850> quite<00:06:27.970> fun<00:06:28.330> so<00:06:28.750> we<00:06:28.960> made<00:06:29.380> some<00:06:29.410> small

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
found it quite fun so we made some small

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:43.679 
found it quite fun so we made some small
changes<00:06:30.250> to<00:06:30.310> help<00:06:30.610> support<00:06:31.060> it

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:04.939 
are actual breakable wooden shields so

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:07.209 
are actual breakable wooden shields so
