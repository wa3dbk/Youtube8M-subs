design you're going to start with a very

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.230 
design you're going to start with a very
large<00:00:21.240> scale<00:00:21.800> sharp<00:00:22.800> stippling<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:24.060> quote

this<00:00:24.449> design<00:00:24.720> all<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.500> simply<00:00:25.890> wiggle

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this design all you do is simply wiggle

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.609 
this design all you do is simply wiggle
around<00:00:26.369> come<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> point<00:00:27.449> wiggle<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.380> another

around come to a point wiggle in another

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.890 
around come to a point wiggle in another
direction<00:00:29.029> curve<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.179> around<00:00:30.240> basically

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
direction curve it around basically

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.860 
direction curve it around basically
think<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.380> regular<00:00:32.099> stippling<00:00:32.790> those<00:00:33.360> curvy

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
think of regular stippling those curvy

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.280 
think of regular stippling those curvy
shapes<00:00:34.170> only<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:34.980> sharp<00:00:35.430> points<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.290> really

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
shapes only with sharp points and really

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.860 
shapes only with sharp points and really
make<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:38.040> open<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.090> don't<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
make this very open you don't want it to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
make this very open you don't want it to
be<00:00:40.020> tight<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.559> dense<00:00:40.829> I'm<00:00:41.129> leaving<00:00:41.520> about<00:00:41.790> an

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
be tight and dense I'm leaving about an

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.619 
be tight and dense I'm leaving about an
inch<00:00:42.360> between<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.379> quilting<00:00:43.829> lines

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
inch between all my quilting lines

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.910 
inch between all my quilting lines
anywhere<00:00:45.629> from<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.899> half<00:00:46.050> an<00:00:46.289> inch<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.800> inch

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
anywhere from a half an inch to an inch

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.490 
anywhere from a half an inch to an inch
because<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.610> isn't<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:48.059> big<00:00:48.360> square<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
because this isn't a very big square you

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.529 
because this isn't a very big square you
want<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> lot<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> space<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> second

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
want a lot of space because the second

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.600 
want a lot of space because the second
half<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> design<00:00:52.260> fills<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.160> all<00:00:53.430> that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
half of the design fills in all that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.020 
half of the design fills in all that
space<00:00:53.910> all<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.559> simply<00:00:56.309> travel<00:00:56.789> back

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
space all you do is simply travel back

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.689 
space all you do is simply travel back
and<00:00:57.059> forth<00:00:57.360> over<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.440> baseline<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and forth over that baseline this is the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
and forth over that baseline this is the
foundational<00:01:00.270> design<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
foundational design so that was kind of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.830 
foundational design so that was kind of
your<00:01:01.789> foundation<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> you're<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> just

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
your foundation and you're going to just

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.770 
your foundation and you're going to just
travel<00:01:04.140> back<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.530> forth<00:01:04.799> over<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.460> top

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
travel back and forth over the top

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.660 
travel back and forth over the top
bisecting<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.229> these<00:01:07.409> Wiggly<00:01:08.070> kind<00:01:08.549> of

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
bisecting it with these Wiggly kind of

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.320 
bisecting it with these Wiggly kind of
flame<00:01:09.060> lines<00:01:09.770> creates<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.979> double<00:01:11.520> defect<00:01:11.939> so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
flame lines creates a double defect so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
flame lines creates a double defect so
you've<00:01:12.479> got<00:01:12.510> basically<00:01:13.080> sharp<00:01:13.860> stippling

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you've got basically sharp stippling

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.760 
you've got basically sharp stippling
stitched<00:01:14.880> over<00:01:15.090> sharp<00:01:15.750> stippling<00:01:16.200> it's

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
stitched over sharp stippling it's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.219 
stitched over sharp stippling it's
really<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.670> easy<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.990> all

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
really really easy if you can see all

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.260 
really really easy if you can see all
you<00:01:19.799> had<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.369> simply<00:01:20.580> start<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you had to do was simply start with that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.960 
you had to do was simply start with that
base<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.110> once<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.890> set<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.820> have

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
base and then once it's set all you have

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.460 
base and then once it's set all you have
to<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.479> about<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.229> stitching

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
to really think about is just stitching

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
to really think about is just stitching
back<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.040> forth<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:26.880> difficult<00:01:27.210> at

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
back and forth that's not difficult at

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.710 
back and forth that's not difficult at
all<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:29.400> biggest<00:01:29.729> thing<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.880> keep<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.270> mind<00:01:30.329> is

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
all the biggest thing to keep in mind is

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.880 
all the biggest thing to keep in mind is
that<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.439> some<00:01:31.710> weird

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that you're going to have some weird

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
that you're going to have some weird
areas<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.090> try<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
areas so just try and get in there and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.280 
areas so just try and get in there and
get<00:01:34.650> back<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:35.100> again<00:01:35.280> fill<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> area<00:01:36.900> with

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
get back out again fill up the area with

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.319 
get back out again fill up the area with
a<00:01:37.320> wiggly<00:01:37.799> flame<00:01:38.130> shape<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.090> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
a wiggly flame shape if you have to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.270 
a wiggly flame shape if you have to
expand<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> make<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> wider<00:01:40.619> make<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> into<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
expand it make it wider make it into a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.969 
expand it make it wider make it into a
spiral<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:42.509> fill<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.350> area<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> best

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
spiral just fill in that area the best

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
spiral just fill in that area the best
way<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.810> wiggle<00:01:46.110> back<00:01:46.259> around

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
way you can and then wiggle back around

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.649 
way you can and then wiggle back around
of<00:01:47.220> course<00:01:47.460> don't<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.210> worry<00:01:48.509> about

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
of course don't really worry about

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.780 
of course don't really worry about
overlapping<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.890> lines<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.549> obviously

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
overlapping your lines because obviously
