00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.200
 One of the surprises of e3 2015 was the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.559
 presentation of the legend of zelda 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.840
 triforce turns for 3ds your scheme will 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.000
 moves away from the conventional centered in the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.119
 multiplayer is believed to be a simple 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.070
 spin-off but neither force hero 2 will have its 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.949
 location in the chronology according to their 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.109
 own creators they still do not clarify 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.109
 but we have our theories 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.600
 first the details revealed about the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.220
 history so far are the following 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.280
 the story will be held away from 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 Jair in such a kingdom is important fashion 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.770
 something has happened to the princess of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.890
 king the king sends for a hero 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.960
 many people claim to be the hero 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.540
 there are fights in Colosseum 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.490
 let's analyze each line and see what 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.729
 reasons there are to be located in each 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.729
 a 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.890
 we believe that it will not be located on the line 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.680
 unified due to the existence of 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.930
 tragic ki and the Julianians do not know to 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.200
 the kokinis until the civil war after 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.450
 end the era of force this kingdom 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.700
 in which triforce turns occurs is a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.130
 advanced kingdom where the important thing is the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.440
 fashion so they do not suffer or have not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.790
 suffered many years a great problem 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.830
 wingspan 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.620
 it is difficult to locate in the era of 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.230
 prosperity because there just jairo 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.760
 constituted as a kingdom and it is impossible for 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.670
 other kingdoms have advanced faster 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.460
 that jairo being this the kingdom of 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.280
 Golden goddesses in the era of chaos is without 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.740
 think then there the world is so messy 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.690
 and unstable there are no reasons why there 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.690
 kingdoms in such a primitive land 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.770
 it is likely to be located as a prequel 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.990
 to the wind waker and sequel to ocarina of 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.990
 time back link back to its time and 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.120
 abandon the future of jaio this can 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.280
 be possible because the king is 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.620
 looking for a hero and many claim to be 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.180
 it is possible that in this other kingdom it 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.820
 is looking for a hero to save the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.190
 world and not just the princess just like 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.530
 tells the prologue of the wind waker the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.870
 king wish to investigate after seeing that a hero 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.030
 true never appeared and the shadows 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.200
 they were approaching the kingdom cairo is not the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.810
 only affected by the flood 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.690
 probably in fact everyone is 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.790
 would be affected because tooling is 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.020
 the protagonist is likely to be 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.520
 locate in the line of slight of the 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.520
 winds in the era without a hero 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.490
 can be located here because of the alphabet 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.290
 gilian used that is the same of the 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.930
 last years of the age of light and 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.430
 darkness can also go to the beginning 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.560
 prior to the era of light and darkness 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.750
 Well, the fact that the king is 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.150
 looking for a hero can be due to the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.950
 fall of the hero of time all want 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.980
 be heroes to face the misfortunes 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.080
 but only one turns out to do this is 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.940
 similar to the story back to gandÃ­n that 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.400
 he won the king's confidence after finishing 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.280
 with a series of misfortunes also 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.560
 we could see it in the golden age it was 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.750
 peace and great prizes because of the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.989
 tranquility of the world without enemies 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.660
 can be passionate and have fun with 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.820
 more sumptuary things like the love of 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.980
 the fact that the alphabet is the same 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.320
 of the in which word can assume that 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.090
 will locate behind it and therefore in the era 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.250
 golden 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.230
 if we consider the fact that the reason 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.330
 why there is no true hero / 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.670
 by turns may be because you no longer 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.349
 they possess the blood of the hero then 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.750
 can be located in the era of describes 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.090
 years in which the blood dissolves 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.940
 gilian 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.949
 Iron dissolves becomes small and by 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.050
 so many other kingdoms take more power and 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.810
 importance kingdoms with other cultures 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.040
 very different from those of jair like fashion 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.040
 and the fights in Colosseum 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.879
 here could be located after the era of 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.000
 shadows then en force raaf en war z ' 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:48.340
 they finish completely combat and canon is 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.169
 sealing of the fourfold sword the world 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.090
 enters an era of peace and can 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.000
 start focusing on other passions 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.580
 like fashion and fights in coliseum not 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.889
 However, it must be considered that it is 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.659
 possible that between force turns in that no 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.759
 there is a true hero demonstrates that already 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.129
 there is no blood of the hero and that 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.659
 so there are no descendants this would 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.030
 that this delivery will not be located in the 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.340
 line of the descendants of the hero 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.230
 in fact it is probably a sequel to 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.750
 any of the lines can happen 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.420
 trash adventure flink transport short 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.610
 adventures other spiric trans in 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.890
 conclusion because of how little is known 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.050
 history since the game is not 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.310
 takes place in khairul is possible 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.650
 locate it in any of the three 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.750
 lines but with more reasons for 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.320
 lines of failure and the line of the hero 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.320
 of the winds
