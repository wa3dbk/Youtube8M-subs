00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello friends this week let's make a 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.100
 home experiment that is a stopwatch 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.540
 of homemade water first let's see your 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.540
 timing power 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.400
 good to do it we will need the 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.160
 following materials a couple of bottles 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.869
 plastic with its plugs a stick of 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.670
 chupa chups everyone knows him well 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.860
 to save it when it eats a 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.529
 permanent marker and a pistol 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.000
 hot glue to attach the going 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.640
 bottles for the plugs we put 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.150
 hot silicone and join we leave 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.340
 cool and well well centered good 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.070
 we review is well centered and well 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.900
 united perfect we remove the plugs and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.600
 let's make a couple of holes with the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.400
 scissors would be worth to put then the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.559
 stick out there but I advise a 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.750
 drill bit 4 because it is just the diameter 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.409
 of the stick and it will be much better than 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.900
 done good the result the finish of 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.390
 the holes is perfect well let's 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.610
 cut the stick with the scissors by the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.989
 half more or less not to the millimeter but 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.390
 roughly half and 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.940
 we will introduce each stick for a 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.280
 hole has to come out plus a stick 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.680
 on one side and the other more on the other 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.439
 good as you see in the image 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.660
 next step seal the sticks because 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.830
 clear out there pass the water and if it's not 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.360
 sealed will escape 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.150
 and good at the end we will go all 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.780
 perfect presented so we can 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.850
 take out and start to fill with water a 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.470
 of the bottles I'm going to put 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 food coloring that they sell it in 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.000
 supermarkets or food stores 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.680
 because I think that's how it looks more colorful 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.360
 it is necessary because the final result 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.480
 let's say it's going to be the same use whether or not 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.190
 tinted but good is more colorful 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.340
 well we have it ready so 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.380
 let's go to test 01 to see how 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.260
 our water timer works 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.780
 home we turn we give to the chronometer of 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.280
 smartphone and we see how long it takes 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.140
 in emptying the bottle from above good 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.320
 I take about one minute 50 seconds 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.530
 If so, it would be good for you to leave it and if 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.149
 you want to reduce the flow, of course 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.910
 these little tubes come phenomenal are 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.920
 insulators of electrician cables 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.390
 and they fit perfectly on the sticks of 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.660
 chupa chups this what it does is 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.160
 choke the flow of water and good 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.180
 because it reduces the flow in this way 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.939
 because the chronometer is no longer 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.950
 to make our measurements or our 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.469
 good use you see has been minutes and 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.689
 has practically filled very little the 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.719
 Bottom bottle the minutes go by 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:40.170
 every minute you have to make a line 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.490
 this will be let's say a species like 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.790
 of 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.640
 of metric a time metric for 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 to then time on each line 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.810
 we know that a minute of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.630
 time then that consists is a 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.450
 stopwatch then every line a minute and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.400
 by chance, more or less 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.560
 eight minutes it has taken to empty the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.650
 little bottle so we know that our 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.550
 Home water timer takes 8 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.800
 minutes in doing let's say everything all its your 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.930
 dump of water the other side then 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.570
 we do the same and we would have already 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.730
 nothing the home water timer in 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.520
 perfect working condition and 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.080
 ready to give it the use we have 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.420
 convenient, I hope you have 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.760
 liked a greeting until the week that 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.439
 comes chao chao 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.180
 good if you liked the video 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:36.590
 subscribe give it to like it shares and if not 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.590
 well, you know 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.170
 Hahaha
