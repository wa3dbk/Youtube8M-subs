00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
maybe but these are not as tricky as the

exercise<00:00:24.850> this<00:00:25.000> is<00:00:25.060> with<00:00:25.420> trickier<00:00:25.869> chords

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
exercise this is with trickier chords

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.209 
exercise this is with trickier chords
like<00:00:26.529> these<00:00:27.369> ones<00:00:27.699> using<00:00:28.029> oh<00:00:31.020> yeah<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.800> reason

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
like these ones using oh yeah the reason

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.130 
like these ones using oh yeah the reason
for<00:00:33.489> why<00:00:33.609> I<00:00:33.640> made<00:00:33.850> this<00:00:33.969> exercises<00:00:34.359> is<00:00:34.690> so<00:00:34.989> that

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
for why I made this exercises is so that

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.709 
for why I made this exercises is so that
you<00:00:35.289> can<00:00:35.469> practice<00:00:35.859> your<00:00:36.600> chord

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
you can practice your chord

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.790 
you can practice your chord
switching<00:00:38.260> basically<00:00:39.190> getting<00:00:39.699> your<00:00:39.940> fingers

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
switching basically getting your fingers

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.239 
switching basically getting your fingers
more<00:00:41.800> in<00:00:42.100> tune<00:00:42.940> with<00:00:43.329> your<00:00:43.899> mind<00:00:44.289> exercise

number<00:00:45.460> one<00:00:45.639> is<00:00:46.420> called<00:00:46.479> tricky<00:00:47.409> open<00:00:47.799> chord

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.069 
number one is called tricky open chord

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:51.029 
number one is called tricky open chord
changes<00:00:48.579> and<00:00:48.659> very<00:00:49.659> rightfully<00:00:50.079> named<00:00:50.769> so

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
changes and very rightfully named so

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.020 
changes and very rightfully named so
because<00:00:51.069> it<00:00:51.579> is<00:00:51.699> very<00:00:51.940> tricky<00:00:53.609> it<00:00:54.609> starts<00:00:54.909> out

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
because it is very tricky it starts out

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.809 
because it is very tricky it starts out
with<00:00:55.089> a<00:00:55.299> b7<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:59.069> the<00:01:00.069> reason<00:01:00.309> for<00:01:00.339> why<00:01:00.489> this<00:01:00.549> is

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
with a b7 and the reason for why this is

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:08.360 
with a b7 and the reason for why this is
difficult<00:01:01.299> is<00:01:01.510> because<00:01:01.539> your<00:01:02.109> fingers

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:35.250 

difference<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:10.630> they<00:01:10.750> take<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> new<00:01:11.140> chord

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:50.490 

for<00:01:35.740> me<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:35.920> can<00:01:36.220> find<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:47.310> minor<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.610> g7<00:01:49.500> that's

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
for me I can find a minor to g7 that's

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.970 
for me I can find a minor to g7 that's
quite<00:01:50.740> tricky<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.300> so<00:01:52.300> practice<00:01:52.960> each<00:01:53.230> chord

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
quite tricky and so practice each chord

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.150 
quite tricky and so practice each chord
change<00:01:55.020> individually<00:01:56.020> first<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.590> then<00:01:56.950> try

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
change individually first and then try

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.400 
change individually first and then try
to<00:01:57.190> start<00:01:57.880> out<00:01:58.030> with<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.390> first<00:01:58.660> top<00:01:59.080> line

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
to start out with the first top line

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:10.919 
to start out with the first top line
only<00:02:00.130> playing<00:02:08.880> okay<00:02:09.880> then<00:02:10.510> you<00:02:10.600> take<00:02:10.810> the

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
only playing okay then you take the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:21.450 
only playing okay then you take the
bottom<00:02:11.260> line<00:02:18.840> okay<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.020> then<00:02:20.890> finally<00:02:21.370> you

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
bottom line okay and then finally you

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
bottom line okay and then finally you
tie<00:02:21.640> them<00:02:21.790> all<00:02:21.940> together

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.070 

and<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.800> next<00:02:36.099> exercise<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:37.000> cannon<00:02:37.720> by

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
and the next exercise is cannon by

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.500 
and the next exercise is cannon by
packable<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.730> think<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.090> nice<00:02:40.239> one

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
packable and I think it's a nice one

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.059 
packable and I think it's a nice one
because<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:41.170> think<00:02:41.230> all<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.860> are<00:02:41.890> familiar

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
because I think all of you are familiar

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.050 
because I think all of you are familiar
with<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.489> melody<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:47.230> it's<00:02:47.800> in<00:02:48.129> C<00:02:48.459> in<00:02:48.849> this

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
with the melody and it's in C in this

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.570 
with the melody and it's in C in this
case<00:02:49.120> usually<00:02:49.569> hear<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:50.170> G<00:02:50.440> or<00:02:50.800> D<00:02:51.220> or

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
case usually hear it in G or D or

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:08.039 
case usually hear it in G or D or
whatever<00:02:52.410> anyway<00:02:53.410> here<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:57.989> minor<00:03:06.060> G<00:03:07.060> and

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
whatever anyway here is a minor G and

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.500 
whatever anyway here is a minor G and
you<00:03:08.080> may<00:03:08.739> be<00:03:08.799> thinking<00:03:09.340> what<00:03:09.910> kind<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.360> an

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
you may be thinking what kind of an

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.210 
you may be thinking what kind of an
exercise<00:03:11.049> is<00:03:11.260> this<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.680> mean<00:03:11.830> this<00:03:11.980> pretty

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
exercise is this I mean this pretty

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.770 
exercise is this I mean this pretty
simple<00:03:12.610> course<00:03:12.849> right<00:03:13.060> maybe<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.390> F<00:03:13.569> is

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
simple course right maybe the F is

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.759 
simple course right maybe the F is
tricky<00:03:14.079> for<00:03:14.110> you

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
tricky for you

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.750 
tricky for you
so<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.970> may<00:03:16.150> need<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.560> practice<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:18.250> switch

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
so you may need to practice that switch

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.740 
so you may need to practice that switch
here<00:03:20.160> with<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.250> efficacy<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.120> F<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
here with the efficacy and the F and the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.620 
here with the efficacy and the F and the
G<00:03:22.890> but<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.069> point<00:03:24.370> about<00:03:24.489> this<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:24.849> that<00:03:25.120> your

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
G but the point about this is that your

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.410 
G but the point about this is that your
your<00:03:25.989> practices<00:03:26.560> with<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.769> metronome<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.610> you

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
your practices with a metronome and you

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.380 
your practices with a metronome and you
speed<00:03:28.900> up<00:03:29.079> incrementally<00:03:30.010> I'm<00:03:30.579> going<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.150> show

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
speed up incrementally I'm going to show

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.559 
speed up incrementally I'm going to show
you<00:03:31.450> what<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.079> mean<00:03:32.319> I<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.849> metronome<00:03:34.239> set

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
you what I mean I have the metronome set

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:51.750 
you what I mean I have the metronome set
to<00:03:34.870> 130<00:03:35.590> beats<00:03:35.769> per<00:03:36.010> minute<00:03:36.250> let's<00:03:36.579> go

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
too now I'm going to 170 beats per

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.440 
too now I'm going to 170 beats per
minute<00:04:16.160> it's<00:04:16.700> gonna<00:04:16.820> be<00:04:16.970> fairly<00:04:17.180> more

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
minute it's gonna be fairly more

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:34.190 
minute it's gonna be fairly more
difficult<00:04:18.639> so<00:04:19.639> let's<00:04:19.880> go

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.230 

-<00:04:34.530> one<00:04:34.950> two

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.670 

okay<00:04:42.240> now<00:04:42.509> we're<00:04:42.630> gonna<00:04:42.690> slow<00:04:43.050> down<00:04:43.199> a<00:04:43.440> little

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
okay now we're gonna slow down a little

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.920 
okay now we're gonna slow down a little
bit<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:44.130> we're<00:04:44.729> gonna<00:04:44.789> be<00:04:45.030> lazy<00:04:45.419> it's<00:04:45.840> the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
bit and we're gonna be lazy it's the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.510 
bit and we're gonna be lazy it's the
last<00:04:46.169> thing<00:04:46.380> we're<00:04:46.500> gonna<00:04:46.620> do<00:04:46.860> we're<00:04:47.460> gonna

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
last thing we're gonna do we're gonna

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.920 
last thing we're gonna do we're gonna
learn<00:04:47.759> some<00:04:47.819> shortcuts<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.770> point<00:04:50.930> the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
learn some shortcuts and the point the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.480 
learn some shortcuts and the point the
reason<00:04:52.110> for<00:04:52.199> why<00:04:52.289> I'm<00:04:52.410> bringing<00:04:52.590> up<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.009> now

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
reason for why I'm bringing up this now

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.400 
reason for why I'm bringing up this now
is<00:04:54.000> because<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.419> think<00:04:54.479> it's<00:04:54.720> important<00:04:55.229> to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
is because I think it's important to

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.760 
is because I think it's important to
learn<00:04:55.729> those<00:04:56.729> other<00:04:57.000> exercises<00:04:57.660> first<00:04:57.930> or<00:04:58.319> or

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
learn those other exercises first or or

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.100 
learn those other exercises first or or
you<00:04:59.039> can<00:04:59.190> make<00:04:59.340> your<00:04:59.460> own<00:04:59.699> exercises<00:05:00.270> but<00:05:00.599> make

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
you can make your own exercises but make

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.650 
you can make your own exercises but make
them<00:05:01.319> tricky<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.190> practice<00:05:02.759> tricky<00:05:03.330> stuff

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
them tricky and practice tricky stuff

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.960 
them tricky and practice tricky stuff
then<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:04.740> easy<00:05:05.039> things<00:05:05.370> will<00:05:05.580> be<00:05:05.759> even

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
then this easy things will be even

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.029 
then this easy things will be even
easier<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:07.110> can<00:05:07.139> play<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.650> front<00:05:07.770> of<00:05:07.919> your

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
easier and you can play in front of your

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.760 
easier and you can play in front of your
friends<00:05:08.520> or<00:05:08.639> maybe<00:05:08.669> on<00:05:09.000> stage<00:05:09.389> without<00:05:10.169> any

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
friends or maybe on stage without any

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.730 
friends or maybe on stage without any
problem<00:05:11.310> at<00:05:11.400> all<00:05:11.430> okay<00:05:12.240> so<00:05:12.509> the<00:05:13.349> point<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.680> that

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
problem at all okay so the point is that

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.760 
problem at all okay so the point is that
between<00:05:14.340> certain<00:05:14.610> chords<00:05:15.180> you're<00:05:15.900> using<00:05:16.380> the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
between certain chords you're using the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.620 
between certain chords you're using the
same<00:05:17.009> fingers<00:05:17.430> on<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.669> same<00:05:17.849> frets<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:18.449> you

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
same fingers on the same frets so you

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.900 
same fingers on the same frets so you
can<00:05:18.870> keep<00:05:19.110> your<00:05:19.320> fingers<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:19.860> those<00:05:19.979> frets<00:05:20.340> if

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
can keep your fingers and those frets if

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.360 
can keep your fingers and those frets if
it's<00:05:21.180> comfortable<00:05:21.419> in<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.050> next<00:05:22.259> chord<00:05:22.530> so<00:05:23.190> we

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
it's comfortable in the next chord so we

it's comfortable in the next chord so we
start<00:05:23.610> out<00:05:23.729> with<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.090> D<00:05:24.300> chord<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:28.590> then<00:05:29.070> -<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.280> G

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
start out with a D chord and then - a G

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.760 
start out with a D chord and then - a G
chord<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:30.030> between<00:05:30.360> those<00:05:30.659> two<00:05:30.900> chords<00:05:31.199> we
