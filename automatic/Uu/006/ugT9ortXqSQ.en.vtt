center there okay we're going to start

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.630 
center there okay we're going to start
by<00:00:45.360> applying<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.170> food<00:00:46.530> grade<00:00:46.860> sealant<00:00:49.640> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
by applying the food grade sealant to

by applying the food grade sealant to
the<00:00:50.930> metal<00:00:51.930> element<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:53.129> generous<00:00:53.520> coating

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the metal element the generous coating

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.420 
the metal element the generous coating
around<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.530> inside<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.059> again

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
around the inside there and again

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.220

another coating around the inside of the
plastic<00:01:01.710> side<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.690> know<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:05.930> I'm<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
plastic side I know that I'm going to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.010 
plastic side I know that I'm going to
just<00:01:07.680> pass<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.159> through<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.950> rubber<00:01:10.950> washer

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
just pass it through the rubber washer

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:25.910 
just pass it through the rubber washer
not<00:01:20.390> three<00:01:21.390> screws<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:23.729> tighten<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.920> nicely

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
not three screws to tighten it nicely

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.539 
not three screws to tighten it nicely
it's<00:01:26.610> important<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> make<00:01:27.180> sure<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
it's important to make sure there is a

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.890 
it's important to make sure there is a
good<00:01:29.549> seal<00:01:31.310> around<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.640> bucket<00:01:32.850> officer<00:01:33.810> you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
good seal around the bucket officer you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
good seal around the bucket officer you
don't<00:01:34.049> want<00:01:34.350> any<00:01:34.619> boiling<00:01:35.250> water<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.700> leak<00:01:35.850> out

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
don't want any boiling water to leak out

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.400 
don't want any boiling water to leak out
here

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:49.270 

okay<00:01:47.260> we'll<00:01:48.260> do<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.470> same<00:01:48.650> on<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.920> other<00:01:48.950> half

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
okay we'll do the same on the other half

00:01:49.280 --> 00:02:04.590 
okay we'll do the same on the other half
I<00:01:50.770> see<00:01:51.770> your<00:01:51.950> plan<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:53.240> outer<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:01.490> inner

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:28.160 

sides<00:02:12.160> carefully<00:02:13.160> for<00:02:13.850> sure

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.860 

the<00:02:29.170> poutine<00:02:29.560> will<00:02:29.920> take<00:02:30.910> two<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.570> twelve

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
the poutine will take two to twelve

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.420 
the poutine will take two to twelve
hours<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.200> dry<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:32.740> it's<00:02:32.860> important<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.310> don't

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
hours to dry so it's important you don't

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.030 
hours to dry so it's important you don't
go<00:02:33.640> off<00:02:33.730> going<00:02:34.000> straight<00:02:34.360> away<00:02:34.740> may<00:02:35.740> be<00:02:35.800> best

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
go off going straight away may be best

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.620 
go off going straight away may be best
to<00:02:36.160> leave<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.700> following<00:02:36.970> day<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:37.480> to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
to leave it to the following day just to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.800 
to leave it to the following day just to
ensure<00:02:38.310> everything<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.460> fine<00:02:40.080> ok<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.750> can

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
ensure everything is fine ok so you can

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.460 
ensure everything is fine ok so you can
see<00:02:43.930> you've<00:02:44.530> got<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.890> two<00:02:45.160> elements<00:02:46.470> inside

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
see you've got the two elements inside

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.570 
see you've got the two elements inside
now<00:02:47.740> you'll<00:02:48.070> notice<00:02:48.310> they're<00:02:48.460> of<00:02:48.550> different

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
now you'll notice they're of different

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.270 
now you'll notice they're of different
heights<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.260> basically<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.890> achieve<00:02:51.220> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
heights that is basically to achieve a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.650 
heights that is basically to achieve a
better<00:02:54.280> boil<00:02:55.020> circulation<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:58.000> up<00:02:58.210> next

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
better boil circulation going up next

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.760 
better boil circulation going up next
step<00:02:58.840> we<00:02:59.140> will<00:02:59.290> use<00:02:59.350> the<00:03:00.100> hop<00:03:00.520> strainer

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
step we will use the hop strainer

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.110 
step we will use the hop strainer
fittings<00:03:02.770> already<00:03:03.040> there<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.810> can<00:03:05.050> simply

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
fittings already there you can simply

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.910 
fittings already there you can simply
attach<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:08.670> popper<00:03:10.890> inside<00:03:11.890> there<00:03:13.920> now

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
attach the popper inside there now

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.720 
attach the popper inside there now
removed<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:17.650> ball<00:03:17.860> valve<00:03:18.010> tap<00:03:18.280> on<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.580> other

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
removed the ball valve tap on the other

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.620 
removed the ball valve tap on the other
side<00:03:19.590> very<00:03:20.590> simple<00:03:20.980> again<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.550> want<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.480> go

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
side very simple again I want you to go

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:30.380 
side very simple again I want you to go
just<00:03:23.350> slide<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.130> in<00:03:24.220> there<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:26.200> simply<00:03:27.100> attach

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:54.060 

tightness<00:03:46.200> perdu<00:03:47.200> any<00:03:47.350> further<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:53.830> what<00:03:53.980> it

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
tightness perdu any further so what it

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.720 
tightness perdu any further so what it
should<00:03:54.190> look<00:03:54.220> like<00:03:54.340> on<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.270> inside<00:03:56.730> okay

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
should look like on the inside okay
