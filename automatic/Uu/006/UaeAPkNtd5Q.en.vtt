the<00:00:06.480> blindfolded<00:00:07.020> drawing<00:00:07.220> yes<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:08.400> basically

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the blindfolded drawing yes so basically

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.250 
the blindfolded drawing yes so basically
we're<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.150> be<00:00:09.240> randomly<00:00:09.660> generating<00:00:10.200> a

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
we're going to be randomly generating a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.169 
we're going to be randomly generating a
word<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.639> draw<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.849> word

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
word and we have to draw that word

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.810 
word and we have to draw that word
blindfolded<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.860> other<00:00:14.009> person<00:00:14.130> has<00:00:14.670> to

blindfolded and the other person has to

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.790 
blindfolded and the other person has to
guess<00:00:14.849> what<00:00:15.389> we're<00:00:15.509> drawing<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.230> three

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
guess what we're drawing we have three

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.120 
guess what we're drawing we have three
rounds<00:00:17.359> 30<00:00:18.359> seconds<00:00:18.779> each<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> whoever

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
rounds 30 seconds each and whoever

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.920 
rounds 30 seconds each and whoever
guesses<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.520> most<00:00:20.699> correctly<00:00:21.300> from<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
guesses the most correctly from the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.980 
guesses the most correctly from the
other<00:00:22.050> person's<00:00:22.320> drawings<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.039> winner<00:00:23.420> so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
other person's drawings is the winner so

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.560 
other person's drawings is the winner so
