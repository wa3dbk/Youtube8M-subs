00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
about paws squats and the way we do I'm

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.060 
about paws squats and the way we do I'm
here<00:00:29.000> at<00:00:29.120> elite<00:00:29.270> Performance<00:00:29.720> Center<00:00:30.070> there's

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
here at elite Performance Center there's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.260 
here at elite Performance Center there's
definitely<00:00:31.430> nothing<00:00:31.550> wrong<00:00:31.789> with<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.149> way

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
definitely nothing wrong with the way

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.779 
definitely nothing wrong with the way
the<00:00:32.840> other<00:00:32.989> people<00:00:33.289> do<00:00:33.379> them<00:00:33.500> but<00:00:34.340> we<00:00:34.579> do<00:00:34.670> them

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
the other people do them but we do them

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.610 
the other people do them but we do them
with<00:00:34.879> a<00:00:34.910> specific<00:00:35.449> goal<00:00:35.600> here<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:36.260> it's<00:00:36.469> not

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
with a specific goal here and it's not

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.740 
with a specific goal here and it's not
just<00:00:36.890> to<00:00:36.980> break<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.600> eccentric<00:00:38.600> and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
just to break the eccentric and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.170 
just to break the eccentric and
concentric<00:00:38.840> phases<00:00:39.590> which<00:00:39.850> there's<00:00:40.850> a<00:00:40.910> lot<00:00:41.060> of

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
concentric phases which there's a lot of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.860 
concentric phases which there's a lot of
value<00:00:41.420> in<00:00:41.450> that

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
value in that

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.680 
value in that
so<00:00:42.020> when<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.230> when<00:00:42.560> you're<00:00:42.680> doing<00:00:42.770> that

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
so when you when you're doing that

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.260 
so when you when you're doing that
breaking<00:00:44.690> that<00:00:44.840> eccentric<00:00:45.170> portion<00:00:45.470> off<00:00:46.270> has

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
breaking that eccentric portion off has

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.580 
breaking that eccentric portion off has
a<00:00:47.300> lot<00:00:47.540> of<00:00:47.570> carryover<00:00:47.989> I<00:00:48.110> believe<00:00:48.380> to<00:00:48.500> the

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
a lot of carryover I believe to the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.299 
a lot of carryover I believe to the
deadlift<00:00:49.149> but<00:00:50.149> we<00:00:50.540> don't<00:00:50.720> for<00:00:50.930> long<00:00:51.079> pauses<00:00:51.410> so

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
deadlift but we don't for long pauses so

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.160 
deadlift but we don't for long pauses so
five<00:00:52.670> seconds<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:53.270> that's<00:00:53.420> a<00:00:53.540> that's<00:00:53.870> a<00:00:53.960> full

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
five seconds and that's a that's a full

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.139 
five seconds and that's a that's a full
five<00:00:54.470> count<00:00:54.860> usually<00:00:55.700> we<00:00:55.790> have<00:00:55.850> somebody

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
five count usually we have somebody

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.060 
five count usually we have somebody
counting<00:00:56.570> while<00:00:56.660> we're<00:00:56.809> doing<00:00:56.930> that<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.920> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
counting while we're doing that and the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.479 
counting while we're doing that and the
reason<00:00:58.340> we<00:00:58.430> do<00:00:58.579> it<00:00:58.610> is<00:00:58.910> we're<00:00:59.360> focused<00:00:59.870> on

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
reason we do it is we're focused on

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.639 
reason we do it is we're focused on
integrating<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:01.640> it's<00:01:01.760> really<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:02.000> core

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
integrating so it's really a core

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.139 
integrating so it's really a core
movement<00:01:03.649> static<00:01:04.159> core<00:01:04.339> movement<00:01:04.699> for<00:01:04.850> us<00:01:04.969> in

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
movement static core movement for us in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.959 
movement static core movement for us in
forcing<00:01:06.140> us<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.590> maintain<00:01:07.009> that<00:01:07.310> structure<00:01:07.939> so

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
forcing us to maintain that structure so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.550 
forcing us to maintain that structure so
we're<00:01:08.749> doing<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.020> things<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.259> you<00:01:09.380> talked

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
we're doing the things that you talked

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.929 
we're doing the things that you talked
about<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.920> if<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:10.280> watch<00:01:10.399> my<00:01:10.609> breathing

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
about and if you watch my breathing

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.690 
about and if you watch my breathing
embracing<00:01:11.329> videos<00:01:11.600> where<00:01:12.560> we're<00:01:12.799> pushing<00:01:13.310> out

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
embracing videos where we're pushing out

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.929 
embracing videos where we're pushing out
and<00:01:13.939> down<00:01:14.409> inflating<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.499> obliques<00:01:15.939> trying

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
and down inflating the obliques trying

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.109 
and down inflating the obliques trying
to<00:01:17.030> keep<00:01:17.209> the<00:01:17.959> sternal<00:01:18.319> crunch<00:01:18.560> locked<00:01:18.829> in

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
to keep the sternal crunch locked in

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.719 
to keep the sternal crunch locked in
making<00:01:20.119> sure<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.420> glute<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.899> VMO<00:01:21.229> balance

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
making sure the glute the VMO balance

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.429 
making sure the glute the VMO balance
have<00:01:22.729> that<00:01:22.909> leg<00:01:23.149> where<00:01:23.630> they<00:01:23.779> need<00:01:23.929> to<00:01:23.959> stay<00:01:24.229> at

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
have that leg where they need to stay at

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.489 
have that leg where they need to stay at
and<00:01:25.659> sticking<00:01:26.659> in<00:01:26.749> the<00:01:26.810> bottom<00:01:27.079> so<00:01:27.289> there's

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
and sticking in the bottom so there's

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:32.260 
and sticking in the bottom so there's
never<00:01:27.679> a<00:01:27.799> point<00:01:28.090> where<00:01:29.090> we're<00:01:29.329> resting<00:01:31.090> on<00:01:32.090> our

for<00:01:41.359> five<00:01:41.389> seconds<00:01:42.789> five<00:01:43.789> seconds<00:01:44.149> might<00:01:44.329> be<00:01:44.479> a

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
for five seconds five seconds might be a

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.149 
for five seconds five seconds might be a
little<00:01:44.719> bit<00:01:44.899> of<00:01:44.959> an<00:01:45.049> overkill<00:01:45.349> so<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:46.009> could

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
little bit of an overkill so you could

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.889 
little bit of an overkill so you could
start<00:01:46.369> at<00:01:46.490> three<00:01:46.759> generally<00:01:47.569> we're<00:01:47.689> doing

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
start at three generally we're doing

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.330 
start at three generally we're doing
well<00:01:48.380> always<00:01:48.950> do<00:01:49.689> two<00:01:50.689> sets<00:01:50.959> of<00:01:51.049> five<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:51.590> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
well always do two sets of five and the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.459 
well always do two sets of five and the
weight<00:01:52.579> is<00:01:52.609> usually<00:01:53.119> around<00:01:53.359> 40<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.200> 50

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
weight is usually around 40 to 50

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.239 
weight is usually around 40 to 50
percent<00:01:54.859> of<00:01:55.009> your<00:01:55.609> maximal<00:01:56.090> effort<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.249> it

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
percent of your maximal effort and it

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:59.760 
percent of your maximal effort and it
can<00:01:58.490> be<00:01:58.579> pretty<00:01:58.729> hard<00:01:58.819> usually<00:01:59.419> you're

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
can be pretty hard usually you're

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.639 
can be pretty hard usually you're
possibly<00:02:00.770> shaking<00:02:01.719> by<00:02:02.719> the<00:02:02.779> fifth<00:02:03.200> rep<00:02:03.439> or

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
possibly shaking by the fifth rep or

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.830 
possibly shaking by the fifth rep or
definitely<00:02:04.039> on<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.310> second<00:02:04.969> set<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:05.329> trying

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
definitely on the second set and trying

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.779 
definitely on the second set and trying
to<00:02:05.929> hold<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.499> position<00:02:06.679> you<00:02:07.399> still<00:02:07.609> want<00:02:07.759> to

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
to hold that position you still want to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.760 
to hold that position you still want to
be<00:02:07.939> explosive<00:02:08.569> as<00:02:08.720> possible<00:02:08.780> as<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.259> initiate

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
be explosive as possible as you initiate

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.740 
be explosive as possible as you initiate
the<00:02:09.920> squat<00:02:10.190> movement<00:02:10.369> from<00:02:10.670> there<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.660> you

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
the squat movement from there so you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.150 
the squat movement from there so you
want<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.989> keep<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.319> core<00:02:12.560> tight<00:02:12.590> keep<00:02:13.010> those

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
want to keep that core tight keep those

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.850 
want to keep that core tight keep those
glutes<00:02:13.400> tight<00:02:13.540> not<00:02:14.540> letting<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.530> lumbar

carry over to the deadlift but really

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.820 
carry over to the deadlift but really
we're<00:02:25.370> trying<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.790> force<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.840> focus<00:02:27.290> on<00:02:27.500> how

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
we're trying to force the focus on how

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.160 
we're trying to force the focus on how
we<00:02:27.890> integrate<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:29.060> into<00:02:29.570> everything<00:02:29.990> else

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
we integrate this into everything else

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.900 
we integrate this into everything else
and<00:02:30.400> really<00:02:31.400> see<00:02:32.210> where<00:02:32.330> we're<00:02:32.450> at

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
and really see where we're at

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.480 
and really see where we're at
now<00:02:34.910> let's<00:02:35.120> watch<00:02:35.240> this<00:02:35.510> set<00:02:35.720> again<00:02:36.490> you'll

little bit that's going to really help

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.100 
little bit that's going to really help
kind<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.340> focus<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.910> put<00:02:59.030> some<00:02:59.210> more<00:02:59.390> stress

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
kind of focus and put some more stress

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.880 
kind of focus and put some more stress
on<00:03:00.820> cueing<00:03:01.820> those<00:03:01.970> things<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.360> fire<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.690> keep

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
on cueing those things to fire to keep

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.330 
on cueing those things to fire to keep
keep<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.010> from<00:03:04.160> rolling<00:03:04.550> over<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.160> also

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
keep you from rolling over this is also

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.520 
keep you from rolling over this is also
not<00:03:07.670> done<00:03:07.940> as<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> core<00:03:08.450> movement<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.170> typically

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
not done as a core movement so typically

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.260 
not done as a core movement so typically
we<00:03:09.650> do<00:03:09.770> this<00:03:09.800> right<00:03:10.190> after<00:03:10.430> we<00:03:10.700> squat<00:03:11.000> and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
we do this right after we squat and

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.410 
we do this right after we squat and
again<00:03:11.990> two<00:03:12.260> sets<00:03:12.530> five<00:03:12.920> reps<00:03:13.420> five-second

the psoas muscle this means that this is
something<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.460> need<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.670> focus<00:03:29.180> on<00:03:29.390> but

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
something that you need to focus on but

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.090 
something that you need to focus on but

breathing<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.760> bracing<00:03:35.180> video<00:03:35.420> or<00:03:36.170> look<00:03:36.410> at

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
breathing and bracing video or look at

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.070 
breathing and bracing video or look at
the<00:03:36.920> brief<00:03:37.100> cues<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.580> went<00:03:37.790> over<00:03:38.000> when<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:38.930> was

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
the brief cues I went over when I was

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.780 
the brief cues I went over when I was
speaking<00:03:39.440> just<00:03:39.710> a<00:03:40.280> few<00:03:40.430> minutes<00:03:40.670> ago<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:42.790> also

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
speaking just a few minutes ago and also

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.090 
speaking just a few minutes ago and also
look<00:03:44.030> at<00:03:44.180> dropping<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.720> weight<00:03:44.930> or<00:03:45.530> dropping

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
look at dropping the weight or dropping

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.740 
look at dropping the weight or dropping
from<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.400> five<00:03:46.550> second<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.180> three<00:03:47.390> second

from the five second to the three second

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.990 
from the five second to the three second
time<00:03:47.930> frame<00:03:48.200> but<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:49.070> would<00:03:49.400> work<00:03:49.580> these<00:03:49.760> if

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
time frame but I would work these if

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.120 
time frame but I would work these if
that<00:03:50.270> does<00:03:50.510> cause<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.080> some<00:03:51.290> pain<00:03:51.560> just<00:03:51.920> back

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
no need to do the rounding random count

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.440 
no need to do the rounding random count
that<00:04:00.470> we're<00:04:00.890> demonstrating<00:04:01.160> there<00:04:01.670> but<00:04:02.180> we<00:04:02.330> do
