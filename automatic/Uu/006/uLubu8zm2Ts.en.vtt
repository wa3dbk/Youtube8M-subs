 and the parents also contribute 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.800
 you can start very early with 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.110
 investing in young children 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.180

 municipality alderman de Jonge 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.839
 Also invest a lot of money in this then 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.699
 just a private initiative 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.409
 it lays in the same line 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.629
 the initiative for points college 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.789
 can of latifa el ouali 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.920

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.650
 with Dutch I remember me 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.140
 understood everything but it was very difficult 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.360
 liked to talk back and that in two 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.360
 singing is being tried 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.730
 direction it but because it because 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.560
 my vocabulary was already great 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.840
 call you 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.759
 passive vocabulary is a big one 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.280
 hear honey already stored in my head 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.530
 by contacting in the neighborhood with with 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.670
 and the local butcher the friends 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.899
 neighborhood awake 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.490
 you just have to convert it to 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.340
 an active one and that goes with young 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.830
 children quite quickly she is jealous of the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.030
 children who now have preschool 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.860
 I wish I had a trampoline this 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.570
 to a future I know myself 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.520
 saving me self-reliance was very 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.689
 great that makes me so far 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.799
 come 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.390
 makes it a little easier for me 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.130
 if my roads were a bit smoother 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 if I had committed a little more you had 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.090
 a washp it came earlier 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.220
 mother pretend it also 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.740
 preschool could have started earlier 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.539
 she brings her daughter mary there 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.549
 the college has been working for a few months now 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.770
 as a test and she notices the difference with 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.099
 her 5 year old son who did not go there 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.920
 Well for example you come spontaneously 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.019
 time is gonna sing songs and too 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.989
 very clear 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.970
 and what we son in kindergarten 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.920
 did that does are already 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.620
 so you start counting and they 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.209
 points things out and that can be both whole 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.720
 good very clear dutch yes it 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.630
 orange at this school also exists one 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.700
 group 0 that are extra lessons for 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.380
 toddlers to limit language deficiency 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.620
 but there is a difference 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.620
 groups 0 that are five days with one 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.650
 The three-year hbo leader with us 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.750
 9 half-days so that means more time 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.480
 we are the holidays open that are the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.579
 groups not zero and the extra offer what 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.470
 I just said with those extra themes and the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.109
 trips that is also a plus for us 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.389
 what just one has or does not have the purpose 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.139
 is three more toddler colleges to open in 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.730
 Rotterdam 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.769
 afterwards 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.000
 viewed the results and investigated whether 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.000
 extension is possible
