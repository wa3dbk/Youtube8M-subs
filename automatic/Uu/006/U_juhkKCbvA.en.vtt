00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.250
 any android device this da 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.220

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.870
 store to finish is http but what 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.000
 I bring you today is the application 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.080
 modified apec has modified to 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.050
 that we can install it in any 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.450
 Android device as we see we have 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.430
 the typical htc desk as we 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.170
 we could find in google now with 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.480
 the typical cards of different 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.640
 web pages but with one more style 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.470
 striking more colorful and with a 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.000
 configuration that will allow us to choose 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.830
 the kind of news we want to receive 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.720
 once we leave the section of 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.370
 configuration will be updated 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.350
 directly the desk and we 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.930
 will show the news of the new 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.280
 sections that we have been selecting 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.230
 tell you also that in order to have the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.809
 option to have the extra cards of 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.370
 the news on this desk 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.860
 we will need to install a second apk 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.930
 apart from the launcher that is called htc 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.340
 service pack and that will provide us 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.010
 this news section is so 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.780
 interesting let's talk now about the 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.550
 launcher configuration we can 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.070
 obviously change the background of 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.990
 screen from several options also 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.940
 we have the option to change theme 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.520
 this option requires us to have a 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.920
 htc account I tried to install it 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.930
 through several of several ways I have 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.729
 been studying online and there's no 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.740
 way to let me install the themes 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.080
 so simply because that option 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.710
 I have not used but otherwise the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.020
 true that everything has worked 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.670
 perfectly from this section 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.619
 we can add widgets in a way 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.090
 very simple simply by choosing the 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.920
 page where we want to add them 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.680
 pushing up the widget we 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.789
 will appear directly on the screen 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.630
 apart from this we will also have the 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.610
 option of 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.259
 and applications from here as you will see 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.869
 it is a very simple way 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.189
 quick and especially practice to add 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.060
 applications without needing to be 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.060
 entering the box 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.660
 to create folders like in almost all 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.490
 the launcher we just keep 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.830
 pressed on top of each application and the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.510
 we will carry over another application and 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.310
 to eliminate them as simple as 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.260
 hold and carry the part 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.720
 superior that will give us the option of whether it is 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.280
 an erase application and if it's from the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.110
 application box directly we 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.850
 will also give the option to uninstall 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.040
 the box of applications we can 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.930
 also more or less modify we can 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.670
 place the applications as we want 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.070
 Order a personalized way 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.450
 alphabetical or by recent we will tell 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.460
 also with a search engine for 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.620
 make it easy for us to find sometimes 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.170
 some applications and we will also have 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.270
 other options like hide administer 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.550
 and even change the format to be 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.280
 see instead of four rows three rows 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.470
 of applications and good up to here the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.990
 htc one and 1009 launcher for 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.550
 any android device you know 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.410
 that I will leave the download links in 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.420
 the video description of both the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.010
 launcher as for the kind of plugin 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.920
 what is needed so that they can be seen 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.330
 the news on the other desk as well 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.520
 that nothing if you liked it do not forget 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.590
 leave a like to subscribe to the channel if 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.480
