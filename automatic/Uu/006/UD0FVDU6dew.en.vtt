figure but other than that it's not that

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.940 
figure but other than that it's not that
huge<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.269> deal<00:02:39.319> while<00:02:40.319> I'm<00:02:40.469> up<00:02:40.650> here<00:02:40.680> I'll

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
huge of a deal while I'm up here I'll

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.770 
huge of a deal while I'm up here I'll
show<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.159> that<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.669> can<00:02:41.819> extend<00:02:42.269> out<00:02:42.480> here

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.780 
there's uh for his horns to come out
that's<00:02:46.409> why<00:02:46.530> they<00:02:46.680> stuck<00:02:46.889> together<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.340> then

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
that's why they stuck together and then

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.920 
that's why they stuck together and then
you<00:02:47.879> just<00:02:48.000> pull<00:02:48.150> them<00:02:48.269> out<00:02:48.329> until<00:02:48.540> they<00:02:48.659> stop

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
you just pull them out until they stop

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.550 
you just pull them out until they stop
and<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.409> get<00:02:49.590> his<00:02:49.769> extended<00:02:50.459> mode<00:02:51.389> here<00:02:51.689> which

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
and you get his extended mode here which

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.720 
and you get his extended mode here which
it<00:02:52.680> looks<00:02:52.859> pretty<00:02:52.980> good<00:02:53.219> I<00:02:53.280> might<00:02:53.489> even<00:02:53.549> just

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it looks pretty good I might even just

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.580 
it looks pretty good I might even just
play<00:02:53.939> in<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.180> mode<00:02:54.329> because<00:02:54.510> none<00:02:55.409> of<00:02:55.439> my

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
play in this mode because none of my

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.649 
play in this mode because none of my
figures<00:02:55.889> have<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:56.639> I<00:02:56.849> like<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.510> fact

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
figures have that but so I like the fact

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:58.849 
figures have that but so I like the fact
that<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.989> slides<00:02:58.169> out<00:02:58.379> from<00:02:58.439> there<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.769> it's

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
that it slides out from there and it's

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.379 
that it slides out from there and it's
not<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.010> separate<00:02:59.310> headpiece<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.760> they<00:03:00.150> slide

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
not a separate headpiece and they slide

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.300 
not a separate headpiece and they slide
in<00:03:00.540> there<00:03:00.629> really<00:03:00.870> easily<00:03:01.199> they're<00:03:01.829> not<00:03:01.949> loose

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
in there really easily they're not loose

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.039 
in there really easily they're not loose
they<00:03:03.060> don't<00:03:03.239> seem<00:03:03.389> like<00:03:03.480> they'll<00:03:03.629> break<00:03:03.810> easy

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
they don't seem like they'll break easy

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.159 
they don't seem like they'll break easy
so<00:03:04.739> it's<00:03:05.099> really<00:03:05.250> good<00:03:05.659> um<00:03:06.659> and<00:03:06.930> then

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
so it's really good um and then

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.449 
so it's really good um and then
basically<00:03:07.439> you<00:03:07.739> know<00:03:07.889> the<00:03:08.010> rest<00:03:08.099> of<00:03:08.250> his<00:03:08.340> body

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
to him and his ankle like armor looks

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.309 
to him and his ankle like armor looks
cool<00:03:34.849> so<00:03:35.849> overall<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.269> really<00:03:36.419> like<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.019> way<00:03:37.049> he

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
cool so overall I really like the way he

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.670 
cool so overall I really like the way he
looks<00:03:37.759> like<00:03:38.759> I<00:03:38.849> said<00:03:39.060> very<00:03:39.329> simple<00:03:39.870> I'm<00:03:40.349> not<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
looks like I said very simple I'm not a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.409 
looks like I said very simple I'm not a
whole<00:03:41.009> lot<00:03:41.159> going<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.900> but<00:03:42.900> um<00:03:43.639> you<00:03:44.639> know<00:03:44.790> there

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
whole lot going on but um you know there

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:46.939 
whole lot going on but um you know there
really<00:03:45.540> isn't<00:03:45.989> with<00:03:46.079> augie<00:03:46.229> toe<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.769> think

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
really isn't with augie toe and I think

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.740 
really isn't with augie toe and I think
they<00:03:47.009> did<00:03:47.159> a<00:03:47.220> good<00:03:47.340> job<00:03:47.400> he's<00:03:48.150> pretty<00:03:48.419> much

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
they did a good job he's pretty much

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.640 
they did a good job he's pretty much
like<00:03:49.079> I<00:03:49.199> said<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.680> same<00:03:50.090> design<00:03:51.090> as<00:03:51.419> the<00:03:51.650> giant

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.110 
like I said the same design as the giant

simplistic pneus and the way he can
strike<00:04:03.209> poses<00:04:03.449> I<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:04.469> I<00:04:04.650> really<00:04:05.009> like<00:04:05.129> him

icq<00:04:08.370> amies<00:04:08.699> I<00:04:08.909> do<00:04:09.329> wish<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:10.049> he<00:04:10.590> came<00:04:10.709> with<00:04:10.859> a

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
icq amies I do wish that he came with a

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.309 
icq amies I do wish that he came with a
little<00:04:11.129> more<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:11.729> know<00:04:11.789> that<00:04:12.150> Augie<00:04:13.019> Tom

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
little more like I know that Augie Tom

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.689 
little more like I know that Augie Tom
doesn't<00:04:13.500> really<00:04:13.680> come<00:04:13.919> with<00:04:14.099> a<00:04:14.310> whole<00:04:14.519> lot

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
doesn't really come with a whole lot

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.640 
doesn't really come with a whole lot
more<00:04:15.030> but<00:04:15.299> maybe<00:04:15.509> just<00:04:15.719> a<00:04:15.810> few<00:04:16.049> more<00:04:16.139> hands<00:04:16.409> to

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
more but maybe just a few more hands to

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.689 
more but maybe just a few more hands to
do<00:04:16.829> a<00:04:17.039> slight<00:04:17.729> variety<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.269> poses<00:04:19.430> but<00:04:20.430> I

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
do a slight variety of poses but I

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.310 
do a slight variety of poses but I
definitely<00:04:21.180> think<00:04:21.449> he's<00:04:21.599> a<00:04:21.630> good<00:04:21.810> figure<00:04:22.049> and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
definitely think he's a good figure and

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.600 
definitely think he's a good figure and
I'm<00:04:22.409> looking<00:04:22.680> forward<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.310> Machine

tornado release to have with him and I

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.110 
tornado release to have with him and I
think<00:04:25.979> it's<00:04:26.099> neat<00:04:26.279> that<00:04:26.310> they're<00:04:26.520> doing<00:04:26.699> that

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
think it's neat that they're doing that

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.300 
think it's neat that they're doing that
one<00:04:28.020> other<00:04:28.110> thing<00:04:28.199> I<00:04:28.440> want<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.650> note<00:04:28.800> before<00:04:29.070> I
