00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 That's our turn to talk about hp. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.500
 energy storage material used in at what's gotta hp life activities there 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.660
 It's all told . 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.650
 In most cases, almost all life forms now store their energy in hp form. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.380
 With the energy in it, it is now used by life activities 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.119
 You can see it. 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:32.390
 But why does hp or at &amp; t have any chemical structure ? 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:36.690
 We can save energy in the form of hp 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.550
 Let me briefly try to talk about that now so used to life 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.000
 I'll have to look at that passage. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000
 I'll see you. 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:51.040
 T's is to that tree stands give adenosine tri-phosphate 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.090
 You do not need to know the abbreviation in detail, but you have to see what it is. 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.600
 There's neundeyo example, you saw that haneungeo Oh dengue in 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.890
 Arden 2 Give us a Lagos 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.720
 When did this come in. When you explained the nucleic acid, you came in. 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:12.040
 The adenine guanine cytosine team just listened to the site's new team. 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.890
 The adenine that comes out then is acting. 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:24.640
 Have you heard of adenine by smoke and reverse time to explain the same nucleic acid yogeot 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:29.200
 When talking about the basic structure of the nucleus smoke plus o carbon per ton of carbon 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 Try as we re-Boss 5 per 5 shots each in 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:41.700
 Lee jeans and Lee Boss Boss characters so ah what I combined the two kinds of call nya 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.700
 I call the request adenosine. 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.200
 Once again 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.100
 Yoaden is a combination of the base and the cooking boss, which are called adenosine 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.549
 Call 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.539
 Okay . Adenosine is a fertile mountain , which is now a weapon. 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:04.560
 Please use 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:09.630
 Such a weapon, people got stuck three now h3 po-party impression 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.520
 Now that this is all meant h3 po meaning came abroad it means on top 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.819
 You can think about it. 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.890
 The design I have attached a two-year-old dog now 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.330
 That's why I have three. Tweight Raul has a triangle. Just a triangle. 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.100
 Please remember three. 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.720
 Then we say phosphoric acid , so we do not have phosphate 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.030
 Stands have written in characters 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.989
 Adenosine has been added to the back of the drug is now 0 You are hard again 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.280
 I'll lead you. 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:44.310
 Adenosine tri-tree then a phosphate phosphonium sulfate was so hp 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:50.010
 We use the abbreviation as 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:53.190
 So what did I say now , why do we switch to hp form 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.160
 I told him I was going to do it. 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:03.209
 Now this is our ion work. 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:08.670
 First anion that is not difficult when the first engagement catch phosphate of adenosine required 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:14.040
 But from the second application, the meaning and application is what. 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.730
 Well do not know anything at all, even off screen-and-let within the opposition itself pushed me 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.630
 It is. 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:23.100
 Because you know you just have to occur geujeongdo small reaction force 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.880
 Despite the large state of rebellion, it is difficult to combine 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.620
 Will 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.820
 The difficulty of combining is that there is a lot of energy in it. 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.980
 I understand. 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:39.209
 You know, then, when you combine the second anion with the third one, 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:43.140
 Likewise , it is difficult to combine because of the regular repulsive force. 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.239
 And yet, there's a combination , 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.690
 You can see it big. 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.410
 So that's where it goes. 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.100
 Why now because that way, thinking little of the glaze applied to app 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:00.180
 Because let's study still do a little step with time KSAT 0 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:04.410
 So here's a straight line, each picture is a regular post. 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.810
 Here's a picture like this in a straight line and it usually waves in many books 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.069
 It draws a picture as a wallpaper different from another's talking 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:16.990
 That's why I call this combination of strange things. 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:19.930
 It 's a high-energy impression when you combine it with high energy repulsion. 

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.850
 This expression 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.680
 Done 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:30.160
 So now this is an unstable union because it is bound to float 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.000
 I can easily put my daughter on. 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.770
 Basset Basset shine I caught easily, so we are now in the water 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:44.919
 Hydrolytic enzymes are involved here as they combine 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.699
 When these hydrolyzed lakes, called hp ace , are involved, 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.460
 There's a number. 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:57.520
 This enzyme is okay with the water so happens, as you can see below 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:05:02.740
 It's two denim and rib os adenosine. Two of them are off. 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:06.039
 Just because there is one floating, you say two, Dia adenosine d 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:10.900
 Bakkwimyeonseo phosphate yoge one fell 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:14.289
 Then the energy used in joining the two comes out, 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.680
 The energy value is a knife with a 3-point run. 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:25.479
 This is the life activity we talked about before 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:28.750
 Material synthesis, material transport, or heat emission photovoltaic power shrinkage 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:32.530
 You can use it for these life activities. 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:36.340
 Of course, there are many questions like this. 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.729
 Because it combines high energy here too impressed this also broken my old one is also creating 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:45.280
 Can not one of you two if g 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:48.670
 1 Night 1 What we say is you amp 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.030
 Is attached to the one-party impression adenosine attached two 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:56.530
 3 is attached to this jusigoyo about once you look at what the term 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:06:01.660
 I'm also like that if you look at the reaction of our normal life 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:09.840
 When I put the swarm was caught lighted ttetda one putting back one grain 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:13.270
 I put and put one in this way ie between hp and atp and adp 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:18.310
 We use it as an energy to go back and forth. 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:19.330
 Now then hp is that what are you going adp when the energy is coming 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.290
 It's a response . 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:27.550
 How much is it? 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:32.410
 I dont have to re-adp combined to put the personnel 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:36.840
 At this time, the reaction would not it vampire'll be right energy going 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.840
 What is the response of the heat generation half 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:46.680
 Maybe you can understand what half is a blood - sucking reaction. 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.920
 Naeseyo writes savings to savings ttaga was written understanding 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.780
 Save it, take it out, save it , take it out, 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:58.620
 That way you have a party that pushes us to understand the 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:03.240
 I talked with you guys about hp. 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.200
 hp is 1 I put a 1 , I want to recycle this kind of savings 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.670
 It is. 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.680
 In that sense, we are now used through life in the form of atp . 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:14.850
 I use the energy contained in it. 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.360
 Do not check it in the package . It's too lumpy. Yeah, it's too lumpy. 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:20.970
 Big 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:24.530
 Old 100,000 won checks hp is easily some of you this way, one thousand won a 40-party 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.530
 I hope you understand.
