00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.429
 after a long and tiring journey, nice 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.300
 we managed to recover the iPhone 5 c 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.340
 not a new apple home device 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.920
 then this video 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.859
 we will use more than anything else for a brief 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.710
 unboxing we will give a few before 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.980
 impression on this device 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.890
 we begin to open it we find immediately the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.140
 our device in green color 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.820
 let's put aside for a moment 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:40.079
 let's see what's inside the box 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:43.710
 we find our quick guides with 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.379
 apple stickers and as accessories we find 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.879
 the headphones they had found already 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.719
 in the iPhone 5 network charger e 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.710
 the lightning cable so nothing new 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.980
 as accessories here is that the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:09.119
 terminal 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:11.430
 if I hno from his terminal support 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.530
 indeed it has features 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.619
 the main ones of the iPhone 5 then 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.810
 we find a a6 processor the camera 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.570

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.479
 white , yellow, pink and green 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.100
 for each of these colors in the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.229
 software we find the background 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:47.250
 combined to the touch it is very beautiful 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.960
 even if we remember that it is built and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.229
 assembled with a polycarbonate 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.210
 always reinforced with metal but not 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.719
 gives us that feeling of a phone 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.409
 plasticky we create the film 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.350
 however, we always find a front 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.959

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.840
