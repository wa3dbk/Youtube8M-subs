down on a flat surface your screen won't
be<00:02:46.390> touching<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.900> case<00:02:47.230> will<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.860> overall

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
be touching the case will and overall

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.640 
be touching the case will and overall
it's<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.790> real<00:02:49.000> clean<00:02:49.330> look<00:02:49.630> like<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.319> say<00:02:50.500> the

it's a real clean look like I say the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.320 
it's a real clean look like I say the
whites<00:02:50.830> going<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.130> show<00:02:51.280> more<00:02:51.489> fingerprinting

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
whites going to show more fingerprinting

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.509 
whites going to show more fingerprinting
but<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.350> definitely<00:02:53.560> gets<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:54.069> lot<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.400> head

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
but it definitely gets a lot of head

latch<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:08.769> can<00:03:08.920> simply<00:03:09.250> take<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:09.610> off

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
latch and you can simply take this off

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.430 
latch and you can simply take this off
but<00:03:10.120> what<00:03:10.209> I'm<00:03:10.330> going<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.510> do<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:11.110> I'm<00:03:11.260> going<00:03:11.349> to

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.460 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
demo<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.069> credit<00:03:12.519> card<00:03:12.790> holder<00:03:13.120> case<00:03:13.470> back

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
demo the credit card holder case back

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.620 
demo the credit card holder case back
for<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:15.910> one<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.239> going<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.450> add<00:03:16.599> a

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
for you and this one is going to add a

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.180 
for you and this one is going to add a
little<00:03:16.900> bit<00:03:17.080> more<00:03:17.200> bulk<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.709> really<00:03:17.920> doesn't

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
little bit more bulk it really doesn't

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.819 
little bit more bulk it really doesn't
add<00:03:18.310> much<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.880> way<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:19.030> weight<00:03:19.390> but<00:03:20.140> bulk

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
add much in the way of weight but bulk

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.710 
add much in the way of weight but bulk
certainly<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.579> will<00:03:21.730> add<00:03:21.970> let<00:03:22.510> me<00:03:22.570> go<00:03:22.660> ahead

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
certainly it will add let me go ahead

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.690 
certainly it will add let me go ahead
and<00:03:22.840> close<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.079> up<00:03:23.370> that's<00:03:24.370> what<00:03:24.579> we're

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
and close that up that's what we're

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.330 
and close that up that's what we're
talking<00:03:25.060> about<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.510> yeah<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.380> adds<00:03:26.560> bulk<00:03:26.920> but

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
talking about so yeah it adds bulk but

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.520 
talking about so yeah it adds bulk but
you<00:03:27.459> can<00:03:27.640> fit<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:27.970> few<00:03:28.420> credit<00:03:28.780> cards<00:03:28.810> in<00:03:29.260> here

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
you can fit a few credit cards in here

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.190 
you can fit a few credit cards in here
or<00:03:29.709> driver's<00:03:30.700> license<00:03:31.150> or<00:03:31.269> whatever<00:03:31.600> I'm

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
or driver's license or whatever I'm

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.170 
or driver's license or whatever I'm
going<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.440> slide<00:03:32.650> one<00:03:33.100> card<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.579> here<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.030> it's

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
going to slide one card in here and it's

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.479 
going to slide one card in here and it's
got<00:03:34.359> like<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.630> spring<00:03:35.260> loading<00:03:35.829> mechanism<00:03:36.010> to

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
got like a spring loading mechanism to

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.900 
got like a spring loading mechanism to
it<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.150> flip<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.959> upside<00:03:38.380> down<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:39.640> cards

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
it so flip that upside down the cards

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.340 
it so flip that upside down the cards
not<00:03:40.090> going<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:40.359> pop<00:03:40.510> out<00:03:40.750> so<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.140> don't<00:03:41.170> have

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
not going to pop out so you don't have

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.660 
not going to pop out so you don't have
to<00:03:41.410> worry<00:03:41.620> about<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:41.920> but<00:03:42.310> as<00:03:42.430> far<00:03:42.459> as

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
to worry about that but as far as

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.840 
to worry about that but as far as
removing<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.389> it's<00:03:43.569> very<00:03:43.810> easy<00:03:44.280> with<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.310> thumb

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
removing it it's very easy with a thumb

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.780 
removing it it's very easy with a thumb
or<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.120> finger<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.780> pop<00:03:47.139> it<00:03:47.350> in<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.530> out<00:03:47.859> so<00:03:48.280> you

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
or a finger to pop it in and out so you

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.129 
or a finger to pop it in and out so you
want<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.000> go<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.239> gym<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.810> want<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.049> do

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
want to go the gym you want to do

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.629

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
and not a wallet this is a great way to

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.379 
and not a wallet this is a great way to
do<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.100> that<00:03:54.130> back<00:03:54.700> plates<00:03:55.000> going<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.269> run

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
do it and that back plates going to run

do it and that back plates going to run
you<00:03:55.480> about<00:03:55.569> 14<00:03:56.260> 95<00:03:57.450> overall<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.260> head

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
you about 14 95 overall it is a head

turner<00:03:59.709> case<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.579> think<00:04:00.609> it<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.389> graft

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
turner case I think it is the graft
