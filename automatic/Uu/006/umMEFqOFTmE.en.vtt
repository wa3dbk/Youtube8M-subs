00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.250
 Well, here, as you can see, we are going to 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.440
 find what is the turbine here is 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.570
 we're going to grab this part just the 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.520
 you will find here where is this 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.530
 destroyed and then this one got on the 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.590
 bus then we come here 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.930
 I think it's the third station with the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.760
 fourth then we come and here is 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.800
 to make our gun around here is 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.620
 the bank so you do not really miss 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.700
 here we go to my friend put the cables 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.290
 who are where is the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.860
 electricity and then here I am 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.329
 putting what is the commune turbine 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.290
 So now we have to go and bring 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.140
 what is as one as a thing that 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.660
 brand as 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.700
 as speed something like that then that 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.770
 we will find it here where 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.830
 is a cabin then we come 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.380
 like we were looking for what 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.850
 what electricity remember that you have 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.350
 to be a zombie one of his friends 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.330
 he has to have the zombie because if 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.130
 you bring it, it's going to die then 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.000
 here we go 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.450
 denver here we have the left hand 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.759
 a little road here can be military 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.530
 because there is fire here 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.539
 that the game is there so is the cabin 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.579
 in this cabin you will be able to find what 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.829
 is that part that we need to do 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.420
 our person and also find me 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.159
 that from the small knife 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.020
 stopping bring better what in 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.360
 the mitt part the mitten a little more 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.399
 good then we're going to find 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.679
 well there it is in the part we remain 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.679
 looking and we can get it then 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.869
 now we are going to here and we are already 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.479
 manufacturing then here we have the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.039
 coils the cables the aesa then 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.430
 Now we are going to bring what is the 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.890
 pipe that is found equipment is already 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.700
 the cornfields and then we 're going down 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.700
 up to 7 seconds to get to 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.890
 core a little bit more because they move more 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.890
 Quick 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.560
 it is very easy to find this width 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.560
 we can find 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.300
 because you find what a radio is 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.250
 that also been for those of mystery 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.320
 but later we will show you with 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.250
 the lungs transplants step this turn 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.360
 so let's find the feet of the tube 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.190
 defend here I bring what is 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.590
 also a meteorite stone and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.810
 it's also part of the isstech but 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.960
 because we were now forming 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.700
 what was the still gun here 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.980
 as you can see grabbed the radius of 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.960
 bounced the stone but let's try to 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.750
 get what he had to the tube the 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.730
 stand out they followed up the tube that 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.310
 has gone fly the radios we go quickly 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.740
 form the guns and as you can see 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.650
 here we are forming the tube the turbine 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.930
 the cables and the watch that I bought a 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.820
 field is memory field many has 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.890
 you can use our weapon 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.560
 try the way that you do not destroy yourself 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.090
 and that destroys the parts will fall on 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.460
 the same place where it was destroyed and 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.250
 will be with fire the parts that are 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.260
 you break these little details put them with the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.020
 claws and treats the way so that it does not 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.390
 is destroyed from the needle 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.770
 and red mark is destroyed treats the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.970
 way that is green is good then 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.500
 boys here we have shown you 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.500
 we can form the gun 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.950
 the sun plan goodbye
