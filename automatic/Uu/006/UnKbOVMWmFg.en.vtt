so<00:03:22.599> the<00:03:22.719> decisions<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.290> we<00:03:23.379> make<00:03:23.590> feel<00:03:24.099> true

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
so the decisions that we make feel true

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.410 
so the decisions that we make feel true
to<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.579> character<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.239> also<00:03:25.329> our

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
to the character but also our

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.270 
to the character but also our
so<00:03:28.020> what<00:03:28.140> we<00:03:28.260> did<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:28.590> establish<00:03:28.709> what<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
so what we did we establish what the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.370 
so what we did we establish what the
definition

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
definition

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.120 
definition
and<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:32.150> me<00:03:32.330> it's<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:33.800> difference<00:03:34.070> between

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
and to me it's the difference between

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.810 
and to me it's the difference between
selfish<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.120> selfless<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:37.370> when<00:03:37.550> you<00:03:37.640> have<00:03:37.760> a

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
selfish and selfless so when you have a

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.220 
selfish and selfless so when you have a
character<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.300> you<00:03:38.450> understand<00:03:39.020> that's

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
character that you understand that's

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.870 
character that you understand that's
