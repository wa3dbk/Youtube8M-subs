00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.429 

the<00:00:31.359> only<00:00:31.509> problem<00:00:31.749> is<00:00:31.900> because<00:00:32.079> of<00:00:32.259> the

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
the only problem is because of the

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.590 
the only problem is because of the
lights<00:00:32.649> in<00:00:32.829> here<00:00:33.010> give<00:00:33.879> a<00:00:33.910> little<00:00:34.059> jumpstart

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
lights in here give a little jumpstart

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600 
lights in here give a little jumpstart
yeah<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:35.140> doesn't<00:00:35.350> start<00:00:35.739> off<00:00:35.860> my<00:00:35.949> god<00:00:36.250> i<00:00:36.280> just

yeah it doesn't start off my god i just
noticed<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.120> tree<00:00:37.360> in<00:00:37.510> their<00:00:37.660> light<00:00:37.989> is<00:00:38.199> like

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
noticed the tree in their light is like

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.580 
noticed the tree in their light is like
the<00:00:38.559> power<00:00:38.739> of<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:38.980> Sun<00:00:39.250> know<00:00:40.140> they<00:00:41.140> can't

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
the power of the Sun know they can't

the power of the Sun know they can't
I've<00:00:41.800> been<00:00:42.100> sweating<00:00:42.340> which<00:00:42.820> one<00:00:43.030> that<00:00:43.180> I

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
I've been sweating which one that I

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.660 
I've been sweating which one that I
probably<00:00:43.420> should<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.440> it's<00:00:44.589> even<00:00:44.680> like<00:00:45.010> more

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
probably should and it's even like more

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.450 
probably should and it's even like more
so<00:00:45.910> because<00:00:46.059> we<00:00:46.180> have<00:00:46.360> all<00:00:46.510> like<00:00:46.719> smoke<00:00:47.460> it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
so because we have all like smoke it

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.030 
so because we have all like smoke it
also<00:00:48.640> has<00:00:48.940> other<00:00:49.120> components<00:00:49.750> if<00:00:49.930> i<00:00:50.079> enter

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
also has other components if i enter

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.560 
also has other components if i enter
different<00:00:51.309> specificity<00:00:52.089> right<00:00:52.420> they

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
different specificity right they

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.630 
different specificity right they
actually<00:00:52.930> actually<00:00:53.110> all<00:00:53.589> be<00:00:53.769> like<00:00:53.920> shin-soo

it's<00:00:58.239> al<00:00:58.769> can<00:00:59.769> turn<00:01:00.040> anything<00:01:00.219> on<00:01:00.489> words

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
it's al can turn anything on words

flashing Oh actually I got a capacitor
you<00:01:10.390> can<00:01:10.540> see<00:01:10.689> it<00:01:10.810> lighting<00:01:11.229> up<00:01:11.350> inside<00:01:11.740> and

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
you can see it lighting up inside and

you can see I'm linking a little bit
it's<00:01:18.549> also<00:01:18.729> infrared<00:01:18.939> so<00:01:19.420> each<00:01:19.689> conscience

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
it's also infrared so each conscience

it's also infrared so each conscience
about<00:01:20.409> election

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569

given<00:01:54.600> its<00:01:54.810> ear<00:01:55.200> tray<00:01:55.410> just<00:01:55.620> seven<00:01:56.010> to<00:01:56.100> twelve

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
given its ear tray just seven to twelve

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.920 
given its ear tray just seven to twelve
you<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.510> old<00:01:57.600> might<00:01:57.780> not

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you see that your old might not

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.990

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
necessarily lacked on to the story

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.210 
necessarily lacked on to the story
liners<00:02:00.330> which<00:02:00.480> is<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> twelve-year-old<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
liners which is a twelve-year-old so the

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.970 
liners which is a twelve-year-old so the
second<00:02:02.520> year<00:02:02.580> might<00:02:02.760> just<00:02:02.940> go<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.150> sure<00:02:03.180> they

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
second year might just go be sure they

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.150 
second year might just go be sure they
love<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.100> black<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.340> gray<00:02:05.670> Megan's<00:02:06.360> family

love the black and gray Megan's family

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.469 
love the black and gray Megan's family
so<00:02:08.160> they<00:02:08.369> weren't<00:02:08.520> necessarily<00:02:08.940> bad<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
so they weren't necessarily bad and the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.400 
so they weren't necessarily bad and the
kid<00:02:09.660> might<00:02:09.810> not<00:02:09.990> see<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.410> bad<00:02:10.820> they<00:02:11.820> are

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
kid might not see it as a bad they are

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.020 
kid might not see it as a bad they are
so<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.890> works<00:02:14.040> showing<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.580> only<00:02:14.730> say

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
so it works showing we just only say

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.460 
so it works showing we just only say
