00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
to look over the tape now a new thoughts

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.680 
to look over the tape now a new thoughts
well<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:05.130> think<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.730> couple<00:00:05.940> things<00:00:06.240> jump<00:00:06.509> out<00:00:06.629> of

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
well I think a couple things jump out of

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.270 
well I think a couple things jump out of
me<00:00:06.899> when<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.680> know<00:00:07.740> when<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:07.980> look<00:00:08.130> at<00:00:08.220> the

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
me when I you know when you look at the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.120 
me when I you know when you look at the
film<00:00:08.490> first<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.450> all<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.410> explosive<00:00:10.920> plays

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
film first of all the explosive plays

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.339 
film first of all the explosive plays
were<00:00:11.370> critical<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.090> passing<00:00:12.509> game<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.019> in

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
were critical in the passing game and in

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.690 
were critical in the passing game and in
the<00:00:13.440> running<00:00:13.769> game<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.130> don't<00:00:14.280> think<00:00:14.610> we

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
the running game I don't think we

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.220 
the running game I don't think we
probably<00:00:14.910> gave<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.420> running<00:00:15.750> game<00:00:15.870> enough

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
probably gave the running game enough

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.859 
probably gave the running game enough
credit<00:00:17.070> after<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.640> game<00:00:17.820> because<00:00:18.150> kody<00:00:18.449> seven

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
credit after the game because kody seven

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.439 
credit after the game because kody seven
touchdown<00:00:19.260> passes<00:00:19.529> but<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.220> thought<00:00:20.880> buck<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
touchdown passes but I thought buck and

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.390 
touchdown passes but I thought buck and
Justin<00:00:21.869> both<00:00:22.080> had<00:00:22.320> nice<00:00:22.560> ball<00:00:22.830> games<00:00:23.100> running

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
Justin both had nice ball games running

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.670 
Justin both had nice ball games running
the<00:00:23.519> football<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.900> all<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
the football to do all of that the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.380 
the football to do all of that the
offensive<00:00:26.039> line<00:00:26.189> has<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.730> play<00:00:26.910> well<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.210> think

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
offensive line has to play well I think

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.240 
offensive line has to play well I think
that<00:00:27.599> showed<00:00:27.869> up<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.740> probably<00:00:28.920> didn't

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that showed up and we probably didn't

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.710 
that showed up and we probably didn't
give<00:00:29.369> enough<00:00:29.400> credit<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> two<00:00:30.420> turnovers

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
give enough credit to the two turnovers

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
give enough credit to the two turnovers
in<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> first<00:00:31.320> quarter<00:00:31.800> by<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.040> defense<00:00:32.550> you

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
in the first quarter by the defense you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.459 
in the first quarter by the defense you
know<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.880> allow<00:00:33.300> us<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.660> jump<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
know to allow us to jump out to the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.040 
know to allow us to jump out to the
28-point<00:00:35.160> lead<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:36.149> collected<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> passing

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
28-point lead what collected the passing

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.690 
28-point lead what collected the passing
game<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.440> enable<00:00:37.829> Cody<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.190> put<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.460> such<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
game to enable Cody to put up such a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.170 
game to enable Cody to put up such a
story<00:00:39.020> well<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.620> Trust<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> big<00:00:41.940> key

the<00:00:49.200> separation<00:00:49.890> speed<00:00:50.219> by<00:00:50.430> our<00:00:50.489> guys<00:00:50.789> you

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the separation speed by our guys you

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.959 
the separation speed by our guys you
know<00:00:51.180> juju<00:00:51.890> Nelson<00:00:52.890> Darius<00:00:53.550> those<00:00:53.760> guys

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
I thought was really evident how

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
I thought was really evident how

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that second option next to investigate

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.609 
that second option next to investigate
well<00:01:03.090> they're<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.270> important<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.229> juju

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619

well they're all important you know juju
has<00:01:04.739> been<00:01:04.920> big<00:01:05.270> you<00:01:06.270> know<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.570> feel

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
has been big you know we really feel

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.530 
has been big you know we really feel
like<00:01:07.260> he's<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.729> cusp<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.299> becoming

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
like he's on the cusp of becoming

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.750 
like he's on the cusp of becoming
something<00:01:10.229> special<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.520> thought<00:01:11.700> that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
something special and I thought that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.270 
something special and I thought that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
showed Saturday not only on offense but

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.340 
showed Saturday not only on offense but
on<00:01:14.369> special<00:01:14.790> teams<00:01:14.939> he<00:01:15.180> played<00:01:15.360> 24<00:01:15.840> plays<00:01:16.140> on

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
on special teams he played 24 plays on

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.590 
on special teams he played 24 plays on
special<00:01:16.740> teams<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.850> we're<00:01:18.060> throwing<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
special teams when we're throwing the

backs Nelson's making his place we're a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.920 
backs Nelson's making his place we're a
lot<00:01:29.040> more<00:01:29.070> difficult<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.060> stop<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.750> we

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
lot more difficult to stop and so we

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.300 
lot more difficult to stop and so we
have<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.320> continue<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.829> spread<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> ball

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
have to continue to spread the ball

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.249 
have to continue to spread the ball
around<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.850> offense<00:01:33.450> obviously<00:01:33.930> stole<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
around the offense obviously stole the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.590 
around the offense obviously stole the
show<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> bunch<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
show but what do you think a bunch of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.520 
show but what do you think a bunch of
well<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> thought<00:01:36.750> they<00:01:36.869> were<00:01:36.930> great<00:01:37.170> coming
