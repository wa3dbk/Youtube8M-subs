I'd say let's say from I 78 points south

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.990 
I'd say let's say from I 78 points south
we'll<00:02:03.840> probably<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:05.399> 50<00:02:05.700> degree<00:02:05.790> mark

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
we'll probably see the 50 degree mark

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.270 
we'll probably see the 50 degree mark
here<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.860> go<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> little<00:02:08.129> bit

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
we're going to create some pretty high

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.979 
we're going to create some pretty high
lapse<00:03:19.940> rate<00:03:20.299> so<00:03:20.510> we're<00:03:20.600> going<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.780> see<00:03:20.959> some

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
lapse rate so we're going to see some

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.830 
lapse rate so we're going to see some
very<00:03:21.260> breezy<00:03:21.620> gusts<00:03:22.209> Gus<00:03:23.209> could<00:03:23.450> be<00:03:23.660> as<00:03:23.810> high

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
Sun angle in late-september so you're

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.409

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
going to need some really good dynamics

no matter how much cold air is here I'm
you<00:04:40.100> understand<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.550> get<00:04:40.610> more<00:04:40.820> cold<00:04:41.090> air

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
you understand you get more cold air

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.659 
you understand you get more cold air
here<00:04:41.479> involved<00:04:41.960> so<00:04:42.740> in<00:04:42.949> the<00:04:43.040> cold<00:04:43.250> air<00:04:43.430> in<00:04:43.610> the

here involved so in the cold air in the
upper<00:04:43.880> levels<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.240> can<00:04:44.270> be<00:04:44.449> cold<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:44.870> could

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
upper levels you can be cold so it could

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.110 
upper levels you can be cold so it could
be<00:04:45.110> one<00:04:45.290> of<00:04:45.350> those<00:04:45.410> deals<00:04:45.590> where<00:04:45.710> it's<00:04:46.550> falling

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
be one of those deals where it's falling

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370

communication<00:04:55.550> is<00:04:55.639> going<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.820> be<00:04:55.910> favoring

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
communication is going to be favoring

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.700 
communication is going to be favoring
areas<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.840> elevation<00:04:57.350> but<00:04:57.470> we're<00:04:57.560> going<00:04:57.650> to

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
areas of elevation but we're going to

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.890 
areas of elevation but we're going to
narrow<00:04:58.220> this<00:04:58.370> down<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.729> follow<00:04:58.970> this<00:04:59.150> over<00:04:59.840> the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
narrow this down to follow this over the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.510 
narrow this down to follow this over the
next<00:05:00.080> couple<00:05:00.229> days<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.710> European<00:05:01.070> model<00:05:01.340> also

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
next couple days the European model also

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.290 
next couple days the European model also
shows<00:05:01.910> some<00:05:02.600> snow<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.919> Canadian<00:05:04.910> model<00:05:05.030> does

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
shows some snow the Canadian model does

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.000 
shows some snow the Canadian model does
as<00:05:05.479> well<00:05:05.630> but<00:05:05.870> it's<00:05:06.020> more<00:05:06.169> snow<00:05:06.470> going<00:05:06.740> over<00:05:06.919> to

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
as well but it's more snow going over to

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.650 
as well but it's more snow going over to
rain<00:05:07.220> so<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.850> couple<00:05:07.970> different<00:05:08.300> scenarios

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
rain so the couple different scenarios

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.909 
rain so the couple different scenarios
yet<00:05:08.870> it's<00:05:09.050> going<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.260> play<00:05:09.350> out<00:05:09.440> with<00:05:09.740> this

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
yet it's going to play out with this

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.500 
yet it's going to play out with this
first<00:05:10.550> thing<00:05:10.639> we<00:05:10.760> need<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:10.910> figure<00:05:11.090> out<00:05:11.180> is<00:05:11.270> the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
first thing we need to figure out is the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.090 
first thing we need to figure out is the
track<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.110> how<00:05:12.290> much<00:05:12.410> cold<00:05:12.680> air<00:05:12.800> is<00:05:12.919> going<00:05:13.040> to

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
track and how much cold air is going to

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.420 
track and how much cold air is going to
be<00:05:13.160> available<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:13.790> then<00:05:14.270> after<00:05:14.540> that<00:05:14.570> point

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
be available and then after that point

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.730 
be available and then after that point
we're<00:05:16.430> going<00:05:16.520> to<00:05:16.610> have<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.789> determine<00:05:17.740> what

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
we're going to have to determine what

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.850 
we're going to have to determine what
exactly<00:05:18.889> we're<00:05:19.370> dealing<00:05:19.669> with<00:05:19.700> as<00:05:20.000> far<00:05:20.210> as<00:05:20.860> you

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
exactly we're dealing with as far as you

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.620 
exactly we're dealing with as far as you
know<00:05:21.979> if<00:05:22.220> this<00:05:22.400> is<00:05:22.430> going<00:05:22.729> to<00:05:22.820> stick<00:05:23.090> it's<00:05:23.330> just

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
know if this is going to stick it's just

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.029 
know if this is going to stick it's just
going<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.810> fall<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.350> then<00:05:24.590> look<00:05:24.770> pretty

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
going to fall and then look pretty

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.100 
going to fall and then look pretty
falling<00:05:25.639> and<00:05:25.789> not<00:05:25.880> sticking<00:05:26.270> anywhere<00:05:26.570> those

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
falling and not sticking anywhere those

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.300 
falling and not sticking anywhere those
are<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.289> best<00:05:27.410> kind<00:05:27.680> you<00:05:27.800> not<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:28.010> clean<00:05:28.190> them

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
are the best kind you not to clean them

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.190 
are the best kind you not to clean them
up<00:05:28.430> in<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.669> Rue<00:05:28.820> it's<00:05:28.970> easier<00:05:29.270> easy<00:05:29.630> on<00:05:29.810> travel

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
up in the Rue it's easier easy on travel

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.930 
up in the Rue it's easier easy on travel
you<00:05:30.320> just<00:05:30.440> have<00:05:30.530> Brett<00:05:30.710> wet<00:05:31.160> roadways<00:05:31.610> that<00:05:31.639> be

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
you just have Brett wet roadways that be

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.180 
you just have Brett wet roadways that be
the<00:05:32.060> most<00:05:32.210> ideal<00:05:32.450> situation<00:05:32.950> so<00:05:33.950> even<00:05:34.160> though

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
the most ideal situation so even though

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.610 
the most ideal situation so even though
the<00:05:34.310> gfs<00:05:34.700> is<00:05:34.880> showing<00:05:35.270> all<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:35.630> snow<00:05:36.050> here<00:05:36.350> and

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
the gfs is showing all the snow here and

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.620 
the gfs is showing all the snow here and
I<00:05:37.010> think<00:05:37.250> it's<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.460> little<00:05:37.550> crazy<00:05:37.910> with<00:05:38.180> how<00:05:38.330> far

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
I think it's a little crazy with how far

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.540 
I think it's a little crazy with how far
is<00:05:38.900> South<00:05:39.260> he<00:05:39.470> gets<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.770> snow<00:05:39.979> line<00:05:40.220> against<00:05:40.460> it

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
is South he gets a snow line against it

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.000 
is South he gets a snow line against it
all<00:05:40.729> the<00:05:41.000> way<00:05:41.090> this<00:05:41.450> is<00:05:41.510> all<00:05:41.780> below<00:05:42.020> 32<00:05:42.410> here<00:05:42.830> so

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
all the way this is all below 32 here so

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.710 
all the way this is all below 32 here so
it<00:05:43.130> gets<00:05:43.220> a<00:05:43.370> pretty<00:05:43.550> far<00:05:43.849> south<00:05:44.150> here<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:44.479> think

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
it gets a pretty far south here I think

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.969 
it gets a pretty far south here I think
that's<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.900> little<00:05:45.110> unrealistic<00:05:45.590> to<00:05:45.860> expect

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
that's a little unrealistic to expect

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.550 
that's a little unrealistic to expect
that<00:05:46.450> but<00:05:47.450> we<00:05:47.630> will<00:05:47.810> keep<00:05:47.990> an<00:05:48.139> eye<00:05:48.260> on<00:05:48.289> this

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
that but we will keep an eye on this

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.969 
that but we will keep an eye on this
just<00:05:48.770> just<00:05:49.370> to<00:05:49.520> be<00:05:50.450> on<00:05:50.539> the<00:05:50.570> safe<00:05:50.840> side<00:05:50.870> just<00:05:51.860> in

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
just just to be on the safe side just in

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.560 
just just to be on the safe side just in
case<00:05:52.099> something<00:05:52.160> happens<00:05:53.000> here<00:05:53.120> the<00:05:53.270> models

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
case something happens here the models

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.940 
case something happens here the models
really<00:05:53.900> can't<00:05:54.139> pick<00:05:54.320> up<00:05:54.440> on<00:05:54.560> the<00:05:54.620> fact<00:05:54.680> that

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
really can't pick up on the fact that

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.520 
really can't pick up on the fact that
the<00:05:55.160> some<00:05:55.490> angle<00:05:55.729> is<00:05:55.789> going<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:56.000> be<00:05:56.090> so<00:05:56.270> high<00:05:56.530> in

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
the some angle is going to be so high in

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.140 
the some angle is going to be so high in
the<00:05:57.710> sky<00:05:57.919> and<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.250> radiational<00:05:58.849> heating<00:05:59.090> is

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
the sky and the radiational heating is

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.820 
the sky and the radiational heating is
really<00:05:59.389> to<00:05:59.479> play<00:05:59.660> a<00:05:59.690> role<00:05:59.990> and<00:06:00.289> again<00:06:00.710> the

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
really to play a role and again the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.560 
really to play a role and again the
strong<00:06:00.979> March<00:06:01.310> son<00:06:01.580> even<00:06:02.120> though<00:06:02.210> it's<00:06:02.360> behind

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
strong March son even though it's behind

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.420 
strong March son even though it's behind
the<00:06:02.690> clouds<00:06:02.930> will<00:06:03.110> still<00:06:03.289> play<00:06:03.410> a<00:06:03.500> big<00:06:03.800> role<00:06:03.950> in

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
the clouds will still play a big role in

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.430 
the clouds will still play a big role in
this<00:06:05.030> system<00:06:05.300> whether<00:06:05.690> it's<00:06:05.900> snowing<00:06:05.990> or<00:06:06.320> not

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
this system whether it's snowing or not

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.930 
this system whether it's snowing or not
still<00:06:06.650> remains<00:06:06.950> to<00:06:07.010> be<00:06:07.070> seen<00:06:07.340> and<00:06:07.490> if<00:06:07.580> it<00:06:07.700> does

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
still remains to be seen and if it does

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.730 
still remains to be seen and if it does
then<00:06:08.720> we<00:06:08.840> have<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:09.020> determine<00:06:09.229> how<00:06:09.470> much<00:06:09.590> is

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
then we have to determine how much is

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.070 
then we have to determine how much is
going<00:06:09.889> to<00:06:09.919> accumulate<00:06:10.340> if<00:06:10.460> any<00:06:10.760> I<00:06:11.030> would<00:06:11.810> say

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
going to accumulate if any I would say

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.330 
going to accumulate if any I would say
if<00:06:12.200> you're<00:06:12.349> an<00:06:12.440> area<00:06:12.650> of<00:06:12.680> elevation<00:06:13.160> over<00:06:13.220> a

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
if you're an area of elevation over a

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
if you're an area of elevation over a
thousand<00:06:13.700> feet<00:06:13.849> you<00:06:13.940> have<00:06:14.030> a<00:06:14.090> better<00:06:14.270> chance

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
thousand feet you have a better chance

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.210 
thousand feet you have a better chance
of<00:06:14.720> that<00:06:14.840> but<00:06:15.050> right<00:06:15.260> now<00:06:15.440> to<00:06:15.979> get<00:06:16.099> in

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
of that but right now to get in

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.560 
of that but right now to get in
specifics<00:06:16.729> is<00:06:16.880> really<00:06:17.180> an<00:06:17.240> effort<00:06:17.479> of

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
specifics is really an effort of

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.450 
specifics is really an effort of
futility<00:06:17.870> we'll<00:06:18.620> get<00:06:18.770> into<00:06:18.919> that<00:06:18.979> as<00:06:19.190> we<00:06:19.310> get<00:06:19.430> a

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
futility we'll get into that as we get a

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.040 
futility we'll get into that as we get a
little<00:06:19.490> bit<00:06:19.729> closer<00:06:19.910> in<00:06:20.150> the<00:06:20.210> week<00:06:20.389> but<00:06:20.630> it

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
little bit closer in the week but it

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.570 
little bit closer in the week but it
does<00:06:21.169> look<00:06:21.200> like<00:06:21.380> after<00:06:21.650> we<00:06:21.830> get<00:06:21.950> beyond<00:06:22.370> this

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
does look like after we get beyond this

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.640 
does look like after we get beyond this
point<00:06:22.880> here<00:06:23.180> we<00:06:23.330> go<00:06:23.450> past<00:06:23.750> this<00:06:23.990> system<00:06:24.410> here

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
point here we go past this system here

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.339 
point here we go past this system here
we<00:06:25.250> are<00:06:25.370> going<00:06:25.520> to<00:06:25.580> get<00:06:25.669> warm<00:06:26.030> on<00:06:26.660> Saturday

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
we are going to get warm on Saturday

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.960 
we are going to get warm on Saturday
we're<00:06:27.530> going<00:06:27.650> to<00:06:27.710> temperatures<00:06:28.130> spiked<00:06:28.729> on

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
we're going to temperatures spiked on

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.120 
we're going to temperatures spiked on
Saturday<00:06:29.450> to<00:06:30.200> close<00:06:30.560> to<00:06:30.770> near<00:06:30.950> normal

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
Saturday to close to near normal

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.500 
Saturday to close to near normal
temperatures<00:06:31.550> for<00:06:31.729> this<00:06:31.880> time<00:06:31.940> of<00:06:32.120> year<00:06:32.270> so

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
temperatures for this time of year so

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.149 
temperatures for this time of year so
anything<00:06:32.960> and<00:06:33.139> a<00:06:33.200> neural<00:06:33.560> right<00:06:33.710> now<00:06:33.830> or<00:06:34.010> is<00:06:34.070> on

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
anything and a neural right now or is on

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.620 
anything and a neural right now or is on
either<00:06:34.280> side<00:06:34.520> of<00:06:34.550> 50<00:06:34.849> degrees<00:06:35.180> from<00:06:35.360> north<00:06:35.419> to

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
either side of 50 degrees from north to

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.740 
either side of 50 degrees from north to
south<00:06:35.719> so<00:06:36.169> anything<00:06:36.919> it<00:06:37.010> does<00:06:37.190> fall<00:06:37.460> this

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
south so anything it does fall this

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.940 
south so anything it does fall this
looking<00:06:38.900> around<00:06:38.990> very<00:06:39.320> long<00:06:39.380> so<00:06:39.740> it's<00:06:39.860> going

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
looking around very long so it's going

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.560 
looking around very long so it's going
to<00:06:40.010> be<00:06:40.070> what<00:06:40.460> regardless<00:06:40.820> what<00:06:41.060> falls<00:06:41.300> what

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
to be what regardless what falls what

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.990 
to be what regardless what falls what
sticks<00:06:41.900> on<00:06:42.170> Friday<00:06:42.590> will<00:06:43.400> certainly<00:06:43.700> be<00:06:43.850> gone
