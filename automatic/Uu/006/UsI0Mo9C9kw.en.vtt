00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.709
 hello all welcome once again to me 

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:06.990
 channel today I bring for you a new 

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:09.420
 makeup and today we are going to use a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.599
 color that is a precious purple that I 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.160
 I think many will let us really well 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.320
 to start then our makeup 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 putting a little bit of prebase I'm 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.360
 using the skin expert pre-base 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.920
 Many have asked me about this 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.500
 mark that has happened to them the truth 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.840
 I have no idea but the idea is 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.670
 that you use one of a brand that 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.009
 You like it to go very well 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.210
 Do you want recommendations or advice about 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.100
 some that I had tried 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.199
 Do not forget to leave me the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.120
 comments and if what I do is 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.699
 basically distribute it all over the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.699
 face and also a little in the eyes 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.890
 Then I will use the pencil 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 a bowl of nix in the color milk that is a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.910
 white as you can see and I'm going to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.890
 use is to enhance the color of the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.430
 shadow over all the purple and I'm going to 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.040
 put only on the mobile eyelid 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.770
 of course we are not going to forget our 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.100
 eyebrows let's paint them and comb those that 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.100
 stay 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.520
 for the colors we are going to start with a 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.190
 coffee if you're a little bit more brunette and 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.440
 a peach if you're white and you're going to 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.470
 put as transition color between the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.670
 basin and the little eyebrow for the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.640
 basin and to give a little more of 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.530
 depth to liu and to the look you can 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.330
 use a dark color not 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.220
 it necessarily has to be black or 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.170
 brown once you have this ready you're going to 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.480
 put then on your mobile eyelid and 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.970
 on the white base of the jumbo enix the 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.160
 purple color this is a pure 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.290
 metalized and I like it a lot and what 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.360
 I do is put it to pat on the part 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.220
 that binds with the basin if I try to 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.200
 blur it so the cut does not look 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.360
 so marked if you wish you can 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.880
 reaffirm a little more the dark color 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.440
 that goes in the eye socket now with 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.700
 now brochita a little more planet what 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.350
 what I'm going to do is that on the eyelid 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.500
 lower I'll put a little bit of color 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.270
 black but only up to half 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.610
 do not give the impression that lÃ¶w is much 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.470
 smaller and next to the lacrimal I will 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.280
 put a little brighter color 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.229
 to open the look at this point 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.539
 is to promote the delineation and the blink 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.910
 I leave to your consideration if you use 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.890
 false eyelashes but believe me that way 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.890
 you will see your makeup much nicer 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.380
 if you want and if your eyes are so 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.150
 small ones like mine you can use 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.170
 in the lower water line a pencil 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.170
 white or skin color 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.300
 analyze your eye makeup and just 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.470
 you need to finish making up your 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.200
 face 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.260
 I am using base blush and 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.890
 corrector only I did not outline no 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.890
 consider it necessary 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.330
 the concealer what I did was apply a 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.300
 little light in the high areas 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.340
 especially on the cheekbone so that 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.340
 the face looks thinner 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.070
 on the lips I'm using a color 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.080
 gorgeous maybelline fuchsia that I 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.100
 it seems to me it has a very good 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.380
 foundation and this is ready my 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.860
 makeup that can be perfect for 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.860
 the night 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.390
 so if you liked this video and this 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.490

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.860
