00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
only 14 on one side well let you know

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.650 
only 14 on one side well let you know
I've<00:02:07.300> got<00:02:07.480> a<00:02:07.510> five<00:02:07.900> serving<00:02:09.210> packet<00:02:10.210> here<00:02:10.390> that

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
I've got a five serving packet here that

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.610 
I've got a five serving packet here that
is<00:02:11.140> farting<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:11.890> generously<00:02:12.460> sent<00:02:12.820> me<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:14.290> we

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
is farting so generously sent me and we

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.390 
is farting so generously sent me and we
will<00:02:14.770> put<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:16.150> cup<00:02:16.690> looks<00:02:17.500> like<00:02:17.710> a<00:02:17.740> very<00:02:18.070> very

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
will put in cup looks like a very very

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.060 
will put in cup looks like a very very
fine<00:02:18.820> powder<00:02:19.210> so<00:02:19.870> I'm<00:02:19.990> guessing<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.860> is

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
fine powder so I'm guessing that this is

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.870 
fine powder so I'm guessing that this is
going<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.250> mix<00:02:21.580> well<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.430> came<00:02:24.430> out<00:02:24.610> white

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
going to mix well it is came out white

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.250 
going to mix well it is came out white
and<00:02:25.180> now<00:02:25.240> let's<00:02:25.390> turn<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.720> red<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.080> there's

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
and now let's turn it red so there's

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.920 
and now let's turn it red so there's
probably<00:02:26.590> some<00:02:26.740> kind<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.040> dies<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.610> there<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.660> I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
probably some kind of dies in there so I

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.780 
probably some kind of dies in there so I
mean<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.290> looks<00:02:32.470> like<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:32.770> got<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.220> typical

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
mean it looks like we got a typical

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.790 
mean it looks like we got a typical
amino<00:02:34.060> acid<00:02:34.420> profile<00:02:34.870> with<00:02:35.110> alanine<00:02:35.590> are

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
amino acid profile with alanine are

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.270 
amino acid profile with alanine are
getting<00:02:36.160> started<00:02:37.090> acid<00:02:37.540> glutamic<00:02:38.530> acid<00:02:38.560> you

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
getting started acid glutamic acid you

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.740 
getting started acid glutamic acid you
know<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:39.460> got<00:02:39.550> your<00:02:39.700> just<00:02:40.270> tons<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.630> them

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
know it's got your just tons of them

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.270 
know it's got your just tons of them
there's<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.960> whole<00:02:41.110> list<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.470> them<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:42.160> then

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
there's a whole list of them and then

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.330 
there's a whole list of them and then
you<00:02:42.370> have<00:02:42.550> your<00:02:42.580> bcaa's<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:44.340> 250

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
you have your bcaa's you have 250

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.500 
you have your bcaa's you have 250

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
one to one ratio which is what you kind

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.510 
one to one ratio which is what you kind
of<00:02:55.870> look<00:02:56.020> for<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.530> bc<00:02:56.710> a<00:02:57.010> supplement<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:00.280> let's

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
of look for you bc a supplement so let's

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.520 
of look for you bc a supplement so let's
just<00:03:00.730> see<00:03:00.940> how<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.150> mix<00:03:01.420> is<00:03:01.630> give<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.320> taste

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
just see how this mix is give it a taste

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:11.180 
just see how this mix is give it a taste
and<00:03:02.920> then<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.920> recommendation<00:03:09.930> that's<00:03:10.930> good

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
and then the recommendation that's good

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.530 
and then the recommendation that's good
it<00:03:12.190> reminds<00:03:12.550> me<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:14.040> selfie<00:03:15.040> pores<00:03:15.540> watermelon

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
it reminds me of selfie pores watermelon

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.530 
it reminds me of selfie pores watermelon
vca<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.930> supplement<00:03:17.620> as<00:03:18.100> far<00:03:18.340> as<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.520> flavor<00:03:18.760> so

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
vca a supplement as far as the flavor so

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.850 
vca a supplement as far as the flavor so
if<00:03:19.600> you're<00:03:19.720> familiar<00:03:19.840> with<00:03:20.080> watermelon

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
if you're familiar with watermelon

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.020 
if you're familiar with watermelon
cellucor<00:03:21.280> c4<00:03:21.459> or<00:03:22.450> vca<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:23.040> very<00:03:24.040> very<00:03:24.430> similar<00:03:24.730> i

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
cellucor c4 or vca a very very similar i

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.110 
cellucor c4 or vca a very very similar i
know<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.590> amino<00:03:27.040> last<00:03:27.280> doesn't<00:03:27.760> contain

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
know that the amino last doesn't contain

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.960 
know that the amino last doesn't contain
the<00:03:28.650> central<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:30.070> cell<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.610> chords<00:03:30.880> it

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
the central in that cell you chords it

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.750 
the central in that cell you chords it
up<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.270> this<00:03:31.420> won't<00:03:31.570> give<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.020> that<00:03:32.200> tingle<00:03:32.760> um

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
up so this won't give you that tingle um

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.290 
up so this won't give you that tingle um
but<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.989> amino<00:03:35.470> acid<00:03:35.890> does<00:03:36.010> have<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.430> what

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
but the amino acid does have that what

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.810 
but the amino acid does have that what
is<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.510> called<00:03:37.720> again<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.440> more<00:03:38.680> jacked<00:03:38.950> so

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
is it called again and more jacked so

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.850 
is it called again and more jacked so
that's<00:03:39.970> something<00:03:40.180> different<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:40.810> taste<00:03:41.680> is

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
that's something different so taste is

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.979 
that's something different so taste is
good<00:03:44.700> yeah<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:45.940> mixed<00:03:46.180> really<00:03:46.450> good<00:03:46.600> I

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989

good yeah and it mixed really good I
mean<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.440> have<00:03:47.590> no<00:03:47.890> pillow<00:03:48.610> foam<00:03:48.970> on<00:03:49.180> top<00:03:49.209> is<00:03:49.630> all

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
mean I have no pillow foam on top is all

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.800 
mean I have no pillow foam on top is all
but<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.489> can't<00:03:51.730> really<00:03:51.850> tell<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.360> got<00:03:52.600> no

but I can't really tell I got no

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.460 
but I can't really tell I got no
granules<00:03:53.700> mixed<00:03:54.700> up<00:03:54.820> very<00:03:55.480> well<00:03:55.780> um<00:03:58.050> so<00:03:59.050> yeah<00:03:59.290> I
