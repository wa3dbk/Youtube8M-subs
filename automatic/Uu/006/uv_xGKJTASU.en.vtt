00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
can say how does a drug know just a way

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.550 
can say how does a drug know just a way
to<00:02:45.670> go<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.420> actually<00:02:46.750> have<00:02:46.900> its<00:02:47.020> action<00:02:47.470> on

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
to go to actually have its action on

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.720 
to go to actually have its action on
your<00:02:47.980> sore<00:02:48.280> toe

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
your sore toe

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.160 
your sore toe
that's<00:02:49.090> something<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.750> will<00:02:50.020> develop

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
that's something that we will develop

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.890 
that's something that we will develop
throughout<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.070> series<00:02:51.490> with<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.910> why<00:02:52.840> do

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
throughout the series with it why do

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.260 
throughout the series with it why do
drugs<00:02:53.290> act<00:02:53.590> differently<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.310> some<00:02:54.940> people

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
drugs act differently in some people

than others some of our sessions will

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.220 
than others some of our sessions will

pharmacogenomics and where we have

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.390 
pharmacogenomics and where we have
different<00:03:01.930> genes<00:03:02.110> where<00:03:02.680> some<00:03:02.920> drugs<00:03:03.190> will

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
different genes where some drugs will

for<00:03:05.050> different<00:03:05.170> people<00:03:06.150> drugs<00:03:07.150> can<00:03:07.450> be<00:03:07.480> used

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
for different people drugs can be used

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
the presentations in this series we

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.740 
the presentations in this series we
would<00:03:18.100> really<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:18.490> to<00:03:18.640> use<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> term<00:03:19.120> medicine

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
would really like to use a term medicine

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.110 
would really like to use a term medicine
whenever<00:03:20.530> you're<00:03:20.680> talking<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.220> patient<00:03:21.459> or

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
whenever you're talking to a patient or

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.300 
whenever you're talking to a patient or
resident<00:03:22.720> please<00:03:23.170> talk<00:03:23.440> about<00:03:23.470> use<00:03:24.130> of

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
resident please talk about use of

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.610 
resident please talk about use of
medicine<00:03:24.790> rather<00:03:25.120> than<00:03:25.360> drug<00:03:25.780> drugs<00:03:26.380> have

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
medicine rather than drug drugs have

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.070 
medicine rather than drug drugs have
connotations<00:03:27.400> of<00:03:27.580> illicit<00:03:28.150> items<00:03:28.840> and

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
connotations of illicit items and

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.410 
connotations of illicit items and
probably<00:03:29.709> not<00:03:29.830> as<00:03:30.040> positive<00:03:30.280> for<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:31.000> person

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
probably not as positive for the person

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.470 
probably not as positive for the person
so<00:03:32.140> with<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.160> we<00:03:33.489> might<00:03:33.670> also<00:03:33.850> explore

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
so with that we might also explore

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.020 
so with that we might also explore
terminology<00:03:35.470> we'll<00:03:36.010> talk<00:03:36.190> about<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.580> person

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
terminology we'll talk about the person

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.729 
terminology we'll talk about the person
that<00:03:37.150> we're<00:03:37.270> actually<00:03:37.450> looking<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.500> treat

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
that we're actually looking to treat

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.770 
that we're actually looking to treat
they<00:03:39.400> are<00:03:39.459> not<00:03:39.640> asthmatic<00:03:40.239> they're<00:03:40.600> not

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
they are not asthmatic they're not

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.320 
they are not asthmatic they're not
diabetic<00:03:41.170> they're<00:03:41.800> not<00:03:41.980> hypertensive<00:03:42.790> they

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
diabetic they're not hypertensive they

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.170 
diabetic they're not hypertensive they
are<00:03:43.450> people<00:03:43.840> people<00:03:44.500> with<00:03:44.800> asthma<00:03:45.180> people

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
are people people with asthma people

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.690 
are people people with asthma people
with<00:03:46.300> diabetes<00:03:46.650> people<00:03:47.650> with<00:03:48.070> hypertension

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
with diabetes people with hypertension

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.060 
with diabetes people with hypertension
so<00:03:49.570> please<00:03:49.840> let's<00:03:50.260> try<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.800> do<00:03:50.920> that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
so please let's try and do that

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.890 
so please let's try and do that
occasionally<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:51.880> all<00:03:52.000> might<00:03:52.209> slip<00:03:52.510> up<00:03:52.690> but

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
occasionally we all might slip up but

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.290 
occasionally we all might slip up but
generally<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:53.920> looking<00:03:54.489> at<00:03:54.700> patient

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
generally it's looking at patient

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:06.039 
generally it's looking at patient
friendly<00:03:55.660> terms

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.929 

so<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.200> Australia<00:04:07.709> we<00:04:08.129> have<00:04:08.310> many<00:04:08.549> drug

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
so in Australia we have many drug

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.449 
so in Australia we have many drug

of good manufacturing process you might

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.150 
of good manufacturing process you might
look<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> look<00:04:19.049> at<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.229> website<00:04:19.680> it's
