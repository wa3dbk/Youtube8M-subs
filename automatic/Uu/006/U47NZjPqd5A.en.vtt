perfectly<00:03:59.930> acceptable<00:04:00.400> tabletop<00:04:01.400> standard<00:04:01.760> I

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
perfectly acceptable tabletop standard I

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.900 
perfectly acceptable tabletop standard I
thing<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.889> there<00:04:03.889> I<00:04:04.190> do<00:04:04.340> explain<00:04:04.760> the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
thing and there I do explain the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.650 
thing and there I do explain the
shortcuts<00:04:05.389> you<00:04:05.480> can<00:04:05.510> take<00:04:05.810> throughout<00:04:07.660> and

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
shortcuts you can take throughout and

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.759 
shortcuts you can take throughout and
it's<00:04:08.720> just<00:04:08.959> you<00:04:09.139> know<00:04:09.200> it's<00:04:09.290> quite<00:04:09.590> relaxing

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
it's just you know it's quite relaxing

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.110 
it's just you know it's quite relaxing
and<00:04:10.340> like<00:04:10.970> say<00:04:11.239> I<00:04:11.269> think<00:04:11.509> this<00:04:11.720> too

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
and like say I think this too

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.809 
and like say I think this too
is<00:04:12.209> what<00:04:12.569> 45<00:04:13.470> hours<00:04:13.950> between<00:04:14.220> four<00:04:14.580> and<00:04:14.610> five

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
is what 45 hours between four and five

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.390 
is what 45 hours between four and five
hours<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.659> but<00:04:15.930> where<00:04:16.440> did<00:04:16.650> maybe<00:04:16.889> we're<00:04:17.190> going

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
hours so but where did maybe we're going

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.710 
hours so but where did maybe we're going
quite<00:04:17.639> certain<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.269> then<00:04:18.419> you're<00:04:18.540> going<00:04:18.660> to

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
quite certain and then you're going to

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.120 
quite certain and then you're going to
be<00:04:18.810> sitting<00:04:18.900> quietly<00:04:19.049> presumably<00:04:19.949> what

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
be sitting quietly presumably what

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.379 
be sitting quietly presumably what
should<00:04:20.280> tell<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:20.609> ground<00:04:21.030> or<00:04:21.150> listen<00:04:21.359> to

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
should tell you that ground or listen to

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.840 
should tell you that ground or listen to
the<00:04:21.540> radio<00:04:21.690> or<00:04:22.049> whatever<00:04:22.229> so<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.310> should<00:04:23.820> be

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
the radio or whatever so you should be

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.430 
the radio or whatever so you should be
able<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.240> get<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.389> major<00:04:24.600> of<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:25.080> this

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
able to get a major of this this

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.370 
able to get a major of this this
standard<00:04:25.919> or<00:04:26.070> better<00:04:26.310> within<00:04:26.880> two<00:04:27.449> one<00:04:28.199> thing

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
standard or better within two one thing

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.870 
standard or better within two one thing
WebSockets<00:04:28.919> two<00:04:29.070> or<00:04:29.190> three<00:04:29.340> hours<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.699> say

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
WebSockets two or three hours I say

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.490 
WebSockets two or three hours I say
would<00:04:30.030> be<00:04:30.180> probably<00:04:30.419> about<00:04:30.570> right<00:04:30.810> here<00:04:31.080> so

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
would be probably about right here so

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.230 
would be probably about right here so
that<00:04:31.770> means<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.510> force<00:04:33.860> inside<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.919> month

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
that means a force inside a month

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.939 
that means a force inside a month
certainly<00:04:36.240> 500<00:04:36.960> points<00:04:37.110> or<00:04:37.290> less<00:04:37.320> at<00:04:37.590> say<00:04:37.710> two

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
certainly 500 points or less at say two

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.340 
certainly 500 points or less at say two
or<00:04:37.979> three<00:04:38.220> weeks<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.639> yeah<00:04:39.180> definitely<00:04:39.690> so<00:04:40.110> I

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
or three weeks in yeah definitely so I
