pineapple<00:00:04.410> guava<00:00:04.710> don't<00:00:05.490> know<00:00:05.580> if<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.790> said

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.090 
pineapple guava don't know if I said

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.329 
pineapple guava don't know if I said
that<00:00:06.270> exactly<00:00:06.750> right<00:00:07.080> but<00:00:07.350> pineapple<00:00:08.099> guava

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:08.339 
that exactly right but pineapple guava

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.280 
that exactly right but pineapple guava
is<00:00:08.580> what<00:00:08.820> we<00:00:08.969> all<00:00:09.089> know<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.509> one<00:00:09.570> buy<00:00:09.959> and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
is what we all know this one buy and

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.949 
is what we all know this one buy and
it's<00:00:10.980> an<00:00:11.160> evergreen<00:00:11.400> shrub<00:00:11.610> it's<00:00:12.299> Hardy<00:00:12.719> down

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
it's an evergreen shrub it's Hardy down

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.670 
it's an evergreen shrub it's Hardy down
to<00:00:13.259> around<00:00:13.379> zero<00:00:13.860> degrees<00:00:14.490> Fahrenheit<00:00:14.570> and

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
to around zero degrees Fahrenheit and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.410 
to around zero degrees Fahrenheit and
can<00:00:16.680> take<00:00:16.860> a<00:00:16.920> lot<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.220> heat<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.730> well<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.390> can

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
can take a lot of heat as well so it can

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.180 
can take a lot of heat as well so it can
handle<00:00:18.900> hot<00:00:19.110> inland<00:00:19.590> valleys<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:21.080> it's<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.590> so

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
handle hot inland valleys and it's in so

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.160 
handle hot inland valleys and it's in so
I'm<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> Northern<00:00:23.820> California<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.720> also<00:00:24.870> I've

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
I'm in Northern California and also I've

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.930 
I'm in Northern California and also I've
seen<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.530> in<00:00:25.770> Southern<00:00:26.100> California<00:00:26.850> it's

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
seen this in Southern California it's

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.110 
seen this in Southern California it's
used<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> large<00:00:27.720> shrub<00:00:28.200> and<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.820> group

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.120 
used as a large shrub and the group

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.820 
used as a large shrub and the group
you're<00:00:30.360> seeing<00:00:30.690> here<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.440> reasons

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you're seeing here one of the reasons

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.299 
you're seeing here one of the reasons
I'm<00:00:32.039> showing<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.879> because<00:00:33.480> I'm<00:00:34.079> not<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.769> huge

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
I'm showing it is because I'm not a huge

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.849 
I'm showing it is because I'm not a huge
fan<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:37.679> there's

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
fan of this because I think there's

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.430 
fan of this because I think there's
other<00:00:38.039> plants<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.789> a<00:00:38.879> landscape<00:00:39.440> situation

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
other plants in a landscape situation

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.389 
other plants in a landscape situation
that<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.190> use<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:41.999> more<00:00:42.359> controlled<00:00:42.809> size

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
that I can use a more controlled size

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.819 
that I can use a more controlled size
for<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.429> plant<00:00:45.260> we'll<00:00:46.260> get<00:00:46.409> to<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.679> other

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
for a plant we'll get to the other

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.919 
for a plant we'll get to the other
benefits<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.999> can<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.659> it<00:00:48.780> has

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
benefits but you can see that it has

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.099 
benefits but you can see that it has
some<00:00:49.100> irregularity<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.609> has<00:00:51.019> kind<00:00:52.019> of

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
some irregularity to it it has kind of

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.989 
some irregularity to it it has kind of
holes<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.679> the<00:00:52.800> bottom<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.460> throughout<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
holes in the bottom and throughout the

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.579 
holes in the bottom and throughout the
plant<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.550> for<00:00:56.550> me<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.629> hard<00:00:57.960> plant<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
plant and so for me it's a hard plant in

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.969 
plant and so for me it's a hard plant in
it<00:00:58.859> from<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> design<00:00:59.639> perspective<00:01:00.289> to<00:01:01.289> use<00:01:01.679> and

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
it from a design perspective to use and

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.990 
it from a design perspective to use and
to<00:01:02.280> predict<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:03.179> will<00:01:03.899> happen<00:01:04.259> with<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
to predict what will happen with it and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.060 
to predict what will happen with it and
this<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.240> about<00:01:06.540> designing<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.380> plants<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
this is about designing with plants and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.800 
this is about designing with plants and
so<00:01:08.310> that's<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.820> why<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.119> wanted<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.570> show

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so that's really why I wanted to show

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.609 
so that's really why I wanted to show
this<00:01:10.079> particular<00:01:10.320> example<00:01:11.299> because<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:13.350> does

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
this particular example because it does

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
this particular example because it does
have<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> fair<00:01:14.189> amount<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.549> irregularity<00:01:15.420> if

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
have a fair amount of irregularity if

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.130 
have a fair amount of irregularity if
you<00:01:15.869> want<00:01:16.079> to<00:01:16.170> dense<00:01:17.060> uniform<00:01:18.060> shrub<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you want to dense uniform shrub this is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.490 
you want to dense uniform shrub this is
not<00:01:19.469> one<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.340> would<00:01:20.610> recommend<00:01:20.969> for<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
not one that I would recommend for that

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.830 
not one that I would recommend for that
so<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.640> close-up<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> fruit

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so you can see a close-up of the fruit

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.010 
so you can see a close-up of the fruit
here<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.619> young<00:01:25.920> fruit<00:01:26.310> taken<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.020> early

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
here this is young fruit taken in early

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.940 
here this is young fruit taken in early
summer<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.149> these<00:01:30.149> tend<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> set<00:01:31.320> their<00:01:31.560> fruit

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
summer and these tend to set their fruit

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.639 
summer and these tend to set their fruit
in<00:01:32.219> late<00:01:32.549> spring<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.289> also<00:01:34.289> look<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
in late spring and also look at the

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.670 
in late spring and also look at the
leaves<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.490> leaves<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:36.149> this<00:01:36.390> greenish<00:01:36.930> kind

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
leaves the leaves are this greenish kind

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.039 
leaves the leaves are this greenish kind
of<00:01:37.799> medium<00:01:38.189> green<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.359> underside

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
of medium green and then the underside

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.099 
of medium green and then the underside
of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.409> leaves<00:01:40.649> is<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> gray<00:01:41.640> color<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.780> see

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
of the leaves is a gray color so see

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:44.660 
of the leaves is a gray color so see
some<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.560> backs<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> leaves<00:01:44.369> they're

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
some of the backs of the leaves they're

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.469 
some of the backs of the leaves they're
flipped<00:01:45.000> over<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:47.909> getting

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
flipped over and so get to the getting

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.169 
flipped over and so get to the getting
to<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> fruit<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.380> an<00:01:49.560> edible<00:01:49.829> fruit<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
to the fruit it's an edible fruit and

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.149 
to the fruit it's an edible fruit and
actually<00:01:51.719> the<00:01:51.899> flower<00:01:52.140> petals<00:01:52.679> are<00:01:52.859> edible

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
actually the flower petals are edible

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.279 
actually the flower petals are edible
hum<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> remember<00:01:54.329> learning<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.990> plant

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
hum I remember learning that in plant

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.139 
hum I remember learning that in plant
class<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.039> was<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.520> only<00:01:56.609> time<00:01:56.999> I

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
class and that was the only time I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.880 
class and that was the only time I
remember<00:01:57.570> them<00:01:57.719> talking<00:01:57.929> about<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.859> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
remember them talking about that on a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.639 
remember them talking about that on a
shrub<00:01:59.310> certainly<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.929> can<00:02:01.079> also<00:02:01.229> see

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
shrub certainly and you can also see

five feet high and white so if you're

five feet high and white so if you're
using<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.640> as<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.620> informal<00:03:05.620> shrub<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.280> would

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
using this as a informal shrub I would

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.670 
using this as a informal shrub I would
recommend<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:07.510> plant<00:03:07.870> these<00:03:08.110> kind<00:03:08.590> of

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
recommend that you plant these kind of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.830 
recommend that you plant these kind of
six<00:03:09.040> feet<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:09.490> center<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.600> get<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
six feet on center so that you get a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.260 
six feet on center so that you get a
decent<00:03:11.380> amount<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.770> infill<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:13.060> ones

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
decent amount of infill and the ones

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.870 
decent amount of infill and the ones
you're<00:03:13.450> looking<00:03:13.810> at<00:03:13.960> here<00:03:14.260> are<00:03:14.410> anywhere<00:03:14.830> from

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
you're looking at here are anywhere from

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.740 
you're looking at here are anywhere from
four<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:15.910> seven<00:03:16.750> or<00:03:17.050> eight<00:03:17.140> feet<00:03:17.440> high<00:03:17.740> and

four to seven or eight feet high and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.530 
four to seven or eight feet high and
again<00:03:19.750> kind<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.260> irregular<00:03:20.890> here<00:03:21.220> but<00:03:21.850> that's

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
again kind of irregular here but that's

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.360 
again kind of irregular here but that's
not<00:03:22.810> bad<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.110> mean<00:03:23.440> if<00:03:23.560> you're<00:03:23.709> knowing<00:03:24.040> what

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
not bad I mean if you're knowing what

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.130 
not bad I mean if you're knowing what
you're<00:03:24.520> getting<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.240> you're<00:03:25.330> using<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.810> as<00:03:25.990> an

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
you're getting and you're using it as an

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.250 
you're getting and you're using it as an
informal<00:03:26.860> kind<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.360> barrier<00:03:28.360> plant<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.050> think

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
informal kind of barrier plant I think

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.730 
informal kind of barrier plant I think
it<00:03:29.410> works<00:03:29.650> for<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:30.690> not<00:03:31.690> deer<00:03:32.020> resistant<00:03:32.620> as

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
it works for that not deer resistant as

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.040 
it works for that not deer resistant as
far<00:03:32.980> as<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.370> know<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:34.060> if<00:03:34.300> you're<00:03:34.450> using<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:35.020> for

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
far as I know and if you're using it for

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.560 
far as I know and if you're using it for
fruit<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:35.980> fairly<00:03:36.250> drought<00:03:36.640> tolerant<00:03:37.300> once

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
fruit it's fairly drought tolerant once

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.540 
fruit it's fairly drought tolerant once
it's<00:03:37.750> established<00:03:37.959> but<00:03:38.680> if<00:03:38.860> you're<00:03:39.010> using<00:03:39.280> it

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
it's established but if you're using it

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.130 
it's established but if you're using it
for<00:03:39.580> fruit<00:03:40.060> then<00:03:40.300> you<00:03:40.420> want<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:40.660> give<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.959> more

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
for fruit then you want to give it more

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.070 
for fruit then you want to give it more
regular<00:03:41.680> water<00:03:42.090> that's<00:03:43.090> what<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.390> can<00:03:43.660> tell<00:03:43.930> you
