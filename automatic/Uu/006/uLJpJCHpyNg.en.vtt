00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.740
 Use of two three fours 567 as 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.440
 sedan convertible cabriolet suv gt coupe or 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.450
 as well as here as gran coupÃ© on the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.549
 bmw bazaar, there is apparently nothing 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.230
 it does not exist 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.109
 Slowly it gets really tight between 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.330
 three limousines touring gt and four 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 Coupe somehow just squeezes itself 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.710
 still this vehicle here the new one 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.439
 four-wheeled coupe and tangible like 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.660
 consistently bmw every little gap 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.610
 tough inside the model pallets 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 to drive so precisely get that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.469
 actually somehow only the Munich 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.059
 down 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.160
 There's still a litter left 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.899
 a vision of a version the only one 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.399
 question that arises is you want that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.960
 you really need that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.840
 Actually, it has been a four 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.820
 Gran Coupe Nobody really misses that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.680
 True though it was like that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.910
 top class gran coupe and that is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.469
 hit like a bomb 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.780
 significantly more than half of all 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.899
 sold six in 2013 were 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.520
 four-door coupes the success should now 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.710
 go in the middle class 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.840
 the four-wheeled gran coupe is probably the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.519
 most beautiful threesome flat with narrow 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.650
 window strip stretched and slid 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.650
 Of course always in coupe with a hack 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.850
 to melt away 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.500
 but who wants to be beautiful, must 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.390
 known to suffer at least that applies 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.259
 for the riders in the fund it becomes 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.689
 really tight 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.090
 legroom and headroom well actually 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.700
 One should speak of angel's head there 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.710
 more than getting used to, though 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.490
 imperceptibly more than the four 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.689
 coupe in numbers 112 mm 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.780
 officially one speaks at the four-star gran 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.430
 coupÃ© of a 4 + 1 seater though that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.189
 naked theory is or 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.450
 marketing blabla 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.909
 Nevertheless, the Gran CoupÃ© is in contrast 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.280
 for two-door four, a relatively high 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.350
 They are getting pretty big everyday 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.090
 loading flap opens as standard 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 button pressure automatically and gives the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.850
 look at 480 liters of bin free the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.609
 seats can be folded down 40 20 40 and 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.649
 make a total of 1300 liters possible 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.570
 otherwise valuable materials best 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.149
 the cockpit is with the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.049
 4q ps identical 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.420
 the same applies to the variety of 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.920
 assistant and infotainment five 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.230
 There will be various drives at the beginning 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.720
 for the chic four-door give four 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.680
 four-cylinder of which two gasoline 420 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.160
 and the 428 and two diesel the 418 de 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.830
 and the 420 de crowns the palette 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.830
 with a straight-six the 435th 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.120
 there are indeed for the four-wheeler Gran coupe 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.250
 an optional sports package but on 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.140
 unfortunately you have to have a correct m version 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.760
 God will wait in vain what will become 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.440
 Now I think so too 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.989
 thought a pity but out of sight 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.510
 Of course, bmw does it all relatively 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.220
 much sense because the distance to the m3 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.900
 limousine we end so low that 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.239
 you almost have to be afraid that I am 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.459
 nobody decides anymore for the 3 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.260
 Nevertheless, you have to enjoy driving in the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.489
 four-wheeled gran coupe do not give up and 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.510
 you do not even need the big one 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.900
 six cylinder 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.549
 here we drive the 428 ii with 2 146 ps 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.310
 and that develops its maximum 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.130
 torque of 350 newton meters already 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.959
 at 1250 rpm can even be 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.959
 turn up to six and a half 1000 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.150
 Moreover, it harmonises wonderfully with the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.090
 optional eight-speed automatic that works 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.340
 like a clockwork faster spontaneous 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.079
 start a silky smooth run great 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.810
 joy of rotation and a wonderful 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.760
 honoriger sounded the same as you get it from 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.299
 bmw expected and as it actually is 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.799
 already know about the four- coupÃ© 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.810
 the four-wheeler Gran coupe drives a lot 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.160
 Precise is finely balanced and 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.370
 high needle directing the surgical direct 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.169
 the 428 is 245 hp and has one 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.220
 maximum torque of 350 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.560
 newton meters 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.270
 the top speed is 250 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.980
 km h 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.190
 and in six seconds fast that gran 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.180
 coupe at 100 later in the year will be the 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:59.760
 range still at 14 30 d 1 435 dx drive 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.560
 and further four-wheel version extends it 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.150
 is again as often as in the true 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.710
 live as long as you do not know 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.600
 you do not miss it then you get 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.740
 it rubbed really nice under the nose 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.310
 and then you really want it 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.230
 to have 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.150
 so it is with this car here 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.220
 actually one can say is the four 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.580
 Gran coupe the best yet best 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.560
 three 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.030
 It combines everyday life in the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.650
 according to almost as much 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.020
 storage space as in the 3er touring with the 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.250
 elegance of a coupe and then it is 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.800
 not really expensive at least 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.990
 in the base, bmw demands for the gran 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.030
 coupe exactly on the last cent as well 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.710
 much as for the coupe that means 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.360
 just below christ, here are two 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.680
 Do you have doors behind you ? 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.970
 which today already still well 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.440
 maybe when teleshopping 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.600
 because you always get something on top 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.090
 but that does not look so elegant and long 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.610
 chic as here of usefull times 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.080
 not to mention 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.790
 But teleshopping has one for that 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.010
 Advantage you usually get there 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.020
 really cheap prices should 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.550
 you do not hope for the four-wheeled Gran Coupe 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.920
 the basic model costs 35 1750 euro the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.840
 428 including a sports package 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.440
 and eight-speed automatic was already included 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.650
 over 60,000 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.650
 and
