00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
borderline of legally legal back then

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.430 
borderline of legally legal back then
and<00:03:11.760> they<00:03:12.510> said<00:03:12.659> all<00:03:12.780> well<00:03:12.989> he<00:03:13.079> had<00:03:13.200> another

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
and they said all well he had another

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.080 
and they said all well he had another
product<00:03:13.889> which<00:03:13.980> was<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.190> natural<00:03:14.549> product<00:03:14.730> it

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
product which was a natural product it

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.490 
product which was a natural product it
must<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.299> been<00:03:15.359> mixed<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.840> same<00:03:15.870> vats<00:03:16.319> of

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
must have been mixed in the same vats of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.409 
must have been mixed in the same vats of
the<00:03:16.620> protein<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.609> some<00:03:17.790> residue<00:03:18.150> must<00:03:18.269> say

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
the protein so some residue must say

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.000 
the protein so some residue must say
that's<00:03:18.629> bullshit<00:03:18.989> they<00:03:19.139> spiked<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.620> product

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
that's bullshit they spiked the product

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.379 
that's bullshit they spiked the product
and<00:03:20.459> that's<00:03:20.519> why<00:03:20.699> I<00:03:20.730> was<00:03:20.879> doing<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.180> well<00:03:21.329> and

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
formula didn't have any of that

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.550 
formula didn't have any of that
that<00:04:47.940> supplement<00:04:48.420> in<00:04:48.540> it<00:04:48.660> or<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.810> steroid<00:04:49.440> in

protein enhancement protein synthesized

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.100 
protein enhancement protein synthesized
or<00:04:56.280> muscle<00:04:56.580> synthesizer<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.840> product

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
or muscle synthesizer and the product

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.790 
or muscle synthesizer and the product
didn't<00:04:58.290> work<00:04:58.410> anymore

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800
