a<00:01:23.370> popular<00:01:24.370> misconception<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:26.200> must

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
a popular misconception is that you must

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.800 
a popular misconception is that you must
put<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.680> milk<00:01:27.040> in<00:01:27.280> after<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:27.940> water<00:01:28.210> however

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
put the milk in after the water however

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.170 
put the milk in after the water however
it<00:01:29.650> should<00:01:30.010> be<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.310> other<00:01:30.430> way<00:01:30.520> around

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
it should be the other way around

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.450 
it should be the other way around
because<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.660> water<00:01:31.840> can<00:01:32.229> sculpt<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.979> teabags

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
because the water can sculpt the teabags

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:47.980 
because the water can sculpt the teabags
and<00:01:33.850> then<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.570> won't<00:01:34.750> taste<00:01:35.050> as<00:01:35.260> nice

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.959 

make<00:01:48.990> sure<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.619> pour<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> water<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.549> slowly

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
make sure you pour the water in slowly

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.569

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.270 
down 10 that's too much
of<00:03:04.420> course<00:03:04.750> don't<00:03:05.140> forget<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.709> stir<00:03:05.950> because

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
of course don't forget to stir because

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.709 
of course don't forget to stir because
this<00:03:06.670> will<00:03:06.879> allow<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.150> sugar<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.689> dissolve

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
this will allow the sugar to dissolve

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.569 
this will allow the sugar to dissolve
however<00:03:10.719> don't<00:03:11.469> stir<00:03:11.829> too<00:03:12.040> vigorously

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
however don't stir too vigorously

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.459 
however don't stir too vigorously
because<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.150> can<00:03:13.359> produce<00:03:13.540> back<00:03:13.959> back<00:03:14.230> and

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
because this can produce back back and

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.679 
because this can produce back back and
as<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.709> said<00:03:14.769> earlier<00:03:15.310> that's<00:03:15.670> very<00:03:16.000> painful

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
as I said earlier that's very painful

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.420 
as I said earlier that's very painful
trust<00:03:17.079> me<00:03:17.349> it<00:03:17.530> happens<00:03:17.829> me<00:03:17.980> none<00:03:20.340> after<00:03:21.340> you've

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
trust me it happens me none after you've

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.149 
trust me it happens me none after you've
made<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.700> cup<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.150> tea<00:03:22.329> what<00:03:23.109> next<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:24.010> need

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
made the cup of tea what next you need

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.299 
made the cup of tea what next you need
to<00:03:24.310> drink<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.730> your<00:03:24.879> silly<00:03:25.060> bugger
