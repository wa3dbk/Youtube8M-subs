00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
why do I keep doing this and so I just

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.780 
why do I keep doing this and so I just
rebuilt<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.270> motor<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:44.190> after<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.250> rebuilt<00:03:45.670> it

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
rebuilt the motor and after I rebuilt it

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
rebuilt the motor and after I rebuilt it
I<00:03:45.910> rebuilt<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.510> stock<00:03:46.780> specs<00:03:47.220> myself<00:03:48.220> and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
I rebuilt it to stock specs myself and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.840 
I rebuilt it to stock specs myself and
and<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.530> didn't<00:03:50.770> have<00:03:50.890> enough<00:03:50.920> power<00:03:51.130> for<00:03:51.700> me

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
and it didn't have enough power for me

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.510 
and it didn't have enough power for me
and<00:03:52.060> so<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.870> eventually<00:03:53.200> ended<00:03:53.770> up<00:03:53.860> taking<00:03:54.370> off

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
and so I eventually ended up taking off

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.479 
and so I eventually ended up taking off
just<00:03:54.880> just<00:03:55.750> basically<00:03:56.290> gutting<00:03:56.739> it<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:56.950> I

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
just just basically gutting it and I

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.160 
just just basically gutting it and I
shaved<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.090> head<00:03:58.270> five<00:03:58.540> thousands

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
shaved the head five thousands

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.170 
shaved the head five thousands
readjusted<00:03:59.800> cam<00:04:00.040> timing<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.640> don't<00:04:00.880> remember

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
readjusted cam timing I don't remember

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.699 
readjusted cam timing I don't remember
how<00:04:01.390> many<00:04:01.450> degrees<00:04:01.780> off<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.349> went

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
how many degrees off I went

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.920 
how many degrees off I went
