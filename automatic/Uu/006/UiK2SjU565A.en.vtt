00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:10.380
 so well now tell you again about them 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:16.430
 the fourth namely this new feature 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:20.789
 which appeared this management skp to 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.580
 almost like 1 art drone but the function is more 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.980
 extended 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.570
 but also more effective as on my point 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.300
 view for this we need 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:39.540
 battery and connect ps4 through the unit 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.820
 3dr power is this god it feeds the module 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.620
 protects electricity from surges here 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.629
 same connected 3d radio 915 megahertz this 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.579
 version 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.719
 bald shtatovskaya because to europe 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.129
 There is a 400 world whole version in this 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.640
 case 915 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.710
 so here we have a translation button connected 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:09.510
 a boozer is connected to standby mode and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:12.229
 the expander channel is connected so well 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.670
 now in order to run 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:21.210
 Fully px4 on the phone we connect 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.920
 the second part of the 3d radio is seen from the 3d radio 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.390
 new there are two connectors there is a connector 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.390
 telemetry which connects to 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.770
 module 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.360
 autopilot and usbi connector in this case 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:44.450
 we connect usb connector and connect to 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.740
 ordinary mini micro usb and phone 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 the program starts right away 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.140
 started up 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.689
 as requested analyzed that the dove 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.869
 the system is not connected we just have it 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.000
 connected 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.590
 disconnected and defined all parameters 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.829
 if I move now 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.569
 visible on the screen what happens movement 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.430
 that is, determines the compass turn 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:16.650
 determines the accelerometer angles of the gyroscope and 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.890
 Everything works as we see a phone with ps4 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.650
 there is no cable beating 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.170
 there is nothing no wifi 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.790
 in this case is now connected to the lips 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:34.230
 Rashka that is, you can turn it off 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.099
 we disconnect it all connections which 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.989
 we don't have 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.890
 the connection works as it is 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.810
 switch to activation mode 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.230
 took off first you need to set the height 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.060
 Now change the height, that is, this is 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.850
 the height we want to raise 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:00.750
 capture well let's say we give him ten 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:02.760
 meters ok and translate mode arm asks 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.200
 transfer to standby that is, we need 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.359
 hold the button and hold it all 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.450
 caught fire means the copter is essentially ready 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.450
 take off and put in arm mode 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.319
 Here in this case now if it were 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.099
 regulators and motors are connected to motors 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.329
 run at minimum speed and 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.819
 the copter would start to rise 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.769
 then we catch harassing well 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.019
 accordingly, he saw that no 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.370
 there is no action so the most translated in 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:42.220
 disarmament mode which modes we have 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.269
 there is seeking stabilization mode 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.500
 altitude hold gps 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:53.590
 and height return home 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.180
 circling on a point on the environment on. this 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.430
 more for gliders 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.290
 and airplanes of different holding positions then 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.730
 there are actually settings here that are very 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.430
 a lot of them can do everything for themselves 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.409
 The main difference of this device is there from 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.829
 the same competitor there is not jai 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:17.620
 in the fact that everything is configured here 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.769
 everywhere we have access completely 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.530
 multipoint 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:28.889
 we can go to the flight tab 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:36.130
 task and here is completely rebuild 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:38.199
 flight point here let's say this was set 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.310
 several points we can generally point 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:45.630
 draw that is in order not to 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:50.470
 create them and just test 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.870
 clear click once drow and now 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.789
 draw the route of the copter and she 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.460
 automatic already puts points 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.460
 every point we can edit 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.050
 altitude flight speed action points 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.659
 can connect sergo 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.360
 and program separately on 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:10.490
 what actions 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.370
 but in principle, everything is further as assembly 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.370
 I will tell you to show thanks
