00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.679 

hi<00:00:01.079> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.350> my<00:00:01.620> tutorial<00:00:02.340> on<00:00:02.580> camera<00:00:03.270> mapping

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
hi this is my tutorial on camera mapping

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.379 
hi this is my tutorial on camera mapping
in<00:00:03.899> cinema<00:00:04.799> 4d<00:00:06.109> first<00:00:07.109> we<00:00:07.529> will<00:00:07.890> take<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.700> sky

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
in cinema 4d first we will take a sky

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.079 
in cinema 4d first we will take a sky
object<00:00:10.370> then<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.969> floor<00:00:12.599> object<00:00:13.670> move<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.849> down

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
object then a floor object move it down

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.510 
object then a floor object move it down
a<00:00:15.120> wee<00:00:15.450> bit<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.379> need<00:00:16.590> two<00:00:16.920> cameras<00:00:17.490> one

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
a wee bit and we need two cameras one

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.450 
a wee bit and we need two cameras one
camera<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:19.109> doing<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> mapping<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.250> one

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
camera for doing the mapping and one

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.210 
camera for doing the mapping and one
camera<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.119> rendering<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.080> name<00:00:22.470> one<00:00:22.710> camera

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
camera for rendering so name one camera

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.759 
camera for rendering so name one camera
render<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:26.369> other<00:00:26.580> camera<00:00:27.769> projection

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
render and the other camera projection

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.459 
render and the other camera projection
and<00:00:30.890> then<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.009> need<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.340> material<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:34.050> we'll

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
and then we need a material so we'll

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.970 
and then we need a material so we'll
create<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:35.070> material<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:38.149> in<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.980> luminance

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
create a material and in the luminance

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560 
create a material and in the luminance
channel<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.520> could<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> color<00:00:42.180> channel

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
channel it could be in the color channel

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.060 
channel it could be in the color channel
as<00:00:42.719> well<00:00:43.250> you<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.460> your<00:00:44.760> still<00:00:45.510> photo<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.800> map

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
as well you get your still photo to map

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.220 
as well you get your still photo to map
and<00:00:49.399> then<00:00:50.399> apply<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.840> both<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> sky<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and then apply it to both the sky and

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.869 
and then apply it to both the sky and
the<00:00:55.230> floor<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:57.559> then<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.010> look<00:00:59.039> down<00:00:59.370> here

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the floor and then if we look down here

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.100 
the floor and then if we look down here
at<00:01:00.149> our<00:01:00.359> mapping<00:01:00.600> options<00:01:01.489> we<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:03.510> projection

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
at our mapping options we the projection

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.429 
at our mapping options we the projection
will<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.379> camera<00:01:04.830> mapping<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.020> we'll<00:01:07.020> use<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
will be camera mapping and we'll use the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.980 
will be camera mapping and we'll use the
projection<00:01:08.010> cameras<00:01:08.580> lot<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.360> click

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
projection cameras lot in there click

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.920 
projection cameras lot in there click
calculate<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:12.180> calculates<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
calculate and it calculates the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.249 
calculate and it calculates the
projection<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.390> camera<00:01:15.390> mapping<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> same

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
projection and camera mapping the same

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.550 
projection and camera mapping the same
deal<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:18.439> camera<00:01:19.490> calculate<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.290> then<00:01:22.290> if

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
deal here camera calculate and then if

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.990 
deal here camera calculate and then if
we<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:22.770> through<00:01:23.250> our<00:01:24.380> render<00:01:25.380> camera<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.249 

animate<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.210> properties<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> render

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
animate the properties of the render

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.760 
animate the properties of the render
camera<00:01:32.240> then<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.259> matches

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
camera then you can see it all matches

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.550 
camera then you can see it all matches
up<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.460> really<00:01:35.759> well<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:37.259> means

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
up really really well and this means

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.359 
up really really well and this means
then<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.040> course<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.119> drop<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:40.369> our

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
then of course that we can drop in our

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.050 
then of course that we can drop in our
3d<00:01:41.909> objects<00:01:42.920> if<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.130> move<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.340> floor<00:01:44.700> up<00:01:44.880> your

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
3d objects if we move the floor up your

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.960 
3d objects if we move the floor up your
elders<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.720> how<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.280> works<00:01:47.280> better<00:01:47.640> there

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
elders see how this works better there

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.270 
elders see how this works better there
we<00:01:48.060> go<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.170> animate<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.740> render

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
we go and so you can animate your render

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.360 
we go and so you can animate your render
camera

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.500 

and<00:01:57.320> there<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.410> go<00:01:59.030> camera<00:02:00.030> mapping<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
and there we go camera mapping and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.050 
and there we go camera mapping and
cinema<00:02:00.840> 4d
