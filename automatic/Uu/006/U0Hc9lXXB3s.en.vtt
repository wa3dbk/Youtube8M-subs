00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and that wasn't good enough for me the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.920 
and that wasn't good enough for me the
photos<00:02:12.030> would<00:02:12.150> move

the then just the pages themselves would

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.940 
the then just the pages themselves would
cut<00:02:15.540> back<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.049> quality<00:02:16.439> of<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> images
