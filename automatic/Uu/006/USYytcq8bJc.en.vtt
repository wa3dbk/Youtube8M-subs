off on so I've already started I'm gonna
start<00:00:43.170> at<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> repeat<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> yarn

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
start at the repeat so with the yarn

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.880 
start at the repeat so with the yarn
over<00:00:45.809> again<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:47.160> pattern<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.760> yarn<00:00:48.530> yarn<00:00:49.530> over

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
over again the pattern is yarn yarn over

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.250 
over again the pattern is yarn yarn over
as<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> purl<00:00:50.430> slip<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> purl<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
as if to purl slip one as if to purl and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.619 
as if to purl slip one as if to purl and
knit<00:00:52.469> two<00:00:52.620> together<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.250> within<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.390> you

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
knit two together so within that you

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.760 
knit two together so within that you
have<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.989> bind<00:00:55.199> off

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770

you<00:02:33.750> won't<00:02:33.900> find<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.500> good<00:02:34.680> area<00:02:34.860> unless<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.490> go

the<00:02:38.190> edge<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.370> possible<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.200> edge<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the edge as possible so this edge is the

best you can see it kind of flops over
and<00:02:44.280> down<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.730> pick<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.150> up<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.520> very

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and down you can pick it up so it's very

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.790 
and down you can pick it up so it's very

49 stitches this is the tricky part and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.590 
49 stitches this is the tricky part and
picking<00:04:40.340> up<00:04:40.430> stitches<00:04:40.730> sometimes<00:04:41.390> you'll

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
picking up stitches sometimes you'll

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.390 
picking up stitches sometimes you'll
have<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:43.150> undo<00:04:44.150> what<00:04:44.360> you<00:04:44.540> did<00:04:44.890> give<00:04:45.890> yourself

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
have to undo what you did give yourself

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.000 
have to undo what you did give yourself
maybe<00:04:46.730> one<00:04:47.030> space<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:47.960> keep<00:04:48.290> going<00:04:48.530> in<00:04:48.830> order

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
maybe one space and keep going in order

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.600 
maybe one space and keep going in order
to<00:04:49.100> get<00:04:49.220> exactly<00:04:49.580> 49<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.510> edge<00:04:51.460> it's<00:04:52.460> just

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
to get exactly 49 to the edge it's just

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.310 
to get exactly 49 to the edge it's just
trial<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:53.000> error<00:04:53.150> that's<00:04:53.450> that's<00:04:53.990> just<00:04:54.050> how

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
trial and error that's that's just how

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.550 
trial and error that's that's just how
you<00:04:54.800> have<00:04:54.920> to<00:04:55.070> do<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.630> want<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:57.050> pretty

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
you have to do it you you want a pretty

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.920 
you have to do it you you want a pretty
close<00:04:57.860> spacing<00:04:58.550> like<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.390> you<00:04:59.750> should

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
close spacing like this and you should

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.010 
close spacing like this and you should
get<00:05:00.080> 49<00:05:00.470> if<00:05:00.920> you<00:05:01.520> have<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:02.120> take<00:05:02.450> one<00:05:02.690> or<00:05:02.840> two

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
get 49 if you have to take one or two

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.620 
get 49 if you have to take one or two
out<00:05:03.200> you<00:05:03.500> know<00:05:03.620> it's<00:05:04.160> it's<00:05:04.460> not<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.910> hard<00:05:05.270> you

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
out you know it's it's not that hard you

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.130 
out you know it's it's not that hard you
can<00:05:05.990> always<00:05:06.230> actually<00:05:06.590> just<00:05:07.040> do<00:05:07.250> this<00:05:07.870> pop<00:05:08.870> one

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
can always actually just do this pop one

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.070 
can always actually just do this pop one
out<00:05:09.760> put<00:05:10.760> this<00:05:10.880> one<00:05:11.120> back<00:05:11.270> in<00:05:11.570> and<00:05:11.840> then

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
out put this one back in and then

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.200 
out put this one back in and then
tighten<00:05:12.320> up<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.710> stitches<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:15.580> again<00:05:16.580> it's

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
tighten up the stitches and again it's

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.550 
tighten up the stitches and again it's
very<00:05:17.300> important<00:05:17.810> to<00:05:17.870> start<00:05:18.080> in<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.320> left

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
very important to start in the left

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.510 
very important to start in the left
image<00:05:18.800> in<00:05:19.960> so<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:21.230> can<00:05:21.500> connect<00:05:22.250> your

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
image in so that you can connect your

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.120 
image in so that you can connect your
first<00:05:23.060> row<00:05:23.360> in<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.600> round<00:05:23.960> if<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:24.590> start

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
first row in the round if you start

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.920 
first row in the round if you start
anywhere<00:05:25.550> else<00:05:25.700> or<00:05:26.030> if<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:26.210> start<00:05:26.660> all<00:05:26.810> the

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
anywhere else or if you start all the
