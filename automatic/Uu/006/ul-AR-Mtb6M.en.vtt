and<00:00:45.329> some<00:00:46.820> little<00:00:47.820> debates<00:00:48.149> going<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.629> every

now and then about what's right and

now and then about what's right and
what's<00:00:50.399> wrong<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.700> what's<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.210> best<00:00:51.450> of

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
what's wrong and what's the best of

what's not the best and again as far as

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.369 
what's not the best and again as far as
I'm<00:00:53.879> concerned<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.020> put<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
I'm concerned it is you know put the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
I'm concerned it is you know put the
language<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:56.070> side<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> tools

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
language to one side it's use the tools

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.170 
language to one side it's use the tools
that<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.170> available<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.059> from<00:01:00.059> my

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that are available to you and from my

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.939 
that are available to you and from my
viewpoint<00:01:00.449> an<00:01:00.840> action<00:01:01.170> indicator<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
viewpoint an action indicator is a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.500 
viewpoint an action indicator is a
pressure<00:01:02.280> release<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.760> pressure<00:01:02.910> releases<00:01:03.390> an

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
pressure release of pressure releases an

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.779 
pressure release of pressure releases an
action<00:01:03.809> indicator<00:01:04.259> something's<00:01:05.220> happened<00:01:05.640> on

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
action indicator something's happened on

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.020 
action indicator something's happened on
the<00:01:05.940> ground<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:07.310> something's<00:01:08.310> changed<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the ground and something's changed and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
the ground and something's changed and
you've<00:01:09.479> got<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.810> indication<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.470> that's

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you've got an indication that that's

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.649 
you've got an indication that that's
changed<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.270> caused<00:01:12.479> by

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
changed and that can be caused by

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.000 
changed and that can be caused by
pressure<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> ground<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> track

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
pressure on the ground in the track

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
pressure on the ground in the track
which<00:01:14.670> gives<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> an<00:01:15.119> indication<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
which gives you an indication of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.980 
which gives you an indication of
direction<00:01:16.260> change<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.950> or<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.630> stopping<00:01:18.630> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
direction change or or a stopping you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.929 
direction change or or a stopping you
know<00:01:19.110> somebody<00:01:19.409> stop<00:01:19.710> him<00:01:19.830> from<00:01:19.979> running<00:01:20.580> or

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
know somebody stop him from running or

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.310 
know somebody stop him from running or
walking<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.509> whatever<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.939> you<00:01:23.939> know<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.750> i

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
walking or whatever so you know it's i

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.890 
walking or whatever so you know it's i
often<00:01:26.189> find<00:01:26.369> people<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.090> caught<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.720> these

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
often find people get caught up in these

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.249 
often find people get caught up in these
words<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.030> from<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.210> viewpoint<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.990> about

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
words and from my viewpoint it's about

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.530 
words and from my viewpoint it's about
setting<00:01:31.830> your<00:01:31.979> belief<00:01:32.369> system<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.180> side

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
setting your belief system to one side

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.510 
setting your belief system to one side
whatever<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.079> might<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.369> like

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
whatever that might be and you know like

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.640 
whatever that might be and you know like
what<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.090> causes<00:01:36.509> why<00:01:37.110> would<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> want<00:01:37.590> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
what I go on causes why would I want to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
what I go on causes why would I want to
deny<00:01:37.799> myself<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.400> opportunity<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.240> learn

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.950 
deny myself the opportunity to learn
something<00:01:40.320> new<00:01:40.369> which<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.880> take<00:01:42.180> away<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
something new which I then take away and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.420 
something new which I then take away and
if<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.200> sits<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.770> me<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.820> like

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
if it sits with me and I like

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.890 
if it sits with me and I like
okay<00:01:47.430> I'll<00:01:47.970> work<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.300> that<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.780> I'll

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
okay I'll work with that and I'll

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.510 
okay I'll work with that and I'll
