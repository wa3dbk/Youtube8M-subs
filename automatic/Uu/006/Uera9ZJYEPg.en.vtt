00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
not set up right or this kind of thing

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.709 
not set up right or this kind of thing
started<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.239> happen

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
started to happen

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.420 
started to happen
I<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:37.050> bike<00:00:37.230> fits<00:00:37.500> important<00:00:38.010> because<00:00:38.129> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I think bike fits important because it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430 
I think bike fits important because it
adds<00:00:38.550> comfort<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> ride<00:00:39.510> you'll

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
adds comfort to the ride you'll

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.229 
adds comfort to the ride you'll
certainly<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.890> more<00:00:41.190> efficient<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.059> bike

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
certainly be more efficient on the bike

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.060 
certainly be more efficient on the bike
over<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> period<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.140> time

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
over a period of time

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.389 
over a period of time
it<00:00:44.309> often<00:00:44.610> ups<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.539> power<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.559> someone<00:00:47.160> can

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
it often ups the power so someone can

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.240 
it often ups the power so someone can
maybe<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.300> ride<00:00:48.780> faster<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.680> longer<00:00:50.039> which

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
maybe just ride faster for longer which

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.000 
maybe just ride faster for longer which
is<00:00:50.430> great<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.879> big<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.020> course<00:00:52.050> also<00:00:52.770> is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
is great a big one of course also is

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.729 
is great a big one of course also is
injury<00:00:53.579> prevention<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:55.140> lot<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.350> people

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
injury prevention and a lot of people

coming on and a proper bike fit can

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.549 
coming on and a proper bike fit can

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
warmed up a little bit get them settling

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.380 
warmed up a little bit get them settling
into<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> saddle<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
into the saddle a little bit and it's a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.240 
into the saddle a little bit and it's a
great<00:01:54.600> time<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.320> learn<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> lot<00:01:55.860> about<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
great time to really learn a lot about a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.069 
great time to really learn a lot about a
cyclist<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.479> now<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> looks<00:01:57.869> like

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
cyclist and right now it looks like

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.709 
cyclist and right now it looks like
we've<00:01:58.380> got<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> pretty<00:01:58.860> long<00:01:59.159> stem<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
we've got a pretty long stem and a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.709 
we've got a pretty long stem and a
pretty<00:02:00.990> long<00:02:01.680> handlebar<00:02:02.490> front<00:02:02.850> end<00:02:03.000> setup<00:02:03.509> so

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
pretty long handlebar front end setup so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.690 
pretty long handlebar front end setup so
what<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.290> often<00:02:04.469> refer<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> bike<00:02:05.520> as

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
what we often refer to on the bike as

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
what we often refer to on the bike as
the<00:02:05.850> cockpit<00:02:06.390> looks<00:02:06.630> pretty<00:02:06.899> long<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.860> can

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the cockpit looks pretty long you can

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.770 
the cockpit looks pretty long you can
see<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.399> point<00:02:08.640> over<00:02:08.879> all<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> way<00:02:09.539> over<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
see this point over all the way over to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.449 
see this point over all the way over to
here<00:02:09.899> Paul<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.860> put<00:02:10.979> your<00:02:11.069> hands<00:02:11.340> out

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
here Paul if you can put your hands out

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.030 
here Paul if you can put your hands out
on<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> hoods<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:11.970> me

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
on the hoods for me

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.610 
on the hoods for me
rolling<00:02:13.909> shoulders<00:02:14.450> straight<00:02:14.959> arms<00:02:15.290> coming

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
rolling shoulders straight arms coming

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.530 
rolling shoulders straight arms coming
right<00:02:15.799> down<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.069> bit<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.519> diving<00:02:16.790> wrist<00:02:17.239> here

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
right down a bit of a diving wrist here

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.300 
right down a bit of a diving wrist here
so<00:02:18.019> we're<00:02:18.230> really<00:02:18.439> gonna<00:02:18.590> be<00:02:18.769> able<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.010> do<00:02:19.129> some

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
so we're really gonna be able to do some

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.009 
so we're really gonna be able to do some
great<00:02:19.519> work<00:02:19.579> on<00:02:19.939> the<00:02:20.090> front<00:02:20.299> end<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.750> there

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
great work on the front end if there

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.170 
great work on the front end if there
were<00:02:21.170> three<00:02:21.349> things<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.890> are<00:02:22.370> really

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
were three things that are really

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.690 
were three things that are really
critical<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.840> think<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.530> rider<00:02:24.920> you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
critical I think for a rider you

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.509 
critical I think for a rider you
certainly<00:02:26.269> want<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.569> have<00:02:26.629> your<00:02:26.989> seat<00:02:27.349> set<00:02:28.310> at

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
certainly want to have your seat set at

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.399 
certainly want to have your seat set at
the<00:02:28.700> right<00:02:28.879> position<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.989> know<00:02:30.109> if<00:02:30.260> it's

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
the right position it you know if it's

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.830 
the right position it you know if it's
too<00:02:30.650> low<00:02:30.859> or<00:02:30.890> too<00:02:31.459> far<00:02:31.700> back<00:02:31.760> that's<00:02:32.420> just<00:02:32.689> not

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
too low or too far back that's just not

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.020 
too low or too far back that's just not
going<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.049> work<00:02:33.260> for<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.769> think<00:02:34.430> handlebar

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
going to work for you I think handlebar

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.059 
going to work for you I think handlebar
adjustment<00:02:35.599> is<00:02:35.689> another<00:02:35.930> critical<00:02:36.530> area<00:02:36.859> that

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
adjustment is another critical area that

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.399 
adjustment is another critical area that
you<00:02:37.340> want<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.819> be<00:02:37.939> set<00:02:38.209> up<00:02:38.359> it's<00:02:38.810> it's<00:02:39.170> one

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
you want it to be set up it's it's one

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.789 
you want it to be set up it's it's one
of<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> contact<00:02:40.189> points<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.599> again<00:02:42.019> anywhere

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
of the contact points and again anywhere

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.399 
of the contact points and again anywhere
that<00:02:43.159> we're<00:02:43.310> contacting<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:44.450> bike<00:02:44.659> that's

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
that we're contacting the bike that's

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.199 
that we're contacting the bike that's
where<00:02:45.680> we<00:02:45.799> need<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:45.980> really<00:02:46.310> set<00:02:46.579> up<00:02:46.730> well<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
where we need it really set up well the

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.159 
where we need it really set up well the
third<00:02:47.480> one<00:02:47.750> would<00:02:48.200> be<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.799> pedals<00:02:50.169> regardless

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.169 
third one would be the pedals regardless

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.659 
third one would be the pedals regardless
of<00:02:51.349> whether<00:02:51.500> you're<00:02:51.680> riding<00:02:51.829> a<00:02:52.040> flat<00:02:52.280> pedal

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
of whether you're riding a flat pedal

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.280 
of whether you're riding a flat pedal
that<00:02:52.790> you're<00:02:52.879> not<00:02:53.030> clicked<00:02:53.359> into<00:02:53.780> or<00:02:54.049> whether

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
that you're not clicked into or whether

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.619 
that you're not clicked into or whether
you're<00:02:54.500> using<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.980> clipless<00:02:55.849> system<00:02:56.419> where<00:02:56.540> you

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
you're using a clipless system where you

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.259 
you're using a clipless system where you
are<00:02:56.810> clicking<00:02:57.109> in<00:02:57.379> then<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.819> would<00:02:59.000> be<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
are clicking in then that would be the

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.879 
are clicking in then that would be the
third<00:02:59.510> area<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.930> we<00:03:00.169> really<00:03:00.200> want<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.739> focus

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
third area that we really want to focus

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.970 
third area that we really want to focus
on<00:03:01.189> for<00:03:01.430> fit<00:03:01.639> leg<00:03:02.540> extension<00:03:03.169> is<00:03:03.290> really<00:03:03.950> a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
on for fit leg extension is really a

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.099 
on for fit leg extension is really a
critical<00:03:04.310> component<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.090> bike<00:03:05.689> fit<00:03:05.930> and

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
critical component to bike fit and

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.470 
critical component to bike fit and
cycling<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.709> general<00:03:07.099> if<00:03:07.310> you're<00:03:07.849> getting<00:03:08.239> too

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
cycling in general if you're getting too

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.750 
cycling in general if you're getting too
much<00:03:08.659> leg<00:03:08.989> extension<00:03:09.650> you're<00:03:10.099> losing<00:03:10.549> power

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
much leg extension you're losing power

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.460 
much leg extension you're losing power
and<00:03:11.120> you're<00:03:11.239> reaching<00:03:11.629> out<00:03:11.959> too<00:03:12.169> much<00:03:12.290> if

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
and you're reaching out too much if

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.470 
and you're reaching out too much if
you're<00:03:12.620> getting<00:03:12.889> too<00:03:13.129> little<00:03:13.609> if<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.239> legs

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
you're getting too little if the legs

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.030 
you're getting too little if the legs
are<00:03:14.629> distant<00:03:15.049> they're<00:03:15.139> not<00:03:15.379> being<00:03:15.650> able<00:03:15.859> to

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
are distant they're not being able to

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.589 
are distant they're not being able to
stretch<00:03:16.280> out<00:03:16.459> as<00:03:16.609> much<00:03:16.730> once<00:03:17.060> again<00:03:17.209> you're

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
stretch out as much once again you're

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.729 
stretch out as much once again you're
losing<00:03:17.989> power<00:03:18.229> and<00:03:18.379> you're<00:03:18.560> losing

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
losing power and you're losing

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.759 
losing power and you're losing
efficiency<00:03:19.159> so<00:03:19.729> it<00:03:20.329> really<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.319> important

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
efficiency so it really is so important

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.649 
efficiency so it really is so important
to<00:03:21.859> have<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.489> seats<00:03:22.940> set<00:03:23.269> at<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.510> right

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
to have the seats set at the right

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.949 
to have the seats set at the right
height<00:03:24.069> upper<00:03:25.069> body<00:03:25.310> positioning<00:03:25.970> is<00:03:26.120> just<00:03:26.810> as

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
height upper body positioning is just as

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.629 
height upper body positioning is just as
important<00:03:27.440> as<00:03:27.530> lower<00:03:27.739> body<00:03:28.040> positioning

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
important as lower body positioning
