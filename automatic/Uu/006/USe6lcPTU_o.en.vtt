around here
it<00:06:32.379> would<00:06:32.589> be<00:06:32.770> ideal<00:06:33.129> to<00:06:33.189> find<00:06:33.580> a<00:06:33.699> place<00:06:33.879> that

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909 
it would be ideal to find a place that

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.850 
it would be ideal to find a place that
has<00:06:34.449> all<00:06:34.779> the<00:06:34.899> footage<00:06:35.259> from<00:06:35.379> all<00:06:35.740> the

has all the footage from all the
security<00:06:36.339> cameras<00:06:36.669> but<00:06:37.120> I'm<00:06:37.360> not<00:06:37.659> really<00:06:37.899> sure

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
security cameras but I'm not really sure

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.499 
security cameras but I'm not really sure
where<00:06:38.439> that<00:06:38.680> would<00:06:38.889> be<00:06:38.919> located<00:06:39.580> I<00:06:39.729> figured<00:06:40.270> if

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:40.509 
where that would be located I figured if

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:42.809 
where that would be located I figured if
we<00:06:40.870> took<00:06:41.139> down<00:06:41.379> the<00:06:41.860> security<00:06:42.219> cameras

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
we took down the security cameras

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.879 
we took down the security cameras
maybe<00:06:43.419> we<00:06:43.719> could<00:06:43.870> find<00:06:44.110> some<00:06:44.319> footage<00:06:44.860> that

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
maybe we could find some footage that

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.510 
maybe we could find some footage that
would<00:06:45.310> help<00:06:46.149> us<00:06:46.560> like<00:06:47.560> help<00:06:48.009> us<00:06:48.159> figure<00:06:48.370> out

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
would help us like help us figure out

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.659 
would help us like help us figure out
who<00:06:48.939> the<00:06:49.240> murderer<00:06:49.479> is<00:06:49.810> oh<00:06:50.289> well<00:06:53.339> we<00:06:54.339> should

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
who the murderer is oh well we should

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.700 
who the murderer is oh well we should
probably<00:06:54.839> figure<00:06:55.839> out<00:06:55.899> where<00:06:56.199> that's<00:06:56.409> coming

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.119 
probably figure out where that's coming
from

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.129 
from

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.649
