850<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.310> world<00:00:20.880> first<00:00:21.180> from<00:00:21.539> Toshiba

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
850 so this is world first from Toshiba

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.410 
850 so this is world first from Toshiba
last<00:00:22.320> Syria<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> cost<00:00:22.949> me<00:00:23.100> about<00:00:23.160> 750<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.300> he

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
last Syria the cost me about 750 so he

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.700 
last Syria the cost me about 750 so he
brought<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> technology<00:00:24.900> down<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
brought the technology down to the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.740 
brought the technology down to the
satellite<00:00:26.070> series<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.330> centered

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
satellite series so this centered

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.179 
satellite series so this centered
entertainment<00:00:28.529> notebook<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.949> screen

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
entertainment notebook is screen

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.550

so this is perfect notebook for them so

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.330 
so this is perfect notebook for them so
yeah<00:00:43.350> basically<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.040> two

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
yeah basically there are two

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.310 
yeah basically there are two
technologies<00:00:44.940> they<00:00:45.090> were<00:00:45.210> talking<00:00:45.480> about<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
technologies they were talking about the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.220 
technologies they were talking about the
special<00:00:46.620> panel<00:00:47.210> there<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
special panel there is there was a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.069 
special panel there is there was a
special<00:00:49.530> panel<00:00:49.680> another<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.079> webcam

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
special panel another one is the webcam

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.560 
special panel another one is the webcam
so<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.370> webcam<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> ordinary

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
so this webcam is not like the ordinary

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.420 
so this webcam is not like the ordinary
webcam<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.890> actually<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> face

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
webcam so this is actually a face

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.189 
webcam so this is actually a face
tracking<00:00:56.670> webcam<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.660> these<00:00:57.809> two

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
tracking webcam so these two

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.770 
tracking webcam so these two
technologies<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.129> webcam<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.030> also<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
technologies the webcam and also the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.330 
technologies the webcam and also the
panel<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.230> achieve<00:01:01.469> enables<00:01:02.250> this

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
panel that achieve enables this

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.740 
panel that achieve enables this
glasses-free<00:01:02.820> 3d<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.799> basically

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
glasses-free 3d so it's basically

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.390 
glasses-free 3d so it's basically
detecting<00:01:06.750> UI<00:01:06.930> Nikora<00:01:07.409> during<00:01:07.650> zone<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
detecting UI Nikora during zone the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.280 
detecting UI Nikora during zone the
viewing<00:01:08.640> zone<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.939> around<00:01:09.150> 1<00:01:09.330> meter<00:01:09.450> maximum

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
viewing zone is around 1 meter maximum

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.890 
viewing zone is around 1 meter maximum
one<00:01:10.530> meter<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.010> once<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.150> detect<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> UN

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
one meter so once they detect the UN

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
one meter so once they detect the UN
correct<00:01:13.260> viewing<00:01:13.470> zone<00:01:13.650> then<00:01:14.369> automatically

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
correct viewing zone then automatically

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.080 
correct viewing zone then automatically
switch<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.799> truly<00:01:17.000> simple

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
switch to truly simple

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.850 
switch to truly simple
just<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:20.210> it's<00:01:20.720> some<00:01:21.020> special<00:01:21.200> panel<00:01:21.740> as

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
just that it's some special panel as

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.290 
just that it's some special panel as
well<00:01:22.010> so<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.400> see<00:01:22.550> it's<00:01:22.700> politically

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
well so you see it's politically

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.160 
well so you see it's politically
dependent<00:01:23.870> compared<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.320> normal<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.770> do

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
dependent compared to the normal to do

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.230 
dependent compared to the normal to do
the<00:01:27.490> similarity<00:01:28.490> wise<00:01:28.670> what<00:01:28.880> did<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.090> general

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
the similarity wise what did the general
