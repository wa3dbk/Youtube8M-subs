00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 and what are the real numbers at 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.770
 long history several mathematicians 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.380
 have developed emotions and ideas about 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.400
 the numbers that have allowed 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.620
 organize them within what today 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.590
 we know as real numbers 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.470
 a part of these real numbers are 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.410
 the natural numbers considered as 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.600
 those that serve to tell others 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.840
 are used to express relationships 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.240
 like half of this bread or the three 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.220
 voting rooms 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.890
 these numbers are called 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.960
 rational the natural numbers and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 rationals were already part of the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.510
 Mathematical knowledge shared by 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.660
 the Greek and Egyptian Persians during the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 5th century before Christ - in this same 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.420
 time 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.850
 Pythagoras to observe that the length of 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 the diagonal of a simple square does not 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.830
 could be measured with numbers 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.930
 natural or rational however the 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.230
 diagonal existed and should have a number 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.830
 that he lived what was this number in 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.820
 this moment there was no Euclid 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.700
 who about the year 300 before Christ 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.530
 changed the notion of the Pythagorean number and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.020
 then there was already a number that measured the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.800
 diagonal of the square the square root 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.680
 from 2 to this number he called it irrational 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.810
 also at this time they were shown 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.200
 that the ratio between length and 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.460
 diameter of a circumference 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.270
 regardless of his schedule was 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.210
 always the same was constant incorporated 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.310
 then the number pi 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.550
 the ancient Egyptians and then the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.180
 Arab and Hindu Greeks found 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.780
 approximate values for pi 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.040
 approximately 3.14 16 now we know 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.020
 that this is also an irrational number 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.810
 advancing on the timeline at ends 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.280
 of the first millennium after Christ did not 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.580
 there were numbers that expressed the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.120
 notions of debt deficit or under the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.550
 sea ​​level little by little it was brewing 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.090
 the need to invent a new class 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.370
 of numbers to present those notions 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.980
 so the negative numbers that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.340
 by joining them with the natives they grouped 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.120
 the set of whole numbers 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.730
 in the 16th and 17th centuries the development of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.190
 the algebraic equations of third and 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.890
 fourth grade led the introduction of 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.040
 three kinds of numbers the numbers 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.140
 algebraic is to say those that are 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.920
 root of an algebraic equation with 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.049
 whole coefficients the transcendent or 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.799
 numbers that are not root of an equation 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.819
 algebraic with integer coefficients and 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.849
 the imaginary 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.800
 that is, the numbers corresponding to 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.350
 the square root of a negative number 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.480
 the imaginary however never 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.180
 they were part of the numbers that now 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.630
 real calls but together with them 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.840
 they were integrated to the complex numbers 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.550
 well well into the middle of the 19th century the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.340
 panorama of the numbers that now 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.000
 we know how real could be seen more or 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.090
 less so at that time the Germans 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.430
 georg so richard eric kim and cardwell 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.470
 they are formulated independently 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.170
 proposals for the systematization of 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.240
 numbers between the consequences 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.880
 important proposals highlighted the 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.590
 creation of set theory and the 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.840
 modern axiomatic method 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.150
 according to the axiomatic method 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.280
 any statement made about 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.680
 the mathematical concepts are 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.569
 propositions that are divided into two 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.939
 classes axioms and theorems 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.489
 the axioms denounce the properties 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:54.129
 fundamentals of those concepts and not 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.650
 Theorems are proved too 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.020
 they denounce properties but they are reduced to 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.720
 from the axioms 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.390
 the axiomatic formulation of numbers 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.640
 they have put order to the conglomerate of 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.230
 numbers that have been appearing 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.560
 inventing itself throughout evolution 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.530
 of mathematics grouping those within 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.900
 the real numbers under this conception 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.170
 we can say that the real numbers 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.390
 they are concepts that are subject axioms 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.960
 from which they are deduced 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.960
 theorems
