00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.160
 with 8 hours of this welcome to this no 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.500
 and to the truth I already lost the account that stepped 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.590
 gave is is creating teams of last in 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.790
 this time we're going on the team a 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.279
 4-2-3-1 of the series is cheap if you remove 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.829
 here the link and shout I'm going to put a 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.300
 moment and get good but the truth 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.160
 is that it is an impressive speed in 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.920
 front 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.550
 we have the speed in front of your 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.200
 last team then we will have the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.970
 best pictures in each position for 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.280
 this formation truth that is what I 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.680
 use is practically the equipment that 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.309
 use which I have that record with the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.309
 old matches 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.630
 this and then if it would be 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.860
 will be the most important thing is to have 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.780
 speed in the most creative ways 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.300
 get good contentions that attack 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.490
 and defend and have a good 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.140
 forward that is fast depends if you 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.449
 like to be quick if you like it to be 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.590
 auctioneer happens in the goal we have 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.450
 to stekelenburg 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.350
 I like the very tall goalies that are 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.950
 very high as 198 I think it has 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.950
 reflexes 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.870
 good saturate then to be a goalkeeper 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.000
 we have a bonus one side has 80 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.980
 speed that most want a central that 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.520
 ine the other side once now 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.950
 same the best central in all the fifa 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.990
 be guided would decide on the left side and 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.910
 to the bulay with the right side the two 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.370
 with the attribution of quality speed 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.960
 offensive working means than ever 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.950
 it comes out in the drive and we can keep 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.440
 line of four 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.440
 We are a boateng that can change it 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.210
 for roger and not marine life quingeo for 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.430
 which will be cheaper and no other 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.660
 side we have arturo vial the 200 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.280
 understands high offensive work and 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.350
 high defensive work television 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.330
 then it will serve us well for 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.580
 attack and defend muriel by the a 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.479
 right neighborhoods on the left side in 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.930
 the center its have ibarbo 92 speed 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.600
 85 dribble for a thousand last coins 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.899
 in what they love most and we have alexandre 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.599
 part opposite let's add 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.060
 where is the one who want 4-2-3-1 if not 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.370
 they want to go if they do not want to add it to 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.230
 save contracts because we were also going 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.220
 to the first match here we are going against a 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.569
 premier team in 4 3 2 1 is very 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.769
 interesting this training as because 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.689
 if they meet with very formations 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.510
 centralized the two contentions it 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:34.000
 they go and destroy the game and you can 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.500
 attack very well by the bands and has 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.680
 pretty good team the truth has 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.290
 agÃ¼ero hazard walcott arteta fellaini 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.970
 miller vermaelen diaby luis johnson by 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.970
 the other side no longer think that we 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.560
 why 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.349
 then the idea is to le des square 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.549
 defensive with the teams and 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.650
 counterattack on the sides with the 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.230
 fast strikers is mainly 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.250
 as well as how it is 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.080
 they are more effective with this 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.330
 training as you can see there very 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.049
 difficult to pass the defense and we have a lot 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.379
 attack version 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.750
 ibarbo and mud surprisingly good 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.879
 I really did not think it was that good and 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.120
 boateng 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.120
 have 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.690
 we have actions in front of 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.380
 then I will not trust and go to 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.050
 play something defensive careful 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.150
 although it was like 2 in the morning 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.220
 from 3 in the morning was playing and is 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.560
 they are dying of sleep and no more to 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.420
 record it more for you to record that 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.880
 the stupidity edition an error in the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.300
 out and now is when the ace 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.709
 is playing disgust will make up and I do not know 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.959
 why is it with the central one he drops the 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.320
 You see magical rebound has fixed magnet 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.900
 and it hits me this one is ok minute 12 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.170
 we can recover we're going to see 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.580
 that we're going to get ahead we're going to give it 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.030
 the return to the scoreboard to what we want 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.260
 but if there is I do not know why because I wanted to 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.069
 to do is to be a killing and I do not know the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.829
 truth is he had many dreams 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.090
 pain and achieved the estu excluding 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.180
 quite 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.030
 the outside as of saleh vargas a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.389
 Dodge and 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.860
 I was ibarbo and barbarian earns enough 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.540
 head those corner shots wherever 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.840
 it wins quite surprised me the truth 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.570
 back there 12 with alexandre embargo 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.860
 duck and I do not know why he did not come in I do not know 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.169
 why did not enter 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.780
 They did not want back but I was pretty 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.590
 I was pretty much more and I was not 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.909
 we went to 145 so I could not tie the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.669
 I was really there and I arrived, I can not 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:50.370
 I could not start to see the mud speed 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.930
 awesome with I wanted to enter but not 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.689
 he also defended well defended very well 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.949
 the truth but you had to tie and 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:59.510
 there were many who had had stolen the 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.820
 ball balance between duck vargas 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.380
 In the fault failure there is a possibility to put 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.740
 natale if you have the money instead of 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:11.050
 vargas and that is the corner shot was already 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:14.430
 hour and mud headbutton and bar 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.430
 I do not know where he plays but 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.240
 but 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.490
 you counted play accounts for 900 900 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.389
 last currencies and in error in the 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.389
 exit won the ball 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.419
 90 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.490
 and the arrears turned the score 2-1 behind me 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.560
 I love this way because it gives you a 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.509
 defensive security and thermal blue without 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.410
 that I receive with this training is the 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.930
 what I like the most 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.650
 it's over the party had the last the 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.270
 there 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.270
 clear the game 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.120
 it would be all for this episode I will upload 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.960
 more videos this week for the match and 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.960
 barbosa we're going
