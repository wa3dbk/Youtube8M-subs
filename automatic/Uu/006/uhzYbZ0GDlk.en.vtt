 strong snowstorm winds in the snow for both 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.710

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.960
 the snowstorm began 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.450
 Yes, and the sun went down at zero 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.420
 the appearance of Ksenia Kasatkina herself 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.240
 their dogs climbed to pass it 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.840
 there was some kind of moral test 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.780
 I'm at the top of a sudden when we go 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.120

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.440
 started a sharp sharp float my 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.640
 old values 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.330
 my former lifestyle and there when it was 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.350
 cold somehow suddenly wanted to live 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.490
 I wanted to go forward 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.840
 where so 3 passes 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.600
 I already understood that the dog needs to be removed and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.460
 walk because I thought next 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.890
 bottom distance 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.720
 which 2 times more in such 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.490
 expeditions the main thing is harmonious 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.030
 team work and whatever happens 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.490
 always remember not to give up your club 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.860
 by joint efforts the team was brought up 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.600
 where in the snowbound old road 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.920

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.870
 Well, so my place under the tent had 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.330
 additionally dig up but still 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.770
 there is not enough space and a decision is made 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.230
 remove one section 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.930
 turned gas heaters stove 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.110
 started the generator conducted a dog inspection 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:32.830
 and briefly discussing the transition went to bed to 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:35.870
 Battlefield allows the sun light drifting 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.000
 interesting on the second day penetrating 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.520
 wind and snow were inherent 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.800
 expedition companions having overcome two more 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.680

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.460
 bonfire 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.590
 but all over the morning everyone was warming up in hot 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.260
 thermal water upper Polyansky 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.660
 sources an indescribable feeling 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.260
 freedom and here at this moment I thought 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.780
 that all these torments 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.730
 along with spending the night in a blizzard and all these 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.970
 here's the effort this whole campaign this here 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.730
 this moment it was worth nothing 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.850
 better than 20 degree frost to try 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.160
 hot present borscht for a meal 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.180

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.790
 over bugs 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.709
 Xenia adequately coped with all 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.830
 difficulties and there were a lot of them and how 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.570
 says she learned her lesson a lot 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.160
 Of course you need to learn more 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.460
 practice it I think that in general we 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.290
 we can deal with everything anniversary 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.080

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.780
 except for pounds of excess weight 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.150
 but did not have time to cool snowmobiles oberyn 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.410
