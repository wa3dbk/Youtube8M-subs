00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
exactly does that mean and are we

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.290 
exactly does that mean and are we
speaking<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:37.010> dedicated<00:00:38.010> servers<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> pc

speaking of dedicated servers for the pc

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.229 
speaking of dedicated servers for the pc
version<00:00:39.559> I<00:00:40.559> wasn't<00:00:41.040> speaking<00:00:41.399> particularly

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
version I wasn't speaking particularly

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.400 
version I wasn't speaking particularly
about<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.960> haven't<00:00:43.200> announced

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
about that because we haven't announced

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.900 
about that because we haven't announced
what<00:00:43.710> our<00:00:43.800> dedicated<00:00:44.160> server<00:00:44.460> support<00:00:44.820> will

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
what our dedicated server support will

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.910 
what our dedicated server support will
be<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.300> modern<00:00:45.480> warfare<00:00:45.600> 3<00:00:45.750> yet<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.620> from<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
be for modern warfare 3 yet but from a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
be for modern warfare 3 yet but from a
design<00:00:47.399> philosophy<00:00:48.120> overall<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:48.899> we

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
design philosophy overall because we

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.869 
design philosophy overall because we
can't<00:00:49.200> get<00:00:49.350> into<00:00:49.469> multiplayer<00:00:49.739> details<00:00:50.309> but

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
can't get into multiplayer details but

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.069 
can't get into multiplayer details but
what<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.210> saying<00:00:51.449> was<00:00:51.629> we're<00:00:51.899> really

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
what I was saying was we're really

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.500 
what I was saying was we're really
looking<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.710> how<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.340> build<00:00:53.579> up<00:00:53.789> from<00:00:54.059> you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
looking at how we can build up from you

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.810 
looking at how we can build up from you
know<00:00:54.660> what's<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> core<00:00:55.920> design<00:00:56.340> feeling<00:00:56.699> we

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
know what's the core design feeling we

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
know what's the core design feeling we
want<00:00:57.120> from<00:00:57.329> modern<00:00:57.570> warfare<00:00:57.719> 3<00:00:57.870> multiplayer

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
want from modern warfare 3 multiplayer

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.500 
want from modern warfare 3 multiplayer
and<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.980> lot<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> has<00:00:59.640> been<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.180> back<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
and a lot of it has been going back to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.299 
and a lot of it has been going back to
that<00:01:00.539> very<00:01:00.840> simplistic<00:01:01.410> call<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.070> duty<00:01:02.280> 4

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that very simplistic call of duty 4

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.490 
that very simplistic call of duty 4
style<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.300> when<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> say<00:01:03.510> simplistic<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.320> mean

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
style and when I say simplistic I mean

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.370 
style and when I say simplistic I mean
focus<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.220> fast<00:01:05.760> pace<00:01:06.119> infantry<00:01:06.900> gun<00:01:07.200> on

focus on that fast pace infantry gun on

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.890 
focus on that fast pace infantry gun on
gun<00:01:07.680> combat<00:01:08.310> where<00:01:08.820> modern<00:01:09.000> warfare<00:01:09.270> 3<00:01:09.479> was

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
gun combat where modern warfare 3 was

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.170 
gun combat where modern warfare 3 was
very<00:01:10.140> much<00:01:10.380> heavy<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.040> air<00:01:11.280> support<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
very much heavy on that air support and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
very much heavy on that air support and
relying<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:13.140> these<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.530> features

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
warfare 3 is going back a little bit to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.670 
warfare 3 is going back a little bit to
those<00:01:18.390> basics<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.140> core<00:01:19.380> gameplay

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
those basics of that core gameplay

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.920 
those basics of that core gameplay
mechanic<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.720> your

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
mechanic so it's all about you and your

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.289 
mechanic so it's all about you and your
gun<00:01:22.229> doing<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> great<00:01:22.890> job<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.549> still<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:24.000> kill

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
gun doing a great job we still have kill

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.910 
gun doing a great job we still have kill
streaks<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.930> although<00:01:25.380> we're<00:01:25.560> redesigning

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
streaks and although we're redesigning

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.380 
streaks and although we're redesigning
the<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.610> works<00:01:26.790> which<00:01:27.060> we'll<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.330> into

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the way that works which we'll get into

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.359 
the way that works which we'll get into
detail<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.409> later<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> campaign

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369

for<00:03:45.489> upcoming<00:03:46.489> call<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.060> duty<00:03:47.299> or<00:03:47.390> modern

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
for upcoming call of duty or modern

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.210 
for upcoming call of duty or modern
warfare<00:03:47.810> games<00:03:48.109> well<00:03:48.709> right<00:03:48.890> now<00:03:48.920> we're

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
warfare games well right now we're

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.069 
warfare games well right now we're
completely<00:03:49.820> focused<00:03:50.329> on<00:03:50.450> modern<00:03:50.720> warfare<00:03:50.900> 3

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
completely focused on modern warfare 3

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.530 
completely focused on modern warfare 3
and<00:03:51.590> we've<00:03:51.769> designed<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.730> be<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.120> payoff

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
and we've designed this to be the payoff

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.569 
and we've designed this to be the payoff
for<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:54.320> investment<00:03:54.470> in<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.100> characters

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
for that investment in the characters

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.160 
for that investment in the characters
and<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:55.880> conflict<00:03:56.390> that<00:03:56.540> we<00:03:56.660> started

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
and the conflict that we started

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.440 
and the conflict that we started
building<00:03:57.560> since<00:03:57.829> call<00:03:58.069> duty<00:03:58.280> 4<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.120> this<00:03:59.269> is

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
building since call duty 4 so this is

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.960 
building since call duty 4 so this is
really<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.840> payoff<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.170> those<00:04:00.470> events<00:04:00.970> and

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
really the payoff to those events and

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.509 
really the payoff to those events and
but<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:02.630> would<00:04:02.870> never<00:04:02.959> say<00:04:03.200> it's<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.470> end<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:04.489> I

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
but I would never say it's the end but I

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.849 
but I would never say it's the end but I
mean<00:04:04.850> this<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.329> definitely<00:04:05.359> big<00:04:06.260> moments<00:04:06.739> but

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
mean this is definitely big moments but

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.500 
mean this is definitely big moments but
I<00:04:07.280> don't<00:04:07.640> want<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.850> say<00:04:07.970> anything<00:04:08.180> that<00:04:08.450> could

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510
