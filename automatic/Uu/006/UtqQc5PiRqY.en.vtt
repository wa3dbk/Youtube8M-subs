00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.050 
that's pretty good I did get two pieces
of<00:03:20.260> jewelry<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.890> first<00:03:21.160> one<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.400> got<00:03:21.550> just<00:03:21.970> a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
of jewelry the first one I got just a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.990 
of jewelry the first one I got just a
pair<00:03:22.300> of<00:03:22.540> boots<00:03:23.290> gold<00:03:23.710> hoops<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.190> actually<00:03:24.610> have

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
pair of boots gold hoops I actually have

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.420 
pair of boots gold hoops I actually have
a<00:03:25.180> dress<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.650> just<00:03:26.860> thought<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.010> there<00:03:27.250> was

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
a dress so I just thought that there was

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.310 
a dress so I just thought that there was
something<00:03:27.580> different<00:03:28.210> to<00:03:28.540> wear<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.080> try<00:03:29.290> I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
something different to wear and try I

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.020 
something different to wear and try I
see<00:03:29.740> them<00:03:29.920> on<00:03:30.010> girls<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.370> would<00:03:30.610> when<00:03:30.940> they

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
see them on girls that would when they

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.790 
see them on girls that would when they
make<00:03:31.180> videos<00:03:31.600> I'm<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:31.840> oh<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.290> should<00:03:32.680> get

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
make videos I'm like oh I should get

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.620 
make videos I'm like oh I should get
some<00:03:32.980> hoops<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.400> then<00:03:33.580> of<00:03:34.000> course<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.360> forget

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
some hoops but then of course I forget

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.460 
some hoops but then of course I forget
to<00:03:34.720> look<00:03:34.900> for<00:03:34.960> hoops

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
to look for hoops

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.560 
to look for hoops
so<00:03:35.560> these<00:03:35.770> are<00:03:35.950> only<00:03:35.980> two<00:03:36.400> dollars<00:03:36.610> which<00:03:37.270> is

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
so these are only two dollars which is

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.090 
so these are only two dollars which is
really<00:03:37.960> affordable<00:03:38.170> because<00:03:38.620> I'm<00:03:38.920> pretty

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
really affordable because I'm pretty

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.360 
really affordable because I'm pretty
sure<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.640> shops<00:03:40.510> they<00:03:41.020> would<00:03:41.230> be<00:03:41.410> like<00:03:41.830> minimum

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
sure in shops they would be like minimum

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.440 
sure in shops they would be like minimum
maybe<00:03:43.030> $5<00:03:43.990> to<00:03:44.260> $10<00:03:44.920> then<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.460> got<00:03:45.610> this<00:03:45.730> pendant

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
maybe $5 to $10 then I got this pendant

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.740 
maybe $5 to $10 then I got this pendant
and<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.860> has<00:03:48.490> what<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.090> looks<00:03:49.210> like<00:03:49.360> this<00:03:49.540> and

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
and it has what it looks like this and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.620 
and it has what it looks like this and
it's<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:49.960> on<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:50.470> long<00:03:50.860> chain<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.330> sits

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
it's just on this long chain so it sits

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.430 
it's just on this long chain so it sits
down<00:03:52.990> well<00:03:53.410> for<00:03:53.800> me<00:03:53.950> just<00:03:54.880> at<00:03:55.330> my<00:03:55.540> bust<00:03:55.780> this

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
down well for me just at my bust this

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.380 
down well for me just at my bust this
weight<00:03:56.650> was<00:03:56.830> only<00:03:57.100> four<00:03:57.310> dollars<00:03:57.490> that's<00:03:57.970> I

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
weight was only four dollars that's I

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.540 
weight was only four dollars that's I
just<00:03:59.260> thought<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.470> couldn't<00:03:59.710> go<00:03:59.860> past<00:03:59.890> it<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.430> be

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
just thought I couldn't go past it to be

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.460 
just thought I couldn't go past it to be
honest<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:00.970> I<00:04:01.600> wear<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> lot<00:04:02.020> of<00:04:02.050> gold<00:04:02.290> jewelry

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
honest and I wear a lot of gold jewelry

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.740 
honest and I wear a lot of gold jewelry
so<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.430> figured<00:04:03.970> that<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.120> would<00:04:04.390> go<00:04:04.570> with<00:04:04.720> a

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
so I figured that that would go with a

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.750 
so I figured that that would go with a
lot<00:04:04.960> of<00:04:05.080> things<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.470> don't<00:04:05.740> have<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:05.980> lot<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.310> long

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
lot of things I don't have a lot of long

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.090

with a nice gold belt around the waist
slide<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:37.020> think<00:05:37.590> that<00:05:37.710> would<00:05:37.830> just<00:05:37.860> look<00:05:38.130> so

slide I think that would just look so
pretty<00:05:39.030> I<00:05:39.180> can't<00:05:39.480> wait<00:05:39.630> to<00:05:39.720> try<00:05:39.840> it<00:05:39.930> on<00:05:40.080> so

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
pretty I can't wait to try it on so

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.500 
pretty I can't wait to try it on so
hopefully<00:05:41.040> it's<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.670> could<00:05:41.880> get<00:05:42.030> in<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.240> size

of<00:05:46.980> these<00:05:47.460> shoes<00:05:47.880> and<00:05:48.420> I've<00:05:48.630> just<00:05:48.840> been<00:05:48.960> loving

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
of these shoes and I've just been loving

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.600 
of these shoes and I've just been loving
things<00:05:49.500> with<00:05:49.650> ankle<00:05:50.070> straps<00:05:50.340> I've<00:05:50.460> been

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
things with ankle straps I've been

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.510 
things with ankle straps I've been
obsessed<00:05:51.030> these<00:05:51.420> ones<00:05:51.660> were<00:05:52.370> $17.40

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
obsessed these ones were $17.40

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.130 
obsessed these ones were $17.40
I<00:05:53.580> actually<00:05:53.850> got<00:05:54.120> them<00:05:54.210> in<00:05:54.330> a<00:05:54.360> size<00:05:54.570> three<00:05:54.900> I've

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
I actually got them in a size three I've

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.990 
I actually got them in a size three I've
got<00:05:55.290> a<00:05:55.320> four<00:05:55.620> in<00:05:56.040> some<00:05:56.250> shoes<00:05:56.430> last<00:05:56.700> time<00:05:56.880> and

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
got a four in some shoes last time and

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.090 
got a four in some shoes last time and
that<00:05:57.090> would<00:05:57.150> be<00:05:57.330> too<00:05:57.540> big<00:05:57.750> so<00:05:58.260> I<00:05:58.290> think<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:58.800> three

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
that would be too big so I think a three

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.400 
that would be too big so I think a three
should<00:05:59.370> be<00:05:59.580> fine<00:05:59.850> they<00:06:00.540> have<00:06:00.780> this<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:00.990> black

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
should be fine they have this a black

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.070 
should be fine they have this a black
wedge<00:06:01.680> and<00:06:01.710> then<00:06:02.160> a<00:06:02.190> ten<00:06:02.610> accent<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:03.630> strap

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
wedge and then a ten accent and strap

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.040 
wedge and then a ten accent and strap
and<00:06:04.440> I<00:06:05.160> think<00:06:05.520> this<00:06:05.670> or<00:06:05.940> hopefully<00:06:06.780> I'll<00:06:07.020> be

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
and I think this or hopefully I'll be

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.630

I ordered it on a Wednesday and it came
on<00:07:12.839> a<00:07:12.899> Tuesday<00:07:13.679> so<00:07:14.479> it<00:07:15.479> took<00:07:15.749> less<00:07:16.199> than<00:07:16.259> seven

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:17.129 
on a Tuesday so it took less than seven

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:19.429
