but you know it's it's heavy but also
you<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.000> mean<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> result<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.650> the

great build quality the next con would

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.510 
great build quality the next con would
be<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.670> focus<00:01:27.270> ring<00:01:27.799> now<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> didn't<00:01:29.130> expect

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
be the focus ring now I didn't expect

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.140

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
for the focus ring to shine in the video

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.920 
for the focus ring to shine in the video
area<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.540> mean<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.600> it's<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.720> lens

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
area I mean this is it's a it's a lens

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.530 
area I mean this is it's a it's a lens
meant<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.439> photography<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> obviously<00:01:39.119> more

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
meant for photography and obviously more

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
meant for photography and obviously more
and<00:01:39.659> more<00:01:39.780> people<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.200> shooting<00:01:40.530> videos<00:01:40.890> with

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and more people are shooting videos with

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460 
and more people are shooting videos with
DSLRs<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.630> nothing<00:01:42.960> compared<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
DSLRs but it's nothing compared to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.800 
DSLRs but it's nothing compared to
cinema<00:01:44.280> lens<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.640> could<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> DSLR

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
cinema lens you could use with the DSLR

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.770 
cinema lens you could use with the DSLR
and<00:01:46.579> finally<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.820> being<00:01:48.090> picky<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and finally just being picky with the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.580 
and finally just being picky with the
cons<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:50.960> obviously<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.140> lens<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
cons here obviously this lens is a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.240 
cons here obviously this lens is a
little<00:01:53.299> less<00:01:54.299> sharp<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.110> wide<00:01:55.290> end<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.649> 2.8

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
little less sharp on the wide end a 2.8

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.149 
little less sharp on the wide end a 2.8
but<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.360> doesn't<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.719> matter<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.140> all<00:01:58.229> for

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but it doesn't really matter at all for

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.300 
but it doesn't really matter at all for
the<00:01:59.219> work<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.290> nice<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the work I do and it is really nice to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.709 
the work I do and it is really nice to
have<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:03.740> lower<00:02:04.740> aperture<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:06.030> those<00:02:06.390> lower

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
have that lower aperture for those lower

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.380 
have that lower aperture for those lower
light<00:02:06.960> situations<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.149> really<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
light situations so that's not really a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.720 
light situations so that's not really a
complaint<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.989> an<00:02:10.349> observation<00:02:10.739> oh<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
complaint just an observation oh and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670 
complaint just an observation oh and
also<00:02:12.330> there<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
also there is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.309 
also there is
barrel<00:02:13.980> distortion<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.689> a<00:02:15.750> crap<00:02:15.989> frame

don't<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.299> if<00:02:21.480> barrel<00:02:22.109> distortion<00:02:22.260> changes

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
don't know if barrel distortion changes

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.429 
don't know if barrel distortion changes
when<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> full-frame<00:02:24.359> sensor<00:02:24.780> if<00:02:24.959> you

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
when going to a full-frame sensor if you

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.559 
when going to a full-frame sensor if you
know<00:02:25.560> let<00:02:25.769> me<00:02:25.859> know<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.129> comments<00:02:26.939> but

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
there is slight barrel distortion when

first I love the range it's a really
nice<00:02:40.260> range<00:02:40.650> for<00:02:40.889> the<00:02:40.950> work<00:02:41.099> I<00:02:41.250> do<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.840> most<00:02:42.840> of

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
nice range for the work I do I most of

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.690 
nice range for the work I do I most of
the<00:02:43.019> time<00:02:43.319> I'm<00:02:43.620> doing<00:02:43.739> work<00:02:44.040> for<00:02:44.099> I'm<00:02:44.370> running

the time I'm doing work for I'm running

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.960 
the time I'm doing work for I'm running
around<00:02:44.790> getting<00:02:45.359> different<00:02:45.689> shots<00:02:46.700> not<00:02:47.700> in

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
around getting different shots not in

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.119 
around getting different shots not in
really<00:02:48.180> planned<00:02:48.569> environments<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.439> you<00:02:49.680> know

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
really planned environments so you know

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.339 
really planned environments so you know
I<00:02:50.159> have<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.519> have<00:02:50.639> the<00:02:50.730> flexibility<00:02:51.389> of<00:02:51.540> having

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
I have to have the flexibility of having

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.780 
I have to have the flexibility of having
a<00:02:52.909> lunge<00:02:53.909> and<00:02:54.500> 24<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.620> 70<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.069> great<00:02:56.489> range

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
a lunge and 24 to 70 is a great range

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.569 
a lunge and 24 to 70 is a great range
now<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.090> do<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> craft<00:02:57.780> frame<00:02:58.159> camera<00:02:59.159> Canon

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
now I do have a craft frame camera Canon

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:06.709 
now I do have a craft frame camera Canon
60d<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:01.200> 24<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.769> 70<00:03:02.189> is<00:03:02.340> more<00:03:02.730> like<00:03:04.879> 24<00:03:05.879> 36

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
60d so the 24 to 70 is more like 24 36

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.610 
60d so the 24 to 70 is more like 24 36
to<00:03:07.049> 105<00:03:07.919> I'm<00:03:08.430> correct<00:03:09.169> let<00:03:10.169> me<00:03:10.260> know<00:03:10.379> if<00:03:10.500> I'm

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
to 105 I'm correct let me know if I'm

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.569 
to 105 I'm correct let me know if I'm
not<00:03:10.919> so<00:03:11.549> it's<00:03:11.939> more<00:03:12.299> on<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.659> tele<00:03:13.079> end<00:03:13.430> but<00:03:14.430> on

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
not so it's more on the tele end but on

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.059 
not so it's more on the tele end but on
a<00:03:15.139> full-frame<00:03:16.139> sensor<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.739> would<00:03:16.919> be<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
a full-frame sensor this would be a

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.039 
a full-frame sensor this would be a
great<00:03:17.519> wide-angle<00:03:18.150> lens<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.629> I'm<00:03:18.720> sure<00:03:18.900> you

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
great wide-angle lens and I'm sure you

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.300 
great wide-angle lens and I'm sure you
just<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:19.859> would<00:03:20.010> be<00:03:20.069> an<00:03:20.159> equally<00:03:20.489> great<00:03:20.750> focal

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
just it would be an equally great focal

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.699 
just it would be an equally great focal
length<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.599> also<00:03:24.599> love<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.049> vibration<00:03:25.590> control

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
length I also love the vibration control

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.089 
length I also love the vibration control
it<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.549> it's<00:03:27.449> pretty<00:03:27.930> solid<00:03:28.199> I<00:03:28.470> mean<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.799> don't
