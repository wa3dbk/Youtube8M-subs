00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.619
 my back 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.290
 the center 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.290
 if you like the plague those who speak the bird paul 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.470
 after the excellent experiment done with the 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.599
 before the battle for cybertron 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.430
 high moon studios boys return to 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.060
 work on a new chapter of 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.060
 transformers 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.640
 this time we are struggling with the 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.270
 fall of cybertron title which is recently 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.070
 released on pc playstation 3 and xbox 360 e 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.000
 that follows perfection how much 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.000
 told in the prequel 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.470
 you are lovers of these robottoni that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.260
 they make that characteristic sound 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.640
 for decades now 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.120
 well then this video review is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.120
 all for you 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.920
 developed by high moon studios 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.630
 transformers cybertron fall 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.240
 resumes the plot left pending 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.130
 from the great the war for cybertron the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.870
 previous episode ended with a 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.520
 stalemate between autobots and 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.440
 decepticons on a planet now at 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.180
 terminus and the fall of cybertron 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.920
 starts right when the decepticons 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.660
 led by megatron attack the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.340
 optimus prime buses and while 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.860
 try to abandon their world a 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.300
 board of a huge spaceship the story 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.220
 however, it does begin a few 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.140
 day before and tells the tenacious defense 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.180
 of the rwc of the buses the games of 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.770
 power of the decepticon and the discovery of 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.630
 a space bridge that could lead 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.210
 cyber trojans to our solar system 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.130
 almost every one of the 13 chapters in which it is 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.229
 divided the campaign proposes a point 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.970
 of different view and game strength a 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.970
 different character to play 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.520
 this time the developers have 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.799
 carried out missions based on the robot 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.780
 controlled and not vice versa 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.280
 every transformer is in fact characterized 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.470
 from a special ability that changes 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.880
 drastically the trip jumper gameplay 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.400
 for example it can enter mode 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.800
 stealthy and get rid of enemies with a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.690
 lethal attack behind while jazz e 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.250
 swindle take advantage of a grappling hook that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.900
 allows them to move quickly 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.150
 from one platform to another 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.920
 the idol of the crazy green blocks is 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.750
 protagonist of almost two missions in 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.330
 which is fought with the sword and there it is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.580
 transforms into t rex and the immense bruti cus 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.860
 it is controllable for an exciting whole 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.750
 chapter this new type of structure 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.549
 makes each mission quite different 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.860
 from the previous and also presents a 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.049
 certain level of micro management in the 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.060
 cybertron fall the paraphernalia a lot 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.250
 larger than before and for each 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.380
 various light or heavy weapons exist 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.940
 upgrades the player must then 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.069
 understand which weapon is best suited to 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.599
 character and enhance it accordingly 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.360
 to unlock interesting effects 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.980
 secondary, however, leaves a little 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.630
 unsatisfied the lack of real e 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.400
 own bosses to defeat 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.010
 practically present and only in the last one 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.049
 epic rich admission of objects 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.180
 secrets to find and settings 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.590
 the countryside is particularly evocative 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.319
 she liked just for the variety of 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.880
 situations this time the possibility is missing 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.470
 to face them in cooperative but 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.150
 other multiplayer modes are 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.040
 remained the same including the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.049
 inevitable conquest and fendi e 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.970
 Team deathmatch is not missing either 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.829
 the escalation option in which players 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.019
 collaborate to defeat waves of 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.690
 enemies unlocking bonuses and routes 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.639
 alternatives with the money earned on 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.440
 problem is that at moon studios it seems 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.700
 have decided not to get too involved 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.200
 this side 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.850
 simplifying most of the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.220
 afor mechanics and more experience 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.450
 rapid and incisive but significantly less 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.220
 deep 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.690
 there are still the four classes that 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.910
 represent the specialties of ours 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.340
 the robotic alter ego on the field the 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.260
 the titan destroyer the infiltrated king e 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.299
 the scientist each of them 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.620
 distinguished by unique abilities and for the 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.209
 role in battle 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.010
 we can create our character 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.470
 choosing the various parts of the body between 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.359
 a limited number of variants and colors 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.770
 after which we can select weapons 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.930
 and associate them and use 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.820
 battle also the balance of the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.680
 classes seemed a bit superficial to us 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.940
 with clearly more powerful titans 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.500
 of the others but we hope that the 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.980
 developers can solve the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:23.140
 problem through a patch the battle 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.120
 for cybertron it stood out above all 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.010
 for the exceptional artistic direction e 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.990
 the inspiration of the high moon developers 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.300
 studios in character creation and 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.820
 location with an unmistakable style e 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.830
 innovative modern and detailed also 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.420
 here the care put by the graphs in the 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.030
 modeling of the various robots remains 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.680
 unchanged the animations are excellent 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.810
 especially when we press 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.370
 the transformation key and let's see 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.800
 break up and the king assemble into a 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.990
 moment tens of pieces and polygons le 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.120
 settings then satisfy by variety 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.980
 and spectacular thanks to effective 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.930
 play of light but modeling 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.880
 unfortunately every element is painstaking 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.490
 undermined by a mediocre work with 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.050
 textures that remain dirty and often in 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.550
 low resolution 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.990
 inexplicable among other things the low one 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.090
 quality of some intermezzo scenes 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.130
 significantly lower than non-sequences 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.080
 interactive in real time a choice 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.850
 questionable which fortunately is limited to 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.950
 few minutes complementary 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.290
 to the fluctuating graphic panorama l 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.150
 excellent soundtrack perfectly 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.220
 punctual in increasing attention 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.260
 during gunfights or in 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.920
 emphasize the spectacularity of some 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:31.560
 situations 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:33.780
 the must roma we go out without the fall 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.850
 by cybertron is a game developed by 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.770
 fans for the fans had entered this 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.510
 category to purchase is absolutely 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.670
 essential if you are not 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.250
 grown up on bread robots but love games 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.780
 action shooter then you should 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.700
 give it a look anyway 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.530
 the countryside is fantastic and the flaws 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.700
 graphics are at odds with a direction 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.680
 artistic over the top 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.630
 shame about the simplification of the 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.430
 multiplayer mode due to the absence of 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.620
 a cooperative mode in the campaign 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.540
 itself but otherwise the fall of 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.640
 cybertron is established as the video game 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.860
 final dedicated to hasbro robots 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.490
 hoping at this point in a sequel 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.490
 even better 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.330
 allow ball 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.810
 excluding
