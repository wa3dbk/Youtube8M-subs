00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
 Welcome to Bigpoint-Berlin! 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
 I'm called Bernd Bairroeter and I'm a Drakensang Online producer. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
 Since May, Drakensang has been online in the Closed beta version 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
 and our team had the opportunity to change their way of working, 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 because it is very different to produce and develop a game that is "lifestyle". 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
 It was something completely new to us all. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 The biggest change is that now every morning we watch the numbers last night. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 We check if the servers are running, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 how many players there were on them, whether there were any problems or crashes. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 We analyze the data, 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 so that we can then immediately divide the tasks of the day for the different teams. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 My name is Florian Busse and I'm a supervisor of Lev design. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 In our brief meetings with the team, we report what we have done over the past day. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Everyone understands which tasks he takes, 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 how he will take care of their implementation so that we can better decide, 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 on our own, what will we do in the upcoming day. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 We are currently working on Tegunswool - the first expansion of the game. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 We have places that are new and which can be surprising to go! 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 So, suddenly we offer something completely new. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.000
 I'm really proud of being able to present the "outer sectors" of the game. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 With our system of building the game at first we thought we would never succeed. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.500
 But, here are the outer fields already! 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.000
 This is something that I am very proud of, and that we have managed to deal with the amazing amount of data. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 I am Yvonne, the author of Drakensang online and write all the quests. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 It is very good for me that this world is constantly growing and new details can be added to it. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 In the update for Tegunswall we are approaching the end of the first chapter in the history of Durya. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I'm called Robin Hancis. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 I am the game design manager at Drakensang Online. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 The "Tegunsuol" update should add more content to the game, especially for players who are at high levels from 30 to 40. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 "The Beast of the Beyond" is our new Boss-NPC for the 40th level. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.500
 I think we're going to introduce a whole new scale for Boss-fighting. 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 We figured out how to develop this "Hackenslay" bat. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 And that's what we've done well, I think. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 "The Messenger" will put the pointer on everything we have prepared so far. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Yes, because the creation of Boss-Battle is relatively difficult considering how many game segments are involved with it. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Its development involves: 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 people by the effects that visualize it, 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 animators, a large number of programmers that make it work 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 and of course, game designers who plan how the whole process will go. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Ultimately, however, the hardest is to predict what the players will be. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 That is, we plan, then test and try, balance and correct. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 We want to give players the opportunity to discover all the power of the Beyond 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 to enter the "Cave of Evil" to learn the nature of the threatening 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 this world danger. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 This is something I think will greatly delight the players.
