00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
discarded it for the longest time during

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.340 
discarded it for the longest time during
the<00:04:48.770> last<00:04:48.800> year<00:04:49.190> or<00:04:49.310> so<00:04:49.340> because<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.300> was<00:04:50.480> for

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
the last year or so because I was for

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
the last year or so because I was for
two<00:04:51.500> reasons<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:52.120> had<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.150> shoulder<00:04:53.660> problem<00:04:54.370> and

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
two reasons I had a shoulder problem and

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.030 
two reasons I had a shoulder problem and
the<00:04:55.460> second<00:04:55.820> reason<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.240> that<00:04:56.300> I<00:04:56.720> was<00:04:57.710> doing<00:04:57.950> it

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
the second reason is that I was doing it

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.970 
the second reason is that I was doing it
with<00:04:58.190> a<00:04:58.250> heavier<00:04:58.670> weight<00:04:58.970> than<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.840> should<00:05:00.140> so

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
with a heavier weight than I should so

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.940 
with a heavier weight than I should so
right<00:05:01.130> now<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.370> leave<00:05:01.820> my<00:05:02.060> ego<00:05:02.270> outside<00:05:02.840> came<00:05:03.770> in

right now I leave my ego outside came in

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.920 
right now I leave my ego outside came in
when<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.280> do<00:05:04.400> it<00:05:04.670> pretty<00:05:05.360> much<00:05:05.450> light<00:05:05.720> weight

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
when I do it pretty much light weight

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.920 
when I do it pretty much light weight
2025<00:05:06.830> pounds<00:05:07.010> and<00:05:07.370> go<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.240> failure<00:05:08.600> right
