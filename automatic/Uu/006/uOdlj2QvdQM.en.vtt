easy<00:01:05.729> adjustment<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:06.659> need<00:01:06.810> no<00:01:06.930> tools

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
easy adjustment you don't need no tools

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.260 
easy adjustment you don't need no tools
to<00:01:07.439> adjust<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.920> justice<00:01:11.400> chain<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:12.060> this

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
to adjust it to justice chain on this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.170 
to adjust it to justice chain on this
all<00:01:12.540> year<00:01:12.900> you're<00:01:13.619> moving<00:01:13.740> these<00:01:14.040> two<00:01:14.369> there's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
all year you're moving these two there's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.440 
all year you're moving these two there's
a<00:01:15.240> screw<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> middle<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:17.330> put<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
a screw in the middle here put the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.030 
a screw in the middle here put the
wrench<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.030> adjust<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.720> chain

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
wrench in and you just adjust a chain

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.380 
wrench in and you just adjust a chain
it's<00:01:23.040> got<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> correct<00:01:23.580> tension<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.090> change

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
it's got the correct tension to change

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.940 
it's got the correct tension to change
so<00:01:24.540> you're<00:01:24.659> able<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> lift<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.200> off<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> groove

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
so you're able to lift it off the groove

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
so you're able to lift it off the groove
there<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.330> should<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.630> able<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> turn

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
there and you should be able to turn

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.230 
there and you should be able to turn
easily<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:32.970> year<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> start<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.049> the

easily this one year to start it at the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.469 
easily this one year to start it at the
chain<00:01:36.240> oil<00:01:36.509> goes<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:39.000> Mexican

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
chain oil goes in here and the Mexican

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.730 
chain oil goes in here and the Mexican
oil<00:01:39.840> will<00:01:40.530> sing<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.220> year<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.899> gas<00:01:43.409> caps

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
oil will sing this one year the gas caps

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.649 
oil will sing this one year the gas caps
you<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> flip<00:01:44.490> cap<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.479> flip

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
you they have a flip cap you just flip

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.170 
you they have a flip cap you just flip
it<00:01:45.780> up<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> turn<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.619> come<00:01:46.829> off<00:01:46.979> easily

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.789 

this<00:01:51.180> saw<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.689> required<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.380> regular

this saw just required just regular
maintenance<00:01:53.009> basically<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.720> mix<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.170> gas

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
maintenance basically you mix the gas

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.410

and<00:01:55.590> oil<00:01:55.680> properly<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> chain<00:01:57.149> oil

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and oil properly and then the chain oil

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.490 
and oil properly and then the chain oil
goes<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:59.000> you<00:02:00.110> you're<00:02:01.110> running<00:02:01.229> out

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
goes in there and you you're running out

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.749 
goes in there and you you're running out
at<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> end<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.950> season<00:02:02.130> you're<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.670> to

use it for a long period of time and

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.389 
use it for a long period of time and
once<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.450> year<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.899> every<00:02:06.930> 50<00:02:07.619> hours<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.129> check

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
once a year or every 50 hours you check

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.059 
once a year or every 50 hours you check
the<00:02:08.580> filter<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.450> disconnect

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the filter we just disconnect

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.690 
the filter we just disconnect
the<00:02:11.219> clipped<00:02:11.640> off<00:02:12.150> here<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:13.980> since

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
the clipped off here and this just since

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.940 
the clipped off here and this just since
this<00:02:14.939> lights<00:02:15.269> off

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
this lights off

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.440 
this lights off
now<00:02:16.950> once<00:02:17.189> the<00:02:17.310> slides<00:02:17.609> off<00:02:17.849> you'll<00:02:18.269> make<00:02:18.420> sure
