Iran that piece of legislation in the

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.659 
Iran that piece of legislation in the
legislation<00:05:42.680> sitting<00:05:43.130> on<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.370> governor's

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
legislation sitting on the governor's

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.600 
legislation sitting on the governor's

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
desk right now and there was a lot of a

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.380 
desk right now and there was a lot of a
lot<00:05:47.180> of<00:05:47.270> rhetoric<00:05:47.919> spread<00:05:48.919> around<00:05:49.150> about<00:05:50.150> that

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
lot of rhetoric spread around about that

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.730 
lot of rhetoric spread around about that
especially<00:05:50.510> with<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.110> shooting<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:51.590> took

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
especially with the shooting that took

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.280 
especially with the shooting that took
place<00:05:51.800> in<00:05:52.010> Arizona<00:05:52.640> and<00:05:52.669> in<00:05:53.060> the<00:05:53.600> timing<00:05:54.169> and

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
place in Arizona and in the timing and

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.830 
place in Arizona and in the timing and
so<00:05:54.530> I<00:05:54.770> almost<00:05:55.550> wonder<00:05:55.790> if<00:05:55.850> there's<00:05:56.060> people<00:05:56.419> in

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
so I almost wonder if there's people in

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.510 
so I almost wonder if there's people in
our<00:05:56.930> legislature<00:05:57.470> to<00:05:57.560> have<00:05:57.680> gun<00:05:57.919> fatigue<00:05:58.340> but

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
our legislature to have gun fatigue but

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.680 
our legislature to have gun fatigue but
they<00:05:58.700> would<00:05:58.820> they<00:05:59.000> need<00:05:59.120> to<00:05:59.270> hear<00:05:59.419> from<00:05:59.450> the

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
they would they need to hear from the

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.960 
they would they need to hear from the
citizens<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:00.200> really<00:06:00.440> do<00:06:00.590> and<00:06:00.830> absolutely<00:06:01.490> and
