00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 for you welcomes school wanna know and 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.819
 she is a master biologist 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.480
 today we will analyze the selection 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.370
 tasks c3 and the third task so for what 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.219
 featured determines ownership 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.400
 plants to the family model to mom or 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.060
 differently family legumes to old 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.970
 name less here they used so 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.400
 I will remind that the mind of their moths and and in 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.230
 principle the most important feature of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 which we define affiliation 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.210
 plants it will be a flower country 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.960
 that is, or here's the flower formula, that is 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.530
 the first is we have to specify the form 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.530
 I will write a flower now I will explain later 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.230
 so I wrote the flower formula let's 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.760
 in order 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.820
 an up arrow indicates what flower 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.739
 wrong what kind of flower 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.500
 wrong is if he only has 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.020
 one axis of symmetry that is it and to the left 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.119
 and the right half will be like 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.670
 rule whose flowers we know and not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.979
 what kind of abstract me flower they 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.530
 have many axes of symmetry and such 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.900
 flowers are called the correct flowers to 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.710
 the same legume wrong is not so 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.899
 slightly special shape shape and so h 5 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.060
 it has 5 sepals 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.880
 and the brackets show that they are grown together 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:41.320
 that is, sepals and about days such 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:45.729
 A pipe on petals and beans 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.930
 Now I draw in a flower if that's it 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.870
 he likes to make out 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.860
 such a structure i.e. top petal 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:02.320
 will be called a sail two side 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:06.280
 it will be oars it and the bottom it will be 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.850
 boat so petals and look one 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.140
 sail 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.209
 true two separate is paddles and two 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.420
 grown together is a boat a boat 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.250
 formed by fused petals 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.450
 further and stamens we have 9 accrete one 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.110
 free pistil one 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:29.470
 this flower formula is further characteristic 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.670
 fruit bean fruit god bean always this 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.430
 characteristic feature 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:40.620
 and the third is some kind of inflorescence can 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.620
 call no brush or head 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.700
 so I would add this property 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.660
 legume family to enter into symbiosis with 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.660
 tuber forged by bacteria 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.120
 these nodule bacteria of forgiveness 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.230
 Worldwide wrote raise on Kiryusha 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.239
 symbiosis with nodule bacteria 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:18.069
 cubes bacteria they live outgrowth them 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.980
 special legume roots and they usb 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.750
 catch nitrogen in the air and you translate 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.709
 nitric acid reunion 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.359
 thereby produce good i'm not with 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.129
 you were a school want to know and I they

 subscribe to our channel 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.150
