welcome to East 6.1 today we're going to
list<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:47.940> primary<00:00:48.450> pollutants<00:00:48.989> found<00:00:49.350> in

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
list the primary pollutants found in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.620 
fillings but that's kind of fallen out
of<00:01:21.390> favor<00:01:21.690> as<00:01:22.050> well<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.649> a<00:01:22.680> lot<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.630> heavy

out<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.550> favor<00:01:26.880> now<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:27.899> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.170> kind<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
out of favor now if you can kind of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.529 
out of favor now if you can kind of
visualize<00:01:28.979> these<00:01:29.640> different<00:01:30.180> types<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
visualize these different types of

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.100 
visualize these different types of
metals<00:01:31.070> heavy<00:01:32.070> metals<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.840> just

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
metals heavy metals and that just

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.330 
metals heavy metals and that just
basically<00:01:34.470> means<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.950> they're<00:01:35.100> higher<00:01:35.310> up

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
basically means that they're higher up

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.669 
basically means that they're higher up
on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> periodic<00:01:36.210> table<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.960> lot<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> them

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
on the periodic table a lot of them

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:45.310 
on the periodic table a lot of them
transition<00:01:38.280> metals<00:01:39.530> pesticides<00:01:43.009> like<00:01:44.009> these

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
transition metals pesticides like these

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.260 
transition metals pesticides like these
from<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.410> agrochemicals<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.399> often<00:01:48.000> waste

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
from the agrochemicals are often waste

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.800 
from the agrochemicals are often waste
water<00:01:48.890> sources<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.390> well<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.830> dioxins<00:01:53.810> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
water sources as well as dioxins so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.270 
water sources as well as dioxins so
dioxins<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:55.979> try<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.569> visualize<00:01:57.569> that<00:01:58.280> this

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
dioxins if we try to visualize that this

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.680 
dioxins if we try to visualize that this
is<00:01:59.550> something<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.119> happened<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.479> few<00:02:00.509> years

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
is something that happened a few years

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.080 
is something that happened a few years
ago<00:02:01.050> there<00:02:01.380> was<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.640> political<00:02:02.640> leader<00:02:02.759> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
ago there was a political leader that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.830 
ago there was a political leader that
was<00:02:03.330> poisoned<00:02:04.080> with<00:02:04.729> dioxins<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.149> dioxins

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
was poisoned with dioxins and dioxins

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.499 
was poisoned with dioxins and dioxins
are<00:02:07.530> basically<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.160> wide<00:02:08.640> category<00:02:09.000> of

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
are basically a wide category of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.410 
are basically a wide category of
different<00:02:09.840> organic<00:02:10.340> molecules<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.640> caused

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
different organic molecules that caused

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.140 
different organic molecules that caused
a<00:02:12.810> lot<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.290> damage<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.610> body<00:02:14.849> they

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
a lot of damage to the body they

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.360 
a lot of damage to the body they
actually<00:02:15.739> bioaccumulates<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:16.920> stay<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
actually bioaccumulates and stay in the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
actually bioaccumulates and stay in the
fatty<00:02:17.640> tissues<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.510> your<00:02:18.959> body<00:02:19.200> doesn't<00:02:19.290> get

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
fatty tissues so your body doesn't get

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.550 
fatty tissues so your body doesn't get
rid<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.890> them<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.400> they're<00:02:21.090> mostly

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
rid of them and they're mostly

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.750 
rid of them and they're mostly
transmitted<00:02:22.560> through<00:02:22.739> food<00:02:23.069> as<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.489> go

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
transmitted through food as you go

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.619 
transmitted through food as you go
higher<00:02:24.030> up<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.390> food<00:02:24.510> chain<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.860> it's

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
higher up on the food chain so it's

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.270 
higher up on the food chain so it's
generally<00:02:27.629> noted<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.379> as<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.920> eat<00:02:29.099> more

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
generally noted that as you eat more

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.210 
generally noted that as you eat more
animal<00:02:29.730> products<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:31.260> dioxins<00:02:31.920> will

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
animal products the dioxins will

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.920 
animal products the dioxins will
increase<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.330> higher<00:02:33.569> up<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
increase because as higher up on the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.770 
increase because as higher up on the
food<00:02:34.020> chain<00:02:34.970> those<00:02:35.970> sources<00:02:36.390> come<00:02:36.750> from

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
food chain those sources come from

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.320 
food chain those sources come from
industrial<00:02:37.410> wastes<00:02:37.830> forest<00:02:38.400> fires<00:02:38.640> burning

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
industrial wastes forest fires burning

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.020 
industrial wastes forest fires burning

or<00:02:45.360> polychlorinated<00:02:46.140> biphenyls<00:02:47.099> we've<00:02:47.459> heard

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
or polychlorinated biphenyls we've heard

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.790 
or polychlorinated biphenyls we've heard
this<00:02:47.970> before<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.050> should<00:02:49.379> actually

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
this before so you should actually

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.010 
this before so you should actually
connect<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.430> straight<00:02:50.790> away<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.690> soil

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
connect it straight away to soil

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.750 
connect it straight away to soil
pollution<00:02:52.790> but<00:02:53.790> basically<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.840> reiterate

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
pollution but basically to reiterate

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.500 
pollution but basically to reiterate
polychlorinated<00:02:56.760> means

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
polychlorinated means

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.490 
polychlorinated means
chlorines<00:02:58.430> biphenyl<00:02:59.459> by<00:02:59.790> means<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.510> phenol

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
chlorines biphenyl by means to phenol

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.119 
chlorines biphenyl by means to phenol
means<00:03:01.769> benzine<00:03:02.430> groups<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.540> that's<00:03:04.129> basically

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
means benzine groups so that's basically

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.240 
means benzine groups so that's basically
coming<00:03:05.459> from<00:03:05.579> electrical<00:03:06.329> equipment<00:03:07.250> other

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
coming from electrical equipment other

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.449 
coming from electrical equipment other
organic<00:03:08.970> matter<00:03:09.239> that's<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:10.079> not<00:03:10.290> good<00:03:10.980> it's

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
organic matter that's just not good it's
