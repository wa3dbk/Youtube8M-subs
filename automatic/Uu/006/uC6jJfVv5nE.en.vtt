00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
little bit but you know where the shaker

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.350 
little bit but you know where the shaker
really<00:01:11.939> excels<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:13.850> when<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.939> put<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
really excels is when you put it on a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.080 
really excels is when you put it on a
wall<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.229> once<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> wall<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
wall like this once it's on the wall the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.969 
wall like this once it's on the wall the
shaker<00:01:18.360> uses<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.049> unique<00:01:19.470> vibration

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
shaker uses very unique vibration

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.969 
shaker uses very unique vibration
technology<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:22.049> actually<00:01:22.229> resonates

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
technology and it actually resonates

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.179 
technology and it actually resonates
throughout<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> entire<00:01:23.850> wall<00:01:25.159> when<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
throughout the entire wall when it

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.240 
throughout the entire wall when it
resonates<00:01:26.729> through<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> entire<00:01:27.330> wall<00:01:28.250> takes

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
resonates through the entire wall takes

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
resonates through the entire wall takes
itself<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.820> got<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> little<00:01:30.090> vibrator

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
itself and it's got a little vibrator

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.870 
itself and it's got a little vibrator
motor<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.770> vibrates<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
motor in it and it vibrates at just the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.340 
motor in it and it vibrates at just the
right<00:01:33.030> frequencies<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> audio<00:01:34.229> you're

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
right frequencies is the audio you're

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.230 
right frequencies is the audio you're
playing<00:01:34.650> through<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> does<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
playing through it and when it does that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.080 
playing through it and when it does that
it<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.350> vibrates<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.159> object<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> set<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it then vibrates the object you set it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.270 
it then vibrates the object you set it
on<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> works<00:01:40.170> great<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.740> things<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.130> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
on so it works great with things like a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.749 
on so it works great with things like a
nice<00:01:41.909> dry<00:01:42.299> wall<00:01:43.700> get<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> bucket<00:01:46.250> trashcan<00:01:47.250> desk

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
thing where unscrews and comes up and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.560 
thing where unscrews and comes up and
the<00:03:29.130> only<00:03:29.310> thing<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.790> found<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.390> does

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
the only thing that I found that it does

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.289 
the only thing that I found that it does
is<00:03:30.750> maybe<00:03:30.959> gives<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.350> little<00:03:31.530> bit<00:03:31.709> more<00:03:31.829> bass

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
is maybe gives a little bit more bass

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.030 
is maybe gives a little bit more bass
but<00:03:33.299> other<00:03:33.570> than<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.019> really<00:03:34.230> don't<00:03:34.739> see

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
but other than that I really don't see

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.330 
but other than that I really don't see
why<00:03:35.730> it's<00:03:36.060> there<00:03:36.290> on<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.470> bottom<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:38.130> do<00:03:38.250> have

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
why it's there on the bottom you do have

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.069 
why it's there on the bottom you do have
a<00:03:38.400> little<00:03:38.519> bit<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:39.030> little<00:03:39.060> sticker<00:03:39.540> here<00:03:39.870> and

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
a little bit a little sticker here and

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.960 
a little bit a little sticker here and
underneath<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.950> sticker<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.370> kind<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.700> gel

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
underneath the sticker is kind of a gel

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.580 
underneath the sticker is kind of a gel
pad<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.510> if<00:03:42.630> you're<00:03:42.780> setting<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.109> on<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.230> desk

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
pad so if you're setting it on a desk

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.410 
pad so if you're setting it on a desk
you're<00:03:43.920> on<00:03:44.070> glass<00:03:44.459> or<00:03:44.730> anything<00:03:45.090> without<00:03:45.209> the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
you're on glass or anything without the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.960 
you're on glass or anything without the
suction<00:03:45.870> cup<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.340> tries<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.370> hold<00:03:47.640> itself

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
suction cup it tries to hold itself

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.030 
suction cup it tries to hold itself
there<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.320> just<00:03:49.470> kind<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.680> put<00:03:49.890> this

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
there and then you just kind of put this

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.740 
there and then you just kind of put this
back<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.790> when<00:03:51.030> you're<00:03:51.150> done<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.420> can

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
the wall the shaker will set right into

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.279 
the wall the shaker will set right into
it<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.519> then<00:04:15.299> when<00:04:15.450> it's<00:04:15.600> set<00:04:15.780> into<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.169> you

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
noticed that the shaker does a lot

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.260 
noticed that the shaker does a lot
better<00:04:24.890> with<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.250> bases<00:04:25.730> than<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:25.970> does<00:04:26.120> with

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
better with the bases than it does with

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.350 
better with the bases than it does with
the<00:04:26.390> highs<00:04:26.600> but<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.650> know<00:04:28.090> it's<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.210> little

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
the highs but you know it's a little

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.210 
the highs but you know it's a little
speaker<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.230> doesn't<00:04:30.650> have<00:04:30.770> a<00:04:30.800> tweeter<00:04:31.130> and

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220

speaker it doesn't have a tweeter and
woofer<00:04:31.490> in<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:32.090> but<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.870> does<00:04:33.050> great<00:04:33.380> with<00:04:33.590> what

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
woofer in it but it does great with what

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.920 
woofer in it but it does great with what
it<00:04:33.920> does<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.400> vibration<00:04:35.000> technology<00:04:35.300> does

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
it does the vibration technology does

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.690 
it does the vibration technology does
help<00:04:36.200> it<00:04:36.320> a<00:04:36.380> little<00:04:36.500> bit<00:04:36.680> on<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:36.920> lowers<00:04:37.250> but
