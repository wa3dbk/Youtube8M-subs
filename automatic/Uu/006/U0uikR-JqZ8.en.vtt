truth<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.580> only<00:02:44.360> man-made<00:02:45.070> things<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:47.150> we

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
truth and only man-made things that we

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.800 
truth and only man-made things that we
make<00:02:47.690> are<00:02:47.990> flat<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.120> that's<00:02:50.120> why<00:02:50.360> nature

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
make are flat and that's why nature

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.850 
make are flat and that's why nature
reveals<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.830> sphere<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:53.000> in<00:02:53.239> rainbows

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
reveals the sphere like in rainbows

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.370 
reveals the sphere like in rainbows
which<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:55.070> course<00:02:55.100> reveal<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.540> spherical

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
which of course reveal the spherical

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.370 
which of course reveal the spherical
world<00:02:57.739> we<00:02:58.100> live<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.420> course<00:02:59.750> the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
world we live in and of course the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.640 
world we live in and of course the
sphere<00:03:01.010> of<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.580> Sun<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.810> gives<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.440> light

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
sphere of the Sun that gives the light

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.510 
sphere of the Sun that gives the light
so<00:03:04.459> nature<00:03:05.000> reveals<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.230> sphere<00:03:06.770> here<00:03:07.340> on

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
so nature reveals the sphere here on

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.680 
so nature reveals the sphere here on
earth<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.150> in<00:03:08.750> outer<00:03:09.620> space<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:11.420> have

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
earth and in outer space and I have

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.440 
earth and in outer space and I have
personally<00:03:12.500> seen<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.610> planet<00:03:14.120> through<00:03:14.420> a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
personally seen the planet through a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.710 
personally seen the planet through a
telescope<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.350> they<00:03:15.620> are<00:03:15.860> spherical<00:03:16.720> without

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
telescope and they are spherical without

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.860 
telescope and they are spherical without
question<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.070> try<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.489> look<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:20.060> nature<00:03:20.239> to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
question so I try to look to nature to

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.960 
question so I try to look to nature to
what<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.230> flat<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.769> I<00:03:22.370> thought<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.670> rocks

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
what is flat and I thought of rocks

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.270 
what is flat and I thought of rocks
perhaps<00:03:23.480> but<00:03:23.750> even<00:03:23.959> rocks<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.620> are<00:03:24.650> flat<00:03:25.010> are

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
perhaps but even rocks that are flat are

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.970 
perhaps but even rocks that are flat are
actually<00:03:25.850> not<00:03:26.060> flat<00:03:26.390> at<00:03:26.540> all<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:27.080> even<00:03:27.769> those

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
actually not flat at all and even those

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.130 
actually not flat at all and even those
things<00:03:28.310> which<00:03:28.610> we<00:03:28.820> perceive<00:03:29.060> in<00:03:29.959> our

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
things which we perceive in our

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.590 
things which we perceive in our
perspective<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.220> be<00:03:31.370> flat<00:03:31.730> like<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.269> salt

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
perspective to be flat like the salt

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.750 
perspective to be flat like the salt
plains<00:03:32.959> are<00:03:33.489> actually<00:03:34.489> not<00:03:35.180> flat<00:03:35.600> whatsoever

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
plains are actually not flat whatsoever

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.600 
plains are actually not flat whatsoever
so<00:03:37.760> natural<00:03:38.420> flat<00:03:39.049> rocks<00:03:39.380> are<00:03:39.739> actually<00:03:40.400> not

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
so natural flat rocks are actually not

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.320 
so natural flat rocks are actually not
flat<00:03:41.000> at<00:03:41.180> all<00:03:41.360> but<00:03:42.290> you'll<00:03:42.739> notice<00:03:43.010> that

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
flat at all but you'll notice that

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.759 
flat at all but you'll notice that
man-made<00:03:44.330> ones<00:03:45.230> are<00:03:45.680> perfectly<00:03:46.570> flat<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.590> then

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
man-made ones are perfectly flat so then

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.070 
man-made ones are perfectly flat so then
I<00:03:48.860> thought<00:03:49.070> of<00:03:49.130> natural<00:03:49.820> trees<00:03:50.239> maybe<00:03:50.780> they

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
I thought of natural trees maybe they

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.470 
I thought of natural trees maybe they
are<00:03:51.260> straight<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:51.860> flat<00:03:52.040> but<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.000> truth<00:03:53.269> is

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
are straight and flat but the truth is

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.920 
are straight and flat but the truth is
no<00:03:54.170> they're<00:03:54.709> not<00:03:54.950> whatsoever<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.450> truth<00:03:56.690> is

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
no they're not whatsoever the truth is

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.590 
no they're not whatsoever the truth is
everything<00:03:57.380> about<00:03:57.620> them<00:03:57.920> is<00:03:58.360> spherical<00:03:59.360> in

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
everything about them is spherical in

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.890 
everything about them is spherical in
nature<00:04:00.220> but<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.340> course<00:04:01.670> in<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.120> flat<00:04:02.450> world

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
nature but of course in the flat world

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.460 
nature but of course in the flat world
Illuminati<00:04:03.860> matrix<00:04:04.549> we<00:04:04.850> find<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.900> round

spherical trees are turned into flat
