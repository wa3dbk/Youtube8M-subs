00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.779
 I have been suffering from stones for about 20 years 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 renal 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:30.039
 after several attempts with the lithotripter 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.680
 for about 10 years this calculation is not 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.530
 it has never been scratched since about three years ago 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.269
 inserted in the lemon study at the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.160
 hospital technology gathered of 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:43.480
 bergamo and I have not had any problems with 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.449
 what other things I use about 120 ml 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.820
 of lemon in a liter of drinking water 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.100
 during the day I never had 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.559
 problems let's say the first one 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:59.519
 period where they burn for the stomach to 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.519
 In the morning it was not all right 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.549
 the renal calculus is formed by the 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.369
 precipitation in the urine of salts 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.979
 so-called litho genes that are forming 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.920
 what kidney stones indications 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.229
 dietetic that we give to the patient who 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.000
 suffers from kidney stones concern 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.899
 adequate introduction of water to the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.759
 day a low sodium diet one 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.399
 low protein diet 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.810
 animals with a normal amount of 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.810
 daily soccer 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.190
 in the urine, however, are present 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.909
 substances that inhibit formation 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.520
 of the calculations 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.830
 among these the most known is citrate 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.830
 citrate and lemon content 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.290
 we have designed a spirit one 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.580
 scientific study as well as yes 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.340
 does with drugs 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.830
 in this study we want to prove 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.230
 as the mont is associated with diet 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.510
 standard for the prevention of 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.130
 kidney stones can reduce the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.460
 flight calculation training compared to 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.460
 diet alone 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.600
 I explain how to do this 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.730
 24-hour urine collection 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.340
 the harvest begins at 7 am and 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.170
 ends at 7 the next morning is 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.130
 a rather particular collection 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.780
 I deliver these two containers 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.150
 within which there are gods 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.310
 reagents every time you uri black will do it 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.900
 in a graduated glass and will divide 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.819
 urine as precisely as possible 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.459
 half in one container half in the other 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.290
 the morning we established yes 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.270
 will present here fast will deliver us 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.290
 I will also make these containers 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.819
 blood collection 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.680
 after which I will accompany her to a 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.660
 clinic next door where the doctor 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.190
 he will ask you some questions 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.950
 about the diet that is following the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.950
 will do a renal ultrasound on a breath 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.569
 out 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.129
 the study envisages the inclusion of 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.549
 202 patients 101 patients will follow 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.709
 only the diet 101 patients over 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.690
 to the standard diet indicated for 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.060
 prevention of stones will take 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.280
 of lemon juice in quantity 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.280
 indicated 120 ml per day 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.440
 in this context it is also interesting 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.070
 the link between the two extremes of Italy 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.300
 bergamo and siracusa and siracusa syracuse 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.090
 be made available to the 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.320
 sick to see if it is possible 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.930
 prevent the formation of calculations 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.670
 these little pebbles that form 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.670
 in kidney and that they do so badly 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.439
 we believe our product that 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.540
 lemon of syracuse for its characters 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.120
 and its properties have a content 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.220
 the agronomists say this is higher 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.350
 of course a higher content of 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.650
 citric acid and therefore lend itself better 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.259
 of others to be used for these 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.690
 its characteristics 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:29.940
 lemon intake associated with 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.880
 diet that we recommend is a factor 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.840
 additional in the prevention of 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.080
 kidney stones 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.430
 because it should provide the amount of 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.740
 citrate needed to prevent 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.080
 crystallization of salt workers i 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.180
 159 patients enrolled so far 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.139
 we hope to finish it in the shortest possible time 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.759
 possible time 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.830
 this is a study that currently 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.870
 we are leading to the hospital 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.090
 analysis and coordination ours 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.849
 in fact an institute all with the help 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.979
 of the lemon consortium for which we 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.169
 we all know that harmlessness is good for me 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.090
 I hope we can prove that 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.229
 even a few lemon a day face 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.229
 even better than apples
