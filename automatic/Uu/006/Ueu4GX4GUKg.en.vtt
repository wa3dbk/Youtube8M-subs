00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.509
 - I got my workout pocket half 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.790
 right with right 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.620
 I got my elastic band from 15 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.009
 centimeters 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 I passed a culture and I went to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.400
 well- geared towards being a culture 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.080
 here with a step back to suit 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
 the tip of the elastic with the medium 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.289
 machine and evine 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.789
 sewing with one whole machine foot 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:34.980
 I'm going to untap this part of mine 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:38.430
 hit that pin right there if you 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.440
 I prefer to take a break in the iron or 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.879
 with scissors carefully and hits well 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.629
 the tip that will be the side of your 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.370
 pocket that will be visible as I go 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.890
 to do now I have to worry about 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.480
 elastic is well rendered here is already 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.199
 confident of security for later I 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.480
 I managed to pull you right, right here. 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.100
 I'll spend another culture here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.010
 taking time off not to catch the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.300
 Elastic is easy to feel the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.100
 here I do not know if they are 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 viewing here 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.729
 we feel where the rubber band is 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.220
 It is important to make a channel for 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.960
 that it is slow what you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.369
 will do if you will put the machine foot 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.009
 on here 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.140
 I think people there use it as a margin 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.700
 of the culture or elastic you are 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 seeing here you're feeling you're doing 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 decrease point again makes one more point 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.140
 slow in your case will make a point 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.990
 slow down when you step on the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.060
 pedal and let's get started now call needle 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.250
 always starting with a lowered needle 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.689
 I'll use it from here 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.119
 my sewing picture 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.570
 Let's slow it down so we can not 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.490
 escape the edge of the elastic or using 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.380
 always the same image of culture that is the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.570
 that I'm using as a parameter 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.770
 elastic there will not I will not have 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.430
 problem when I got here on the tip 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.020
 has the signet a channel more or less 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.829
 two centimeters I finished 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.280
 doing automatically how you can 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.840
 see here I gave a class to my picture 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.399
 It was the starting culture which was the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.330
 elastic, that makes it easy for me to 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.970
 pull the I think he will pucker me 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.569
 I'll form my purse pocket 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.540
 I want the size I think 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.920
 so I 'm going to go france him just until 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.659
 Where I want I think if you 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.450
 want a little bit more nimble 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:26.969
 it decreases a little elastic as we go there 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.969
 Let's see in his pocket how he's going to stay
