00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.020
 hahaha 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.129
 is there anything this season 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.660
 then in the country, who does not know if it's only the beginning of the year 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.089
 I was 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.320
 good evening to break the spell 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.620
 Josh Brolin but no more than the rich and the powerful 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.620
 but in the coming years 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.660
 with certainty for the time 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.070
 f 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.070
 gpec skills 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.520
 at least 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 initially released too much equality 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.110
 there is a job to be done 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.000
 the power fell after taking de facto tonight 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.940
 to begin 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.940
 this first spring period this formality 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.020
 because we adopt the global package from head to toe 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:12.899
 afterwards we have it's that girls entertainment 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.899
 since the defeat on his arrival 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.219
 he incurs with afp 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.169
 gerald c 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.729
 at 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:24.029
 enjoy it 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:26.639
 each subject 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.639
 I think in this sense 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:44.939
 there was a lot of wind 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.719
 it will be a given moment so we count more than hope that a hospital bed 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.719
 it does not include brussels 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.009
 with 188 for the benefit of all cases not only easy to access
