00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.130
 to make another scene 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.530

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.600
 Fire tank from only whom I have please 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.520
 nor could that be the royal one 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.229
 conversely, we exchange the places 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.900
 and now you are in the fire tank 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.820

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.770

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.439

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.180
