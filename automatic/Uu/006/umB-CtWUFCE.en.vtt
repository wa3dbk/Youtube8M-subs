first day I walked for about thirty

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.440 
first day I walked for about thirty
minutes<00:00:54.810> on<00:00:55.080> a<00:00:55.140> treadmill<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:56.300> that<00:00:57.300> was

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
minutes on a treadmill and that was

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.710 
minutes on a treadmill and that was
about<00:00:57.720> all<00:00:58.110> I've<00:00:58.890> done<00:00:59.130> since<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.330> other

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
about all I've done since then other

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.880 
about all I've done since then other
than<00:01:00.810> my<00:01:01.140> daily<00:01:01.320> work<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.510> daily<00:01:03.510> routines<00:01:03.890> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
than my daily work and daily routines so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.020 
than my daily work and daily routines so
I<00:01:05.630> haven't<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:06.840> added<00:01:07.430> extra<00:01:08.430> exercise

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
I haven't really added extra exercise

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.810 
I haven't really added extra exercise
other<00:01:09.479> than<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> very<00:01:10.079> first<00:01:10.409> day<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
other than the very first day and that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
other than the very first day and that
probably<00:01:12.420> didn't<00:01:12.780> make<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> whole<00:01:13.200> lot<00:01:13.259> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
probably didn't make a whole lot of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.399 
probably didn't make a whole lot of
difference<00:01:13.860> anyway<00:01:15.650> as<00:01:16.650> far<00:01:16.800> as<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.150> food

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
difference anyway as far as the food

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.860 
difference anyway as far as the food
it's<00:01:19.409> been<00:01:19.620> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> mixed<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:21.210> me<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.750> of

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
it's been kind of mixed for me some of

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.940 
it's been kind of mixed for me some of
it's<00:01:22.080> been<00:01:23.210> okay<00:01:24.380> some<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.710> haven't

things and logging things drinking the
water<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:44.010> of<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:45.320> which<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.620> have<00:01:46.860> done<00:01:47.450> then

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
water all of that which I have done then

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.870 
water all of that which I have done then
you<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.799> haven't<00:01:50.310> felt<00:01:51.380> hungry<00:01:52.640> there's<00:01:53.640> been<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you I haven't felt hungry there's been a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.710 
you I haven't felt hungry there's been a
few<00:01:54.120> times<00:01:54.180> when<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.549> wanted<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.700> eat<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:59.720> it

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
few times when I wanted to eat and it

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.500 
few times when I wanted to eat and it
was<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:02.250> own<00:02:02.280> desire<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.090> eat<00:02:03.119> not

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
was just my own desire to eat not

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.020 
was just my own desire to eat not
because<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.260> hungry<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:07.519> it<00:02:08.519> was<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.879> my

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
because I was hungry but it was just my

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.949 
because I was hungry but it was just my
desire<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.539> want<00:02:10.049> to<00:02:10.229> eat<00:02:10.439> something<00:02:11.959> and

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
desire to want to eat something and

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.710 
desire to want to eat something and
that's<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.159> issues<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:15.090> I've<00:02:15.390> had

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
that's one of the issues that I've had

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.699 
that's one of the issues that I've had
so<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:16.349> kind<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.739> training<00:02:17.159> process

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
so it's kind of a training process

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.190 
so it's kind of a training process
recognizing<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.890> you're<00:02:20.160> not<00:02:20.370> hungry<00:02:21.200> you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
recognizing that you're not hungry you

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.410 
recognizing that you're not hungry you
know

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
know

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.949 
know
have<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.900> eat<00:02:23.430> but<00:02:24.430> at<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.610> same<00:02:24.790> time<00:02:25.030> it's

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
have to eat but at the same time it's

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.250 
have to eat but at the same time it's
not<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.380> I'm<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:26.800> not<00:02:27.400> hungry<00:02:27.900> most<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
not that I'm just not hungry most of the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.170 
not that I'm just not hungry most of the
time<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:30.670> feel<00:02:31.360> full<00:02:32.730> especially<00:02:33.730> after<00:02:33.910> I've

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
time I feel full especially after I've

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.180 
time I feel full especially after I've
eaten<00:02:34.480> one<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.190> meals<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.530> know<00:02:38.770> in
