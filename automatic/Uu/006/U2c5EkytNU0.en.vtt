going towards the bed or into the bed

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.459 
going towards the bed or into the bed
and<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.149> still<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> treat<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and then they still get the treat so you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.819 
and then they still get the treat so you
click<00:00:58.829> steps<00:00:59.399> towards<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.030> or<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:01.020> step<00:01:01.469> into

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
click steps towards it or a step into

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.280 
click steps towards it or a step into
the<00:01:01.920> bed<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.510> throw<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> treat<00:01:06.290> good

job

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.380 

so<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.610> he's<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.939> putting<00:01:15.270> his

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
so here you can see he's not putting his

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
so here you can see he's not putting his
feet<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> bed<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> might<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.799> wait<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
feet in the bed so I might just wait and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
feet in the bed so I might just wait and
see<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.580> he<00:01:17.670> might<00:01:17.909> go<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.390> sniff<00:01:18.689> inside<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
see if he might go just sniff inside the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
see if he might go just sniff inside the
bed<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.830> by<00:01:20.189> mistake<00:01:20.369> put<00:01:20.880> his<00:01:21.030> foot<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
bed and by mistake put his foot in the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.219 
bed and by mistake put his foot in the
bed<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.830> feed<00:01:23.159> multiple<00:01:23.909> treats<00:01:24.509> for

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
bed and I can feed multiple treats for

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.010 
bed and I can feed multiple treats for
being<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.009> bed<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:27.330> easier<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> have

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
being on the bed it's easier if you have

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.840 
being on the bed it's easier if you have
a<00:01:28.200> bigger<00:01:28.530> bed<00:01:28.829> if<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.250> very<00:01:29.520> small

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
a bigger bed if you have a very small

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
a bigger bed if you have a very small
bed<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> curl<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.170> they

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
bed that they have to curl up and they

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.620 
bed that they have to curl up and they
might<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:31.950> less<00:01:32.250> successful<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.180> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
might be less successful with this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.929 
might be less successful with this
exercise<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> bigger<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.009> target<00:01:35.670> zone

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
exercise so the bigger the target zone

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
exercise so the bigger the target zone
the<00:01:36.600> easier<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> exercise<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.740> right<00:01:39.590> ok

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the easier the exercise is right ok

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.429 
the easier the exercise is right ok
so<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.729> fake<00:01:42.060> treat<00:01:42.420> isn't<00:01:43.049> working

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
so if your fake treat isn't working

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.260 
so if your fake treat isn't working
anymore<00:01:43.649> I'm<00:01:43.920> simply<00:01:44.220> go<00:01:44.369> back<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> step

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
anymore I'm simply go back to the step

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:56.610 
anymore I'm simply go back to the step
of<00:01:45.479> throwing<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> treat<00:01:46.229> into<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> bed

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.130 

step<00:01:57.620> 3<00:01:57.950> wait<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.700> see<00:01:58.910> if<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.150> dog<00:01:59.420> thinks<00:01:59.840> to

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
step 3 wait and see if the dog thinks to

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.050 
step 3 wait and see if the dog thinks to
go<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.590> bed<00:02:03.190> so<00:02:04.190> after<00:02:04.490> playing<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:04.880> game

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
go to the bed so after playing this game

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.390 
go to the bed so after playing this game
a<00:02:05.120> couple<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.600> times<00:02:05.870> you<00:02:06.680> can<00:02:06.830> see<00:02:07.070> if<00:02:07.220> your

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
a couple of times you can see if your

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.070 
a couple of times you can see if your
dog<00:02:07.520> might<00:02:07.820> think<00:02:08.180> to<00:02:08.330> go<00:02:08.450> into<00:02:08.630> bed<00:02:08.750> on<00:02:08.930> their

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
dog might think to go into bed on their

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.470 
dog might think to go into bed on their
own<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.679> just<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.040> step<00:02:10.369> towards<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.180> bed

step<00:05:03.990> 6<00:05:04.440> combine<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.340> behavior<00:05:05.759> with<00:05:06.120> a

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
step 6 combine the behavior with a

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.659 
step 6 combine the behavior with a
settle<00:05:06.650> so<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.770> next<00:05:07.949> step<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.280> this<00:05:08.400> is

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
settle so the next step to this is

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.430 
settle so the next step to this is
teaching<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.150> puppy<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.600> settle<00:05:09.960> in<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.289> bed

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
teaching the puppy to settle in the bed

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.129 
teaching the puppy to settle in the bed

and I have a tutorial on how to teach
the<00:05:13.350> settle<00:05:13.680> but<00:05:14.100> basically<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:14.729> have<00:05:14.760> the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
the settle but basically you have the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.390 
the settle but basically you have the
bed<00:05:15.210> next<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.660> you<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.590> work<00:05:16.770> on<00:05:16.949> a<00:05:16.979> settle

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
bed next to you and you work on a settle

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.850

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
and you can see the link to the video if

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.170 
and you can see the link to the video if
you<00:05:20.190> look<00:05:20.370> down<00:05:20.580> in<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:20.940> description<00:05:21.440> so

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
you look down in the description so

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.490 
you look down in the description so
basically<00:05:24.180> wait<00:05:24.449> until<00:05:24.720> your<00:05:24.840> puppy's<00:05:25.199> not

thinking<00:05:25.919> about<00:05:26.099> the<00:05:26.280> food<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.960> then<00:05:27.960> you

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
thinking about the food and then you

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.919 
thinking about the food and then you
