00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.039 
amount of pixels that's in the iPad 2
which<00:01:34.920> would<00:01:35.280> say<00:01:35.430> hey<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> iPad<00:01:36.090> twos<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
which would say hey the iPad twos you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.690 
which would say hey the iPad twos you
know<00:01:37.140> not<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.560> great<00:01:37.770> would<00:01:37.979> display<00:01:38.250> but

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
know not that great would display but

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.460 
know not that great would display but
what<00:01:39.390> you're<00:01:39.509> missing<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
what you're missing is that it's the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.899 
what you're missing is that it's the
same<00:01:40.680> amount<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> pixels<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> smaller

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
same amount of pixels in a smaller

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.690 
same amount of pixels in a smaller
screen<00:01:42.390> density<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> smaller<00:01:44.070> screen<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
screen density or a smaller screen so it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060

makes<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> pixel<00:01:45.210> density<00:01:45.299> higher<00:01:46.070> but

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
makes the pixel density higher but

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.490 
makes the pixel density higher but
however<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.970> still<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.750> best<00:01:48.930> quality

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
however it's still not the best quality

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.219 
however it's still not the best quality
in<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.130> world<00:01:50.479> from<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> average<00:01:51.960> distance

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
in the world from the average distance

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.410 
in the world from the average distance
that<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.610> use<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.909> at<00:01:54.060> you're<00:01:54.270> not

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that you would use it at you're not

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.639 
that you would use it at you're not
gonna<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.659> able<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.020> distinguish<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
gonna be able to really distinguish the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.800 
gonna be able to really distinguish the
pixels<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.399> look<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:56.759> close<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.780> will

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
pixels but if you look up close you will

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.870 
pixels but if you look up close you will
be<00:01:58.170> able<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> distinguish<00:01:58.829> them<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.759> we

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
be able to distinguish them and if we

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.490 
be able to distinguish them and if we
compare<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> something<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.899> Nexus<00:02:01.049> 7

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
compare it to something like the Nexus 7

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
compare it to something like the Nexus 7
which<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:02.159> right<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.670> you'll<00:02:03.450> notice

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
which I do have right here you'll notice

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.539 
which I do have right here you'll notice
that<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.530> an<00:02:04.740> HD<00:02:05.009> display<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that this is actually an HD display and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.089 
that this is actually an HD display and
it's<00:02:06.149> much<00:02:06.329> harder<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:07.200> distinguish<00:02:07.619> pixels

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it's much harder to distinguish pixels

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.449 
it's much harder to distinguish pixels
but<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.599> not<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> big<00:02:10.200> difference<00:02:10.459> if

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
but really not a big difference if

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.130 
but really not a big difference if
you're<00:02:11.610> considering<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> price<00:02:12.270> point<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
you're considering the price point it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
you're considering the price point it
might<00:02:13.440> become

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
might become

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.770 
might become
more<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> big<00:02:14.580> difference<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.090> also<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.750> a

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
more of a big difference you also have a

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.230 
more of a big difference you also have a
16<00:02:16.320> by<00:02:16.470> 9<00:02:16.500> aspect<00:02:16.650> ratio<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> Nexus<00:02:17.820> 7<00:02:17.850> here

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
16 by 9 aspect ratio on the Nexus 7 here

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.710 
16 by 9 aspect ratio on the Nexus 7 here
and<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:20.040> do<00:02:20.220> not<00:02:20.370> have<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> 61<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.300> here<00:02:21.540> so

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
and you do not have the 61 on here so

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.610 
and you do not have the 61 on here so
you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.990> tell<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.410> definitely

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
you can tell that it's definitely

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.490 
you can tell that it's definitely
definitely<00:02:23.250> significantly<00:02:24.150> wider<00:02:24.510> which<00:02:25.350> I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
definitely significantly wider which I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.560 
definitely significantly wider which I
personally<00:02:25.950> like<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.400> everyday<00:02:26.640> use<00:02:26.970> but

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
personally like for everyday use but

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.380 
personally like for everyday use but
when<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.140> consider<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.860> fact<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.430> when<00:02:30.270> you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
when you consider the fact that when you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.360 
when you consider the fact that when you
watch<00:02:30.600> videos<00:02:31.380> you're<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.040> be<00:02:32.220> getting

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
watch videos you're going to be getting

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.740 
watch videos you're going to be getting
letterboxing<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.180> at<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.330> top<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
letterboxing up at the top and the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.950 
letterboxing up at the top and the
bottom<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:35.010> becomes<00:02:35.340> more<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.700> problem<00:02:36.240> but

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
bottom it becomes more of a problem but

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.990 
bottom it becomes more of a problem but
again<00:02:37.380> having<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> same<00:02:38.220> resolution<00:02:38.550> as<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
again having the same resolution as the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.720 
again having the same resolution as the
iPad<00:02:39.330> 2<00:02:39.750> all<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.590> apps<00:02:40.740> still<00:02:41.040> work<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.250> we

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
iPad 2 all the apps still work so we

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.130 
iPad 2 all the apps still work so we
only<00:02:41.850> have<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.060> couple<00:02:42.090> downloaded<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.840> far<00:02:42.990> but

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
only have a couple downloaded so far but

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.450 
only have a couple downloaded so far but
if<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.320> go<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.680> subway<00:02:43.980> surfer<00:02:44.280> here

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
if we just go in the subway surfer here

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.830 
if we just go in the subway surfer here
you'll<00:02:44.610> see<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.480> completely

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
you'll see that it it's completely

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.970 
you'll see that it it's completely
optimized<00:02:46.260> already<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.650> don't<00:02:46.800> have<00:02:46.890> to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
optimized already you don't have to

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.380 
optimized already you don't have to
worry<00:02:47.160> about<00:02:47.220> any<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.640> letterboxing

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
worry about any of that letterboxing

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.720 
worry about any of that letterboxing
which<00:02:48.960> has<00:02:49.230> been<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> pretty<00:02:50.130> big<00:02:50.310> problem<00:02:50.640> on

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
which has been a pretty big problem on

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.420 
which has been a pretty big problem on
the<00:02:51.090> iphone<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:52.290> um<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.100> you're<00:02:53.220> not<00:02:53.340> gonna

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
the iphone but um so you're not gonna

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.410 
the iphone but um so you're not gonna
have<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.640> problem<00:02:53.910> here<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:57.060> there<00:02:57.210> you<00:02:57.300> can

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
have that problem here so there you can

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.900 
have that problem here so there you can
kind<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.660> hear<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> speaker<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.470> a

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
kind of hear the speaker it's a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.600 
kind of hear the speaker it's a
sufficiently<00:02:59.910> loud<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.860> far<00:03:02.070> everything

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
sufficiently loud so so far everything

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.700 
sufficiently loud so so far everything
is<00:03:02.700> working<00:03:03.090> out<00:03:03.420> pretty<00:03:03.900> well<00:03:04.050> with<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.380> iPad

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
is working out pretty well with the iPad

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.540 
is working out pretty well with the iPad
just<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.940> few<00:03:06.150> minor<00:03:06.710> problems<00:03:07.710> we<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:08.190> got<00:03:08.340> some

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
just a few minor problems we we got some

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.370 
just a few minor problems we we got some
factories<00:03:09.270> scratching<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:09.960> kind<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.200> hard

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
factories scratching it's kind of hard

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.650 
factories scratching it's kind of hard
to<00:03:10.410> see<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:11.550> it's<00:03:11.790> only<00:03:11.940> it's<00:03:12.210> kind<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:12.630> a

to see on it's only it's kind of like a
it's<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.620> don't<00:03:14.280> know<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.400> can<00:03:14.580> see<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.760> in

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
it's like I don't know you can see it in

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.580 
it's like I don't know you can see it in
the<00:03:14.910> correct<00:03:15.090> light<00:03:15.330> considering<00:03:16.050> like<00:03:16.350> it's

the correct light considering like it's

a it's the aluminum bakit it's a it's

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
almost like a piece of machinery was

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.830 
almost like a piece of machinery was
just<00:03:20.730> scuffed<00:03:20.970> against<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.480> when<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.750> was

being<00:03:21.990> packaged<00:03:22.530> or<00:03:22.709> something<00:03:23.010> it's<00:03:23.400> really

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
being packaged or something it's really

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.460 
being packaged or something it's really
no<00:03:23.820> big<00:03:24.090> deal<00:03:24.120> considering<00:03:24.959> it's<00:03:25.080> on<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.290> back

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
no big deal considering it's on the back

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.010 
no big deal considering it's on the back
and<00:03:25.770> you<00:03:26.640> know<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:27.090> can<00:03:27.209> expect<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.810> type<00:03:27.959> of

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
and you know you can expect that type of

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.890 
and you know you can expect that type of
flaws<00:03:28.350> even<00:03:28.770> though<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.130> kind<00:03:29.400> of

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
flaws even though it is kind of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
flaws even though it is kind of
disappointing<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.290> from<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.500> dimension

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
disappointing but from a dimension

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.000 
disappointing but from a dimension
standpoint<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.610> extremely<00:03:33.330> thin<00:03:34.020> when<00:03:34.980> I

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
standpoint it's extremely thin when I

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.260 
standpoint it's extremely thin when I
first<00:03:35.280> picked<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.610> up<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.850> Apple<00:03:36.120> store

first picked it up in the Apple store

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.460 
first picked it up in the Apple store
before<00:03:36.420> we<00:03:36.630> even<00:03:36.750> decided<00:03:37.080> we<00:03:37.320> were<00:03:37.410> gonna

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
before we even decided we were gonna

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.040 
before we even decided we were gonna
purchase<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:38.040> we<00:03:39.000> immediately<00:03:39.540> noticed<00:03:39.930> that

purchase it we immediately noticed that

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.750 
purchase it we immediately noticed that
it<00:03:40.170> was<00:03:40.290> very<00:03:40.620> light<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.280> it's<00:03:41.430> definitely

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
it was very light and it's definitely

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.170 
it was very light and it's definitely
aimed<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.240> be<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.390> one-hand<00:03:43.310> /<00:03:44.310> one-hand

like<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.150> it's<00:05:06.780> more<00:05:07.020> similar<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.409> a<00:05:07.530> large<00:05:07.770> iPod

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
like a it's more similar to a large iPod

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.490 
like a it's more similar to a large iPod
Touch<00:05:08.280> but<00:05:08.520> all<00:05:08.909> the<00:05:09.270> features<00:05:09.659> that<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:10.020> iPod

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
Touch but all the features that the iPod

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.860 
Touch but all the features that the iPod
are<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.159> iPad<00:05:11.490> has<00:05:11.639> it<00:05:11.849> separated<00:05:12.479> from<00:05:12.750> the

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
are the iPad has it separated from the

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.320 
are the iPad has it separated from the
iPod<00:05:13.139> Touch<00:05:13.490> transfer<00:05:14.490> over<00:05:14.639> to<00:05:14.789> this<00:05:14.969> device

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
iPod Touch transfer over to this device

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.719 
iPod Touch transfer over to this device
so<00:05:15.539> you<00:05:15.569> still<00:05:15.810> have<00:05:15.960> all<00:05:16.199> the<00:05:16.229> gestures<00:05:17.009> you

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
so you still have all the gestures you

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.510 
so you still have all the gestures you
still<00:05:17.969> have<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.509> landscape<00:05:19.500> rotation<00:05:20.250> you

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
still have the landscape rotation you

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.100 
still have the landscape rotation you
still<00:05:20.759> have<00:05:20.940> photobooth<00:05:21.509> if<00:05:21.629> you<00:05:21.719> solve<00:05:21.960> all

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
still have photobooth if you solve all

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.469 
still have photobooth if you solve all
the<00:05:22.259> apps<00:05:22.440> that<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:22.949> normally<00:05:23.099> wouldn't<00:05:23.610> get

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
the apps that you normally wouldn't get

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.480 
the apps that you normally wouldn't get
with<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.810> smaller<00:05:25.409> device<00:05:25.710> like<00:05:25.919> an<00:05:26.039> iPhone<00:05:26.159> or

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
with a smaller device like an iPhone or

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.520 
with a smaller device like an iPhone or
iPod<00:05:26.909> Touch<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:27.419> that<00:05:27.990> brings<00:05:28.110> us<00:05:28.319> to<00:05:28.440> the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
iPod Touch so that brings us to the

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.219 
iPod Touch so that brings us to the
camera<00:05:30.440> obviously<00:05:31.440> you<00:05:31.560> have<00:05:31.770> a<00:05:31.800> pretty

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
camera obviously you have a pretty

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.390 
camera obviously you have a pretty
improved<00:05:34.229> camera<00:05:34.469> when<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:34.800> compare<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.159> the

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
improved camera when you compare to the

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.180 
improved camera when you compare to the
iPad<00:05:36.150> 2<00:05:36.479> haven't<00:05:37.080> had<00:05:37.169> much<00:05:37.349> experience<00:05:37.650> as

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
iPad 2 haven't had much experience as

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.499 
iPad 2 haven't had much experience as
this<00:05:38.279> is<00:05:38.460> just<00:05:38.639> a<00:05:38.729> first<00:05:38.880> impressions<00:05:39.419> video

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
this is just a first impressions video

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:40.969 
this is just a first impressions video
we'll<00:05:39.779> talk<00:05:39.900> more<00:05:40.080> about<00:05:40.169> this<00:05:40.380> in<00:05:40.529> our<00:05:40.590> review

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
we'll talk more about this in our review

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.950 
we'll talk more about this in our review
but<00:05:41.159> from<00:05:41.310> what<00:05:41.460> I<00:05:41.490> can<00:05:41.610> see<00:05:41.960> definitely

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
but from what I can see definitely

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.029 
but from what I can see definitely
higher<00:05:43.319> quality<00:05:43.919> rear<00:05:44.520> facing<00:05:44.819> and<00:05:45.860> the<00:05:46.860> main

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
higher quality rear facing and the main

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.450 
higher quality rear facing and the main
thing<00:05:47.279> is<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.520> front<00:05:47.729> facing<00:05:48.000> whereas<00:05:48.539> you

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
thing is the front facing whereas you

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.249 
thing is the front facing whereas you
used<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.580> have<00:05:50.759> such<00:05:51.120> bad<00:05:51.569> cameras<00:05:52.080> on<00:05:52.199> the

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
used to have such bad cameras on the

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.600 
used to have such bad cameras on the
front<00:05:52.349> of<00:05:52.500> Apple<00:05:52.740> devices<00:05:52.979> they're<00:05:53.279> finally

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
front of Apple devices they're finally

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.830 
front of Apple devices they're finally
starting<00:05:53.909> to<00:05:53.940> improve<00:05:54.150> them<00:05:54.539> which<00:05:54.719> is

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
starting to improve them which is

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.420 
starting to improve them which is
definitely<00:05:55.650> a<00:05:55.830> step<00:05:56.009> in<00:05:56.069> the<00:05:56.250> right<00:05:56.400> direction

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
definitely a step in the right direction

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.939 
definitely a step in the right direction
in<00:05:56.940> my<00:05:57.060> opinion<00:05:57.479> I<00:05:57.659> just<00:05:58.379> wanted<00:05:58.680> to<00:05:58.770> quickly

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
in my opinion I just wanted to quickly

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.800 
in my opinion I just wanted to quickly
touch<00:05:59.279> on<00:05:59.430> battery<00:05:59.729> life<00:05:59.879> I<00:06:00.090> charged<00:06:00.599> up<00:06:00.690> to

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
touch on battery life I charged up to

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
touch on battery life I charged up to
about<00:06:00.960> 90%<00:06:01.560> I<00:06:02.219> came<00:06:02.960> with<00:06:03.960> about<00:06:04.169> 80<00:06:04.379> I<00:06:04.500> changed

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
about 90% I came with about 80 I changed

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.969 
about 90% I came with about 80 I changed
up<00:06:04.919> to<00:06:05.039> charging<00:06:05.520> up<00:06:05.610> to<00:06:05.699> about<00:06:05.789> 90<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.680> so<00:06:07.680> in

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
up to charging up to about 90 and so in

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.450 
up to charging up to about 90 and so in
about<00:06:08.580> 2<00:06:09.389> hours<00:06:09.419> of<00:06:10.050> you<00:06:10.169> maybe<00:06:10.409> about<00:06:11.219> an<00:06:11.340> hour

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
about 2 hours of you maybe about an hour

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.399 
about 2 hours of you maybe about an hour
and<00:06:11.639> a<00:06:11.669> half<00:06:11.819> pretty<00:06:12.599> heavy<00:06:12.779> use<00:06:13.110> with

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
and a half pretty heavy use with

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.469 
and a half pretty heavy use with
brightness<00:06:14.159> about<00:06:14.460> halfway<00:06:14.639> up<00:06:14.849> we're<00:06:15.330> only

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
brightness about halfway up we're only

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.200 
brightness about halfway up we're only
looking<00:06:15.690> about<00:06:16.139> a<00:06:16.169> 13%<00:06:16.860> drop<00:06:17.580> on<00:06:17.819> the<00:06:17.909> battery

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
looking about a 13% drop on the battery

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.540 
looking about a 13% drop on the battery
life<00:06:18.590> so<00:06:19.590> it's<00:06:19.949> looking<00:06:20.159> like<00:06:20.250> some<00:06:20.460> pretty

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
life so it's looking like some pretty

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.830 
life so it's looking like some pretty
good<00:06:20.699> battery<00:06:21.000> life<00:06:21.060> and<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.419> battery<00:06:21.690> life

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
good battery life and the battery life

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.360 
good battery life and the battery life
has<00:06:21.990> always<00:06:22.139> been<00:06:22.349> pretty<00:06:22.560> good<00:06:22.680> on<00:06:22.740> iPads<00:06:23.159> and

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
has always been pretty good on iPads and

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.689 
has always been pretty good on iPads and
I<00:06:23.400> would<00:06:23.520> expect<00:06:23.819> it<00:06:23.969> to<00:06:24.000> carry<00:06:24.270> over<00:06:24.629> as

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
I would expect it to carry over as

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.879 
I would expect it to carry over as
you're<00:06:26.699> taking<00:06:27.240> a<00:06:27.479> less<00:06:27.900> of<00:06:27.990> a<00:06:28.080> draw<00:06:28.349> with<00:06:28.650> the

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
you're taking a less of a draw with the

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.980 
you're taking a less of a draw with the
smaller<00:06:29.219> screen<00:06:29.669> from<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.029> battery<00:06:30.360> so

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
smaller screen from the battery so

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.469 
smaller screen from the battery so
overall<00:06:31.979> first<00:06:32.699> impressions<00:06:33.180> are<00:06:33.300> pretty

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
overall first impressions are pretty

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.300 
overall first impressions are pretty
positive<00:06:33.810> some<00:06:34.409> things<00:06:34.620> are<00:06:34.740> lacking<00:06:34.949> in<00:06:35.219> the

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
positive some things are lacking in the

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.600 
positive some things are lacking in the
display<00:06:35.669> category<00:06:36.300> and<00:06:36.830> I<00:06:37.830> would<00:06:38.039> have<00:06:38.399> liked

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
display category and I would have liked

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.319 
display category and I would have liked
to<00:06:38.669> see<00:06:38.849> a<00:06:38.880> bit<00:06:39.509> of<00:06:39.630> a<00:06:39.750> smaller<00:06:40.080> price<00:06:40.440> point

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:41.329 
to see a bit of a smaller price point

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:44.119 
to see a bit of a smaller price point
definitely<00:06:42.329> positive<00:06:43.199> you're<00:06:43.919> gonna<00:06:44.009> get

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
definitely positive you're gonna get

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:46.459 
definitely positive you're gonna get
