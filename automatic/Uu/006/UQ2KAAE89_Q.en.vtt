00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.880 
Spacey and I honestly think that it's
perfect<00:03:43.800> because<00:03:44.570> getting<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.840> like<00:03:46.560> getting

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
perfect because getting to like getting

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.940 
perfect because getting to like getting
inches<00:03:47.430> like<00:03:47.670> maybe<00:03:47.880> 22<00:03:48.420> 24<00:03:48.870> 26<00:03:48.900> that's<00:03:49.709> really

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
inches like maybe 22 24 26 that's really

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.710 
inches like maybe 22 24 26 that's really
not<00:03:50.100> layering<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.850> really<00:03:51.209> end<00:03:51.330> up<00:03:51.480> having

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
not layering so you really end up having

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.840 
not layering so you really end up having
to<00:03:51.780> cut<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.410> lot<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:52.950> your<00:03:53.100> hair<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.520> I<00:03:53.640> didn't

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
to cut a lot of your hair and I didn't

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.270 
to cut a lot of your hair and I didn't
have<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.120> really<00:03:54.300> cut<00:03:54.600> any<00:03:54.840> hair<00:03:55.170> besides<00:03:56.040> like

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
have to really cut any hair besides like

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.280 
have to really cut any hair besides like
right<00:03:56.489> here<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.730> my<00:03:56.850> bank<00:03:57.090> area<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.600> think<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.050> cut

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
right here in my bank area I think I cut

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.250 
right here in my bank area I think I cut
maybe<00:03:58.550> not<00:03:59.550> even<00:03:59.790> an<00:03:59.880> inch<00:04:00.060> off<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:01.050> really

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
maybe not even an inch off and it really

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.880 
maybe not even an inch off and it really
just<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.830> was<00:04:02.040> perfect<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:02.600> 18<00:04:03.600> inches<00:04:04.110> 22<00:04:04.709> and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
just it was perfect so 18 inches 22 and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.979 
just it was perfect so 18 inches 22 and
26<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.459> wouldn't<00:04:05.790> say<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:05.940> was<00:04:06.239> too<00:04:06.450> Spacey<00:04:06.750> I

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
26 I wouldn't say that was too Spacey I

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.340

uncontrollable shedding it was
maintainable<00:04:27.879> that's<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.629> worry<00:04:28.810> but<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:30.550> did

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
maintainable that's the worry but it did

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.460 
maintainable that's the worry but it did
have<00:04:30.940> more<00:04:31.120> shedding<00:04:31.539> than<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.780> 22<00:04:32.169> and<00:04:32.289> 18

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
I love these curls and I think with the

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.649 
I love these curls and I think with the
curling<00:06:09.340> wands<00:06:09.669> -<00:06:09.879> they<00:06:10.150> come<00:06:10.360> out<00:06:10.509> as

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
curling wands - they come out as

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.420 
curling wands - they come out as
different<00:06:10.870> kind<00:06:11.500> of<00:06:11.590> curls<00:06:11.949> because<00:06:12.250> the

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
different kind of curls because the

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.760 
different kind of curls because the
smaller<00:06:12.729> curling<00:06:13.210> wands<00:06:13.389> they<00:06:14.319> have<00:06:14.590> this

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
smaller curling wands they have this

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.219 
smaller curling wands they have this
like<00:06:14.949> spirally<00:06:15.759> like<00:06:16.150> this<00:06:16.330> is<00:06:16.509> a<00:06:16.539> spiral<00:06:16.930> II

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
like spirally like this is a spiral II

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.040 
like spirally like this is a spiral II
curl<00:06:17.520> but<00:06:18.520> it's<00:06:18.699> not<00:06:18.909> really<00:06:19.389> it's<00:06:19.629> like<00:06:19.719> more

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
curl but it's not really it's like more

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.659 
curl but it's not really it's like more
of<00:06:20.080> a<00:06:20.199> wave<00:06:20.409> I<00:06:20.680> think<00:06:20.889> because<00:06:21.159> it's<00:06:21.310> a<00:06:21.400> bit<00:06:21.580> it

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
of a wave I think because it's a bit it

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.390 
of a wave I think because it's a bit it
was<00:06:21.759> a<00:06:21.819> bigger<00:06:22.120> curling<00:06:22.659> line<00:06:22.810> barrel<00:06:23.800> so<00:06:24.279> it

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
was a bigger curling line barrel so it

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.269 
was a bigger curling line barrel so it
just<00:06:24.580> came<00:06:24.759> out<00:06:24.940> like<00:06:25.060> this<00:06:25.240> and<00:06:25.479> I<00:06:25.569> absolutely

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
just came out like this and I absolutely

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:30.180 
just came out like this and I absolutely
love<00:06:27.570> these<00:06:28.570> curls<00:06:28.899> like<00:06:29.020> I<00:06:29.139> feel<00:06:29.349> like<00:06:29.409> I<00:06:29.800> need

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190

somebody's video okay no it was
seriously<00:06:33.930> I<00:06:34.930> was<00:06:35.230> thinking<00:06:35.500> about<00:06:36.180> putting

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
seriously I was thinking about putting

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.700 
seriously I was thinking about putting
highlights<00:06:37.630> in<00:06:37.780> his<00:06:37.870> hair<00:06:37.990> but<00:06:38.020> imma<00:06:38.290> take<00:06:38.560> it

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
highlights in his hair but imma take it

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.110 
highlights in his hair but imma take it
off<00:06:38.830> and<00:06:39.100> do<00:06:39.220> all<00:06:39.340> that<00:06:39.370> stuff<00:06:39.580> and<00:06:39.910> do<00:06:40.000> that

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
off and do all that stuff and do that

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.700 
off and do all that stuff and do that
but<00:06:40.660> it<00:06:40.840> probably<00:06:41.020> won't<00:06:41.260> be<00:06:41.350> for<00:06:41.560> a<00:06:41.620> couple

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710
