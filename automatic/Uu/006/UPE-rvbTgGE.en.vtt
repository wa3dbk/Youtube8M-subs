00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 and here we are in a new tutorial of 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.220
 minecraft in which you signal to make a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.889
 steve extract supersized as 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.200
 very well this statue is similar to the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.859
 I 've already made the zombie statue 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.359
 Giant size as in the previous years 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.890
 I'm going to teach only the measurements 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.890
 since it takes a lot to do it 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:30.110
 and the materials that we will need are 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:33.140
 oak blue wool wool boards were born 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.570
 brown wool gray wool board 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.530
 there being very well the measures of 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.860
 foot are the same 8 long and 2 of 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.040
 high and 4 wide and when we got here 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.500
 three are left between three and six 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.830
 fingers high and with we got here the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.879
 back is all three 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.850
 if he did not know so much against enzo 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.620
 October back also and also in 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.469
 the other side 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.320
 the pants is the same also and with the 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.570
 zombie are 12 tall and when 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.650
 we come to this right corner we do 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.920
 a stair way 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.480
 and here just like here right now 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.090
 you can not see it because they are holding hands 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.720
 but it would be like the previous one and in the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.720
 back 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.530
 it would be the same as in the previous one and 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.020
 It would look 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.460
 this double staircase that being in the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.970
 center 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.970
 Y 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.080
 and the pants would be that later in the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.780
 T-shirt would also be the same as 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.090
 zombie 12 high 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 and the sleeves would also be the same as 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.890
 would be 54 tall and the base or 5 of 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.370
 tall and 4 wide 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.290
 and in the first change is that instead 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.970
 you want to make the hands of the zombie that 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.800
 hands of the cen vision out the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.920
 station hands down but the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.010
 same measures are with a measure of 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.229
 4 x 4 and also long they have to 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.600
 measure from 10 from top to bottom have to 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.869
 measure 10 just like the zombie just that 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.260
 instead of out and down and now 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.390
 the most complicated the head is made 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.490
 same as the zombie 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.400
 what would it be that between between the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.770
 sleeve and neck sticking out two for 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.480
 two and two forward and do it 8 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.930
 and then it would be like that from the base above 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.380
 of the base we put two of oak table 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.260
 then four on of fir board and 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.190
 then two oak table after 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.620
 the two tips another of fir board and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.920
 then on the side of these two other two 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.310
 of fir board 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.420
 and to make the eyes that are in 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.910
 line with the mustache we make one of 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.590
 we put a blue wool other wool 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.319
 blue and next to blue wool 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.610
 white if it is not clear and then 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:10.410
 you just look at the face and see you later 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.070
 the most difficult hair 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.390
 he puts on another line of fir boards 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.650
 of oak I do not remember sometimes not 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.290
 I distinguish well simply you look at it 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.220
 over like that and it's done in three high in 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.340
 the two corners 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.500
 with brown wool and the rest covered it and 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.370
 now this is important 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.280
 the profile side is thus done first 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.170
 they put three brown wool 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.010
 after the brown wool dret it 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.560
 they leave here two rob tones of space 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.709
 followed then two more are lowered 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.260
 blocks then two other blocks towards the 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.940
 left one block down two 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.060
 blocks on the left and the side 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.220
 It is around here back then by 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.590
 back on the other side would be like that 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.800
 that I do not explain and behind 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.810
 they would leave so the base would be left and then 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.569
 in the next two oak in each 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.580
 side and in the four that remain in the 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.800
 brown wool center 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.570
 well, this has been everything if you have 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.730
 Some doubt comments in the description if 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.430
 you want some other stratum to 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.470
 some other tutorial whatever everything 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.320
 what do you say I hope you liked it 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.590
 good to give like subs and comment on the 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.590
 description
