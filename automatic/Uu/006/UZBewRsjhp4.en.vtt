00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.660
 yes 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.529
 if not 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:30.160
 I think that at that time we had normal 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.160
 deep neck and point 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.930
 how 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.930
 you have to go back to watch those whores do not 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 best 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.350
 greetings to all gamers 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.380
 we are the pro no that they are 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.380
 welcome to the banner of May 29 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.970
 before starting the review we want 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.420
 clarify that these reviews for the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.990
 second channel if their lives took us away 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.990
 of drugs 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.130
 of shots but all are all from 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.520
 shots have my stupid imagination 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.840
 do not be in third person to five like this 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.929
 I developed for your chris martin 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.640
 who painted it does not matter who makes a 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.640
 sequel part of bayer 1 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.530
 the launch of this game is 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.900
 scheduled for October 30, 2009 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.210
 but it left until February 9 , 2010 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.210
 they are primark nuggets in tepito 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.160
 the graphics that go to the improvement of 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.900
 many know the one rolling in is a 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.700
 very nice graphic engine but it 's like 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.690
 a woman must be treated so that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.300
 approve the track at least two controls 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.229
 the graphic here but with a touch of goal 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.229
 of the night 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.340
 the multiplayer that does not cause you the 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.550
 truth and nobody in the world 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.770
 would play and we 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.230
 as of the problems 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.060
 I have several endings and you have 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.770
 that by the game several times doing 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.280
 different things to discover all 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.280
 the finals 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.630
 where he does not die anymore and he goes to live 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.580
 mexico and he makes a pompadour and his name 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.190
 his new name is peÃ±a grandson and is 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.270
 president and we are going to be worth come but not 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.270
 it's a movie 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.620
 the game music is good in styles 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.620
 like jazz and funk sinatra tony bennett 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.850
 i 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.680
 well let's go with the conclusion of 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.540
 we give it proof because it is a 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.640
 good game although the first one was a lot 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.830
 better but it was set in acapulco 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.660
 that's why we give it 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.900
 the place where is behind all 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.190
 we 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.140
 but hey, he's going to leave several days 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.420
 infinite and we will buy it until with 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.020
 this one of 300 inmates the compost is that 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.020
 for tomorrow 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.430
 sometimes because the lady is taught with 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.240
 your life for the second crisis channel 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.970
 and what I mentioned the periods 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:38.750
 still without a hand up or down or 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.750
 regular or so increase is not like that
