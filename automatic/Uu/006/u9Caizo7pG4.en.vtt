 it's just 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.840
 why fool and write books 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:31.250
 that you yourself can not check you can not believe everything 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.020
 that they write in books is good only to assure 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.240

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.139

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:03.830
 weather we can not make clouds 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:09.669
