that's how that's what it does now how

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.010 
that's how that's what it does now how
to<00:01:45.479> make<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:48.409> so<00:01:49.640> like<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> bit<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to make it so like this it's a bit of a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.560 
to make it so like this it's a bit of a
weird<00:01:52.409> combination<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> rough<00:01:57.060> dirt

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
weird combination and so a rough dirt

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.590 
weird combination and so a rough dirt
then<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.350> couple<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.979> row<00:01:59.009> would<00:01:59.430> make<00:01:59.820> CCTV

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
then one couple in a row would make CCTV

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:09.160 
then one couple in a row would make CCTV
camera<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:02.280> how<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:06.409> how<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.439> make<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
camera and then how to how to make the

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.120 
camera and then how to how to make the
monitor<00:02:10.170> that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
monitor that

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.050 
monitor that
Cole<00:02:12.340> would<00:02:12.880> think<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.820> combination

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
Cole would think that it's a combination

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.810 
Cole would think that it's a combination
somewhere<00:02:16.720> at<00:02:16.810> land<00:02:17.050> like<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.610> there<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.700> go

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.630 
just so you can place multiple cameras
instead<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.290> all<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.710> screens<00:02:39.040> looking<00:02:39.490> at

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
instead of all the screens looking at

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.860 
instead of all the screens looking at
one<00:02:40.270> camera<00:02:40.690> as<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.290> see<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:43.120> that'd

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
one camera as you can see that so that'd

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.520 
one camera as you can see that so that'd
be<00:02:43.900> cool<00:02:44.260> if<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.440> could<00:02:44.560> do<00:02:44.800> multiple<00:02:45.340> cameras

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
be cool if you could do multiple cameras

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.040 
be cool if you could do multiple cameras
and<00:02:47.530> multiple<00:02:48.190> screens<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.050> allocate
