00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hey people welcome to me on the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.839
 Today I want to talk about the couch 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.849
 update policy of hÃ¤nsel speak 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.660
 it's a thorn for many android users 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.960
 in the eye how slow actually updates 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.220
 on your phones come at apple you have 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.170
 this problem not so if a new one 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.449
 operating system is there then is the whole 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.820
 bad on all devices on it so this 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.570
 case support therefore we know 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.400
 that as not as special as as 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.500
 Android user of course you have to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.360
 distinguish it gives the android user 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.280
 who do not have me in the google phone 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 special a samsung that is of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.379
 not another manufacturer 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.020
 Google is because I have so far 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.010
 There is always some type of google in there 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.739
 cooperation with a manufacturer 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.719
 has produced and then actually that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.530
 all google forum sales or 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.809
 nexus and i want this video 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 Accordingly, out today frieda 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.010
 Rumors about new nexus phone year 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.739
 I like pretty much in the last time 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.780
 keep strong and not just first 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.180
 but also as I said so one 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.270
 new update from google so by android 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.070
 system 4.2 or 5.0 you never know 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.229
 exactly what in each case the code name 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:22.830
 small is going to contribute now is that way 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.020
 The concepts have always only been understood by us 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.570
 It was made by a manufacturer 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.030
 But it seems that this year is over 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.920
 would change the matter a bit 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:37.710
 and that max out one speaks 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.720
 by lg one speaks of samsung man 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.840
 speaks of motorola and one speaks 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.790
 maybe even from the htc that the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.490
 each with its own nexus phone 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.110
 should rausbringen or become white 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.729
 it's not exactly true yet 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.040
 only rumors i'm not based on 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.720
 own knowledge but the war so the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.130
 rumor mill seething in the last 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.680
 exact time on this subject now to 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.409
 effective tasting problem if I 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.360
 as an android user nexus phone 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.569
 but any of one of many 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.950
 Manufacturer side htc samsung st 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.139
 or whatever it is 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.230
 I get the updates much first 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:27.450
 so later than the nexus force will get 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:30.389
 as an example the update berlin 1.1.0 the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.859
 is yes in june I believe announced 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.439
 it was then the end of june at the beginning of july 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.810
 came out and was practically on 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.510
 same day or week later 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.189
 all nexus funds at all 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.480
 the whole world 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:47.849
 I have the flagship of 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.669
 samsung so the galaxy s3 that's one 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.949
 the most important phones for samsung and 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.790
 I still have that from jelly bean update 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:56.430
 nothing seen 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.310
 So it should come to pay soon 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.750
 the poland already has it 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.319
 next week probably on 19 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.680
 october the korean 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.420
 here carriers will get the update 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.900
 and then then the rest of the world 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.879
 so i had daniel's four months on 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.650
 an update waiting for him what practical 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.379
 One day later at all 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.750
 Mobile phones on this is a huge problem 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.670
 at android the problem gets worse 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.859
 then even if I'm not the flagship 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.810
 from a manufacturer but have 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:32.430
 as well a second class philip plagge 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.919
 be it a samsung galaxy s2 now 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.700
 then again, a place 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.560
 was open 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.359
 what maybe the jelly bean 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.370
 update gets but then much first 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.599
 much later at htc you know that 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.400
 especially because htc really 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.949
 known as ruler because the ATIB 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.439
 very very slowly apply that 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.090
 flagship currently at htc was android 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.120
 is the htc evo ix 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.629
 that's the most important thing 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.519
 Mobile phone for HTC currently 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.859
 then there's this https or reply 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.719
 So the smaller variants not so 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.609
 because we are not that right 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:10.370
 Flagships are the update 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.659
 probably also flying but first 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.280
 end of this year or maybe even 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.789
 start 2013 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.849
 that's the whole story with android 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.620
 update is so extremely slow I hope and 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.240
 I wish for the future that 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.009
 google and manufacturer more 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.900
 I therefore welcome cooperation 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.340
 the fact that probably several 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.190
 different google nexus phone 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.659
 to come out 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.190
 there you can see that the 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.349
 cooperation so the will to 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.090
 there is cooperation that is there 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.009
 Google really multiplies more with the 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.539
 manufacturers want to work together 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.070
 and accordingly the updates 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.470
 faster apply the joke to the 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.270
 nexus phone is actually that 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.380
 android so do not have to nonsense 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.210
 like me on this I have me too 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.889
 convince here so this touch with 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.509
 system 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.940
 I have to say it's not like that 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.699
 I do not like it or anything but it works 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.520
 me that really the whole 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.840
 update policy aggravates and 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.180
 slows down there if an update 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.740
 informative samsung the system must as 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.599
 it is and then also his needs 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.430
 must adapt or the 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.110
 whole software needs to adapt to it 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.720
 then also intensively with the patch joke 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.069
 with the touchwiz surface 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.629
 I therefore welcome this enormous 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.009
 cooperation between google and the 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.479
 different manufacturers and me 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.069
 hope for the future that the 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.919
 it gets even stronger if you do 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:29.680
 really if possible on surfaces 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.419
 dispensed with and just go through it 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.789
 Just put out a word like that 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.520
 that would be the whole process enormously 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.780
 fast and the profit updates a lot 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.389
 Much faster I sound my there 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.990
 still the phones still with the 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.500
 version 2.3 or so from android im 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.690
 run 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.190
 what is it all about nowadays 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.139
 do not love that I'm not talking 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.699
 from cell phones somehow three years ago 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.530
 comes out in but it's enough already 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.300
 a year or a half years back 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.530
 So important old hang is but the 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.090
 will simply not update anymore 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.069
 because it is no longer worth it for the 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.630
 manufacturer actually the system like that 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:06.819
 to adapt it then actually on 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.409
 the preliminary phone also the me what 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.360
 I can really still care about many 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.219
 do not say that much except that 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.449
 really probably that 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.729
 Android system will be what then 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.759
 effectively still running on the new lexus 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:23.110
 you will have heard such a few rumors 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:26.530
 to the lg nexus that apparently lg 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.150
 I am optimus nexus 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.530
 do not assume that we then the 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.880
 full but I do not assume 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.659
 It is under the name on the 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.110
 I think the market is rather as a 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:39.210
 optimist nexus or lg optimus ex being 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.710
 optimistic a nice sounding name 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.250
 under which one also gets such a device 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.250
 can market 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.190
 I would appreciate it if the 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.069
 Comments would be what you write about 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:57.340
 the update policy of android hero too 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:59.710
 be his and what you at best 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.509
 hoped for a new nexus phone too 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.419
 So what should be in there 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:09.039
 that is to bring negligence and what 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:10.659
 So you hope the new system 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:13.569
 should the team be harmed what should 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:16.870
 Things are different about jenny or ice cream 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:19.770
 sandwich that was so far from her and up 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.770
 next time adiÃ³s
