hello<00:00:00.870> in<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.410> leo<00:00:01.680> rhythm<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.340> be<00:00:02.399> making<00:00:02.669> a

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hello in this leo rhythm to be making a

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.190 
hello in this leo rhythm to be making a
difference<00:00:03.330> between<00:00:03.449> hard<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.319> soft<00:00:04.410> water

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
difference between hard and soft water

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.950 
difference between hard and soft water
so<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:08.220> bit<00:00:08.490> early<00:00:08.730> very<00:00:09.000> poorly<00:00:09.360> drawn

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
so this is a bit early very poorly drawn

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.009 
so this is a bit early very poorly drawn
map<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.639> depending<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.360> which<00:00:12.480> area<00:00:12.900> of

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
map and and depending on which area of

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.629 
map and and depending on which area of
the<00:00:13.170> country<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.980> live<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.549> that

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the country that you live in and that

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.099 
the country that you live in and that
you're<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> different

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
you're going to have a different

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.429 
you're going to have a different
hardness<00:00:16.949> or<00:00:17.130> water<00:00:17.779> so<00:00:18.779> down<00:00:19.760> here<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.439> where

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
hardness or water so down here and where

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.179 
hardness or water so down here and where
I<00:00:22.619> am<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.100> water<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.519> very<00:00:23.730> very<00:00:23.939> hard<00:00:24.300> I'm

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
I am the water is very very hard I'm

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.000 
I am the water is very very hard I'm
completely<00:00:26.189> different<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.349> say<00:00:28.349> over<00:00:28.920> in

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
completely different to say over in

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.420 
completely different to say over in
Wales<00:00:29.869> or<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.230> Scotland<00:00:31.470> where<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> water

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
Wales or up in Scotland where the water

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.170 
Wales or up in Scotland where the water
is<00:00:32.579> actually<00:00:32.820> quite<00:00:33.180> soft<00:00:34.670> you<00:00:35.670> will<00:00:35.880> notice

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
is actually quite soft you will notice

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180 
is actually quite soft you will notice
the<00:00:36.510> difference<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.860> when<00:00:38.010> you're

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the difference and what when you're

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.000 
the difference and what when you're
shampooing<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.790> hair<00:00:38.940> soft<00:00:39.899> water<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.620> goes

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
shampooing your hair soft water and goes

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.280 
shampooing your hair soft water and goes
up<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> leather<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.910> quite<00:00:42.600> easily<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.079> you

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
up to leather and quite easily so you

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.549 
up to leather and quite easily so you
need<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.860> use<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> tiny<00:00:44.340> bit<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.670> champagne<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
need to use a tiny bit of champagne to

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
need to use a tiny bit of champagne to
get<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> nice<00:00:46.800> famous<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.489> your<00:00:47.640> head<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.940> the

get a nice famous of your head and the
hard<00:00:48.629> water<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.559> need<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:50.010> quite<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> large

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
hard water you need to use quite a large

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.790 
hard water you need to use quite a large
am<00:00:50.760> p<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.270> t<00:00:51.899> able<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> same<00:00:52.559> leather

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
on top of your head because it doesn't

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.510 
on top of your head because it doesn't
and<00:00:54.660> lather<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.110> quite<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.469> well<00:00:55.620> same<00:00:56.309> with

and lather up quite as well same with

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
and lather up quite as well same with
soap<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:57.930> notice<00:00:58.199> there's

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
soap and you will notice there's

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.380 
soap and you will notice there's
probably<00:00:59.280> give<00:00:59.430> me<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> difference<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.120> taste

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
probably give me a difference in a taste

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.070 
probably give me a difference in a taste
of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.050> tea<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:02.190> you're<00:01:02.309> drinking<00:01:02.930> part<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
of the tea that you're drinking part and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.469 
of the tea that you're drinking part and
supported<00:01:04.589> tastes<00:01:04.830> different<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> which<00:01:06.330> is

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
supported tastes different and which is

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.039 
supported tastes different and which is
why<00:01:06.979> yorkshire<00:01:07.979> tea<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.780> especially<00:01:09.780> made<00:01:09.990> for

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
why yorkshire tea is especially made for

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.390 
why yorkshire tea is especially made for
hard<00:01:10.680> water<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:12.390> get<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> different

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
hard water and you get a different

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.249 
hard water and you get a different
variations<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.670> how<00:01:15.360> different<00:01:15.780> things<00:01:15.869> taste

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
variations in how different things taste

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.380 
variations in how different things taste
how<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.860> water<00:01:17.189> coming<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.700> attacks<00:01:18.030> taste

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
how the water coming out attacks taste

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.499 
how the water coming out attacks taste
in<00:01:18.720> different<00:01:19.110> parts<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.530> country<00:01:19.710> and

in different parts of the country and

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.810 
in different parts of the country and
you<00:01:21.509> also<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> difference<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.820> earning

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you also get a difference in earning

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.090 
you also get a difference in earning
kettles<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.049> i<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> really<00:01:25.830> big<00:01:26.070> problem

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that the bottom of my castle is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.069 
that the bottom of my castle is
constantly<00:01:29.189> covered<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.880> Life<00:01:30.090> Scout<00:01:30.270> knife<00:01:30.720> d

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
limescale my kettle my washing machine

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.920 
limescale my kettle my washing machine
my<00:01:33.869> dishwasher<00:01:34.939> basically<00:01:35.939> every<00:01:36.450> two<00:01:36.689> weeks

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
my dishwasher basically every two weeks

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.410 
my dishwasher basically every two weeks
otherwise<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.740> they<00:01:38.640> would<00:01:38.820> start<00:01:39.119> stop

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
otherwise and they would start stop

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.660 
otherwise and they would start stop
working<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.409> soft<00:01:40.680> water<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.280> don't<00:01:41.430> have

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
working it is soft water you don't have

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.050 
working it is soft water you don't have
this<00:01:41.820> problem<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:44.070> water<00:01:44.250> hardness<00:01:44.640> comes

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
this problem so water hardness comes

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.999 
this problem so water hardness comes
from<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.720> types<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.259> ions<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.950> are

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
from the types of ions that are

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.340 
from the types of ions that are
dissolved<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> water<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.659> hard<00:01:48.960> water<00:01:49.140> is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
dissolved in the water so hard water is

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.010 
dissolved in the water so hard water is
very<00:01:49.530> high<00:01:49.770> concentrations<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:50.880> group<00:01:51.509> two

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
very high concentrations or group two

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.940 
very high concentrations or group two
ions<00:01:52.530> here<00:01:53.040> safely<00:01:53.880> calcium<00:01:54.780> t<00:01:55.439> plus<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
ions here safely calcium t plus and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.280 
ions here safely calcium t plus and
magnesium<00:01:56.640> two<00:01:56.850> plus<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.329> they<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:58.079> less

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
magnesium two plus and they get less

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.420 
magnesium two plus and they get less
water<00:01:58.710> from<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.790> rocks<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.869> here<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> cut

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
water from the rocks so here is a cut

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.200 
water from the rocks so here is a cut
out<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.240> slice<00:02:03.750> down<00:02:04.729> into<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> grounds

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
out that a slice down into the grounds

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.900 
out that a slice down into the grounds
and<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.930> put<00:02:07.170> Dave<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.409> there<00:02:07.890> because<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.610> good

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and I put Dave on there because a good

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.160 
and I put Dave on there because a good
visual<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> White<00:02:09.690> Cliffs<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.080> Dover

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170

I'm<00:02:11.770> sure<00:02:12.130> some<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.730> are<00:02:12.910> familiar<00:02:13.060> with

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
I'm sure some of you are familiar with

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.830 
I'm sure some of you are familiar with
pictures<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.400> those<00:02:15.400> big<00:02:15.640> white<00:02:15.819> cliffs<00:02:16.209> which

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
pictures of those big white cliffs which

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.479 
pictures of those big white cliffs which
goes<00:02:17.050> straight<00:02:17.319> down<00:02:17.349> into<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.130> beach<00:02:18.280> one

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
goes straight down into the beach one

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.390 
goes straight down into the beach one
see<00:02:18.880> that's<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.780> chalk<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.680> limestone

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
see that's the chalk and the limestone

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.180 
see that's the chalk and the limestone
that<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.970> white<00:02:22.239> color<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.410> we<00:02:23.530> can<00:02:23.709> see<00:02:24.010> and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that the white color that we can see and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.190 
that the white color that we can see and
then<00:02:24.700> when<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> rain<00:02:25.360> water<00:02:25.630> comes<00:02:26.050> down

making beer the calcium in the water is

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.270 
making beer the calcium in the water is
good<00:03:00.340> for<00:03:00.700> our<00:03:00.730> teeth<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.540> our<00:03:01.690> bones<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.500> the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
things getting into the water and if you

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.500 
things getting into the water and if you
just<00:03:12.519> want<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.819> use<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.180> need<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.420> know

just want to use that you need to know

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.940 
just want to use that you need to know
about<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:14.290> as<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.440> mentioned<00:03:14.470> four<00:03:14.920> it's

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
about and so as I mentioned four it's

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.849 
about and so as I mentioned four it's
really<00:03:15.459> difficult<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:16.180> another<00:03:16.450> soap<00:03:16.859> relax

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
really difficult to another soap relax

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.830 
really difficult to another soap relax
shampoo<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.670> I'm<00:03:18.760> using<00:03:18.940> quite<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.329> lot<00:03:19.630> which

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
shampoo and I'm using quite a lot which

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.349 
shampoo and I'm using quite a lot which
can<00:03:20.109> be<00:03:20.290> expensive<00:03:20.940> you're<00:03:21.940> literally

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
can be expensive you're literally

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.479 
can be expensive you're literally
pouring<00:03:22.989> money<00:03:23.230> down<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.620> dry<00:03:23.799> money<00:03:24.070> do<00:03:24.250> this

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
pouring money down the dry money do this

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.780 
pouring money down the dry money do this

important in can be formed inside the
kettle<00:03:30.700> which<00:03:31.239> means<00:03:31.480> you'll<00:03:31.630> end<00:03:31.870> up<00:03:31.930> with

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
kettle which means you'll end up with

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.190 
kettle which means you'll end up with
bits<00:03:32.320> in<00:03:32.470> your<00:03:32.590> tea<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.180> can<00:03:34.329> also<00:03:34.450> form<00:03:34.870> on

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
bits in your tea and it can also form on

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.640 
bits in your tea and it can also form on
the<00:03:35.530> inside<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:35.980> pipes<00:03:36.910> hot<00:03:37.780> water<00:03:37.930> pipes<00:03:38.260> this

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
the inside of pipes hot water pipes this

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.370 
the inside of pipes hot water pipes this
causes<00:03:39.130> problem<00:03:39.640> in<00:03:40.000> boilers<00:03:40.630> they<00:03:40.959> can<00:03:41.109> break

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
causes problem in boilers they can break

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.800 
causes problem in boilers they can break
and<00:03:41.739> because<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.640> scale<00:03:42.940> formed<00:03:43.269> inside<00:03:43.420> them

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
and because the scale formed inside them

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.740 
and because the scale formed inside them
I<00:03:44.019> can<00:03:44.260> also<00:03:44.410> block<00:03:44.709> under<00:03:45.220> sinks<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.030> drains

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
I can also block under sinks and drains

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.270 
I can also block under sinks and drains
so<00:03:49.410> there<00:03:49.800> are<00:03:49.830> two<00:03:50.010> different<00:03:50.160> types

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
so there are two different types

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.520 
so there are two different types
particle<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> temporary<00:03:51.570> hard<00:03:51.720> water<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.440> a

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
particle to a temporary hard water and a

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410 
particle to a temporary hard water and a
permanent<00:03:52.950> hard<00:03:53.130> water<00:03:53.310> intel<00:03:54.150> difference

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
permanent hard water intel difference

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.970 
permanent hard water intel difference
between<00:03:54.750> them<00:03:54.900> because<00:03:55.200> temporary<00:03:55.590> hard<00:03:55.800> work

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
between them because temporary hard work

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.240 
between them because temporary hard work
that<00:03:56.220> water<00:03:56.640> can<00:03:57.060> be<00:03:57.090> suffering<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.720> boil<00:03:58.350> so

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
that water can be suffering to boil so

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.310 
that water can be suffering to boil so
this<00:03:59.640> is<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.880> example<00:04:00.120> for<00:04:00.540> calcium<00:04:00.990> ions

this<00:04:23.610> bit<00:04:23.970> here<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:25.110> lime<00:04:25.290> scale<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.830> we

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
this bit here is the lime scale and we

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.250 
this bit here is the lime scale and we
can<00:04:26.130> tell<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:26.760> from<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.480> equation<00:04:27.750> because

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
can tell this from the equation because

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.470 
can tell this from the equation because
this<00:04:28.590> here<00:04:28.860> straight<00:04:29.370> cymbal<00:04:29.610> tells<00:04:30.030> us<00:04:30.240> it's

this here straight cymbal tells us it's
solid<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.950> we're<00:04:32.070> going<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.250> be<00:04:32.310> looking<00:04:32.430> for

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
solid so we're going to be looking for

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.360 
solid so we're going to be looking for
them<00:04:33.090> in<00:04:33.300> solid<00:04:33.720> form<00:04:33.750> in<00:04:34.140> civitate<00:04:34.650> in<00:04:35.100> this

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
them in solid form in civitate in this

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.070 
them in solid form in civitate in this
case<00:04:35.580> it's<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.880> limes<00:04:36.150> down<00:04:36.450> at<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.930> bottom

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
case it's the limes down at the bottom

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.470 
case it's the limes down at the bottom
of<00:04:37.860> your<00:04:37.919> kettle<00:04:38.520> or<00:04:38.850> in<00:04:39.120> your<00:04:39.270> washing

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
of your kettle or in your washing

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.240 
of your kettle or in your washing
machine<00:04:39.630> or<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.169> dishwasher<00:04:40.650> or<00:04:40.950> wherever

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
machine or the dishwasher or wherever

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.960 
machine or the dishwasher or wherever
you're<00:04:41.310> heating<00:04:41.580> water<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.740> then<00:04:43.740> this<00:04:44.220> water

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
you're heating water and then this water

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.510 
you're heating water and then this water
has<00:04:45.360> now<00:04:45.600> been<00:04:45.780> softened<00:04:46.310> because<00:04:47.310> we've

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
has now been softened because we've

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.180 
has now been softened because we've
removed<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.300> eyes<00:04:48.690> are<00:04:49.110> making<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:49.560> hard<00:04:49.590> and

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
removed the eyes are making it hard and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.670 
removed the eyes are making it hard and
we<00:04:50.490> put<00:04:50.700> them<00:04:50.730> into<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.390> solid<00:04:51.660> lime<00:04:52.110> scale<00:04:52.410> so

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
we put them into the solid lime scale so

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.150 
we put them into the solid lime scale so
they're<00:04:52.860> no<00:04:53.010> longer<00:04:53.190> dissolved<00:04:53.760> in<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.910> water

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
they're no longer dissolved in the water

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.350 
they're no longer dissolved in the water
another<00:04:56.160> way<00:04:56.280> we<00:04:56.490> can<00:04:56.640> remove<00:04:56.910> hardens<00:04:57.300> when

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
another way we can remove hardens when

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.420 
another way we can remove hardens when
water<00:04:57.600> is<00:04:57.750> by<00:04:58.020> using<00:04:58.169> an<00:04:58.530> ion<00:04:58.890> exchange<00:04:59.250> column

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
water is by using an ion exchange column

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.760 
water is by using an ion exchange column
so<00:05:00.090> here<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.419> have<00:05:00.450> a<00:05:00.750> column<00:05:01.140> that<00:05:01.169> is<00:05:01.410> packed

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
so here I have a column that is packed

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.960 
so here I have a column that is packed
with<00:05:02.070> sodium<00:05:03.060> ions<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:04.040> carbonate<00:05:05.040> ions<00:05:05.400> when

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
with sodium ions and carbonate ions when

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.510 
with sodium ions and carbonate ions when
we<00:05:06.180> put<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.960> hard<00:05:07.380> water<00:05:07.590> through<00:05:07.950> it<00:05:07.979> the

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
we put the hard water through it the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.820 
we put the hard water through it the
magnesium<00:05:09.000> ions<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.900> calcium<00:05:10.320> ions<00:05:10.590> going<00:05:10.770> to

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
magnesium ions the calcium ions going to

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.670 
magnesium ions the calcium ions going to
kind<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.070> swap<00:05:11.370> places<00:05:11.550> with<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.140> Sonia

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
kind of swap places with it the Sonia

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.320 
kind of swap places with it the Sonia
mornings<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.280> we're<00:05:14.550> going<00:05:14.669> to<00:05:14.760> get<00:05:14.850> outcome

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
mornings and we're going to get outcome

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.820 
mornings and we're going to get outcome
calcium<00:05:16.080> carbonate<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.680> magnesium
