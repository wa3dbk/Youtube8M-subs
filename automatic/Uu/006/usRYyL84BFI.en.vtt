00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.030
 wonderfully good day marko marin l here 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.510
 with a new test and check video i 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.740
 look at a mirror ball today 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.500
 I have the candidate here from 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.480
 eurolite in execution 50 cm 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.120
 This mirror ball also makes in 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.250
 bigger trucks super fun 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.550
 if it is lit up properly 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.580
 with a pin spot or a led spot 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.710
 moving heads the disco ball is one 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.989
 the oldest lighting effects if one 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.159
 Master our parents already look back 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.900
 at that time in discos or in 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.170
 dancecafés already hang a mirror ball 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.239
 has in the fifties sixties 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.890
 up to date like mirror ball and if 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.070
 you look at the clubs today 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.320
 hanging mirror ball partly so huge 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.120
 big two meter ball 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.400
 I 'm here for a 50 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.159
 centimeter ball appeared and I am 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.299
 just as enthusiastic about the many 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.920
 small stars 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.100
 which spread in the room when the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.110
 what will light up me 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.210
 pretty at the eurolite mirror ball 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.940
 I like the user manual 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.970
 is in german and contains all 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.100
 safety-relevant answers 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.440
 ask how I got the ball 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.130
 hang up what motors can I 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.980
 You can find all that here 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.010
 exactly described and I think that's good 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.860
 because security especially with hanging 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.180
 share is the a and o one 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.250
 event technology and eurolite 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.170
 everything is correct 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.780
 you in the manual everything is in it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.790
 and we'll have a look at the ball im 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.840
 detail what security 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.250
 characteristics actually such a 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.610
 mirror ball nowadays has up here 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.160
 you see two solve once 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.770
 Solve this is the main thesis where you 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.640
 the chain could penetrate the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.580
 Whole engine goes this evil is one 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.460
 stuck axis that goes through the core 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.110
 through and from below then that is 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.900
 Gegenstück I'll show you when I am 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.580
 Turn this around here you see the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.709
 The axis is there even two or three times 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.040
 screwed goes completely through it 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.350
 the ball well because you can not crash 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.520
 and that next to it 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.400
 this release is simply the hedge 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.950
 for a second chain with it too 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.390
 really everything is safe if you are the one 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.860
 balls your traverse 1 hangs that was 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.290
 again the test and check 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.540
 here today I hope he has one 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.459
 get small stimulation and the necessary 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.430
 Help for your purchase decision one 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.880
 mirror ball you get me say 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.420
