this is battery powered as a button and
up<00:01:40.439> top<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.860> actually<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.159> hook<00:01:41.369> sharpener<00:01:41.790> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
up top is actually a hook sharpener I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.730 
up top is actually a hook sharpener I
don't<00:01:42.030> use<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.659> know<00:01:43.020> some<00:01:43.259> guys<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
don't use it I know some guys that you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.670 
don't use it I know some guys that you
use<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> basically<00:01:44.460> spins<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:46.500> kinda

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
use it but it basically spins it's kinda

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.160 
use it but it basically spins it's kinda
hard<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> main<00:01:48.090> thing<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.140> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
hard to see but the main thing of it is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.780 
hard to see but the main thing of it is
you<00:01:49.320> stick<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.770> line<00:01:49.979> through<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
you stick your line through here and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
you stick your line through here and
it'll<00:01:51.390> strip<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> line<00:01:52.259> off<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:53.600> reel<00:01:54.600> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
it'll strip the line off of your reel so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.149 
it'll strip the line off of your reel so

I was going to show you exactly kind of

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:56.870

how it works

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.789 
how it works
I<00:01:56.909> believe<00:01:57.360> they're<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.659> 10<00:01:57.930> 15<00:01:58.079> bucks<00:01:58.770> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
I believe they're like 10 15 bucks I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.830 
I believe they're like 10 15 bucks I
don't<00:01:59.610> really<00:01:59.790> hold<00:01:59.909> me<00:02:00.030> against<00:02:00.360> Stig's<00:02:00.600> an

don't really hold me against Stig's an

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.080 
don't really hold me against Stig's an
exact<00:02:01.170> price<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.579> definitely<00:02:02.790> worth

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
exact price but it's definitely worth

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.179 
exact price but it's definitely worth

there you go you can see I just took off
about<00:02:58.519> 150<00:02:59.519> yards<00:02:59.670> of<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.599> just

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
about 150 yards of this is just

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.350 
about 150 yards of this is just
monofilament<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:02.640> know<00:03:02.730> close<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.000> 30

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
monofilament and you know close to 30

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.059 
monofilament and you know close to 30
seconds<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.349> would<00:03:04.470> have<00:03:04.560> taken<00:03:04.800> you
