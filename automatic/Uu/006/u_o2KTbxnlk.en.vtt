 Hi there, you're on the channel 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:17.880
 valerian and today i will do for you 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.619
 overview on the palette from 144 colors in general 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.630
 I received this palette in November 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.609
 of the month from the VKontakte beauty group 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.800
 boutique i won her in a contest 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.080
 link to the beauty boutique group I 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.480
 leave in the description for this video 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.399
 but somehow it happened that I still 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 did not deign to actually this video 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.989
 make and clear can explain why 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.149
 because first there are new year packs 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.879
 the video then left from not boiling you had 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.469
 the flags are now vlogs run out and i can 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.840
 mind in this palette tell better 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.520
 late than never first would i like 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.379
 say a few words about how actually 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.690
 beauty boutique did not deliver this palette 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.340
 I have to say that the band is based 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.960
 so that they are none 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.219
 the item does not send Russia mail 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.579
 accordingly does not threaten you 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.070
 one hundred percent of your things will be intact 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.439
 and preservation without chipping without cuts then 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.159
 what you ordered will all come in perfect 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.689
 condition 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.520
 it is very convenient because 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.720
 that example my palette was packed 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.640
 let's say how not quite as it were around the core 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 in a box there is no 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 without any cardboard and she found 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.400
 in perfect condition that is nowhere 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.860
 nothing broke up did not break away 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.080
 scratching itself reticulation then came a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.369
 here is a branded box yes that is 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.380
 matt box here on 144 and colors 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.400
 chain color of the river written by new however 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.619
 new yes 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.170
 everything is very seriously written behind 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.240
 Description of the composition and the palette itself is 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.670
 view format that is neither erased 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.130
 on animals the packaging of the palette is also very 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.890
 good by itself so well not exactly 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.689
 rugged but not quite hill and of course 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.790
 bring her somewhere will be very 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.220
 problematic i already see it like this i 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.619
 I do it because it will be very hard 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.149
 because for example when i paint yes 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.880
 that is, here I open the lid as if 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.740
 big turn and that is so here i am 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.439
 I'm afraid to leave it on weight seems to me that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.329
 she fights just saying therefore always 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.640
 and you have to support yourself 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.500
 the palette is right here is solid all refill 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.390
 and all are attached perfect 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.100
 where nothing staggers all falls out 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.630
 it came so it should come now 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.610
 I wanted to tell you a little bit with 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.680
 you in the shadows almost all of these not from 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.690
 pallets are similar in application properties 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.670
 unless 23 any absolutely 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.530
 unsuccessful shade is different 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.290
 the first is of course pigmentation 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.820
 pigmentation here is top notch then 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.740
 there you can put the shadows straight without 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.280
 bases all the same everything will be bright saturated 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.480
 the shadows do not crumble and do not roll down 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.370
 some of the shadows have cream 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.080
 texture so all your 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.000
 applying make-up turns into 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.310
 pleasant pastime the shadows hold on 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.770
 all day well shaded and 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.840
 mixed together it is very convenient 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.410
 when creating any complex makeup 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.820
 and the shadows have no smell I do not know someone 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.680
 it will certainly be a big plus 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.170
 shadows are applied equally well as 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.030
 brushes as sponzhas and just 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.430
 fingers that is in this problem in general 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.830
 No, and they are also washed away just ordinary 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.780
 There soap even yes well and any or 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.940
 special makeup products of course 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.220
 I would like to say a few words about themselves 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.860
 colors i mean this one i'm the most 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.540
 let's say so much love and which one 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.650
 actually acceptable my favorite ranks 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.840
 these are these two 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.760
 and here these here 4 it seems to me it is quite 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.090
 understandable because the patient's mind color 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.430
 which an amateur is used or 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.989
 super rare three or she simply does not 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.709
 love occupied very likes green 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.540
 shade yes i prefer honey honey 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.070
 sand palettes are actually available 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.350
 absolutely all colors that can 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.049
 handy girls in the rank of sign for 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.760
 lifelong that is for the day you can 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.260
 use there yes here's the top one not there 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.870
 slightly brighter lower here 3 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.549
 darker that is bright for the evening if 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.200
 some kind of up there special some 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.600
 solemn occasion yes or just there 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.480
 on some photo shoot 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.180
 the palette in my opinion can change 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.579
 absolutely all the shadows of a girl for life 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.560
 the cost of this palette thousand 400 rubles 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.560
 what in my opinion one hundred and forty four colors 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.170
 very inexpensive at all in my plans 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.360
 there are generally so little idea to buy yet 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.220
 know they are called zid flight that is 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.690
 such are the magnetic little palettes 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.479
 and I just want to be stupid 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.230
 you are the cows and colors i like and 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.130
 carry with them constantly in 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.950
 use because it's so much 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.690
 good shadows 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.370
 I always use here for example when 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.200
 there was see really wanted to take 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.510
 from here a couple of denyushku 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.210
 I can't wear this entire trip with 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.320
 yourself you understand therefore yes i would 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.800
 advised in general 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:41.480
 especially the one who lu well let's say no longer 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.580
 novice user up to cosmetics but but not 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.250
 advanced that is the one who started here 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.080
 already use you can buy yourself 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.210
 Here is the order to buy a magnetic 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.740
 palette and quietly in the carriage 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.840
 use because it's real 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.790
 very cool shadows which i recommend 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.620
 I myself didn’t expect that to everyone 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.570
 so cool this palette because 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.300
 they are usually Chinese but this is Nikita 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.490
 This is America in my elf produces 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.200
 very cool thing i forgot you 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.790
 show my favorite colors i want 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.440
 mark your favorite color first is 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.230
 here this is such a shortbread 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.660
 in general, all the colors are very bright yes you 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.880
 I have already seen somewhere on the sweeper I'm still learning 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.690
 I love this golden one 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.750
 gold is gold and probably this one 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.850
 here he goes so pink but for 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.130
 Latin from this palette can 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.640
 feel free to make urban decay naked 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.650
 absolutely any nakid 1 2 or 3 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.680
 because there is so much here 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.840
 sand shades generally leave 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.580
 I mean, I think that 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.670
 principle every girl can allow 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.560
 currently buy for 1400 rubles attacking 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.750
 huge palette and more basically already 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.340
 Do not buy shadows for at least three years. 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.760
 I want to say that with the advent of this 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.470
 palettes and probably half a year has passed 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.930
 less probably never again 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.970
 I bought myself these times because 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.490
 here the reality is all the shades that I 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.800
 may ever really come in handy very 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.540
 cool thing I really recommend it 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.370
 I advise everyone to go to this group. 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.400
 they send beauty boutique all over 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.350
 Russia and even in my abroad there before 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.180
 Ukraine yes here are countries such as there 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.360
 you can find such products that we have 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.860
 no fall i mean there will be carmix and 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.840
 eyes and these lip balms 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.150
 round there sold a lot 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.670
 cosmetics from elf generally by the way for 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.130
 border cosmetics elf considered super 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.620
 budget I do not know why it is considered so 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.139
 us, it is not whether 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:36.280
 I went to the official site of the elf and 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.800
 there that is concealer 2 dollars lipstick 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.880
 dollar i mean i don't know you with 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.440
 pleasure lived in america 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.970
 use this makeup because 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.520
 judging by the shadows I can say that this 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.740
 high-quality cosmetics cheap and very 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.080
 cool here and so a little bit strange and 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.750
 I didn’t blow the elf palette I hope 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.130
 you do something for yourself to get well, not looked carefully 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.080
 I just liked to look at 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.030
 beautiful shade ears beautiful louder i 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.800

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.810
 love kissing hug 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.639
 go to the beauty boutique group there 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.780
