00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.760 
out of this guy I do it with this
drawing<00:01:10.030> because<00:01:10.450> this<00:01:10.810> draw<00:01:11.079> helps<00:01:11.469> to

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
drawing because this draw helps to

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.639 
drawing because this draw helps to
really<00:01:12.310> direct<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.259> ones<00:01:14.409> that<00:01:14.590> you

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
really direct it is the ones that you

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.120 
really direct it is the ones that you
saw<00:01:14.979> fly<00:01:15.250> away<00:01:15.549> came<00:01:15.820> out<00:01:15.969> the<00:01:16.119> back<00:01:16.299> end<00:01:17.130> out
