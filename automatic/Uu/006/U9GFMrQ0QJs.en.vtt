00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.950
 make an exception to that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.360
 look this is the case and that doing 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.670

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.250
 what man can do is sewn very much 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.260
 things don't and it determines and how feel 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.550

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.640

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.719
 although with a jar 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.350
 apple just got it done 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.509
 got 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.009
 the iphone is made in china they go 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.540
 so bad with the employees there because 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.980
 they have to sign a contract that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.000
 they do not commit suicide 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.920
 but the one with the staff is if you do 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.870
 but she does it for each other 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.000
 she earned 80 billion on that shit 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.069

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.349
 sign that it is possible 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 just terrible that that 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.260

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.959
 conscience has given up yes that's what 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.370
 happens 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.989
 so pretty difficult to measure I can tell you 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.709
 tell that I still bully like that 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.780
 the world goes on 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.760
 They have that old apple you exercise 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.390
 deserves effort and didn't and it 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.790

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.710

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.090

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.010
 pull the cyclist's feminine and then 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.180
 at night and then it is always certain 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.480
