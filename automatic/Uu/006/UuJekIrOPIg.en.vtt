00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.429
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.809
 okay today I have a video a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.520
 little bit special and a little bit 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.020
 unusual is also something that 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.240
 I did not know on the map that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.039
 of you want 80% do not know 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.060
 it's just at a door here so I know 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.350
 that there are some who know but there are some 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.029
 still many who do not know 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.010
 how to get into the reserve 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.420
 federal bank 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.500
 so you will really smile that's 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.579
 that I did not think we could do 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.780
 so this door it allows you 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.210
 simply to be able to ride in 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.620
 an upper floor and to be able to access 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.230
 a little bit at the office of all that is 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.489
 hide in the reserve so frankly 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.079
 I was surprised how to access 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.969
 safes of the federal bank 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.039
 so we will continue a little bit 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.079
 way my case it's close mans 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.940
 decorations are extremely well come I 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.690
 found that frankly the marble on the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.930
 walls the paintings the decorations a little 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.609
 little fooled frankly that gives it spring 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.140
 super good so yes if you have any 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.939
 closed offices how do you open them 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 take sticky bombs for you 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.630
 ask them to stick them all 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.710
 simply on the doors of course 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.880
 now you will not endorse 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.080
 right now you will put yourself a 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.090
 little bit immune 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.350
 I'm waiting a little bit for you 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.330
 be clear and now you 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.430
 operate and here you are in the offices 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.810
 so that's the first step so in 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.490
 going back to the offices you think 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.080
 to have something sadly he 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.210
 there is nothing so that's what I thought 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.920
 actually in power by going to open 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.570
 some offices that I was going to collect 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.640
 for example safes and that's 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.840
 small boxes I speak finally I 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.479
 do not start from the big safes of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.590
 small enclosures or a certain value 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.560
 with jewels etc 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.700
 so unfortunately nothing so that's 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.009
 a little bit scary so you go 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.899
 find you here is super bowl and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.229
 frankly beautiful scenery I have nothing 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.049
 to say 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.329
 so there is a vault at the bottom 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.119
 so how to access I was surprised 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.700
 that the door is closed there are just 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:05.300
 a thing to do so does star you 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.950
 go to loose market online 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.330
 you simply go to market 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.340
 xbox makes you yes frankly times 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.930
 it's pretty stupid stuff so I 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.100
 do not know how come people 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.420
 they come to find that kind of 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.730
 things in fact I'm still 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.130
 surprised there is so much bullshit in 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.930
 can we discover on gta 5 game 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.730
 unfortunately every game that is going to be 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.410
 done now is going to be squarely at 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.450
 square feet my cottage and it's really 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.530
 pity but what are you 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.970
 want us to do it now it's 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.140
 like that if there are always people we go 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.730
 to say it's clever in programming 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.650
 who manages to thwart the protections 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.230
 So, here is just below, so I 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.180
 am in the room at the room that was 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.170
 locked that I could not access 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.700
 which you have seen frankly is a 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.420
 not stupid so but here in the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.720
 room of safe 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.230
 so the famous chest that is really 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.240
 nice not bad at all no 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.010
 so what do you think of this room 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.570
 of chests 1 do not hesitate to tell me 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.640
 really in the comments roissy 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.350
 what's this stuff of phew and everything is there in 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.960
 does it will open it so of course 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.830
 so it's less like an idiot 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.160
 still not understand how that 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.030
 opened up I put a little bit of time 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.920
 to be able to feed 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.270
 of course I prefer to see this video in 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.230
 putting time why I say that 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.310
 because I know there are some who are going 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.209
 to arrive first time others 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.530
 much less 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.239
 they will put a little bit more 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.140
 time it will allow you to see that you 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.870
 are not the soils of 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.920
 the universe has struggled on some stuff 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.030
 that it is we will first say 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.110
 youtuber also who is planting who is 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.850
 to always arrive to show you the 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.080
 perfection like that if for example seven 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.830
 porters do not suffer you 're not going 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.450
 tell me in the comments 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.950
 but I did not understand it does not open 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.420
 the door by month you would see how 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.150
 I proceeded to open the strong 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.290
 and it may be td and if that 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.730
 that they succeeded the first time 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.170
 all the better for you so I shoot I 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.070
 so pulls sometimes she suffers times 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.540
 they do not open right away 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.950
 so according to you find a point 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.959
 of hanging on which in fact she is 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.180
 a little bit but she is a little bit 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.300
 open will simply allow us 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.350
 to be really good but 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.350
 reposition so in time 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.390
 not obvious when even open a 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.770
 vault like that so I'm 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.940
 enough for one so I push all the 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.200
 explosive year where I loved them 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.920
 explosively frankly I did not fart a 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.340
 lead you will tell me in the 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.620
 comments 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.630
 I agreed but I put between 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.130
 holes and it puts me all on the door 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.140
 I'm pretty average that I move away 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.730
 now so it's not bad and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.019
 I'm warning the cops at the same time to 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.579
 Egypt and a point frankly I 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.560
 do not think do market during all 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.820
 explosives 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.290
 the door still opens not missed 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.930
 factory expectations in matting it's me who has 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.940
 bad luck or it is I who have not gifted 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.300
 so here I 'm going to pick up a rifle at 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.100
 pump in fact in the mato I beg you 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.630
 a pretty magical presentation 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.910
 so here and to all I will make you a 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.340
 presentation of all the weapons I am 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.860
 doing them so that's the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.090
 safe you access it to the room the 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.980
 room of safe 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.680
 and there you are going to laugh is that 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.020
 you're going to open that door so the 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.160
 kill said wow it's the ball I'm 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.900
 in the vault 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.430
 it's great, there's a lot of stuff 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.440
 interesting is not it 's nothing 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.669
 everything is not bad as I know it 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.440
 there are so many things that you do 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.970
 to roll but really it is that you have 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.460
 the impression you're pissed off for 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.830
 nothing so it's not bad so all that 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.900
 you did 7 served for nothing just you 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.370
 to tell you that you went for a ride in the 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.350
 safe room but you have nothing 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.400
 found in jewelers or I know 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.200
 not too much what I believe he is in 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.520
 strike they have a little bit emptied 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.050
 funds before entrusting the bank a 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.640
 qualified no but frankly it's a 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.530
 little bit boring it 's nothing 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.270
 everything I thought I could unlock 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.039
 some stuff for example that there was 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.660
 a huge wad of bills on the 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.890
 table I do not know 2 million will be was 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.229
 quite frankly coming out of the stuff 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.169
 like that innovations for example 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.340
 in multiplayer bata it makes this kind 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.600
 of something that appears once per 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.640
 week and the first they find 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.410
 not they manage to get 2 million 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.960
 euros I ignite 1 but it would have 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.550
 been not bad so now there is a 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.990
 interesting so here you have been a 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.500
 little bit tested that is safe the room 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.140
 chests 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.729
 it was not useful for anything 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.190
 all we will leave 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.600
 so the safe is here so after to 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.860
 just go out gucci rain dance 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.260
 house immediately the door 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.790
 lang the door opposite she does not open 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.990

 we can be managed you can do this 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.300

 game I do not stop that killing people so 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.850
