very well built didn't have to reseat

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.740 
very well built didn't have to reseat
them<00:01:32.890> at<00:01:33.010> any<00:01:33.160> time<00:01:33.250> during<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.210> eight<00:01:34.420> tests

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.210 
them at any time during the eight tests
that<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.110> did<00:01:37.380> during<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.560> test<00:01:38.770> video<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.070> will

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
that I did during the test video I will

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.860 
that I did during the test video I will
slow<00:01:39.640> down<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.060> video<00:01:40.150> so<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.600> can<00:01:40.630> actually

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
slow down the video so you can actually

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.410 
slow down the video so you can actually
see<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.740> radius<00:01:42.190> of<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.550> bb's<00:01:42.880> as<00:01:43.150> they<00:01:43.300> hit

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
see the radius of the bb's as they hit

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.170 
see the radius of the bb's as they hit
the<00:01:43.540> target<00:01:45.150> very<00:01:46.150> well<00:01:46.360> built<00:01:47.160> because<00:01:48.180> they

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
the target very well built because they

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.650 
the target very well built because they
are<00:01:49.360> about<00:01:49.990> as<00:01:50.200> good<00:01:50.380> as<00:01:50.590> an<00:01:50.770> AEG<00:01:51.660> performance

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660
