00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
off the pitch and he looked likely to be

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.440 
off the pitch and he looked likely to be
someone<00:00:23.340> would<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.550> really<00:00:23.730> vocal<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.240> bitch

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:41.849 
going to just progress and progress and

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:44.719 
going to just progress and progress and
he<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.209> beat<00:01:42.359> out<00:01:42.479> rule<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.520> thought

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
he just beat out rule it really thought

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.249

about<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.179> Osmond<00:01:45.450> captaincy<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:45.929> he'd

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
about to the Osmond captaincy and he'd

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.569 
about to the Osmond captaincy and he'd
be<00:01:46.409> really<00:01:46.709> good<00:01:46.859> for<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.069> future<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.520> i

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
be really good for the future but i

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.949 
be really good for the future but i
think<00:01:47.819> if<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:47.999> look<00:01:48.179> into<00:01:48.329> school<00:01:48.749> term

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
think if we look into school term

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.379 
think if we look into school term
options<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.679> arteta<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:50.340> then<00:01:50.999> we'd

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
options it would be arteta and then we'd

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:52.550 
options it would be arteta and then we'd
have<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.569> bring<00:01:51.779> in<00:01:51.869> which<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.169> a<00:01:52.229> couple<00:01:52.439> years

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
have to bring in which in a couple years

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
have to bring in which in a couple years
time<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.310> something<00:01:53.490> i<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:53.939> think

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
time and that's something i really think

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.940 
time and that's something i really think
would<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.359> a<00:01:54.599> good<00:01:54.869> idea<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.259> Arsenal<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.859> we

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
would be a good idea for Arsenal if we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980 
would be a good idea for Arsenal if we
made<00:01:56.130> our<00:01:56.729> tech<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.999> captain<00:01:57.359> for<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.569> season
