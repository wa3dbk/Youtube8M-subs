and let's first my first time touching
it

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
it

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.880 
it
at<00:00:16.100> that

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.570 

and<00:00:19.789> that<00:00:19.970> click

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.670 

very<00:00:23.180> nice<00:00:23.450> metal

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.550 

i<00:00:26.770> touch<00:00:27.310> covers

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.250 

very<00:00:33.130> flexible<00:00:33.670> right<00:00:33.850> there<00:00:34.060> just<00:00:34.390> like<00:00:35.200> a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
very flexible right there just like a

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.140 
very flexible right there just like a
little<00:00:35.440> cloth<00:00:36.010> material

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.930 

here's<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> trackpad

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.210 

opens<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.829> there<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:46.920> go<00:00:47.120> touch<00:00:48.120> screen

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.310 

I've<00:00:53.580> never<00:00:53.700> tried<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.180> keyboard<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:54.990> this<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
I've never tried the keyboard on this so

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.709 
I've never tried the keyboard on this so
I'm<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> here

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.560 

interesting

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.570 

it's<00:01:06.870> not<00:01:07.110> capacitive<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.370> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it's not capacitive it's a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
it's not capacitive it's a
pressure-sensitive

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.530 

that's<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.280> very<00:01:26.310> strange<00:01:26.850> feeling

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
that's a very strange feeling

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.090 
that's a very strange feeling
there's<00:01:29.290> a<00:01:29.350> little<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:31.770> texture<00:01:32.770> there<00:01:32.920> on

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
there's a little little texture there on

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.880 
there's a little little texture there on
the<00:01:33.220> f<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.550> J<00:01:33.730> so<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.180> can<00:01:34.330> feel<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.960> just

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
the f and J so you can feel it and just

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.960 
the f and J so you can feel it and just
setting<00:01:36.190> my<00:01:36.220> fingers<00:01:36.700> there<00:01:36.910> it's<00:01:37.090> not<00:01:37.300> typing

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.750 

but<00:01:44.540> pressure<00:01:45.410> just<00:01:46.100> put<00:01:46.370> a<00:01:46.400> little<00:01:46.580> pressure

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
but pressure just put a little pressure

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.410 
but pressure just put a little pressure
there

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.630 

and<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.869> types<00:01:51.110> Wow

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.930 

very<00:01:56.270> cool

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.330 

flip<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.690> around<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.320> have<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.500> kickstand<00:02:04.130> like

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
flip it around and have a kickstand like

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.809 
flip it around and have a kickstand like
that

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.270 

that's<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.359> passive<00:02:11.019> windows<00:02:11.709> t<00:02:11.950> there

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
that's a passive windows t there

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:24.059 
that's a passive windows t there
let's<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:13.850> if<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.470> hold<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.590> up<00:02:15.709> privacy

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.429 

and<00:02:24.189> I'm<00:02:24.909> not<00:02:24.969> sure<00:02:25.239> if<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.599> can<00:02:25.629> detach<00:02:26.109> it<00:02:26.349> with

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
and I'm not sure if I can detach it with

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:32.850 
and I'm not sure if I can detach it with
one<00:02:26.620> yep<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.459> did

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.840 

missed<00:02:33.520> it

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.340 

there<00:02:39.850> we<00:02:39.940> go<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.270> time<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.630> clicked<00:02:40.900> and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
there we go that time it clicked and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.600 
there we go that time it clicked and
it's<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.710> there<00:02:41.920> very<00:02:42.850> nice

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.470 

kick<00:02:46.540> stand<00:02:46.780> back<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:49.180> should<00:02:49.330> be<00:02:49.450> a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
kick stand back and there should be a

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.260 
kick stand back and there should be a
microSD<00:02:50.470> card

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
microSD card

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:03.410 
microSD card
there's<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.110> slot<00:02:53.560> right<00:02:53.860> under<00:02:54.160> there

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.710 

and<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.540> just<00:03:04.720> comes<00:03:04.930> right<00:03:05.050> back<00:03:05.290> on

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
and it just comes right back on

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.550 
and it just comes right back on
touch<00:03:07.410> cover<00:03:07.740> up

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:20.260 

I<00:03:11.620> guess<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.250> didn't<00:03:12.459> go<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.580> sleep

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:29.940 

ok<00:03:21.270> now<00:03:22.260> comes<00:03:22.500> back

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.210 

see<00:03:30.580> if<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.760> does<00:03:30.940> automatic<00:03:31.510> screen<00:03:31.870> rotation

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.910 

yep<00:03:35.820> took<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.780> second

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.010 

turn<00:03:43.550> back

there's me let's switch to the

cameras pointed kind of straight when

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.379 
cameras pointed kind of straight when
it's<00:04:19.500> on<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.709> kickstand
