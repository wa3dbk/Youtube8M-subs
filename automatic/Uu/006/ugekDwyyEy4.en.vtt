right<00:00:00.149> and<00:00:00.359> I'm<00:00:00.599> here<00:00:00.780> at<00:00:00.870> California<00:00:01.380> extreme

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
right and I'm here at California extreme

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.050 
right and I'm here at California extreme
it's<00:00:02.129> July<00:00:02.810> 16th<00:00:03.810> there's<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.890> big<00:00:05.190> arcade<00:00:05.759> and

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
it's July 16th there's a big arcade and

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.490 
it's July 16th there's a big arcade and
pinball<00:00:06.240> show<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.990> these<00:00:07.049> guys<00:00:07.259> are<00:00:07.410> running

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
pinball show and these guys are running

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.209 
pinball show and these guys are running
away<00:00:07.830> from<00:00:07.890> me<00:00:09.710> so<00:00:10.710> there's<00:00:10.889> gonna<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.070> like

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
away from me so there's gonna be like

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.330 
away from me so there's gonna be like
400<00:00:11.540> pinball<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.570> arcade<00:00:13.019> machines<00:00:13.769> here<00:00:14.099> and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
400 pinball and arcade machines here and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.359 
400 pinball and arcade machines here and
they<00:00:14.969> also<00:00:15.210> are<00:00:15.900> showing<00:00:16.440> joysticks<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
they also are showing joysticks the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.120 
they also are showing joysticks the
movie<00:00:17.789> which<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.570> cult<00:00:18.900> classic<00:00:19.109> movie<00:00:19.800> from

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
movie which is a cult classic movie from

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.640 
movie which is a cult classic movie from
the<00:00:20.460> 80s<00:00:21.890> where<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.369> kids<00:00:23.699> say<00:00:23.970> their<00:00:24.660> local

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the 80s where the kids say their local

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.099 
the 80s where the kids say their local
arcade<00:00:26.160> by<00:00:26.490> playing<00:00:26.910> video<00:00:27.330> games<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> giant

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
arcade by playing video games on a giant

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.389 
arcade by playing video games on a giant
joystick<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.699> built<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.449> giant<00:00:30.810> joystick<00:00:31.529> for

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
joystick so I built a giant joystick for

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.240 
joystick so I built a giant joystick for
the<00:00:32.550> event<00:00:33.050> that<00:00:34.050> actually<00:00:34.530> plays<00:00:34.770> video

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the event that actually plays video

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.180 
the event that actually plays video
games<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.230> how<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> did<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
games and this is how I did it this is a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.250 
games and this is how I did it this is a
lamp<00:00:41.190> cover<00:00:41.460> from<00:00:42.030> Home<00:00:42.210> Depot<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
lamp cover from Home Depot it's just a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779 
lamp cover from Home Depot it's just a
plastic<00:00:43.469> lamp<00:00:43.890> cover<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.280> drilled<00:00:44.579> some<00:00:44.760> holes

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
plastic lamp cover I drilled some holes

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.100 
plastic lamp cover I drilled some holes
to<00:00:45.090> put<00:00:45.329> some<00:00:45.570> some<00:00:46.850> switches<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
to put some some switches in here and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.920 
to put some some switches in here and
then<00:00:49.260> inside<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.190> put<00:00:50.550> an<00:00:50.640> RGB<00:00:51.180> flashing

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
then inside I put an RGB flashing

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.889 
then inside I put an RGB flashing
circuit<00:00:52.350> pretty<00:00:52.559> simple<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.300> kind

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
circuit pretty simple and you can kind

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.410 
circuit pretty simple and you can kind
of<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.739> cool<00:00:55.949> effects<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
of see the the cool effects with the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
of see the the cool effects with the
wires<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> LEDs<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.010> spread

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
wires because the LEDs are just spread

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.729 
wires because the LEDs are just spread
apart<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> circuit<00:01:00.149> board<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
apart on a circuit board in there at the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.369 
apart on a circuit board in there at the
bottom<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> circuit<00:01:02.609> board<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:04.110> the

bottom is the circuit board for the the
flasher<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.070> used<00:01:05.970> some<00:01:06.240> reducers<00:01:06.979> PVC<00:01:07.979> pipe

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
flasher I used some reducers PVC pipe

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
flasher I used some reducers PVC pipe
reducers<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.840> three<00:01:10.049> inch

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
reducers I think it's like three inch

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
reducers I think it's like three inch
down<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> two<00:01:11.580> inch

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
down to a two inch

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 
down to a two inch
fight<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.189> down<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.759> have<00:01:15.060> some<00:01:15.390> more

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
fight and down in here I have some more

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.499 
fight and down in here I have some more
PVC<00:01:16.290> pipe<00:01:16.560> reducers<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.700> sphere<00:01:18.149> which<00:01:18.479> is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
PVC pipe reducers and a sphere which is

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.780 
PVC pipe reducers and a sphere which is
another<00:01:18.990> lamp<00:01:19.320> cover<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.610> cut<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
another lamp cover that I I just cut a

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.310 
another lamp cover that I I just cut a
bigger<00:01:21.030> hole<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> top<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.080> cover

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
bigger hole on the top so it would cover

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.249 
bigger hole on the top so it would cover
up<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.770> mechanics<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.810> down<00:01:24.810> inside

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
up all the mechanics of it down inside

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.859 
up all the mechanics of it down inside
there's<00:01:25.560> four<00:01:26.009> cherry<00:01:26.970> switches<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.659> each

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
there's four cherry switches for each

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.130 
there's four cherry switches for each
direction<00:01:29.299> there's<00:01:30.299> some<00:01:30.420> set<00:01:30.630> screws<00:01:30.960> that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
direction there's some set screws that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
direction there's some set screws that
hold<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:32.369> pipe<00:01:33.030> reducer<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:34.640> another<00:01:35.640> reducer

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
hold the pipe reducer to another reducer

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
hold the pipe reducer to another reducer
which<00:01:36.390> happens<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.899> make<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> nice<00:01:37.320> ball<00:01:38.100> joint

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
which happens to make a nice ball joint

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.620 
which happens to make a nice ball joint
for<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.530> joystick<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:41.520> put<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> screw<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.539> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.120 
for the joystick I put a screw in the
side<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.869> goes<00:01:42.990> into<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.590> shaft<00:01:43.830> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
side that goes into the shaft that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
side that goes into the shaft that
limits<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> rotation<00:01:45.209> so<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.569> wires<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
limits the rotation so the wires that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.199 
limits the rotation so the wires that
come<00:01:46.440> down<00:01:46.649> from<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> switches<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
come down from the switches and the

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.830 
come down from the switches and the
flashing<00:01:48.959> circuit<00:01:49.890> don't<00:01:50.130> get<00:01:50.429> ripped<00:01:50.640> off<00:01:50.840> on

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840

the normally closed part of the the
cherry<00:01:57.420> switches<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:57.959> hooked<00:01:58.140> an<00:01:58.289> LED<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.890> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
cherry switches I hooked an LED in a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
cherry switches I hooked an LED in a
resistor<00:01:59.399> circuit<00:01:59.819> so<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.270> use<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> for

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
resistor circuit so I can use it for

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.109 
resistor circuit so I can use it for
debugging<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:02.039> make<00:02:02.190> sure<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.610> when<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.789> push

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
debugging to make sure that when I push

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.469 
debugging to make sure that when I push
the<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:04.439> joystick<00:02:04.950> shaft<00:02:05.189> over<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:06.240> switch

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
the the joystick shaft over the switch

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.740 
the the joystick shaft over the switch
is<00:02:06.630> actually<00:02:06.810> opening<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.920> closing

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
is actually opening and closing

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.259 
is actually opening and closing
correctly<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.380> cut<00:02:10.920> some<00:02:11.069> acrylic<00:02:11.310> discs<00:02:11.910> to
