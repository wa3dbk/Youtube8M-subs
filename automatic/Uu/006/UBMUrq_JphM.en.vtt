go down where my positive negative wires
can<00:02:49.370> come<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.900> connect<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.380> battery<00:02:51.590> and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
can come and connect to the battery and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.860 
can come and connect to the battery and
the<00:02:53.390> negative<00:02:53.780> wire<00:02:54.430> for<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.520> battery<00:02:58.870> comes

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
the negative wire for the battery comes

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.890 
the negative wire for the battery comes
back<00:03:00.110> up<00:03:00.290> through<00:03:00.530> here<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:02.300> can<00:03:02.360> see<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:02.810> a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
back up through here you can see it's a

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.880 
back up through here you can see it's a
little<00:03:02.990> cluttered<00:03:04.870> comes<00:03:05.870> around<00:03:06.290> underneath

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
little cluttered comes around underneath

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.390 
little cluttered comes around underneath
the<00:03:07.190> starter<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.560> ground<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.740> it's<00:03:09.890> grounded

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
the starter and ground it it's grounded

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.660 
the starter and ground it it's grounded
right<00:03:10.580> here

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
right here

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.220 
right here
see<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.910> can<00:03:14.060> see<00:03:14.090> where<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.480> have<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.780> grounded

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
see you can see where I have it grounded

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.550 
see you can see where I have it grounded
right<00:03:16.040> there<00:03:16.570> okay<00:03:17.920> now

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
I'll show you where the kill switch is I

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.500 
I'll show you where the kill switch is I
set<00:03:26.030> up<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.270> kill<00:03:26.480> switch<00:03:26.780> right<00:03:27.740> here<00:03:28.510> it's

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
set up the kill switch right here it's

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.640 
set up the kill switch right here it's
on<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.350> all<00:03:31.780> that's<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:35.530> there<00:03:36.530> was

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
on this is all that's on so there was

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.340 
on this is all that's on so there was
two<00:03:36.860> wires<00:03:37.130> coming<00:03:37.490> from<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.790> magneto<00:03:38.350> which

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
two wires coming from the magneto which

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.680 
two wires coming from the magneto which
was<00:03:40.130> right<00:03:40.370> here<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.940> were<00:03:41.060> originally

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
was right here that were originally

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.890 
was right here that were originally
hooked<00:03:42.650> by<00:03:43.070> wire<00:03:43.340> clamps<00:03:43.850> I<00:03:44.030> took<00:03:44.510> those<00:03:44.660> off

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
hooked by wire clamps I took those off

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.890 
hooked by wire clamps I took those off
cuz<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.590> had<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.800> cut<00:03:45.980> them<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:46.310> remove<00:03:46.640> them<00:03:46.900> to

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
cuz I had to cut them and remove them to

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.270 
cuz I had to cut them and remove them to
put<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.230> switch<00:03:48.470> hit<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:48.680> put<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.010> switch<00:03:49.250> in

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
put the switch hit I put the switch in

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.270 
put the switch hit I put the switch in
here<00:03:49.820> drilled<00:03:50.300> a<00:03:50.330> hole<00:03:50.770> put<00:03:51.770> it<00:03:51.890> down<00:03:52.040> nice<00:03:52.250> and

here drilled a hole put it down nice and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.210 
here drilled a hole put it down nice and
tight

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
you can see the back of it and those two

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.699 
you can see the back of it and those two
wires

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
wires

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.580 
wires
I<00:03:57.920> just<00:03:58.340> ran<00:03:59.020> soldered<00:04:00.020> these<00:04:00.170> two<00:04:00.350> wires

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
I just ran soldered these two wires

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.010 
I just ran soldered these two wires
together<00:04:01.270> cover<00:04:02.270> them<00:04:02.510> up<00:04:02.540> with<00:04:02.600> some<00:04:02.840> black

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
together cover them up with some black

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.580 
together cover them up with some black
tape<00:04:04.840> let's<00:04:05.840> see<00:04:06.020> if<00:04:06.080> I<00:04:06.200> can<00:04:06.290> get<00:04:06.380> a<00:04:06.410> better

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
tape let's see if I can get a better

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:14.880 
tape let's see if I can get a better
picture<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.459> that<00:04:07.840> okay<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.050> they<00:04:09.890> travel<00:04:10.520> up

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.210 

not<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.040> best<00:04:16.450> picture<00:04:17.450> but<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.859> can<00:04:19.010> see

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
not the best picture but and you can see

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.030 
not the best picture but and you can see
where<00:04:19.400> they<00:04:19.519> go<00:04:19.940> into<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.329> back<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:20.810> that

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
where they go into the back of that
