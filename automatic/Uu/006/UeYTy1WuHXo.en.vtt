a lot of debris that needs to be moved

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
a lot of debris that needs to be moved
this<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.770> less<00:01:11.520> fatiguing<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.510> use<00:01:13.020> this

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
this is a lot less fatiguing to use this

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.880 
this is a lot less fatiguing to use this
it's<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.130> heavy<00:01:14.689> its<00:01:15.689> lightweight<00:01:16.229> as

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it's not very heavy its lightweight as

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.300 
it's not very heavy its lightweight as
far<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.369> that's<00:01:17.850> concerned<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.979> good

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
especially from a commercial standpoint

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.039 
especially from a commercial standpoint
but<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.740> also<00:01:22.920> good<00:01:23.250> around<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> house

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
but it's also good around the house

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
again you can move a lot more material

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.330 
again you can move a lot more material
easily<00:01:27.350> with<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> backpack<00:01:28.799> blower<00:01:31.340> the

easily with this backpack blower the
handheld<00:01:32.880> model<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.799> good<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.130> smaller<00:01:35.460> areas

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
handheld model is good for smaller areas

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.380 
handheld model is good for smaller areas
like<00:01:36.299> patios<00:01:36.810> decks<00:01:37.490> small<00:01:38.490> sidewalks<00:01:39.090> or

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
like patios decks small sidewalks or

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.039 
like patios decks small sidewalks or
driveways<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:40.970> lot<00:01:41.970> more<00:01:42.240> hand<00:01:42.570> action

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
driveways a lot more hand action

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.149 
driveways a lot more hand action
involved<00:01:43.790> but<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.880> gets<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> job<00:01:45.210> done

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
involved but it gets the job done

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.149 
involved but it gets the job done
throttle<00:01:47.159> control<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.860> your<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.009> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
throttle control is up here your on and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.020 
throttle control is up here your on and
off<00:01:50.280> switch<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> side<00:01:52.369> it's<00:01:53.369> very<00:01:53.759> good

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
off switch on the side it's very good

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.929 
off switch on the side it's very good
for<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:55.140> said<00:01:55.409> smaller<00:01:56.159> projects<00:01:58.939> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
for as I said smaller projects the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
for as I said smaller projects the
electric<00:02:00.450> handheld<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:02.549> even<00:02:02.969> better<00:02:03.740> for

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
electric handheld is even better for

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.520 
electric handheld is even better for
people<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.640> lighter<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:07.320> big

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
people because it's lighter the big

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.880 
people because it's lighter the big
drawback<00:02:08.069> however<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.050> electrical<00:02:10.560> card

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
drawback however is the electrical card

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.940 
drawback however is the electrical card
plugs<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.989> drag<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.470> with<00:02:13.650> you
