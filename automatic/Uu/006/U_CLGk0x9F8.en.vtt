find<00:01:27.739> tnk<00:01:28.459> 3<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.880> be<00:01:28.970> way<00:01:29.239> more<00:01:29.270> fun<00:01:29.780> especially

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
find tnk 3 to be way more fun especially

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.460 
find tnk 3 to be way more fun especially
on<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.739> PlayStation<00:01:31.340> 3<00:01:31.989> where<00:01:32.989> both<00:01:33.170> games

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
on the PlayStation 3 where both games

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.830 
on the PlayStation 3 where both games
use<00:01:33.709> the<00:01:33.890> same<00:01:34.069> control<00:01:34.459> system<00:01:34.880> that<00:01:35.390> force

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
use the same control system that force

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.169 
use the same control system that force
you<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.080> rotate<00:01:36.530> your<00:01:36.739> primary<00:01:37.369> firing<00:01:37.970> with

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
you to rotate your primary firing with

you to rotate your primary firing with
the<00:01:38.360> l1<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.989> r1<00:01:39.190> buttons<00:01:40.190> I<00:01:40.429> think<00:01:40.789> that<00:01:40.970> Ikari

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
the l1 and r1 buttons I think that Ikari

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.900 
the l1 and r1 buttons I think that Ikari
warriors<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:42.020> just<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.530> much<00:01:42.709> faster<00:01:43.130> to

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
warriors is just that much faster to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.969 
warriors is just that much faster to

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
render that particular control scheme

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.270 
render that particular control scheme
ineffective<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.910> not<00:01:47.330> fun<00:01:47.599> tnk<00:01:48.590> 3<00:01:48.920> gives<00:01:49.160> you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
ineffective and not fun tnk 3 gives you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.430 
ineffective and not fun tnk 3 gives you
more<00:01:49.429> room<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.819> breathe<00:01:50.090> as<00:01:50.569> you<00:01:50.869> can<00:01:51.050> power<00:01:51.319> up
