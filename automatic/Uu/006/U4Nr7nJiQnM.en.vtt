00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.500
 I wanted to show you this kind of work 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.000
 of sabina min 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.710
 we as a company work in 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.329
 melamine of life and video we do everything 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.519
 type of services we want to find 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:22.329
 this wood material is called this 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.820
 by formed that is a md plated in this 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.699
 Thursday the material is a bit bright 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.669
 we have an elegant modern style 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.490
 current picture development using in 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.170
 the news in the bakers by 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.230
 example we want to see the dimension of 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.990
 Handles are formed are not steel 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.090
 stainless 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.230
 and the door has a detail that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.240
 call when you create the forum is the mold 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.340
 which is a bone song that gives 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.770
 greater resistance at the time of 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 doors and is working and has a 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.470
 greater durability 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.560
 with time you can see that it is 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.590
 the company that is a right body 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.250
 this table come in and let's go that's a life 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.170
 to work 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.610
 you can look good for example is a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.140
 piece of that is thick and you can 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.750
 put who is in these tables can 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.229
 put today the environment for example and nothing 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.990
 of peace can wash was effective and has 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.890
 greater resistance in this space 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.500
 the Japanese have the sides 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.260
 these Japanese are wide they are big 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.180
 for the reasons as you can see the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.770
 large deep drawers 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.530
 you can water all your pots or 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.799
 seasons 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.960
 now you can also see the drawer is 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.360
 broad and deep but internally 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.310
 has a drawer to store your 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:55.160
 a slide drawer is covered covered 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.600
 you can see that they slide easily 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.550
 do not get stuck they are not carriers 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.690
 runners are always correct 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.880
 telescopic 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.130
 in this telescopic way they are 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.870
 automatic slides because 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.670
 automatic because you at the moment 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.570
 you are going to close the doors 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.900
 it automatically closes and 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:22.420
 they automatically close is by the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:25.550
 quantity of us when we use 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.470
 the space below magnas pipes if 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.050
 you can not use much force and there 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.350
 one more mind crossed us accessories of 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.590
 cleaning and here we have included within 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.590
 this 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 Y 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.630
 is the kitchen furniture also a 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.090
 decorated 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.630
 in the corner part are decorated that 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.770
 It is the door that you can arms 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.170
 products 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.140
 we wanted to have this kind of strength 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.850
 I have rope that come with this step 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.060
 seed 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.720
 that automatically opens and part 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.590
 from below that is a door made and bad 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.620
 min 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.840
 it is once a non-innovative rope 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.760
 because it is currently being used 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.310
 just like a more elegant destination a 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.590
 style 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.200
 updated 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.000
 as you can see this this video 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.460
 it's a video there's nothing 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.410
 it's an embossed sandblasted myth that gives 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:43.630
 a style and you can see that 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.940
 they get up solid for having 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.280
 we would also like something more of this 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.550
 kitchen 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.690
 for example on this side of the corner 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.690
 this side of the corner 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.510
 you can see a door emits which 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.250
 this really can not open use 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.200
 this space or if you want to use everything 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.860
 the space opens everything 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.860
 so 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.360
 that what we normally do 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.049
 We design for you to have 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.120
 greater function in your kitchen 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.690
 and here we can also create a 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.690
 continent 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.030
 which can be like that 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:35.939
 is made with video portal with its 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.749
 glasses we have water so you can 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:45.520
 save a senator and down you can 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:48.310
 show some products like groceries 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.289
 or anything good anything 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.060
 the designs that you can see inside 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.419
 from this kitchen we prepare ourselves 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.219
 of this according to your need for 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.439

 a message and we make visits 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.349
 no commitment incomplete budgets 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.569
