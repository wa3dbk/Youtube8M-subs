comes<00:01:38.840> with<00:01:38.899> like<00:01:39.710> two<00:01:39.890> gigabytes<00:01:40.369> of<00:01:40.550> storage

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
comes with like two gigabytes of storage

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.969 
comes with like two gigabytes of storage
now<00:01:41.360> let's<00:01:41.600> split<00:01:41.869> up<00:01:41.899> between<00:01:42.200> 60<00:01:42.770> gigabytes

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
now let's split up between 60 gigabytes

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.730 
now let's split up between 60 gigabytes
of<00:01:43.250> built-in<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:44.000> about<00:01:44.600> 60<00:01:45.170> gigabytes<00:01:45.409> of

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
of built-in and about 60 gigabytes of
