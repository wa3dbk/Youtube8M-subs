00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.180 

what<00:02:05.460> gave<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.729> away<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.119> me<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.979> look

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
what gave it away for me is that I look

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.180 
what gave it away for me is that I look
down<00:02:08.429> inside<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.349> little<00:02:10.800> bits<00:02:11.009> of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
down inside I can see little bits of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.550 
down inside I can see little bits of
glue<00:02:11.580> which<00:02:11.849> I'm<00:02:12.090> sure<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.810> not<00:02:12.989> right<00:02:15.319> all<00:02:16.319> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
glue which I'm sure is not right all the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.600 
glue which I'm sure is not right all the
way<00:02:16.680> through<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.430> edges<00:02:20.430> of

way through and I see that the edges of

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.990 
way through and I see that the edges of
it<00:02:21.620> they<00:02:22.620> don't<00:02:22.860> look<00:02:22.980> right<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> me<00:02:23.489> they<00:02:23.790> look

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
it they don't look right to me they look

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.270
