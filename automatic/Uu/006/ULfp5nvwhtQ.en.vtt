leave a lot on and when I went to take
it<00:00:21.750> back<00:00:21.930> off<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.910> idle<00:00:24.660> will<00:00:25.050> raise<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it back off the idle will raise the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.019 
it back off the idle will raise the
stool<00:00:25.680> up<00:00:25.800> high<00:00:26.010> around<00:00:26.580> two<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> half

stool up high around two and a half
thousand<00:00:27.420> rpm<00:00:28.550> might<00:00:29.550> prefer<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.880> oil<00:00:30.300> at

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
thousand rpm might prefer to oil at

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.940 
thousand rpm might prefer to oil at
around<00:00:30.869> 16<00:00:31.340> 1700<00:00:32.340> rpm<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.680> closer

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
around 16 1700 rpm so I on closer

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.319 
around 16 1700 rpm so I on closer
inspection<00:00:36.260> somewhat<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:40.940> when<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> use

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
inspection somewhat I can see when I use

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.190 
inspection somewhat I can see when I use
the<00:00:42.629> lever<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> cable<00:00:44.160> movie

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
play in the throttle before it actually

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.600 
play in the throttle before it actually
accelerates<00:01:30.290> there's<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.680> much<00:01:31.860> forward<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
accelerates there's as much forward and
