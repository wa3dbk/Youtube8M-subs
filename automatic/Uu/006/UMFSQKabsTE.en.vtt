00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.590
 hello thank you for visiting my channel since 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.200
 the video on how to use the compass with 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.389
 wrongdoing at home has reached 66 thousand 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.400
 visits I wanted to do an update of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.710
 this video and give them a tool 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.650
 fabulous to mark the plane of the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.329
 exact and precise way with this 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.800
 update and the template we are going to 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.239
 to be able to mark not only four 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.239
 orientations as we did in the 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.309
 previous video but 8 remember that for 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.110
 use the template must take the measurement 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.700
 of your house or your apartment with a 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.200
 group if you do not have a compass 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
 conventional you can use any 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.519
 smart phone an iphone or an ipad 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.920
 we have a video where you 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.780
 we explain how to do it and if not at the end 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 of this video I'll leave the link 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.530
 so you can access it very well 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.870
 so you can have this template 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.910
 You must comply with three simple steps on 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.969
 first leave your like in this video 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.859
 the second step is to share it on the network 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.140
 of your preference can be twitter or 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.940
 weight and the third step is to access my 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.039
 website where you will find a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.040
 link to open the template 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.240
 download and print it hopefully on paper 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.100
 acetate form 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.670
 and being transparent I can over 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.040
 put it on any plan 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.960
 and well to know how to work with this 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.570
 template stay watching this video 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 Take the plan of your house and mark lines 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 end-to-end diagonals of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.350
 plane to then at the intersection of 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 the lines mark the center now it takes 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.369
 the measure of the faÃ§ade with the compass 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.979
 from several places and always looking 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.440
 towards the same side write down the measurements 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.690
 to then take an average from the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.030
 center of the plane throws a straight line 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.070
 in the direction of the facade and place the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.009
 average measure obtained with the compass 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.590
 place the template by aligning your 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.929
 center with the center of the plane and second 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.429
 aligns the measure of the house with the 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.399
 measure of the template doing 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.130
 match the lines as the template 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.220
 has a transparent background you can see it from 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.830
 this way on the plane now make a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.630
 small mark at the end of each line of 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.820
 the template so that you have the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.399
 references of the eight orientations 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.979
 then remove the template and one of the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.320
 brands going through the center of this 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.290
 shape finally places the orientation 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.319
 corresponding for each space 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.700
 very well this has been all for today 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.859
 remember to leave me your comments your 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.140
