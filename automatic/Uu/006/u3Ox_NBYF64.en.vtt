00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.220 

here<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.310> could<00:00:20.490> see<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.730> three<00:00:21.600> pins<00:00:21.869> that

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
here you could see that three pins that

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.710 
here you could see that three pins that
make<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.980> every<00:00:23.220> Tila<00:00:23.850> make<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:25.490> spark<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:27.510> we

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
make in every Tila make the spark so we

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.220 
make in every Tila make the spark so we
should<00:00:28.320> shorten<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.400> need<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.330> shorten<00:00:30.660> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
should shorten it I need to shorten it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.319 
should shorten it I need to shorten it
please<00:00:34.550> take<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> camera<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:38.180> need<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
please take it the camera I need to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:01:27.240 
please take it the camera I need to
shorten<00:00:39.780> enters

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:35.490 

so<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:28.280> have<00:01:29.229> it<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.909> wire<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:34.310> prevent<00:01:34.460> spark

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
so I have it the wire to prevent spark

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:46.389 
so I have it the wire to prevent spark
in<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.679> apt<00:01:37.039> I<00:01:38.469> start<00:01:39.469> now<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:42.289> engine<00:01:45.399> now

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
in the apt I start now the engine now

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.590 
in the apt I start now the engine now
good<00:01:46.789> it's<00:01:47.780> good<00:01:48.020> with<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.380> spark<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
good it's good with that spark in the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.270 
good it's good with that spark in the
PTC<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.659> new<00:01:51.289> Sparky<00:01:51.979> because<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:52.640> shot

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
PTC the new Sparky because I shot

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.719 
PTC the new Sparky because I shot
the<00:01:54.700> piece

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:25.160 

beans

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.440 

thanks<00:02:26.170> for<00:02:26.349> watching
