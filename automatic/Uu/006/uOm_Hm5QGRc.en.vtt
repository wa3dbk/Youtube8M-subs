that we've seen in the previous two but

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:03.860 
that we've seen in the previous two but
nevertheless<00:06:02.400> a<00:06:02.610> lot<00:06:02.849> to<00:06:02.969> admire<00:06:03.090> him<00:06:03.599> he's

well<00:06:05.699> which<00:06:05.940> in<00:06:06.599> ice<00:06:06.900> dance<00:06:07.229> is<00:06:07.560> not<00:06:08.009> easy<00:06:08.449> but

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
well which in ice dance is not easy but

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:10.879 
well which in ice dance is not easy but
they<00:06:09.509> did<00:06:09.659> have<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.810> couple<00:06:10.110> of<00:06:10.199> dicey<00:06:10.409> moments

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
they did have a couple of dicey moments

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.100 
they did have a couple of dicey moments
one<00:06:11.069> particular<00:06:11.430> that<00:06:11.940> he<00:06:12.360> spotted<00:06:12.719> in<00:06:12.960> the

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
one particular that he spotted in the

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.760 
one particular that he spotted in the
serpentine<00:06:13.770> lift

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
serpentine lift

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.150 
serpentine lift
when<00:06:14.919> she<00:06:15.220> struggles<00:06:15.789> with<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.349> hold<00:06:17.349> but

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
when she struggles with the hold but

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.950 
when she struggles with the hold but
there<00:06:18.639> was<00:06:18.729> another<00:06:19.030> move<00:06:19.300> which<00:06:19.479> I<00:06:19.629> think

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
there was another move which I think

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.680 
there was another move which I think
could<00:06:20.259> be<00:06:20.289> a<00:06:20.650> violation<00:06:21.250> where<00:06:21.669> she<00:06:22.270> went<00:06:22.419> down

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
could be a violation where she went down

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.200 
could be a violation where she went down
onto<00:06:23.199> the<00:06:23.319> toes<00:06:23.710> of<00:06:23.919> her<00:06:24.009> boots<00:06:24.310> and<00:06:24.610> in<00:06:25.120> the

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
onto the toes of her boots and in the

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.860 
onto the toes of her boots and in the

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
definitely not on the ice there so there

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.959 
definitely not on the ice there so there
will<00:07:06.110> be<00:07:06.169> a<00:07:06.319> point<00:07:06.500> one<00:07:06.680> deduction<00:07:07.159> some<00:07:07.879> of

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:07.969 
will be a point one deduction some of

will be a point one deduction some of
the<00:07:08.120> judges<00:07:08.689> pick<00:07:08.960> that<00:07:09.110> out
