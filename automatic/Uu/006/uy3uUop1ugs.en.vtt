matches<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> WWE<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:10.110> been<00:02:10.140> pretty<00:02:10.649> good

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
matches in the WWE have been pretty good

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.410 
matches in the WWE have been pretty good
and<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.129> think<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.730> will<00:02:11.879> be<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.300> as

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and I think this one will be just as

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
and I think this one will be just as
good<00:02:12.569> as<00:02:12.690> any<00:02:12.810> other<00:02:12.930> ones<00:02:13.349> where

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
good as any other ones where

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.559 
good as any other ones where
seen<00:02:14.069> in<00:02:14.220> recent<00:02:14.370> memory<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.270> what<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:15.480> you

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
seen in recent memory so what do you

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.960 
seen in recent memory so what do you
think<00:02:15.750> should<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.080> stipulation<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
think should be the stipulation and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.760 
think should be the stipulation and
going<00:02:17.970> into<00:02:18.090> ravi<00:02:18.390> indian<00:02:18.780> vs<00:02:19.110> alberto<00:02:19.230> duryea

going into ravi indian vs alberto duryea

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.309 
going into ravi indian vs alberto duryea
