00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
which is a little bit higher ups it's a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.720 
which is a little bit higher ups it's a
little<00:00:27.930> bit<00:00:28.050> unsure<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.220> long<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.519> he's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
