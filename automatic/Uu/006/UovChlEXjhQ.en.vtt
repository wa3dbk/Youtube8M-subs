00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it it doesn't necessarily mean that what

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.720 
it it doesn't necessarily mean that what
every<00:00:41.550> piece<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.300> clicked<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.960> will<00:00:43.140> get

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it gives you an option to spin the wheel

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.600 
it gives you an option to spin the wheel
at<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> end<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:52.140> wheel<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:53.100> contain

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
at the end and the wheel will contain

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.650 
at the end and the wheel will contain
some<00:00:54.300> parts<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.140> some<00:00:55.320> pieces<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.180> stone

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
some parts and some pieces of this stone

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.400 
some parts and some pieces of this stone
and<00:00:58.730> if<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.090> wheel<00:01:00.270> ends<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.719> then<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.260> win

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and if the wheel ends on it then you win

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.229 
and if the wheel ends on it then you win
that<00:01:01.590> piece<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.309> obviously<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.059> times

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that piece but obviously a lot of times

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
that piece but obviously a lot of times
as<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.290> wheel<00:01:04.559> doesn't

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
as you can see that this wheel doesn't

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.940 
as you can see that this wheel doesn't
have<00:01:05.189> any<00:01:05.400> pieces<00:01:05.640> whatsoever<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.439> most<00:01:07.770> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
have any pieces whatsoever and most of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.300 
have any pieces whatsoever and most of
the<00:01:08.040> time<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.400> will<00:01:08.549> win<00:01:08.960> money<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> win

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the time you will win money so you win

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.510 
the time you will win money so you win
gold<00:01:11.580> food<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.680> sometimes<00:01:13.680> experience<00:01:14.310> but

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
most of the time I would say food is the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.160 
most of the time I would say food is the
most<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.040> win<00:01:17.369> now<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.360> sped<00:01:18.810> off<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
most that you win now I sped off time a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.480 
most that you win now I sped off time a
little<00:01:19.320> bit<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.710> because<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.040> didn't<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
little bit here because I didn't want to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300 
little bit here because I didn't want to
go<00:01:21.060> through<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.479> old<00:01:21.900> pieces<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.250> is

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
go through the old pieces but this is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
go through the old pieces but this is
the<00:01:23.549> last<00:01:23.759> piece<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.360> need<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.780> race<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.530> up

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the last piece I need to race for and up

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.590 
the last piece I need to race for and up
to<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.009> point<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.490> raced<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:27.000> every<00:01:27.330> single

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.520 
to this point I raced for every single
piece<00:01:28.549> in<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> game<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.180> did<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:30.900> buy<00:01:31.140> any<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
