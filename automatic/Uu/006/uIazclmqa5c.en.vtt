have room for it so let's wrap this up

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.440 
have room for it so let's wrap this up
with<00:03:42.469> a<00:03:42.530> few<00:03:42.829> things<00:03:43.129> to<00:03:43.459> keep<00:03:43.640> in<00:03:43.819> mind<00:03:44.060> first

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
with a few things to keep in mind first

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.420 
with a few things to keep in mind first
of<00:03:44.689> all<00:03:44.840> we<00:03:45.049> always<00:03:45.469> say<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.709> if<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.159> ain't

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
of all we always say that if it ain't

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.809 
of all we always say that if it ain't
broke<00:03:46.760> don't<00:03:47.060> fix<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:48.049> but<00:03:48.680> if<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.340> ain't<00:03:49.489> broke

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
broke don't fix it but if it ain't broke

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.940 
broke don't fix it but if it ain't broke
it<00:03:50.090> doesn't<00:03:50.569> mean<00:03:50.719> that<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:51.049> should<00:03:51.290> keep<00:03:51.530> it

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
it doesn't mean that you should keep it

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.679 
it doesn't mean that you should keep it
furthermore<00:03:52.760> things<00:03:53.150> don't<00:03:53.359> have<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.569> be

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
furthermore things don't have to be

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.780 
furthermore things don't have to be
crashing<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.409> burning<00:03:54.530> around<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.219> in<00:03:55.400> order
