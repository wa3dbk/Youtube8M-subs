00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.110
 hello today plays will tell 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.260
 you about the board game you were sick 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.320
 can you keep the balance of the figures on 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.849
 shaky game discs check it out to you and 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.070
 offers board game bomb whether the game 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.160
 packed in a large non-standard 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.919
 square box is heavy enough and 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.739
 massive inside exclusively 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.989
 disc-shaped wood components 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:39.220
 playing field figurines of two colors 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.310
 support and cork ball before starting 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 game figures are located on the field drives 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.610
 in any order if desired complicate 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.880
 the game 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.500
 you can even put them on top of each other 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.490
 also to add complexity 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.260
 it is advisable to leave the disk center empty 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.410
 the base column is placed on the table 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.380
 she cork fits his top 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.290
 the ball then and this is perhaps the most 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.119
 complicated you need to install a disk with 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.560
 the figures on it 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:14.200
 over this shaky construction the players in 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.079
 bamboleo take turns and take turns 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.249
 try to take a figure with a disc or 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:23.350
 even two figures standing on each other 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:25.600
 brothers should be very careful to 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.259
 the disk has not lost balance and the figures are not 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.859
 fell successfully taken figure is put 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.200
 in front of the player if during the attempt 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.929
 remove the figure disc dangerously leans 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.959
 the player has the right to stop and return 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.990
 figure back then he should 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:47.130
 return one of your shots to the box 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.200
 earlier figures as fine 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.170
 also if the player thinks that none 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.959
 figures can not be removed, he passes the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.719
 at the same time he will have to give one of 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.289
 of their figures to the first player who 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.420
 can successfully remove the figure from the board 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.149
 if all players save the round 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.209
 also completed 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.319
 bamboleo game round ends if 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.290
 the disk will become empty 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.250
 or any figure will fall from him or he 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.190
 himself after the round is over the players 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.180
 think 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.750
 points each shot figure gives one 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.800
 point 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.080
 and the wounded figure or disc loses 4 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.190
 so you can even go to minus a 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.440
 the game is played up to 20 points also in 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.630
 There are several variations to the rules. 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.030
 this game with different mechanisms 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.250
 counting victory points and nobody 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.160
 prohibits players from inventing their own 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.160
 own bomb left is absolutely 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.740
 meditative educational board game 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.260
 spatial thinking agility and 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.780
 neatness and just fun fun 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.780
 for players of any age
