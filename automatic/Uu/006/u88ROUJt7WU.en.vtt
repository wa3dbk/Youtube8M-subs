00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
what's up guys it's going to be a quick

ipad 4 and the apple ipad 3 in my

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.680 
ipad 4 and the apple ipad 3 in my
opinion<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.550> think<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.820> apple<00:00:09.030> ipad<00:00:09.090> 4<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.660> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
opinion I think the apple ipad 4 is the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.650 
opinion I think the apple ipad 4 is the
biggest<00:00:10.110> joke<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.469> their<00:00:10.620> keynote<00:00:10.950> yesterday

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
biggest joke of their keynote yesterday

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.010 
biggest joke of their keynote yesterday
it<00:00:12.660> adds<00:00:12.929> pretty<00:00:13.769> much<00:00:14.009> some<00:00:14.700> little<00:00:15.660> things

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
it adds pretty much some little things

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.890 
it adds pretty much some little things
that<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.470> not<00:00:16.619> worth<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.859> upgrade<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.760> if<00:00:18.720> i

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
that it's not worth the upgrade and if i

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900 
that it's not worth the upgrade and if i
had<00:00:19.109> an<00:00:19.199> ipad<00:00:19.500> 3<00:00:19.710> will<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.130> piss<00:00:20.340> me<00:00:20.369> off<00:00:20.580> that

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
had an ipad 3 will just piss me off that

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.880 
had an ipad 3 will just piss me off that
there's<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> new<00:00:21.449> one<00:00:21.840> right<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.650> anyway

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
there's now a new one right but anyway

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.259 
there's now a new one right but anyway
let's<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.250> quickly<00:00:23.460> look<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:23.850> aspect

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
let's just quickly look at aspect

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.730 
let's just quickly look at aspect
differences<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.199> i<00:00:25.260> don't<00:00:25.410> want<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
differences because i don't want this to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.460 
differences because i don't want this to
take<00:00:25.890> forever<00:00:26.539> literally<00:00:27.539> everything<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
take forever literally everything is the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.910 
take forever literally everything is the
same<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:29.340> all<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.029> way<00:00:30.179> down<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.840> has<00:00:31.260> it

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
same here all the way down it has it

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.410 
same here all the way down it has it
doesn't<00:00:32.189> actually<00:00:32.279> say<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.180> does

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
doesn't actually say it here but it does

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.380 
doesn't actually say it here but it does
have<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.140> dual<00:00:34.440> Wi-Fi<00:00:35.040> antennas<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.239> makes

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
have the dual Wi-Fi antennas so it makes

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.030 
have the dual Wi-Fi antennas so it makes
the<00:00:36.600> Wi-Fi<00:00:36.989> stronger<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the Wi-Fi stronger the one of the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.420 
the Wi-Fi stronger the one of the
biggest<00:00:41.219> difference<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.239> has<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> 1.2

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
biggest difference is it now has a 1.2

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.819 
biggest difference is it now has a 1.2

facetime<00:00:47.610> over<00:00:47.640> Wi-Fi<00:00:48.800> which<00:00:49.800> allows<00:00:50.190> yeah

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
facetime over Wi-Fi which allows yeah

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.520 
facetime over Wi-Fi which allows yeah
allows<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.719> facetime<00:00:52.140> over<00:00:52.170> Wi-Fi

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
allows for the facetime over Wi-Fi

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.139 
allows for the facetime over Wi-Fi
compared<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> ipad<00:00:53.579> through<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> add

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
compared to the ipad through that add

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.410 
compared to the ipad through that add
the<00:00:54.300> VGA<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.710> use<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.190> video<00:00:57.149> calling

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the VGA and you can use it video calling

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.790 
the VGA and you can use it video calling
over<00:00:57.719> Wi-Fi<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.230> other<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
over Wi-Fi on the other know what that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.709 
over Wi-Fi on the other know what that
means<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.190> face<00:00:59.579> time<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.390> now<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> has

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
means it's not face time but now it has

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.540 
means it's not face time but now it has
a<00:01:00.809> proper<00:01:01.140> FaceTime<00:01:01.590> camera<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
a proper FaceTime camera that was one of

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.810 
a proper FaceTime camera that was one of
the<00:01:02.609> biggest<00:01:02.820> upgrades<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.629> has<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.400> next

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the biggest upgrades it has the next

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
the biggest upgrades it has the next
biggest<00:01:06.030> upgrade<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.540> ipad<00:01:06.840> 4<00:01:07.080> has<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
biggest upgrade the ipad 4 has is it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370 
biggest upgrade the ipad 4 has is it
they<00:01:07.950> put<00:01:08.250> their<00:01:08.490> apple<00:01:08.909> a6x<00:01:09.600> chip<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.260> it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
they put their apple a6x chip in it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.000 
they put their apple a6x chip in it
compared<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> Apple<00:01:11.460> a5<00:01:11.610> chip<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
compared to the Apple a5 chip so it's a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.350 
compared to the Apple a5 chip so it's a
lot<00:01:14.159> stronger<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> chip<00:01:15.330> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
lot stronger now we know this chip is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
lot stronger now we know this chip is
very<00:01:15.689> strong<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> iphone<00:01:16.770> 5<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
very strong it's in the iphone 5 as the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
very strong it's in the iphone 5 as the
a6<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> they're<00:01:18.869> probably<00:01:19.080> clocked<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
a6 so they're probably clocked it a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.620 
a6 so they're probably clocked it a
little<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.580> higher<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:21.150> they've<00:01:21.479> done

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
little bit higher or they've done

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780 
little bit higher or they've done
something<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.650> push<00:01:23.220> probably<00:01:23.640> more

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
something to it to push probably more

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.380 
something to it to push probably more
pixels<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.479> added<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.409> X<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.150> better

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
pixels and added an X so it's better

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.030 
pixels and added an X so it's better
performing<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.259> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.590> stronger

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
performing it's going to be stronger

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.300 
performing it's going to be stronger
performing<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.740> yeah<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:31.979> else<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.280> they

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
performing but yeah what else have they

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.969 
performing but yeah what else have they
done<00:01:32.549> they've<00:01:33.210> given<00:01:33.630> us<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.650> doesn't

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
done they've given us it doesn't

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.969 
done they've given us it doesn't
actually<00:01:35.130> say<00:01:35.780> here<00:01:36.780> well<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
actually say here well I can see the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.039 
actually say here well I can see the
battery<00:01:38.340> hasn't<00:01:38.640> changed<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> price<00:01:39.840> is

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
battery hasn't changed the price is

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
battery hasn't changed the price is
probably<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.860> same<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.430> not<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.640> little<00:01:41.820> bit

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
probably the same if not a little bit

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.010 
probably the same if not a little bit
more<00:01:42.119> expensive<00:01:44.180> they've<00:01:45.180> added<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.540> lightning

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
more expensive they've added a lightning

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.859 
more expensive they've added a lightning
port<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.649> mean<00:01:47.579> let's<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> tells<00:01:48.659> you

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
port I mean let's see here it tells you

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.050 
port I mean let's see here it tells you
here<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.649> value<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> Lightning<00:01:50.520> port<00:01:50.759> and
