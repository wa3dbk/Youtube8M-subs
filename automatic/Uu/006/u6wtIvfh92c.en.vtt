00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.080
 if you have to understand the meaning of the movements then 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.080
 have all the basic motions behind you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:28.239
 what is the meaning now i have said and 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:32.649
 saying without saying a word about this not that 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:35.739
 it's just a reflection of how it makes sense 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.460
 why for us for russian it is long 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.680
 digested 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.760
 why is it easier for amerikosov because 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.699
 that it is them below that is, people do not say 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.339
 they say translation stamp your foot on i 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.920
 so on the tip imagine that the harp is not 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.460
 I thought that in Russia is considered the whole sill 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.059
 woman for trying to pay accordingly 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.879
 trampled 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:02.159
 it already opens up just all eyes 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:07.290
 now you are not an argument very important then 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:10.570
 cool is it very much further 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.140
 stagnation is excellent one thing you think in 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.970
 head so what 's the other thing you 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:22.550
 think there is no way to dig 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.930
 I understand yours can fly off like this 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.360
 can leave can catch 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:40.130
 accordingly it is already 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:44.570
 it's not that you do something think 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.740
 trample the world will turn upside down seriously and 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.240
 when you realize that everyone has 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.850
 its meaning slightly to translate 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.910
 let's say not enough to understand it and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.910
 call it can be considered doom 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.310
 but words who 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.190
 can be perceived as well 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.620
 perceive how to give there and this 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.900
 right then so as not skin differently 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.140
 do that hips back side can all 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.050
 this is also the base of this yes but when you 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.780
 study study exactly the reflection that is 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.230
 then when he teaches yes he cannot teach 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.080
 only i'm sure we happily taught 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.480
 only explains everything because this 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.050
 engine process he has to show 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.360
 example accordingly what is it now this 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.100
 just an example and you can 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.310
 mile so how do you feel for this 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.960
 perceive it all exactly how it makes sense 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.050
 understand everyone is not yourself 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.580
 what that meaning carries a special movement and 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.790
 then you can just 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.240
 that's what we call the bases they make you 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.740
 there are people who do they do not value 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.930
 They wanted to give the archive and these are all 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.540
 calculated but you need to be able to dance 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.580
 do the things you do for the first time 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.220
 The output podlagivaet 2 acts like this 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:28.550
 this trick is just stupid banal 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:30.739
 full chip moat it is not also that 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.200
 there is again taught in small chips 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.200
 done will make a cool chip than will 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.239
 what is important to understand 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.450
 meaning everything when you trade 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:48.410
 will do think about stop you will 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:52.970
 I do something wrong there accordingly 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.590
 at this point, I'll do something not like 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.500
 i feel the getters and it is 10 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.780
 dance is born here is a magic 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.950
 action the same second they are when you 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.069
 did too 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.019
 even if for that I have a lot already 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.170
 should be trying now more often 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.480
 dance and grandfather so that on to 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.790
 dance you need to clearly understand what it is 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.680
 find out why the base 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:27.760
 need to understand everything all or need to understand 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:30.290
 let's say 3 yes and that yoko taro its board 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.940
 tree is just moving 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:39.220
 transfer well and everything has moved now 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.220
 made it beautiful as it were dancing 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.960
 bring it you have constipation 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.430
 so will be born somewhere bass is not 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.070
 there is material and so on then bases but 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.380
 if you want to separate yourself and 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.270
 something like we just each time will 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.190
 make everything new and new every self 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.360
 can any base base thing 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.590
 jerk off what is impossible under immediately 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.360
 the adapter is so just not 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.910
 here's a little example of this whole thing 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.900
 so your body is feelings but when 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.220
 you just layer it immediately taught in number 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.720
 learn different things right away 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.810
 the audience is there the food is there their own forge 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.810
 this
