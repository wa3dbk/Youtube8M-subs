00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
okay so today I'm gonna demonstrate how

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.660 
okay so today I'm gonna demonstrate how
to<00:00:07.049> do<00:00:07.379> in<00:00:07.740> elevate<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.929> irrelevant<00:00:09.929> in

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
to do in elevate and irrelevant in

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.180 
to do in elevate and irrelevant in
elevate<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.389> basically<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.110> rise<00:00:13.530> without<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
elevate is basically a rise without a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.570 
elevate is basically a rise without a
plie<00:00:14.610> which<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.179> showed<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:15.690> last<00:00:15.900> video<00:00:16.580> so

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
plie which I showed in my last video so

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.540 
plie which I showed in my last video so
this<00:00:17.760> was<00:00:17.970> an<00:00:18.210> example<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.869> an<00:00:18.990> elevate<00:00:22.550> you

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
this was an example of an elevate you

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.490 
this was an example of an elevate you
keep<00:00:23.760> your<00:00:23.910> legs<00:00:24.090> completely<00:00:24.840> straight<00:00:25.289> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
keep your legs completely straight and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.359 
keep your legs completely straight and
just<00:00:26.070> rise<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> then<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.740> balance<00:00:31.369> okay

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
just rise and then you can balance okay

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.810 
just rise and then you can balance okay
so<00:00:32.910> now<00:00:33.180> after<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.930> master<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> LaVey<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
so now after you master the a LaVey you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.470 
so now after you master the a LaVey you
can<00:00:36.090> go<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.329> irrelevant<00:00:37.110> which<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.969> plie

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
can go on to irrelevant which is plie

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.280 
can go on to irrelevant which is plie
rise<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> combination<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.989> plie

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
rise to have the combination of a plie

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.979 
rise to have the combination of a plie
and<00:00:44.219> an<00:00:44.550> elevate<00:00:46.940> that's<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.450> probably

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and an elevate that's kind of probably

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.490 
and an elevate that's kind of probably
why<00:00:49.230> they<00:00:49.469> sound<00:00:49.770> alike<00:00:51.079> another<00:00:52.079> thing<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
why they sound alike another thing that

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100 
why they sound alike another thing that
you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.390> stretch<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.809> feet

before you're starting a class is plie
roll<00:00:59.579> through<00:01:00.440> rise<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.780> first<00:01:04.159> rise<00:01:05.840> over

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
roll through rise and first rise over

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.210 
roll through rise and first rise over
the<00:01:07.979> egg<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.580> straight<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:10.860> just
