under a microscope it's got an

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.770 
under a microscope it's got an
indentation<00:01:41.320> little<00:01:41.830> concave<00:01:42.510> divot<00:01:43.510> in<00:01:43.660> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
end there the barrel is hexagonal and I

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.770 
end there the barrel is hexagonal and I
think<00:01:49.840> it's<00:01:50.430> aluminium<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.700> looks<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.570> and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
think it's aluminium and looks of it and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.730 
think it's aluminium and looks of it and
it's<00:01:53.740> all<00:01:53.980> black<00:01:54.310> powder-coated<00:01:55.180> now<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.470> great

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
it's all black powder-coated now a great

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.920 
it's all black powder-coated now a great
advantage<00:01:57.190> with<00:01:57.580> that<00:01:57.880> apart<00:01:58.510> from<00:01:58.570> being

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
advantage with that apart from being

see this you'll see the two little

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.719 
see this you'll see the two little
grooves<00:03:36.669> at<00:03:36.819> the<00:03:36.909> top<00:03:37.150> there<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:38.129> we<00:03:39.129> will<00:03:39.189> put

grooves at the top there and we will put

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:43.080 
grooves at the top there and we will put
the<00:03:40.120> spring<00:03:40.810> bar<00:03:41.019> tool<00:03:41.049> in<00:03:41.639> locate<00:03:42.639> it<00:03:42.819> firmly
