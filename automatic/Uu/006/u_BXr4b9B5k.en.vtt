a lot of people aren't a big fan of this

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.649 
a lot of people aren't a big fan of this
knife<00:02:15.579> they<00:02:15.819> like<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.090> look<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:16.599> I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
the sheath that came with actually feels

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.920 
the sheath that came with actually feels
a<00:02:24.129> little<00:02:24.310> bit<00:02:24.430> higher<00:02:24.730> quality<00:02:24.760> than<00:02:25.629> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
a little bit higher quality than the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.679 
a little bit higher quality than the
sheath<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:26.409> my<00:02:26.500> old<00:02:26.709> slick<00:02:27.390> plus<00:02:28.390> see

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
retention is much much tighter on this

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.179 
retention is much much tighter on this
one<00:02:37.230> actually<00:02:38.230> it's<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> little<00:02:38.950> too<00:02:39.159> tight

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
one actually it's a little too tight

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.890 
one actually it's a little too tight
it's<00:02:39.640> gonna<00:02:39.730> really<00:02:40.090> scratch<00:02:40.329> of<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.599> carbon

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it's gonna really scratch of that carbon

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.069 
it's gonna really scratch of that carbon
fiber<00:02:41.140> oh<00:02:41.409> I<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.459> heat<00:02:42.640> gun<00:02:42.849> so<00:02:43.120> I'll

fiber oh I have a heat gun so I'll

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.619 
fiber oh I have a heat gun so I'll
probably<00:02:44.639> heat<00:02:45.639> that<00:02:45.790> up<00:02:45.849> or<00:02:46.209> maybe<00:02:46.389> it'll

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
probably heat that up or maybe it'll

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.879 
probably heat that up or maybe it'll
wear<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.989> overtime<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.650> don't<00:02:47.889> know<00:02:49.290> but<00:02:50.290> you
