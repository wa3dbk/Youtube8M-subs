00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.130 
a little discussion thing because I know
probably<00:05:20.240> many<00:05:20.420> of<00:05:20.540> you<00:05:20.600> don't<00:05:20.750> carry<00:05:21.050> around

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
probably many of you don't carry around

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.620 
probably many of you don't carry around
vlog<00:05:21.500> cameras<00:05:22.010> but<00:05:22.400> I'm<00:05:22.970> sure<00:05:23.180> that<00:05:23.390> at<00:05:23.540> some

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
vlog cameras but I'm sure that at some

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.940 
vlog cameras but I'm sure that at some
point<00:05:23.990> or<00:05:24.080> another<00:05:24.110> you've<00:05:24.410> been<00:05:24.560> taking<00:05:24.860> a

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
point or another you've been taking a

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.430 
point or another you've been taking a
picture<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:25.730> maybe<00:05:26.540> there<00:05:26.870> was<00:05:27.020> someone<00:05:27.230> in

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
picture and maybe there was someone in

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.170 
picture and maybe there was someone in
the<00:05:27.500> background<00:05:27.680> who<00:05:28.100> did<00:05:28.280> something<00:05:28.580> to

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
the background who did something to

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.940 
the background who did something to
maybe<00:05:29.810> when<00:05:30.200> your<00:05:30.350> family<00:05:30.620> members<00:05:30.920> for

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
maybe when your family members for

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.030 
maybe when your family members for
someone<00:05:31.370> like<00:05:31.550> like<00:05:32.390> that<00:05:32.720> got<00:05:33.440> in<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.800> shot

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
someone like like that got in the shot

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.790 
someone like like that got in the shot
with<00:05:34.250> you<00:05:34.630> maybe<00:05:35.630> that's<00:05:35.810> not<00:05:36.050> as<00:05:36.200> common<00:05:36.440> as<00:05:36.650> I

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
with you maybe that's not as common as I

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.550 
with you maybe that's not as common as I
think<00:05:37.550> it<00:05:37.850> is<00:05:38.030> but<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:38.570> bet<00:05:38.810> in<00:05:39.020> your<00:05:39.140> lifetime

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
think it is but I bet in your lifetime

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.200 
think it is but I bet in your lifetime
that's<00:05:39.740> probably<00:05:40.280> happened<00:05:40.610> at<00:05:40.730> least<00:05:40.880> once

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
that's probably happened at least once

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.510 
that's probably happened at least once
or<00:05:41.420> to<00:05:41.960> someone<00:05:42.260> you<00:05:42.410> know<00:05:42.590> if<00:05:43.310> that's

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
or to someone you know if that's

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.250 
or to someone you know if that's
happened<00:05:44.030> if<00:05:44.210> someone<00:05:44.510> else<00:05:44.630> has<00:05:44.810> gotten<00:05:45.080> into

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
happened if someone else has gotten into

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.930 
happened if someone else has gotten into
