windward way four gears war judgment
three<00:00:04.230> stars<00:00:04.500> insane<00:00:05.009> difficulty<00:00:05.460> to

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
three stars insane difficulty to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.490 
three stars insane difficulty to
classify<00:00:05.970> challenge<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.259> Declassified

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
classify challenge so the Declassified

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.230 
classify challenge so the Declassified
challenge<00:00:07.980> for<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.910> extra

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
challenge for this is that that extra

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.049 
challenge for this is that that extra
locus<00:00:09.719> will<00:00:09.900> attack<00:00:10.200> from<00:00:10.710> behind<00:00:10.980> now<00:00:11.940> what

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
locus will attack from behind now what

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.160 
locus will attack from behind now what
this<00:00:12.210> means<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:13.610> there<00:00:14.610> will<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.170> extra

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
this means is that there will be extra

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.170 
this means is that there will be extra
waves<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:17.010> either<00:00:18.859> wretches<00:00:19.859> or<00:00:20.180> potentially

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
waves of either wretches or potentially

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.679 
waves of either wretches or potentially
even<00:00:21.289> grubs<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.590> come<00:00:23.250> from<00:00:23.490> behind<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
even grubs that come from behind and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.220 
even grubs that come from behind and
like<00:00:25.019> during<00:00:25.410> some<00:00:25.619> fights<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.930> this<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.080> one

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
like during some fights so this is one

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.779 
like during some fights so this is one
of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> longer<00:00:28.740> levels<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> entire<00:00:29.519> game

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of the longer levels in the entire game

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.630 
of the longer levels in the entire game
and<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:31.019> actually<00:00:33.620> fortunately<00:00:34.620> there<00:00:34.950> are<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and it actually fortunately there are a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.490 
and it actually fortunately there are a
couple<00:00:36.270> checkpoints<00:00:36.870> throughout<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.230> level

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
couple checkpoints throughout this level

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.760 
couple checkpoints throughout this level
because<00:00:38.899> when<00:00:39.899> they<00:00:39.989> come<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.290> behind<00:00:40.530> if

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
because when they come from behind if

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.049 
because when they come from behind if
you're<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.010> prepared<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.940> it's

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
you're not prepared for it like if it's

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.040 
you're not prepared for it like if it's
your<00:00:42.149> first<00:00:42.270> time<00:00:42.450> playing<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.870> you're<00:00:42.960> just

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050

your first time playing and you're just
learning<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.309> points<00:00:44.640> where<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.789> need<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> be

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
learning the points where you need to be

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.850 
learning the points where you need to be
on<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.870> toes<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.289> spinning<00:00:46.559> around<00:00:46.770> really

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
on your toes and spinning around really

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
on your toes and spinning around really
quick<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> don't<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.719> know

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
quick or you don't have like a you know

good<00:00:48.989> headphones<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.469> something<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> actually

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
good headphones or something to actually

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.350 
good headphones or something to actually
listen<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> deuce<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.789> pop<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.239> from

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
listen for the deuce to pop up from

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.639 
listen for the deuce to pop up from
behind<00:00:51.829> you'll<00:00:52.829> probably<00:00:53.129> die<00:00:53.460> pretty<00:00:53.610> quick

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.290 

it's<00:00:58.649> not<00:00:58.859> overwhelmingly<00:00:59.609> difficult<00:00:59.820> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
it's not overwhelmingly difficult the
