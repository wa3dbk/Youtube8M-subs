I'm<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> only<00:00:50.969> seal<00:00:51.360> where<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> screws

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I'm going to only seal where the screws

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.100 
I'm going to only seal where the screws
are<00:00:53.030> we've<00:00:54.030> cleaned<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> deck<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.989> the

are we've cleaned the deck and the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.650 
are we've cleaned the deck and the
fitting<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.590> acetone<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.640> ensure<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.360> perfect

bond<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> sealant<00:00:59.550> we're<00:01:00.359> using<00:01:00.600> bolts

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
bond with the sealant we're using bolts

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.130 
bond with the sealant we're using bolts
here<00:01:02.000> it's<00:01:03.000> always<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> good<00:01:03.570> idea<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.960> use

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
here it's always a good idea to use

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
here it's always a good idea to use
bolts<00:01:04.530> even<00:01:04.890> though<00:01:04.979> every<00:01:05.189> time<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.549> get

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
bolts even though every time you get

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.240 
bolts even though every time you get
apart<00:01:06.000> from<00:01:06.240> sailrite<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.990> will<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.409> screws

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
apart from sailrite it will have screws

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.590 
apart from sailrite it will have screws
we<00:01:09.150> can't<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.900> length<00:01:10.650> bolt<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.220> need

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
we can't know what length bolt you need

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.090 
we can't know what length bolt you need
the<00:01:12.600> screws<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.740> universally

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
the screws are more universally

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.649 
the screws are more universally
applicable<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.130> send<00:01:20.400> screws<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.210> bolts

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
applicable so we send screws but bolts

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.120 
applicable so we send screws but bolts
are<00:01:21.810> better<00:01:22.020> there's<00:01:22.590> no<00:01:22.740> question<00:01:23.100> about

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
are better there's no question about

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.300 
are better there's no question about
that<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> good<00:01:24.720> idea<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.710> get

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that now it's a good idea to if I get

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.120 
that now it's a good idea to if I get
some<00:01:26.580> sealant<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.659> bolt<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.979> going

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
some sealant on the bolt I'm just going

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.740 
some sealant on the bolt I'm just going
to<00:01:29.159> put<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.759> temporarily<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.570> hold

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
to put that one in temporarily to hold

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.990 
to put that one in temporarily to hold
everything<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.650> I'll<00:01:32.100> put<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> little<00:01:32.520> sealing

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
everything and I'll put a little sealing

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.780 
everything and I'll put a little sealing
around<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.509> bolt<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.070> want<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> seal<00:01:35.579> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
around the bolt what we want to seal is

around the bolt what we want to seal is
the<00:01:35.939> opening<00:01:36.799> nothing<00:01:37.799> else

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.540 
Jim's place the nut on the inside and is
now<00:02:45.030> tightening<00:02:45.690> down<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.260> bolt<00:02:52.280> usually<00:02:53.280> one

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
now tightening down the bolt usually one

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.100 
now tightening down the bolt usually one
to<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:54.570> tighten<00:02:54.810> these<00:02:55.490> snug<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.910> then<00:02:57.870> let

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
to just tighten these snug and then let

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.340 
to just tighten these snug and then let
the<00:02:58.320> sealant<00:02:58.830> dry<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.790> then<00:03:00.780> tighten<00:03:01.260> them

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
the sealant dry and then tighten them

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.870 
the sealant dry and then tighten them
from<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.710> back<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.700> bowl<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:04.880> final

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
from the back if it's a bowl a final

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.940 
from the back if it's a bowl a final
half<00:03:06.090> turn<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:07.110> in<00:03:07.230> other<00:03:07.290> words<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.650> let<00:03:07.830> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
half turn so in other words you let the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.750 
half turn so in other words you let the
seal<00:03:08.300> form<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.420> kind<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.780> gasket<00:03:10.550> now<00:03:11.550> he's

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
seal form a kind of gasket now he's

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:21.000 
seal form a kind of gasket now he's
installing<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.390> second<00:03:12.810> nut

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.160 

when<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.220> part<00:03:22.459> when<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.360> adhesive<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.900> drive

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
when the part when the adhesive is drive

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.070 
when the part when the adhesive is drive
and<00:03:24.590> you're<00:03:24.770> tightening<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:26.209> nut<00:03:26.450> for

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
and you're tightening the nut for

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.059 
and you're tightening the nut for
another<00:03:27.350> half<00:03:27.560> turn

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
another half turn

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.540 
another half turn
just<00:03:28.550> hold<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.000> head<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.540> screw<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:30.170> place

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
just hold the head of the screw in place

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.210 
just hold the head of the screw in place
so<00:03:31.550> it<00:03:31.670> doesn't<00:03:31.730> move<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.080> if<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.830> if<00:03:34.100> you

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
so it doesn't move if it if it if you

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.130 
so it doesn't move if it if it if you
turn<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.580> screw<00:03:34.819> it's<00:03:35.270> likely<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.690> break<00:03:35.930> the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
turn the screw it's likely to break the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.400 
turn the screw it's likely to break the
seal<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:37.160> final<00:03:37.970> turn<00:03:38.420> should<00:03:39.050> be<00:03:39.200> done

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
seal so that final turn should be done

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.270 
seal so that final turn should be done
from<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:40.069> inside<00:03:41.530> if<00:03:42.530> you're<00:03:42.709> using<00:03:42.890> enough

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
from the inside if you're using enough

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.180 
from the inside if you're using enough
in<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.459> bowl<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:44.090> can't<00:03:44.870> do<00:03:45.050> it<00:03:45.170> here<00:03:45.500> using

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
in a bowl you can't do it here using

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.220 
in a bowl you can't do it here using
wood<00:03:46.370> screws<00:03:46.640> without<00:03:47.239> breaking<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.720> seal<00:03:47.930> so

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
wood screws without breaking the seal so

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.550 
wood screws without breaking the seal so
you<00:03:48.290> just<00:03:48.590> type<00:03:48.739> in<00:03:48.950> which<00:03:49.069> means<00:03:49.340> now
