outputs again color-coded so there's no

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.819 
outputs again color-coded so there's no
confusion<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:09.030> we<00:03:10.019> follow<00:03:10.290> these<00:03:10.560> color

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
confusion and we follow these color

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.940 
confusion and we follow these color
codes<00:03:11.659> right<00:03:12.659> down<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.109> transfer<00:03:13.560> pumps
