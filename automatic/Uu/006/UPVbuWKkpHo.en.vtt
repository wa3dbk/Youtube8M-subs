when<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> move<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:40.100> we<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.220> one<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.700> two

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
when it's a move see we have one up two

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.299 
when it's a move see we have one up two
down<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> middle<00:00:42.480> C<00:00:42.780> then<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:43.620> tick<00:00:44.010> finger

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
down the middle C then we go tick finger

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.040 
down the middle C then we go tick finger
number<00:00:44.550> three<00:00:44.760> we're<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.840> B

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
B flat just with the three finger three

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.840 
B flat just with the three finger three
and<00:00:56.339> you're<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.180> finger<00:00:57.480> two<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.989> C<00:00:58.850> 1

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and you're going to be finger two is C 1

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.329 
and you're going to be finger two is C 1
is<00:01:00.059> d<00:01:00.299> we<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.780> across<00:01:01.019> finger<00:01:01.500> number<00:01:01.739> four

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
is d we go across finger number four

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.960 
is d we go across finger number four
over<00:01:02.970> finger<00:01:03.269> number<00:01:03.479> one<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> E<00:01:04.080> flat<00:01:04.970> 3

over finger number one to the E flat 3

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.530 
over finger number one to the E flat 3
is<00:01:06.119> girl

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
is girl

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.110 
is girl
-<00:01:08.200> it's<00:01:08.410> two<00:01:08.620> is<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:10.930> two<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:12.520> being<00:01:12.760> back

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
- it's two is one and two is being back

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.880 
- it's two is one and two is being back
crossing<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.720> two<00:01:13.930> over<00:01:14.170> finger<00:01:14.470> number<00:01:14.680> one
