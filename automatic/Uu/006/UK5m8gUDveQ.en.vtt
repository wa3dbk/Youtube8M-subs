I<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:17.099> frequently<00:00:17.849> to<00:00:18.000> work<00:00:18.180> with<00:00:18.390> weights

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
I like frequently to work with weights

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.509 
I like frequently to work with weights
for<00:00:19.019> challenging<00:00:19.590> fabrics<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.400> make

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 
for challenging fabrics that can make

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.240 
for challenging fabrics that can make
all<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> difference<00:00:21.260> but<00:00:22.260> not<00:00:22.500> every<00:00:23.070> machine

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
all the difference but not every machine

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.749

has a suitable comb this one was made by
brother<00:00:27.359> years<00:00:27.810> ago<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:29.099> use<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.669> the<00:00:29.880> river

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
brother years ago for use with the river

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.900 
brother years ago for use with the river
they<00:00:31.019> intended<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.280> to<00:00:32.340> put<00:00:32.580> a<00:00:32.610> river

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
they intended for you to put a river

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.660 
they intended for you to put a river
wire<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.080> each<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:35.040> these<00:00:35.190> times

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
wire in here and each of these times

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.140 
wire in here and each of these times
stuck<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.780> between<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.440> needle<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.940> wire

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
stuck in between a needle and the wire

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.020 
stuck in between a needle and the wire
held<00:00:39.570> them<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.900> to<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.470> fabric<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.700> fine

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
held them on to the fabric that's fine

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.450 
held them on to the fabric that's fine
works<00:00:42.390> great<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.470> it<00:00:43.620> works<00:00:43.830> just<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.430> well

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
works great but it works just as well

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.770 
works great but it works just as well
for<00:00:44.880> non<00:00:45.740> river<00:00:46.740> use<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.490> also<00:00:48.330> for<00:00:48.600> non

hinged<00:00:52.380> bar<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.290> bit<00:00:55.410> heavy<00:00:55.740> so<00:00:55.980> by

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
hinged bar it's a little bit heavy so by

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400 
hinged bar it's a little bit heavy so by
itself<00:00:56.790> it<00:00:57.180> adds<00:00:57.390> some<00:00:57.660> weight<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.140> work

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
itself it adds some weight to your work

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.920 
itself it adds some weight to your work
and<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.430> enough<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.750> has

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and it can be just enough it has

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.770 
and it can be just enough it has
multiple<00:01:01.590> holes<00:01:01.830> as<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.610> on<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.540> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
multiple holes as you see on which you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.889 
multiple holes as you see on which you
can<00:01:03.990> hang<00:01:04.229> regular<00:01:05.189> river<00:01:05.460> weights<00:01:05.780> even<00:01:06.780> if

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
can hang regular river weights even if

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.569 
can hang regular river weights even if
you<00:01:06.990> don't<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> river<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.009> could<00:01:08.189> buy<00:01:08.369> or

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
you don't have a river you could buy or

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.679 
you don't have a river you could buy or
improvise<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.390> River<00:01:09.659> weights<00:01:10.789> and<00:01:11.789> I'm

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
improvise some River weights and I'm

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.020 
improvise some River weights and I'm
going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.439> show<00:01:13.649> you<00:01:13.679> how<00:01:14.039> to<00:01:14.100> use<00:01:14.429> it<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.820> any

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
going to show you how to use it on any

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
going to show you how to use it on any
machine<00:01:15.270> where<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.810> need<00:01:16.170> some<00:01:16.590> extra<00:01:16.859> weight

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
machine where you need some extra weight

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.480 
machine where you need some extra weight
such<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.909> tuck<00:01:18.149> stitch<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:19.469> I<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.249> to<00:01:20.280> use

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
such as for tuck stitch or I like to use

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
such as for tuck stitch or I like to use
it<00:01:20.789> for<00:01:20.939> thread<00:01:21.240> lace<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.749> you<00:01:21.929> will<00:01:22.079> see<00:01:22.289> in

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it for thread lace as you will see in

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
it for thread lace as you will see in
this<00:01:22.619> design<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.270> bit<00:01:24.420> of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
this design because a little bit of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.169 
this design because a little bit of
weight<00:01:24.840> helps<00:01:25.229> me<00:01:25.469> control<00:01:25.859> the<00:01:26.579> work<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
weight helps me control the work and

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.599 
weight helps me control the work and
keep<00:01:27.749> it<00:01:27.899> from<00:01:28.079> popping<00:01:28.320> off<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.740> end<00:01:29.100> needles

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
keep it from popping off the end needles

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.109 
keep it from popping off the end needles
and<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.569> just<00:01:30.810> makes<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.350> more<00:01:31.560> smoothly

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
and it just makes it go more smoothly

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.230 
and it just makes it go more smoothly
but<00:01:33.119> thread<00:01:33.659> lace<00:01:33.929> is<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.560> delicate<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.909> can't

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
but thread lace is so delicate you can't

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.440 
but thread lace is so delicate you can't
really<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.810> stick<00:01:37.049> any<00:01:37.350> weights<00:01:37.649> in<00:01:37.950> there

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
really just stick any weights in there

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
really just stick any weights in there
and<00:01:39.450> hanging<00:01:40.049> claw<00:01:40.439> weights<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.130> risky<00:01:41.670> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
and hanging claw weights it's risky I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.330 
and hanging claw weights it's risky I
don't<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.219> get

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
don't like to do it because you can get

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.879 
don't like to do it because you can get
100<00:01:44.819> rows<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.659> damage<00:01:46.289> one<00:01:46.499> piece<00:01:46.679> of

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
100 rows in and damage one piece of

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.370 
100 rows in and damage one piece of
thread<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.090> whole<00:01:48.270> piece<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.749> virtually

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
thread and the whole piece is virtually

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.090 
thread and the whole piece is virtually
ruined<00:01:50.179> so<00:01:51.179> I<00:01:51.569> find<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.109> to<00:01:52.319> be<00:01:52.350> very<00:01:52.469> helpful

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
ruined so I find this to be very helpful

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.559 
ruined so I find this to be very helpful
you<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.609> a<00:01:53.639> little<00:01:53.999> careful<00:01:54.210> when

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
you have to be a little careful when

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.809 
you have to be a little careful when
moving<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.499> teeth<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:56.100> we're<00:01:56.369> moving<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
moving the teeth up we're moving the

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.120 
moving the teeth up we're moving the
weights<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.389> to<00:01:57.600> prevent<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> teeth<00:01:58.709> from

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
weights up to prevent the teeth from

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.660 
weights up to prevent the teeth from
snagging<00:01:59.429> the<00:01:59.729> fabric<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:02.219> putting<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
snagging the fabric but just putting it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.449 
snagging the fabric but just putting it
on<00:02:02.819> and<00:02:03.119> taking<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.539> off<00:02:03.799> doesn't<00:02:04.799> cause<00:02:05.159> any

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
on and taking it off doesn't cause any

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.879 
on and taking it off doesn't cause any
harm<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.090> are<00:02:06.270> careful<00:02:06.569> let<00:02:07.560> me<00:02:07.679> show<00:02:07.829> you

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:07.889 
harm if you are careful let me show you

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:10.670 
harm if you are careful let me show you
how<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.130> like<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.580> use<00:02:08.760> it

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
how I like to use it

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.830 
how I like to use it
I'm<00:02:11.680> knitting<00:02:12.010> some<00:02:12.400> thread<00:02:12.760> lace<00:02:13.060> here<00:02:13.450> I'm

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
I'm knitting some thread lace here I'm

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.539 
I'm knitting some thread lace here I'm
going<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.140> zoom<00:02:14.409> in<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.650> little<00:02:14.829> bit<00:02:15.159> so<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.459> can

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
going to zoom in a little bit so you can

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.600 
going to zoom in a little bit so you can
see<00:02:15.939> how<00:02:16.120> delicate<00:02:16.659> it<00:02:16.689> is<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:18.010> working<00:02:18.340> on

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
see how delicate it is I'm working on

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.240 
see how delicate it is I'm working on
the<00:02:18.790> bulky<00:02:19.209> machine<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.680> find<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.069> it

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the bulky machine and I find that it

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.800 
the bulky machine and I find that it
works<00:02:21.280> better<00:02:21.730> with<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> little<00:02:22.329> bit<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.599> weight

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
works better with a little bit of weight

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.910 
works better with a little bit of weight
but<00:02:23.760> given<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.879> delicacy<00:02:25.569> of<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.870> fabric<00:02:26.439> you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
but given the delicacy of the fabric you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.100 
but given the delicacy of the fabric you
are<00:02:26.950> really<00:02:27.760> limited<00:02:28.360> in<00:02:28.540> what<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.500> do

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
are really limited in what you can do

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.069 
are really limited in what you can do
all<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.319> have<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.709> do<00:02:32.890> when<00:02:33.250> it's<00:02:33.400> time<00:02:33.700> is

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
all you have to do when it's time is

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.619 
all you have to do when it's time is
lift<00:02:35.079> up<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> fabric<00:02:36.239> making<00:02:37.239> sure<00:02:37.480> that

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
lift up on the fabric making sure that

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.390 
lift up on the fabric making sure that
it<00:02:37.780> comes<00:02:37.989> off<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> teeth<00:02:38.890> because<00:02:39.280> it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
it comes off of the teeth because it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.729 
it comes off of the teeth because it
might<00:02:39.579> have<00:02:39.700> hung<00:02:39.909> up<00:02:40.090> on<00:02:40.299> them<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:41.170> gently

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
might have hung up on them but gently

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.319 
might have hung up on them but gently
lift<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.810> goes<00:02:43.989> right<00:02:44.319> on<00:02:44.379> up<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.329> the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
lift and it goes right on up and the

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:53.339 
lift and it goes right on up and the
hinge<00:02:46.599> will<00:02:46.959> cause<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.530> catch<00:02:48.359> again<00:02:52.349> we're

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
hinge will cause it to catch again we're

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.460 
hinge will cause it to catch again we're
caught<00:02:53.709> again<00:02:54.159> but<00:02:55.120> not<00:02:55.329> so<00:02:55.720> caught<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.319> it's

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
caught again but not so caught that it's

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.900 
caught again but not so caught that it's
going<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.859> damage<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.280> fabric

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.300 

there<00:03:05.600> are<00:03:05.720> quite<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.990> few<00:03:06.170> ways<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.920> set<00:03:07.130> up

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
there are quite a few ways to set up

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.930 
there are quite a few ways to set up
this<00:03:07.490> time<00:03:07.850> putting<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.390> fabric<00:03:08.870> through<00:03:09.080> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
this time putting the fabric through the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.780 
this time putting the fabric through the
pinch<00:03:10.940> but<00:03:11.360> only<00:03:11.510> one<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.870> them<00:03:12.110> works<00:03:12.670> put<00:03:13.670> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
pinch but only one of them works put the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.360 
pinch but only one of them works put the
teeth<00:03:14.030> towards<00:03:14.660> yourself<00:03:14.840> I'm<00:03:15.380> back<00:03:15.770> here<00:03:16.100> I'm

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
teeth towards yourself I'm back here I'm

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.350 
teeth towards yourself I'm back here I'm
pointing<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.910> myself<00:03:17.440> these<00:03:18.440> are<00:03:18.620> my<00:03:18.800> knees

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
pointing to myself these are my knees

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.090 
pointing to myself these are my knees
the<00:03:20.360> comb<00:03:20.630> is<00:03:20.810> sitting<00:03:21.230> with<00:03:21.650> its<00:03:21.860> teeth

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
the comb is sitting with its teeth

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.030 
the comb is sitting with its teeth
pointing<00:03:22.370> at<00:03:22.640> my<00:03:22.790> stomach<00:03:23.330> I<00:03:23.540> do<00:03:24.110> not<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:24.800> any

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
pointing at my stomach I do not have any

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.710 
pointing at my stomach I do not have any
wire<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.700> comb<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.120> does<00:03:26.270> not<00:03:26.450> matter

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
wire in the comb it does not matter

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.540 
wire in the comb it does not matter
because<00:03:27.020> this<00:03:27.440> wouldn't<00:03:27.650> align<00:03:28.070> properly

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
because this wouldn't align properly

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.800 
because this wouldn't align properly
anyway<00:03:28.910> so<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.900> put<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.260> fabric<00:03:30.740> through<00:03:31.810> under

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
anyway so I put the fabric through under

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.490 
anyway so I put the fabric through under
the<00:03:32.840> hinge<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:34.160> hinge<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.610> laying<00:03:34.940> on<00:03:35.690> top<00:03:35.750> of

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
the hinge the hinge is laying on top of

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.370 
the hinge the hinge is laying on top of
the<00:03:36.770> comb<00:03:37.040> but<00:03:37.970> folded<00:03:38.480> towards<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.990> machine

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
the comb but folded towards the machine

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.760 
the comb but folded towards the machine
away<00:03:39.650> from<00:03:40.100> me<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.450> flip<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.900> fabric<00:03:42.110> under

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
away from me so I flip the fabric under

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.620 
away from me so I flip the fabric under
here<00:03:43.390> towards<00:03:44.390> myself<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.940> when<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:46.970> lift<00:03:47.360> it

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
here towards myself and when I lift it

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.370 
here towards myself and when I lift it
up<00:03:48.280> I'm<00:03:49.280> going<00:03:49.460> to<00:03:49.520> try<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.790> do<00:03:50.030> one<00:03:50.270> handed<00:03:53.380> see

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
up I'm going to try to do one handed see

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.220 
up I'm going to try to do one handed see
how<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.680> falls<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.480> such<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.510> way<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.080> the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
how it falls in such a way that the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.750 
how it falls in such a way that the
weight<00:03:57.500> which<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.370> already<00:03:58.700> on<00:03:58.940> there<00:04:00.760> is

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
weight which is already on there is

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.380 
weight which is already on there is
underneath<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.280> stays<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.520> high<00:04:04.700> here<00:04:05.240> we

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
underneath and stays the high here we

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.240 
underneath and stays the high here we
are<00:04:05.680> lifting<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.800> again<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:09.320> great<00:04:09.620> thing<00:04:09.950> is

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
are lifting it again the great thing is

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.550 
are lifting it again the great thing is
that<00:04:10.280> these<00:04:10.700> teeth<00:04:11.090> do<00:04:11.450> not<00:04:11.690> have<00:04:12.020> to<00:04:12.230> align

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
that these teeth do not have to align

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.520 
that these teeth do not have to align
with<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.400> spacing<00:04:13.910> of<00:04:14.000> your<00:04:14.180> machine<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:15.290> can

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
with the spacing of your machine you can

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.340 
with the spacing of your machine you can
use<00:04:15.800> this<00:04:16.190> kind<00:04:16.580> of<00:04:16.760> comb<00:04:17.030> on<00:04:17.359> any<00:04:18.109> machine

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
use this kind of comb on any machine

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.409 
use this kind of comb on any machine
though<00:04:18.770> it<00:04:18.920> was<00:04:19.100> designed<00:04:19.250> for<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.880> standard
