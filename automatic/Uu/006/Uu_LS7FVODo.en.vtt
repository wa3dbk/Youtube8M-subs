00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello how are you good night 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.190
 for all welcome to the second round 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.269
 of this fight with erick osores no day 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.000
 rather the thing comes more calm 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.050
 I did not want to answer the cell phone 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.730
 the weekend is upset is not 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.710
 annoying 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.440
 that calms me down, I am if I am a 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.400
 little indignant not with you but with this 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.400
 with this one 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.970
 this tendency to blame others and not 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.440
 to blame 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.350
 I do not know if very Peruvian or very American 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.540
 world but it does not displease him 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.420
 we regulate the analysis to close everything 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.330
 of taquito for life that seems to me 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.699
 it seems at least that we 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.160
 the referee's performance to analyze the 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.050
 improvement of the final balance you can not go 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.330
 they lost to the referee 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.280
 first self-criticism the game that we 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.080
 I missed a game because I want to win where I am 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.329
 the game lacked hierarchy did not miss 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.940
 hierarchy decisions approach game 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.840
 strategy renovations restatements 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.460
 the rival lacked luck maybe not you 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.470
 missed so much the sport overcome 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.990
 sometimes difficult and time 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.570
 wind the rain the court the referee the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.700
 leather and everything is inside and then if 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.840
 you blamed not much wind the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.350
 excuses 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 the excuse is the live is the live is the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.250
 that you throw the responsible to a 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.590
 cost and you are here is true not 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.280
 I like the sax I do not like it does not speak 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.280
 well of humidity 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.820
 of a leader does not speak well 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.800
 they will definitely hear teasing never 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.530
 the eliminator of the selection and I speak 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.390
 today to remove the man the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.190
 justice commission of arbitrators of the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.960
 conmebol because this situation is 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.360
 unsustainable is missing a date for 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.759
 finish when in mans and the same we go 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.759
 like to see by the public this 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.619
 program sometimes we see that matches 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.119
 They are sad and we do not want to discuss it 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.800
 in production but there is not 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.479
 predecessor before good of the first 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.390
 review we were exceeded in the explanation 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.560
 of people if today the same way people go 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.989
 to have whatever that corner here 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.660
 there is a Viking optimist who gets 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:21.840
 always in the program you can still 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.800
 gonzalo mathematically look today I 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.819
 I'll show you with this calculator 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.650
 that more than clearly can not be 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.870
 then front after showing this 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.230
 giant calculator that I peeled them and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.230
