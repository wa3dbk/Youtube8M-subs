playing as a medic on upward forced into

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.769 
playing as a medic on upward forced into
an<00:00:17.430> early<00:00:17.609> /<00:00:18.090> which<00:00:18.240> was<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> little<00:00:18.690> bit

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
an early / which was a little bit

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.650 
an early / which was a little bit
unfortunate<00:00:19.560> but<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.730> be<00:00:20.880> expected<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.630> suppose

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
unfortunate but to be expected I suppose

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.599 
unfortunate but to be expected I suppose
it<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.199> upward<00:00:22.680> after<00:00:22.949> all<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.160> everybody

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
it is upward after all and everybody

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.730 
it is upward after all and everybody
knows<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.480> beginning<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.199> upward<00:00:25.560> is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
knows that the beginning of upward is

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.759 
knows that the beginning of upward is
one<00:00:26.099> chaotic<00:00:26.849> spam<00:00:27.300> fast<00:00:27.660> towards<00:00:28.470> every

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
one chaotic spam fast towards every

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.910 
one chaotic spam fast towards every
single<00:00:29.130> exit<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.349> surprisingly<00:00:31.349> enough<00:00:31.710> as

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
single exit but surprisingly enough as

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.170 
single exit but surprisingly enough as
you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.189> see<00:00:32.340> right<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:32.640> there's<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> lot

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
you can see right here there's not a lot

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.610 
you can see right here there's not a lot
of<00:00:33.210> resistance<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.960> now<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> think<00:00:34.260> we've

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
of resistance right now I think we've

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.770 
of resistance right now I think we've
killed<00:00:34.890> most<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.430> them<00:00:35.610> which<00:00:36.239> allowed<00:00:36.540> us<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
killed most of them which allowed us to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.619 
killed most of them which allowed us to
push<00:00:37.590> through<00:00:37.860> sufficiently<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:39.300> make<00:00:39.450> sure

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
push through sufficiently to make sure

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.850 
push through sufficiently to make sure
that<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> grief

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
distance which is very rewarding i can

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
distance which is very rewarding i can
actually<00:01:28.350> hit<00:01:28.619> stuff<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> needle

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
actually hit stuff with with the needle

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.550 
actually hit stuff with with the needle
gun<00:01:30.329> there<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.720> many<00:01:30.930> needles<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> they

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
gun there are so many needles and they

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.920 
gun there are so many needles and they
are<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.920> small<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:33.180> hard<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.509> me<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
are so small it's very hard for me to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.399 
are so small it's very hard for me to
get<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> grip<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:36.270> needle<00:01:36.600> gun<00:01:36.750> itself<00:01:37.140> or

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
get a grip on the needle gun itself or

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.830 
get a grip on the needle gun itself or
on<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.710> bloodsword<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.479> happen

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
on the bloodsword now this will happen

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.480 
on the bloodsword now this will happen
if<00:01:40.140> i<00:01:40.229> were<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> use<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> weapon<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> lot<00:01:41.250> more

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
if i were to use the weapon a lot more

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
if i were to use the weapon a lot more
but<00:01:42.079> because<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> fact<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.530> i<00:01:43.649> can't

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
but because of the fact that i can't

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.649 
but because of the fact that i can't
really<00:01:44.159> track<00:01:44.549> all<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> needles<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.540> my

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
really track all of the needles with my

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.870 
really track all of the needles with my
eyes<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.079> very<00:01:46.229> hard<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.710> predict<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.700> way

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
eyes it's very hard to predict in a way

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.630 
eyes it's very hard to predict in a way
where<00:01:48.600> they<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.220> compared<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> where

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
where they are going compared to where

playstyle is a thing or should have but
this<00:05:55.570> is<00:05:55.750> why<00:05:55.900> I<00:05:55.930> flames<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.560> I<00:05:56.620> I<00:05:56.650> tried<00:05:57.340> to

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
this is why I flames and I I tried to

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.830 
this is why I flames and I I tried to
press<00:05:57.670> all<00:05:57.820> the<00:05:57.880> buttons<00:05:58.000> at<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.450> same<00:05:58.510> time

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
press all the buttons at the same time

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.600 
press all the buttons at the same time
and<00:05:59.050> if<00:05:59.140> I<00:05:59.200> have<00:05:59.320> an<00:05:59.410> uber<00:05:59.650> it<00:06:00.100> tends<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.430> done

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
and if I have an uber it tends to done

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.730 
and if I have an uber it tends to done
trigger<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.090> uber<00:06:01.360> but<00:06:01.540> nobody<00:06:01.930> died<00:06:02.200> so<00:06:02.710> I

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
trigger the uber but nobody died so I

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.980 
trigger the uber but nobody died so I
guess<00:06:03.010> that's<00:06:03.250> something<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:04.120> counts<00:06:04.870> for

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
guess that's something that counts for

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.710 
guess that's something that counts for
anything<00:06:05.080> but<00:06:05.590> I<00:06:05.830> know<00:06:06.670> it<00:06:06.910> was<00:06:07.090> it<00:06:07.420> wasn't

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720
