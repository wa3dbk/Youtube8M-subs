00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Hey everyone and welcome to this Audiofanzine video

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.400
where we're going to demo the new PolyTune Clip

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
which clips directly onto the headstock of your guitar

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.900
The PolyTune Clip is packaged like so

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.640
with a clipping mechanism and, of course

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.300
the actual tuner, with a surprisingly large screen

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.460
We see there are 3 buttons

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.680
One relatively large button here

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.740
and two smaller buttons found here

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.840
We turn it on by clicking on the large button

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.840
We see the typical PolyTune display

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.440
so nothing new with regards to display

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.220
The different modes are accessible, for example,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.320
by clicking on this small button here,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.580
we can lower the tuning like so

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.320
and we can tune with a capo up to the 7th fret

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.280
If we click on the other small button,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.940
we switch from chromatic to strobe mode

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.440
which offers the advantage of more precise tuning

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.400
If we click on both small buttons simultaneously

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.060
we can adjust the pitch from 435Hz to 445Hz

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.200
If we hold on this button here

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.680
we enter Bass mode

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.300
And another positive is that the clip automatically turns off after 3 minutes

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.120
It also automatically reorients itself, so if we turn the tuner like so,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.520
normally the display will adjust accordingly

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.960
And the price, set at 39â‚¬,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.620
is certainly justifiable for a tuner of this quality

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.260
However, one thing that's missing relative to the original PolyTune

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.520
is that there is no longer a Drop D mode

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.080
So guitarists that often use Drop D tuning might be a little disappointed

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.120
Another thing that bugged us at first

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.400
is that there are just 3 buttons, all without any labels

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.880
on the PolyTune Clip, so it's true that as a result,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.660
we were a bit lost at first,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.080
and had to experiment a while to get used to each button's function

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.280
And there's still the same issue,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.920
which certainly doesn't concern everyone,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.900
but was also present in the original Polytune,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.060
where, if you're playing in Open Tuning,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.600
you won't be able to take advantage of the polyphonic mode

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.700
and you'll instead have to tune string-by-string, so there you have it.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.620
Now we're gonna try it on a guitar.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.400
So here it is, clipped on the headstock of our acoustic guitar

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.900
So the cool thing about the PolyTune Clip is that

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.200
it automatically detects if we're playing a single string, as such

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.220
(as you can see, the string is just a tad sharp)

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.520
or if we're playing all guitar strings with one stroke

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.720
and here, the clip switches to polyphonic mode

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:31.100
Thus, here we see that the A and B strings are slightly out of tune

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.580
And if we once again play a single string

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.080
the tuner switches back into monophonic mode

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.880
(it's slightly sharp here)

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.040
So there you have it, the guitar is in tune

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.040
I hope you enjoyed the video. 'Till next time.
