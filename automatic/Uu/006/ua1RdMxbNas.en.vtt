 custom 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 from china 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.759
 we have already seen a lot of ported games 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.829
 never grinev on a pis 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.380
 and now found a new life on 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.989
 mobile devices and basically this 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.329
 cool but when they release another 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.320
 part of the most famous console series not 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.950
 on console 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.660
 she mobile this cause a bunch of questions 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.420
 perplexities and critics are we now 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 talking about the gsx-r hall which the company 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.250
 square enix decided to run 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.920
 exclusive on iphone and android and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.380
 On the version of Andrew we are today and see 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.180
 with you the channel is alive and see the review of the game 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.180
 deus ex in full moon 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.540
 the game is not a sequel 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.300
 acclaimed human revolution on consoles 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.850
 as a prequel about the events before 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.370
 The plot in the revolution awaits us somewhat 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.060
 hours of adventure in virtual Moscow and 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.580
 Panama sample of 2027 in the best 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.530
 cyberpunk tradition what up to more 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.870
 exact time span then us 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.950
 will throw a few months before the beginning 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.320
 human revolution 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.690
 protagonist mercenary band saxon 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.510
 escaping from former employers from 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.729
 private military organization while he 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.220
 together with a fluent intelligence agent 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.050
 she Kelso hides in Latin America in 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.550
 region run out of medication 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.110
 helping the body owner 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.869
 modifications are best tolerated 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.390
 implants for both heroes begin 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.030
 terrible pain and ben have to get out 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.580
 to the city for help and it is reasonable that this 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.690
 the walk tightens the heroes of the whole world 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.550
 conspiracy and everything would be nice and interesting if 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.240
 would not substantially castrated 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.520
 storyline 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.280
 slowly and the passage of the game will take you 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.460
 from the power of 5-6 hours and the pleasure itself 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.060
 It will cost 8 bucks such a game 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.700
 market 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.030
 Is it a little expensive for such a short game? 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.260
 It was not without popular now 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.660
 microtransactions on a pause in the game you 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.060
 find a whole arsenal of all kinds of things 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.370
 from weapons to implants and is it worth 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.590
 say that game currency can be the most 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.959
 dishonestly replenish from the card 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.239
 visa that is, we buy 6 hours 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.400
 passing for 8 dollars and in doing so 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.410
 we have the opportunity to throw in the game and more 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.900
 ten 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.850
 but let's not talk about sad things 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.640
 one moment which will cause criticism 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.190
 Most players control this as 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.260
 not cool but shooter genre remains the most 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.180
 hard to control on the touchpad 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.799
 to be able to normally 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.350
 aim at the enemy will have 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.019
 stop for in motion get in 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.940
 opponent will be oh how difficult though 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.830
 developers and allow you to reassign 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.870
 the location of almost all the buttons and 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.239
 interface elements but very fast 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.160
 it becomes clear that your new 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.840
 convenient control scheme closes 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.610
 vital movement buttons 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.250
 between 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.920
 shelters that can not be reassigned 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.170
 however, I want to pay tribute to the mode 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.330
 stealth control no longer seems so 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.170
 unfriendly and can leisurely 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.780
 take aim 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.960
 change position or even hide from 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.540
 the enemy as to the appearance of the game 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.820
 looks amazingly nice 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.570
 branded yellowish style series 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.430
 deus ex 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.140
 And in general, the atmosphere of cyberpunk 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.570
 transmitted to all 100 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.700
 at times even willing to afford to 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.160
 a minute to move away from passing and just 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.590
 be like to see what's going on 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.230
 locations, where else if not in deus ex 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.989
 admire the environment but not all 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.010
 so simple the game is made on the unity engine 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.709
 and we have a number 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.690
 blemishes such as the bodies of enemies disappear 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.520
 after a few seconds artificial 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.970
 intelligence leaves much to be desired 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.520
 animation of enemies and completely at C grade in 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.290
 you will have a lot of game 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.120
 opportunities for location scattered pile 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.190
 items you can study 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.680
 leaflets and documents that can 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.660
 read the doors that need special 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.920
 way to hack and hacking procedure 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.920
 on done on the top five 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.449
 computers where you can read the correspondence 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.729
 workers and everything would be fine but all this 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.449
 joy in English and if 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.699
 consider that 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.350
 this joy is so much that unwittingly 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.380
 you begin to regret that your English 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.210
 not at least colloquially sorry 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.190
 that the game was not translated into Russian at least 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.090
 in the texts not to mention the replicas and 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.820
 dialogues so what is daeus ex in foul 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.010
 opinion of critics and journalists 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.289
 very divided on the one hand we 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.419
 we have a very high-quality stealth shooter 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.449
 telling us about events before human 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.580
 revolution on the other and the load is very weak 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.370
 for a series with a plot unfinished course 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.199
 engine and mediocre controls te 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.780
 who don't know english or not at all 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.330
 played deus ex absolutely not understand 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.910
 nothing of what is happening here and 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.470
 at best, this game does not belong to 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.139
 independent option ok 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.760
 peculiar dlc released from what 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.550
 there on mobile platforms 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.500
 Well, in general, the game is very good if 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.880
 treat it not as a normal shooter and 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.729
 as stealth action movie 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.090
 then one of the best genres right there 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.620
 add and one of the most expensive 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.750
 recommend to buy for the price 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.020
 only those who know English and 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.570
 not very far from the whole series of games and on 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.450
 This all with you was kinat and channel filed 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.450
