00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.469
 and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.870
 and 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.129
 and 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.449
 ah 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.449
 and 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.880
 Let's see what we are going to do 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.550
 battery, we'll explain how to download 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.510
 a battery in 2004 sportster models 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.329
 until 2013 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.980
 ok we're going to teach you good I'm going to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.980
 teach my first and then 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.350
 how to remove the battery in a poster 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.350
 since 2004 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.010
 2013 is very good 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.100
 to see teacher to start to start 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.400
 you have to remove the lid I do not feel at 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.400
 little cat 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.000
 let's remove the lid 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.570
 I hope here and here 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.850
 and then from here 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.750
 unhooking of traces 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.060
 that is all 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.770
 well now we need a dice three 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.570
 eighth with its extension and a mat for 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.420
 remove him 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.640
 in the belt the screw of the belt that 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.640
 he has the one who holds the battery here 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.470
 it's down here 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.600
 now well once we have 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.990
 released in 5 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.780
 It is very important to remove the maxi fuse 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.200
 is this 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.470
 this is to avoid some short some 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.130
 we can do some damage some piece 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.180
 electrical and this is removed 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.060
 one 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.800
 saleh 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.910
 and this 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.620
 we have to take it out and leave it in one place 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.060
 safe 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.560
 ok now what follows is 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.560
 with a 10 mm wrench 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.469
 we remove the positive pole of the battery 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.980
 what 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.560
 let's discount the negative post this 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.160
 it's a little harder because there's a 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.160
 little hidden 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.989
 because it is advisable to install a 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.989
 battery charger 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.480
 in case you do not use much 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.180
 motorcycle the charger keeps the battery in 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.100
 good condition without overloading the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.910
 it will lower the battery completely this 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.910
 could damage the 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.890
 we take out the bar 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.690
 ok good then to connect 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:09.060
 what is a charger 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.060
 of the battery 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.359
 of the house 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:19.840
 bring a camp kit this is a part 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:22.210
 was connected to the virtual battery 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.410
 It is connected with another extension going 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.950
 to give 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.950
 of the house 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.969
 the black this is easy because it is black and 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.800
 Red 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:35.729
 the black 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.729
 connects 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.970
 with the battery 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.350
 we would have connected on a motorcycle more 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.350
 easy 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.409
 because you just remove the seat and it's 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.589
 easier than talavera 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:21.099
 we apply that is not swept screws 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.099
 and tight 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.869
 we are very strong 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.820
 the truth 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.790
 now we put the site of the battery 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.199
 and we can connect 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.860
 the three wires is the possible 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.860
 principal 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.080
 the one of the march 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.639
 and our battery and tend our 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.639
 connection for rusty charger 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.969
 it's important success before so that already 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.629
 be all 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.629
 if it is easier 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:30.639
 We cut in the positive post 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.449
 we go 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.449
 we connect the possible principal 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.480
 all this is already 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.110
 we have our battery understand 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.110
 installed 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.130
 and now that it is installed 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.680
 but we put to load 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.010
 has a 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:12.110
 in protection 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.930
 it connects there is no problem because 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:18.600
 everything only takes a meaning in the 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:22.080
 cables and then plug it 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.610
 so this part stays on the motorcycle 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.610
 there no longer 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:32.019
 the guards for
