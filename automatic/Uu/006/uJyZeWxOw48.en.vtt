00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
I'm sure everybody wants to know how to

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:44.370 
I'm sure everybody wants to know how to
develop<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.319> enhance<00:00:04.410> their<00:00:04.890> speed

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.799 

basically<00:00:45.380> what<00:00:45.530> I<00:00:45.559> like<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.829> do<00:00:45.980> is<00:00:46.010> practice

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
basically what I like to do is practice

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.330 
basically what I like to do is practice
basic<00:00:47.809> rudiments<00:00:48.170> such<00:00:48.530> as<00:00:48.739> singles<00:00:49.129> doubles

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
basic rudiments such as singles doubles

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.720 
basic rudiments such as singles doubles
and<00:00:49.640> paradiddles<00:00:50.450> for<00:00:51.110> long<00:00:51.260> periods<00:00:51.290> of<00:00:51.620> time

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
and paradiddles for long periods of time

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.130 
and paradiddles for long periods of time
repetitiously<00:00:52.730> not<00:00:53.270> only<00:00:53.510> on<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.690> drums<00:00:53.930> but

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
repetitiously not only on the drums but

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.990 
repetitiously not only on the drums but
also<00:00:54.379> on<00:00:54.800> surfaces<00:00:55.370> with<00:00:55.550> little<00:00:55.820> or<00:00:55.940> no

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
also on surfaces with little or no

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.869 
also on surfaces with little or no
rebound<00:00:56.570> such<00:00:57.350> as<00:00:57.470> pillows<00:00:57.800> also<00:00:58.489> I<00:00:58.519> like<00:00:58.820> to

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
rebound such as pillows also I like to

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.000 
rebound such as pillows also I like to
practice<00:00:59.269> with<00:00:59.570> sticks<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.710> little

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
practice with sticks that a little

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.410 
practice with sticks that a little
heavier<00:01:01.340> than<00:01:01.460> what<00:01:01.610> I<00:01:01.640> usually<00:01:01.699> play<00:01:02.180> with

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
heavier than what I usually play with

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.570 
heavier than what I usually play with
such<00:01:03.050> as<00:01:03.170> marching<00:01:03.530> band<00:01:03.710> stakes<00:01:04.009> this<00:01:04.400> will

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
such as marching band stakes this will

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.130 
such as marching band stakes this will
help<00:01:04.670> build<00:01:04.879> up<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.390> strength<00:01:05.449> within<00:01:05.869> your

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
help build up the strength within your

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.170 
help build up the strength within your
wrists<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.650> arms<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.460> also<00:01:07.820> I<00:01:07.940> like<00:01:08.060> to

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
wrists and arms and also I like to

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.150 
wrists and arms and also I like to
stretch<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.990> kind<00:01:09.560> of<00:01:09.590> helps<00:01:09.860> out<00:01:09.950> with<00:01:10.070> the

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
stretch to it kind of helps out with the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.010 
stretch to it kind of helps out with the
flexibility<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:11.030> all<00:01:11.240> plays<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.509> role<00:01:11.810> and

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
flexibility it all plays a role and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.050 
flexibility it all plays a role and
developing<00:01:12.800> your<00:01:12.920> speed<00:01:13.190> let's<00:01:13.640> talk<00:01:13.759> about<00:01:13.940> a

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
developing your speed let's talk about a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.480 
developing your speed let's talk about a
technique<00:01:14.539> that<00:01:14.780> also<00:01:15.560> applies<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.009> building

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
technique that also applies to building

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.219 
technique that also applies to building
speed<00:01:16.729> call<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.330> molar<00:01:17.509> technique<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.170> learned

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
speed call the molar technique I learned

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.990 
speed call the molar technique I learned
this<00:01:18.619> technique<00:01:18.800> from<00:01:19.369> a<00:01:19.520> drummer<00:01:19.789> by<00:01:19.940> the

going to help you with building speed
basically<00:01:35.330> it's<00:01:35.840> fairly<00:01:36.050> simple<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.710> molar

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
basically it's fairly simple the molar

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.499 
basically it's fairly simple the molar
technique<00:01:37.310> consists<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.729> three<00:01:37.970> strokes<00:01:38.210> the

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
technique consists of three strokes the

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.529 
technique consists of three strokes the
first<00:01:39.020> stroke<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:40.030> called<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.179> whipping

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
first stroke is called the whipping

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.850 
first stroke is called the whipping
stroke<00:01:41.750> that's<00:01:41.960> why<00:01:42.050> i<00:01:42.110> like<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.320> call<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:42.530> it's

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
stroke that's why i like to call it it's

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.440 
stroke that's why i like to call it it's
a<00:01:42.950> Down<00:01:43.160> stroke<00:01:43.340> basically<00:01:44.000> what<00:01:44.119> you<00:01:44.210> want<00:01:44.360> to

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
a Down stroke basically what you want to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.870 
a Down stroke basically what you want to
try<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.600> do<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:45.020> develop<00:01:45.409> a<00:01:45.740> waving<00:01:46.430> motion<00:01:46.580> in

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
try to do is develop a waving motion in

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.810 
try to do is develop a waving motion in
your<00:01:47.000> hand<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.560> one<00:01:48.560> single<00:01:48.799> motion<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.700> is

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
your hand and one single motion this is

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.090 
your hand and one single motion this is
going<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.090> allow<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.600> be<00:01:51.229> free<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.740> also

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
going to allow you to be free and also

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.010 
going to allow you to be free and also
play<00:01:52.250> with<00:01:52.280> more<00:01:52.610> power<00:01:52.850> without<00:01:53.270> using<00:01:53.720> as

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
play with more power without using as

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.960 
play with more power without using as
much<00:01:54.470> energy<00:02:00.460> make<00:02:01.460> sure<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.729> get<00:02:01.820> this

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
much energy make sure you get this

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.160 
much energy make sure you get this
whipping<00:02:02.210> action<00:02:02.479> it's<00:02:02.810> very<00:02:02.960> important<00:02:05.170> ok

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
whipping action it's very important ok

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.410 
whipping action it's very important ok
the<00:02:06.320> second<00:02:06.680> stroke<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.369> tap<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:14.209> third

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
the second stroke is a tap and the third

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.350 
the second stroke is a tap and the third
stroke<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.440> upstroke<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.940> usually

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
stroke is the upstroke is usually

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750 
stroke is the upstroke is usually
generated<00:02:17.780> from<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.049> elbow<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.670> once<00:02:19.670> you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
generated from the elbow and once you

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.130 
generated from the elbow and once you
put<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:19.910> together<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.510> comes<00:02:20.810> out<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.110> be

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
put it together it comes out to be

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.289 
put it together it comes out to be
tripled<00:02:21.530> its<00:02:21.650> pretty<00:02:21.860> much<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.130> each<00:02:22.280> hand<00:02:22.549> so

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
tripled its pretty much on each hand so

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:41.310 
tripled its pretty much on each hand so
I'm<00:02:23.360> going<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.510> demonstrate<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:24.019> for<00:02:24.079> you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:56.369 

saying<00:02:42.320> goes<00:02:42.470> with<00:02:42.650> other<00:02:42.769> hand

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.920 

put<00:02:57.379> them<00:02:57.470> together<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:58.209> get<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.450> pretty<00:02:59.660> fast

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
put them together you get a pretty fast

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:32.780 
put them together you get a pretty fast
single<00:03:00.230> stroke<00:03:00.440> roll

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.450 

the<00:03:33.790> molar<00:03:34.000> technique
