well<00:00:00.450> we've<00:00:00.599> talked<00:00:00.810> about<00:00:00.930> waves<00:00:01.890> we've

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
well we've talked about waves we've

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.770 
well we've talked about waves we've
talked<00:00:02.370> about<00:00:02.490> wavelengths<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.300> period<00:00:03.659> and

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
talked about wavelengths and period and

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.110 
talked about wavelengths and period and
frequency<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.470> speed<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.069> wave<00:00:05.220> we

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
frequency and the speed of the wave we

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.540 
frequency and the speed of the wave we
talked<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.420> little<00:00:06.509> bit<00:00:06.690> about<00:00:06.810> sound<00:00:07.200> waves

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
talked a little bit about sound waves

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.890 
talked a little bit about sound waves
but<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.670> should<00:00:08.849> spend<00:00:09.150> at<00:00:09.330> least<00:00:09.450> some<00:00:09.719> time

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
but we should spend at least some time

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.709 
but we should spend at least some time
just<00:00:10.320> discussing<00:00:11.150> electromagnetic<00:00:12.150> waves<00:00:12.360> or

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
just discussing electromagnetic waves or

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.169 
just discussing electromagnetic waves or
as<00:00:13.259> physicists<00:00:13.799> call<00:00:13.980> them<00:00:14.099> light<00:00:14.280> waves<00:00:14.519> most

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
as physicists call them light waves most

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.640 
as physicists call them light waves most
people<00:00:15.540> don't<00:00:15.719> call<00:00:15.900> them<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.080> they<00:00:16.350> think

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
people don't call them that they think

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.960 
people don't call them that they think
they're<00:00:16.800> there's<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.310> stuff<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.760> see

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
they're there's the stuff you can see

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.150 
they're there's the stuff you can see
and<00:00:18.240> then<00:00:18.900> there<00:00:19.590> are<00:00:19.650> these<00:00:19.800> other<00:00:20.010> things

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and then there are these other things

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.910 
and then there are these other things
called<00:00:20.490> radio<00:00:20.910> waves<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.510> x-rays<00:00:21.930> but

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
called radio waves and x-rays but

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.439 
called radio waves and x-rays but
they're<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.580> same<00:00:23.609> thing<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.390> only

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
they're all the same thing the only

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.130 
they're all the same thing the only
difference<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.699> that<00:00:26.840> they<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:27.960> different

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
difference is that they have different

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.050 
difference is that they have different
wavelengths<00:00:28.680> they're<00:00:29.279> all<00:00:29.429> what's<00:00:29.820> called

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
wavelengths they're all what's called

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.479 
wavelengths they're all what's called

in this electron this electron could

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.090 
in this electron this electron could
feel<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.090> guy<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.469> electron<00:00:46.890> moved

feel this guy and if this electron moved
up<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:48.270> would<00:00:48.480> feel<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.840> change<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
up this would feel that change so if I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.410 
up this would feel that change so if I
took<00:00:50.010> an<00:00:50.219> electron<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.610> moved<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.329> down

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
took an electron I moved it up and down

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.750 
took an electron I moved it up and down
this<00:00:52.170> would<00:00:52.379> feel<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.829> fluctuating<00:00:53.489> change

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this would feel that fluctuating change

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.389 
this would feel that fluctuating change
it's<00:00:54.210> an<00:00:54.300> electromagnetic<00:00:54.840> wave<00:00:55.309> faster<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it's an electromagnetic wave faster the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.180 
it's an electromagnetic wave faster the
charges<00:00:56.820> move<00:00:57.590> this<00:00:58.590> shorter<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> wavelength

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
charges move this shorter the wavelength

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.420 
charges move this shorter the wavelength
the<00:00:59.640> higher<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.239> frequency<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> wave<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
the higher the frequency of the wave and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.100 
the higher the frequency of the wave and
Tana's<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.850> long<00:01:03.270> conductors<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.019> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
Tana's are just long conductors so you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
Tana's are just long conductors so you
can<00:01:04.260> run<00:01:04.500> electrons<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> down<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.180> create

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
can run electrons up and down and create

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.899 
can run electrons up and down and create
waves<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.470> send<00:01:07.830> them<00:01:07.950> out<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:10.610> if<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.700> had<00:01:11.729> a

wave if I if I had an antenna and I
started<00:01:17.790> jiggling<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.500> electrons<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.740> certain

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
started jiggling the electrons a certain

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310 
started jiggling the electrons a certain
way<00:01:20.280> then<00:01:20.970> they'd<00:01:21.390> send<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> way<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
way then they'd send out a way but it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.399 
way then they'd send out a way but it
would<00:01:22.380> look<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:24.170> like<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.500> except<00:01:27.409> light

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
would look just like that except light

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.130 
would look just like that except light
travels<00:01:29.009> much<00:01:29.340> faster<00:01:29.820> than<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.960> can

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
travels much faster than you and I can

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.870

imagine<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:32.070> would<00:01:32.340> take<00:01:32.520> light<00:01:34.880> 186,000

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
miles a second it takes light about

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.270

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
and it's about six point six to six

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.350 
and it's about six point six to six
times<00:06:29.210> ten<00:06:29.540> to<00:06:29.720> minus<00:06:29.840> 34<00:06:31.240> joules<00:06:32.240> times

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
times ten to minus 34 joules times

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.430 
times ten to minus 34 joules times
seconds<00:06:34.360> so<00:06:35.360> let's<00:06:35.389> do<00:06:35.630> an<00:06:35.690> example<00:06:35.810> with<00:06:36.230> all

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
seconds so let's do an example with all

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.710 
seconds so let's do an example with all
this<00:06:36.590> in<00:06:36.800> here<00:06:38.440> let's<00:06:39.440> figure<00:06:39.650> out<00:06:40.720> let's

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
this in here let's figure out let's

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.830 
this in here let's figure out let's
figure<00:06:41.900> out<00:06:41.990> the<00:06:42.169> number<00:06:42.410> of<00:06:42.530> photons<00:06:43.840> leaving

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
figure out the number of photons leaving

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.360 
figure out the number of photons leaving
a<00:06:44.990> 100<00:06:45.950> watt<00:06:46.070> bulb<00:06:46.280> every<00:06:46.639> second<00:06:47.030> those
