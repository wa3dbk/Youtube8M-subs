00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.930 
this is just a demonstration I mean I
guess<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:15.970> could<00:02:16.120> use<00:02:16.420> these<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:18.280> guess<00:02:18.820> you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
guess you could use these I guess you

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.370 
guess you could use these I guess you
could<00:02:19.090> do<00:02:19.240> these<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.660> suggest<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.110> don't

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
could do these but I suggest you don't

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.710 
could do these but I suggest you don't
but<00:02:20.590> something<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:22.500> okay

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
but something like this okay

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.610 
but something like this okay
something<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:25.870> would<00:02:26.140> be<00:02:26.170> really<00:02:26.440> good

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
something like that would be really good

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.610 
something like that would be really good
and<00:02:27.459> I'll<00:02:28.300> use<00:02:28.360> alcohol<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:30.959> cotton<00:02:31.959> balls<00:02:32.260> &amp;

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
and I'll use alcohol and cotton balls &amp;

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.699 
and I'll use alcohol and cotton balls &amp;
tissue<00:02:32.650> or<00:02:33.040> whatever<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.459> gonna<00:02:33.610> use<00:02:34.709> make

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
tissue or whatever you gonna use make

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.360

sure your stuff is really sterilized so

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.510 
sure your stuff is really sterilized so
you<00:02:40.060> would<00:02:40.209> take<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.930> alcohol<00:02:41.380> without<00:02:41.709> in

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
you would take the alcohol without in

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.260 
you would take the alcohol without in

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380
