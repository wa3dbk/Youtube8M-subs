like<00:03:00.750> an<00:03:00.959> extra<00:03:01.200> step<00:03:01.709> involved<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.459> get

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
like an extra step involved to get

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.330 
like an extra step involved to get
everywhere<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.560> think<00:03:04.560> Windows<00:03:04.800> 8<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.040> pretty

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
everywhere I think Windows 8 is pretty

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.430 
everywhere I think Windows 8 is pretty
and<00:03:05.489> stuff<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.000> does<00:03:06.209> startup<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.780> lot<00:03:06.900> faster

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
and stuff and does startup a lot faster

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.229

and<00:03:07.470> seems<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.129> run<00:03:08.280> faster<00:03:09.739> but<00:03:10.819> there<00:03:11.819> are<00:03:11.940> it

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.520 
and seems to run faster but there are it
just<00:03:12.420> feels<00:03:12.750> weird<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:13.140> guess<00:03:13.170> it's<00:03:13.440> because

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
