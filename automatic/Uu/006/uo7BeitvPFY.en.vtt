going to remove the TCP censor undo this

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.770 
going to remove the TCP censor undo this
sensor<00:00:40.989> over<00:00:41.230> here<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:43.270> this<00:00:43.390> cover<00:00:43.660> is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
sensor over here and then this cover is

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.569 
sensor over here and then this cover is
going<00:00:43.899> to<00:00:43.960> come<00:00:44.170> off<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.710> then<00:00:45.340> we're<00:00:45.460> going

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
to get inside to remove the velocity

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.229 
to get inside to remove the velocity
stacks<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.550> I'll<00:00:48.670> show<00:00:48.820> you<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:48.940> when<00:00:49.210> we

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
stacks and I'll show you that when we

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.130 
stacks and I'll show you that when we
get<00:00:49.449> there<00:00:49.629> okay

get there okay

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.770 
get there okay
on<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.500> TCP<00:00:51.010> sensor<00:00:51.429> there's<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.510> couple<00:00:52.690> ways

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
on the TCP sensor there's a couple ways

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.119 
on the TCP sensor there's a couple ways
you<00:00:52.960> could<00:00:53.140> do<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:53.289> you<00:00:53.530> can<00:00:53.649> just<00:00:53.829> take<00:00:54.010> the

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
you could do it you can just take the

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.639 
you could do it you can just take the
bolts<00:00:54.429> out<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.809> you<00:00:55.989> want<00:00:56.199> to<00:00:56.289> remove<00:00:56.500> the

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
bolts out if you want to remove the

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.209 
bolts out if you want to remove the
whole<00:00:56.829> thing<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:58.239> in<00:00:58.359> actuality<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.920> can<00:01:00.100> do

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
whole thing but in actuality what can do

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.479 
whole thing but in actuality what can do
is<00:01:00.399> just<00:01:00.640> slide<00:01:01.600> this<00:01:01.780> back<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.440> just<00:01:03.249> pop

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
is just slide this back and just pop

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.990 
is just slide this back and just pop
this<00:01:03.699> off<00:01:04.410> so<00:01:05.410> that<00:01:05.440> separates<00:01:06.040> that<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.490> then

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
this off so that separates that and then

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.750 
this off so that separates that and then
right<00:01:07.750> back<00:01:07.990> here<00:01:09.630> behind<00:01:10.630> this<00:01:11.020> sensor<00:01:11.760> you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
right back here behind this sensor you

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.760 
right back here behind this sensor you
just<00:01:12.909> press<00:01:13.150> that<00:01:13.180> in<00:01:13.540> really<00:01:13.930> hard<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.409> push

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
just press that in really hard and push

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.870 
just press that in really hard and push
down<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:17.560> it'll<00:01:17.800> just<00:01:18.070> pop<00:01:18.250> right<00:01:18.310> off

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.580 

okay<00:01:21.880> so<00:01:21.939> now<00:01:22.210> that's<00:01:22.450> disconnected<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.350> then

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
okay so now that's disconnected and then

that and we have the intercooler line

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.310 
that and we have the intercooler line
off<00:03:40.239> that<00:03:40.540> goes<00:03:40.690> from<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.049> intercooler

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
off that goes from the intercooler

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.699 
off that goes from the intercooler
itself<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.670> turbo<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.560> next<00:03:44.560> thing

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
the white platform installed and what it

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.150 
the white platform installed and what it
does<00:05:16.720> is<00:05:16.960> these<00:05:17.110> bolts<00:05:17.500> go<00:05:17.650> down<00:05:17.830> through<00:05:18.070> the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
does is these bolts go down through the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.280 
does is these bolts go down through the
existing<00:05:18.610> holes<00:05:18.820> and<00:05:19.150> they<00:05:19.630> just<00:05:19.840> thread<00:05:20.110> into

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
existing holes and they just thread into

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.810 
existing holes and they just thread into
the<00:05:20.910> platform<00:05:21.910> below<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:23.040> you<00:05:24.040> just<00:05:24.250> crank

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
the platform below and you just crank

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.310 
the platform below and you just crank
them<00:05:24.940> up<00:05:25.060> until<00:05:25.240> they're<00:05:25.510> right<00:05:25.900> at<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.110> top

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
them up until they're right at the top

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.460 
them up until they're right at the top
and<00:05:26.530> then<00:05:27.490> we<00:05:27.970> can<00:05:28.150> go<00:05:28.270> ahead<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:28.810> drop<00:05:29.230> the

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
and then we can go ahead and drop the

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.650 
and then we can go ahead and drop the
new<00:05:30.190> intercooler<00:05:30.520> right<00:05:30.790> on<00:05:30.940> top<00:05:31.150> okay<00:05:31.450> I<00:05:31.480> went

new intercooler right on top okay I went
ahead<00:05:31.810> and<00:05:31.990> installed<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.770> pipe<00:05:33.670> while<00:05:33.850> I<00:05:33.910> was

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
ahead and installed the pipe while I was

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.340 
ahead and installed the pipe while I was
out<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:34.600> put<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.310> put<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.370> clamp<00:05:36.640> on<00:05:36.880> and

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
then I'm gonna go ahead and set this in

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.140 
then I'm gonna go ahead and set this in
much<00:05:40.180> easier<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.570> do<00:05:40.720> it<00:05:40.870> out<00:05:41.050> versus<00:05:42.150> when

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
much easier to do it out versus when

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.510 
much easier to do it out versus when
it's<00:05:43.180> already<00:05:43.660> a<00:05:43.750> we're<00:05:43.930> sitting<00:05:44.260> inside<00:05:44.520> and

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
it's already a we're sitting inside and

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.360 
it's already a we're sitting inside and
we're<00:05:45.730> gonna<00:05:45.790> go<00:05:46.000> ahead<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.240> connect<00:05:47.370> this

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
we're gonna go ahead and connect this

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.800 
we're gonna go ahead and connect this
hose<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.960> there<00:05:50.170> and<00:05:50.820> that<00:05:51.820> hose<00:05:52.150> right<00:05:52.450> on<00:05:52.600> to

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
hose to there and that hose right on to

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.480 
hose to there and that hose right on to
there<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.820> then<00:05:54.820> we<00:05:55.270> can<00:05:55.300> go<00:05:55.630> ahead<00:05:55.750> and

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
there and then we can go ahead and

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.870 
there and then we can go ahead and
attach<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.700> back<00:05:57.880> to<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.360> turbo<00:05:59.100> and<00:06:00.100> then

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
attach it back to the turbo and then

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.460 
attach it back to the turbo and then
we'll<00:06:01.000> be<00:06:01.120> ready<00:06:01.330> to<00:06:01.390> install<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.320> air<00:06:02.440> box

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
we'll be ready to install the air box

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.700 
we'll be ready to install the air box
okay<00:06:03.160> we<00:06:03.610> have<00:06:03.790> this<00:06:03.970> baby<00:06:04.210> installed<00:06:04.750> we're

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
okay we have this baby installed we're

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.340 
okay we have this baby installed we're
attached<00:06:06.010> to<00:06:06.160> the<00:06:06.250> turbo<00:06:07.230> we're<00:06:08.230> all

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
attached to the turbo we're all

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.170 
attached to the turbo we're all
connected<00:06:08.950> so<00:06:09.370> this<00:06:09.520> is<00:06:09.700> what<00:06:09.850> it<00:06:09.970> should<00:06:10.120> look

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
connected so this is what it should look

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.770 
connected so this is what it should look
like<00:06:10.330> at<00:06:10.630> this<00:06:10.750> stage<00:06:11.760> okay<00:06:12.760> what<00:06:13.180> I<00:06:13.210> had<00:06:13.480> to<00:06:13.630> do

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
like at this stage okay what I had to do

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.040 
like at this stage okay what I had to do
was<00:06:13.930> this<00:06:14.890> just<00:06:15.760> slide<00:06:16.000> this<00:06:16.180> off<00:06:16.450> of<00:06:16.660> this

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
was this just slide this off of this

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.860 
was this just slide this off of this
bracket<00:06:17.560> right<00:06:17.590> here<00:06:18.240> so<00:06:19.240> that<00:06:19.270> this<00:06:19.510> can<00:06:19.690> move

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
bracket right here so that this can move

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.680 
bracket right here so that this can move
forward<00:06:20.290> enough<00:06:21.030> so<00:06:22.030> we'll<00:06:22.150> be<00:06:22.270> able<00:06:22.300> to<00:06:22.450> test

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
forward enough so we'll be able to test

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.830 
forward enough so we'll be able to test
the<00:06:22.960> air<00:06:23.650> box<00:06:23.890> above<00:06:24.220> okay<00:06:25.180> so<00:06:25.240> now<00:06:25.510> at<00:06:25.690> this

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
the air box above okay so now at this
