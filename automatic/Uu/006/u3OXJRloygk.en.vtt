is<00:00:03.340> about<00:00:03.610> what<00:00:03.760> are<00:00:03.820> we<00:00:03.880> doing<00:00:04.090> formats<00:00:04.390> today

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
is about what are we doing formats today

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.130 
is about what are we doing formats today
timetable<00:00:06.970> so<00:00:07.120> about<00:00:07.300> two<00:00:07.510> digits<00:00:07.840> by<00:00:07.960> one

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.140 
timetable so about two digits by one

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:16.950 
timetable so about two digits by one
digit<00:00:08.290> could<00:00:08.620> you<00:00:08.710> have<00:00:08.890> a<00:00:08.920> go<00:00:13.470> oh<00:00:15.689> great<00:00:16.689> work

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
digit could you have a go oh great work

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.409 
digit could you have a go oh great work
so<00:00:17.230> you<00:00:17.320> can<00:00:17.470> actually<00:00:17.590> do<00:00:17.920> two<00:00:18.220> digits<00:00:19.029> by<00:00:19.179> one

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
so you can actually do two digits by one

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:26.370 
so you can actually do two digits by one
digit<00:00:19.630> just<00:00:20.079> hang<00:00:20.230> on<00:00:20.320> a<00:00:20.349> sec<00:00:20.560> Izzie<00:00:25.380> Isabelle

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
digit just hang on a sec Izzie Isabelle

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.099 
digit just hang on a sec Izzie Isabelle
can<00:00:26.650> do<00:00:26.949> two<00:00:27.669> digits<00:00:28.150> by<00:00:28.419> one<00:00:28.779> digit

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
can do two digits by one digit

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:39.770 
can do two digits by one digit
multiplication

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.010 

so<00:00:40.650> is<00:00:40.830> there<00:00:41.280> another<00:00:41.490> strategy<00:00:42.150> can<00:00:42.930> you

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
so is there another strategy can you

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.380 
so is there another strategy can you
look<00:00:43.110> over<00:00:43.380> there<00:00:43.500> Rach<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> screen<00:00:44.390> as

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
look over there Rach on the screen as

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.130 
look over there Rach on the screen as
you<00:00:45.810> can<00:00:45.960> see<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.500> I've<00:00:46.830> been<00:00:47.100> working<00:00:47.640> with

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
you can see there I've been working with

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.130 
you can see there I've been working with
my<00:00:49.140> Apple<00:00:49.830> watch<00:00:49.880> to<00:00:50.880> record<00:00:51.390> data<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.989> my

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
my Apple watch to record data of my

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.870 
my Apple watch to record data of my
students<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.739> regular<00:00:53.580> learning

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
students just regular learning

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.630 
students just regular learning
interactions<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.949> by<00:00:56.129> using<00:00:56.160> my

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
interactions and you can see by using my

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.090 
interactions and you can see by using my
watch<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> dictation<00:00:58.140> function

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
watch I can use the dictation function

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.170 
watch I can use the dictation function
to<00:00:59.610> actually<00:01:00.559> record<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:02.129> authentic<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
to actually record really authentic and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.260 
to actually record really authentic and
valuable<00:01:03.809> data<00:01:04.050> straight<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.220> my<00:01:05.400> Google

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
valuable data straight to my Google

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.870 
valuable data straight to my Google
sheet<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.440> share<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.770> others<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.610> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
sheet that I can share with others and I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
sheet that I can share with others and I
don't<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> type<00:01:09.690> or<00:01:09.960> write<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> thing<00:01:10.560> I've

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
don't have to type or write a thing I've

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.270 
don't have to type or write a thing I've
actually<00:01:11.040> pressed<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:12.149> watch<00:01:12.390> twice<00:01:13.280> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
actually pressed my my watch twice and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.520 
actually pressed my my watch twice and
I'm<00:01:14.369> collecting<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.570> great<00:01:15.869> data<00:01:16.229> on

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I'm collecting this really great data on

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.160 
I'm collecting this really great data on
my<00:01:16.890> students<00:01:17.399> which<00:01:17.550> is<00:01:17.700> fantastic<00:01:18.050> let's<00:01:19.050> go

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
my students which is fantastic let's go

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.690 
my students which is fantastic let's go
over<00:01:19.410> and<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.649> little<00:01:19.800> bit<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.490> over

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
over and do a little bit more so over

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.650 
over and do a little bit more so over
here<00:01:20.850> right<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:22.850> you've<00:01:23.850> done<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.300> is<00:01:24.539> there

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
here right so you've done that is there

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.240 
here right so you've done that is there
another<00:01:24.899> strategy<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.920> could<00:01:26.100> actually

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
another strategy that we could actually

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:40.359 
another strategy that we could actually
use<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.149> regard<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.810> solving<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.500> problem

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.210 

okay<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:43.050> I<00:01:43.080> would<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.649> my<00:01:43.799> students

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
okay so what I would do with my students

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.940 
okay so what I would do with my students
is<00:01:44.400> I'd<00:01:44.610> use<00:01:44.820> my<00:01:44.850> watch<00:01:45.229> I'd<00:01:46.640> record<00:01:48.950> Isabelle

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
is I'd use my watch I'd record Isabelle

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
is I'd use my watch I'd record Isabelle
can<00:01:50.220> use<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> different<00:01:51.119> strategy<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.960> solving

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
can use a different strategy for solving

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.170 
can use a different strategy for solving
that<00:01:52.650> same<00:01:53.040> maths<00:01:53.580> problem<00:01:57.170> press<00:01:58.170> done<00:01:58.470> and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
that same maths problem press done and

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.609 
that same maths problem press done and
what<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.330> doing<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.110> sending<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
what it's doing is it's sending it

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.300 
what it's doing is it's sending it
straight<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.159> my<00:02:02.310> Google<00:02:02.759> sheet<00:02:04.189> just<00:02:05.189> a
