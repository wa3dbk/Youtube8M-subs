00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello all yourself hunter and in this video 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.250
 sea ​​is already about descending on a hammer as 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.200
 funnels 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.570
 is built in brief this mechanism 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.280
 necessary for auto feed 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.429
 items other mechanisms 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.350
 or my current device is pretty 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.720
 just for this we need 5 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.550
 iron ingots chest and fireplace 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.109
 gear 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.970
 after you have installed crafted 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.340
 discharge tray it looks like this 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.109
 the way the drain tray has its 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.579
 internal interface so that he has 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.399
 get to right click 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.500
 the button here has four cells in these 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.870
 cells you can put any item 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.840
 and this item as liberation 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.670
 places mechanism which are by 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.660
 descending with a hammer will be automatically in 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.300
 him then for example if you fold 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.250
 iron ore lies at the bottom 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.930
 electric furnace which this iron ore 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.000
 can melt something as 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.309
 freeing the place of the iron race 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.059
 will automatically feed here as 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.949
 we see here also if their release 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.460
 mulattos are others for example 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.760
 natures such as gold or copper 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.760
 ore 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.600
 it will first be completely recycled 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.369
 iron ore 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 that is a lord who is in 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.890
 electric furnaces only then when the whole 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.750
 iron kind will be recycled and tray with 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.020
 empty will start feeding there in gold 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.020
 ore 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.909
 also the descent and draining trays can 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.400
 make a small turret like that and all 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.290
 Items from the top tray again I will 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.210
 first fed to the bottom and already only 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.869
 from it fed into a wonderful oven 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.090
 more precisely in electro food also to the trigger 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.250
 the tray can connect pipes from all 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 parties except not for that is if you 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.670
 want to pipe the subject 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.100
 drain tray and already from it 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.310
 mechanism then you can connect side 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.280
 either on top of the pipe 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.460
 this is done for example 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.250
 items 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.409
 if which you were more precise if 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.130
 items you feed directly through the pipes 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.619
 mechanism bypassing the pharynx 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.480
 when the mechanism accumulates on the tip 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.340
 the maximum number of items that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.590
 can accommodate all the rest 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.550
 items will fall out and they can 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.920
 just the abyss 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.989
 to prevent this from happening 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.349
 launching boats how are these 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.560
 items will be stored here and by 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.950
 as they make room in the mechanism, they 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.510
 will give in here on this all 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.340
 Thank you for your attention put huskies 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.580
 subscribe to my channel and see you soon 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.580
 meeting
