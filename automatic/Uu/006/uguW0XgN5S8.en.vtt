00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
script can adjust that fraction it's

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.920 
script can adjust that fraction it's
basically<00:02:10.450> which<00:02:10.780> way<00:02:11.050> these<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.860> goes<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
basically which way these that goes so

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.650 
basically which way these that goes so
as<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.290> see<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.620> goes<00:02:14.800> up<00:02:15.100> right<00:02:15.400> here
