parentally<00:02:10.020> three<00:02:10.349> two<00:02:10.560> one<00:02:10.800> shot

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
parentally three two one shot

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.210 
parentally three two one shot
I<00:02:11.390> think<00:02:11.990> this<00:02:12.140> particular<00:02:12.410> bill<00:02:12.740> for<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.920> trial

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
I think this particular bill for a trial

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.720 
I think this particular bill for a trial
really<00:02:13.610> brings<00:02:14.120> how<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.870> genset<00:02:15.740> is<00:02:15.950> built<00:02:16.460> to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
really brings how a genset is built to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.210 
really brings how a genset is built to
last<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.360> built<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.140> work<00:02:18.350> in<00:02:18.500> any<00:02:18.650> climate

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
last and built to work in any climate

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.660 
last and built to work in any climate
and<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.670> perform<00:02:20.120> at<00:02:20.740> just<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.890> breakneck<00:02:22.190> speed

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
and to perform at just a breakneck speed

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.940 
and to perform at just a breakneck speed
of<00:02:22.760> what<00:02:22.910> we<00:02:23.000> needed<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.420> do<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:24.110> created

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
of what we needed it to do it created

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.070 
of what we needed it to do it created
the<00:02:25.100> power<00:02:25.310> we<00:02:25.550> needed<00:02:25.910> at<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.360> elevation<00:02:26.780> it

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the power we needed at the elevation it

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.830 
the power we needed at the elevation it
was<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:27.560> order<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.980> supply<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.090> lights<00:02:29.420> for

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
was in order to supply the lights for

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.960 
was in order to supply the lights for
the<00:02:29.900> lanterns<00:02:30.350> which<00:02:30.920> really<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.490> brings<00:02:31.820> it

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
the lanterns which really just brings it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.180 
the lanterns which really just brings it
all<00:02:32.060> together<00:02:32.240> that<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.170> genset<00:02:33.680> truly<00:02:34.040> is

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
all together that the genset truly is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.160 
all together that the genset truly is
built<00:02:34.490> for<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:34.970> we<00:02:35.480> as<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.720> company<00:02:35.990> are

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
built for it and we as a company are

00:02:36.170 --> 00:03:10.990 
built for it and we as a company are
built<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.530> deliver
