actually going to show you is how to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.630 
actually going to show you is how to
make<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.160> cool<00:00:17.430> little<00:00:17.760> nifty<00:00:18.390> trap<00:00:19.490> you<00:00:20.490> can

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
make a cool little nifty trap you can

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.390 
make a cool little nifty trap you can
use<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.119> survival<00:00:21.810> multiplayer<00:00:22.279> joints<00:00:23.279> any

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
use in survival multiplayer joints any

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.660 
use in survival multiplayer joints any
server<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:24.500> well<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> use<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.039> T&amp;T

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
server that well out of the use of T&amp;T

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.960 
server that well out of the use of T&amp;T
which<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.390> actually<00:00:27.599> implicated<00:00:28.470> than<00:00:28.650> that

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
which was actually implicated than that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.790 
which was actually implicated than that
so<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.029> may<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.449> seen<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.990> trap<00:00:31.349> similar<00:00:31.679> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
so you may have seen a trap similar to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.770 
so you may have seen a trap similar to
this<00:00:31.890> before<00:00:32.070> where<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.700> use<00:00:32.910> TNT<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
this before where you just use TNT and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.560 
this before where you just use TNT and
they<00:00:33.989> fall<00:00:34.260> down<00:00:34.590> then<00:00:34.950> blow<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.420> like

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
they fall down then blow up but I like

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.889 
they fall down then blow up but I like
adding<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> dynamite<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.100> log<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.899> as

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
adding the dynamite or the log to it as

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.580 
adding the dynamite or the log to it as
a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.469> added<00:00:41.219> twist<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.410> just<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.559> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
a little added twist I just like it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.490 
a little added twist I just like it
better<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.989> don't<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.320> make<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
better so if you don't have to make the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.790 
better so if you don't have to make the
trap<00:00:46.710> here's<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> video<00:00:48.379> come<00:00:49.379> right<00:00:49.649> up

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
trap here's a video come right up

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.750 
trap here's a video come right up
that'll<00:00:50.070> show<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.460> how<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.610> all<00:00:53.610> right

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
here we are um it'll actually need to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
here we are um it'll actually need to
totally<00:00:57.360> mush<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.899> make<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.230> rapid<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> need

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949

door and two things with T&amp;T but it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.780 
door and two things with T&amp;T but it's
not<00:01:06.150> too<00:01:06.540> hard<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.840> surround<00:01:07.170> Jeff<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.520> anyways

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
not too hard to surround Jeff so anyways

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
not too hard to surround Jeff so anyways
here<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.330> go<00:01:09.450> building<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> door<00:01:10.170> frame<00:01:10.380> i'm

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
here we go building the door frame i'm

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.920 
here we go building the door frame i'm
not<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.890> build<00:01:11.070> an<00:01:11.189> entire<00:01:11.930> little

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
not going to build an entire little

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.340 
not going to build an entire little
house<00:01:13.250> because<00:01:14.250> um<00:01:14.780> dicks<00:01:15.780> alone<00:01:16.049> it's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
house because um dicks alone it's

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.679 
house because um dicks alone it's
basically<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> idea<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.360> build<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.509> house

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
basically the idea is to build a house

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
basically the idea is to build a house
and<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.259> web<00:01:19.560> multiplayer<00:01:20.100> server<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and as web multiplayer server that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.460 
and as web multiplayer server that
people<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:21.330> try<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.630> come<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:21.960> loop<00:01:22.170> stuff

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
people will try and come in loop stuff

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.999 
people will try and come in loop stuff
from<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:23.070> die<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.350> it'll<00:01:25.350> irritate<00:01:25.560> them

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
from will die and it'll irritate them

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.200 
from will die and it'll irritate them
and<00:01:26.869> see<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.170> doing<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> next<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.939> is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
and see what I like doing so next up is

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.969 
and see what I like doing so next up is
basically<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.840> dig<00:01:31.200> down<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.710> me

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
basically to dig down so I can have me

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.320 
basically to dig down so I can have me
at<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.189> house<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.700> set<00:01:36.000> below<00:01:36.390> ground<00:01:36.780> level

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
at your house is set below ground level

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.400 
at your house is set below ground level
that<00:01:38.330> basically<00:01:38.540> makes<00:01:38.870> it<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:39.230> it's

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
that basically makes it so that it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.620 
that basically makes it so that it's
harder<00:01:39.680> for<00:01:39.710> people<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.070> see<00:01:40.370> if<00:01:41.120> our<00:01:41.360> pressure

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
harder for people to see if our pressure

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.300 
harder for people to see if our pressure
plates<00:01:41.930> on<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.170> rest<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.560> door<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:46.130> now

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
plates on the rest of the door so now

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.890 
plates on the rest of the door so now
you<00:01:46.370> get<00:01:46.640> down<00:01:46.910> to<00:01:47.870> out<00:01:48.290> from<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.920> door<00:01:49.130> and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
you get down to out from the door and

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.440 
you get down to out from the door and
about<00:01:50.900> five<00:01:51.260> or<00:01:51.560> six<00:01:51.890> down<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:53.000> can<00:01:53.150> take

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
about five or six down and you can take

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.060 
about five or six down and you can take
to<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.660> can<00:01:53.900> take<00:01:54.080> as<00:01:54.200> thick<00:01:54.350> as<00:01:54.440> you<00:01:54.530> want<00:01:54.560> but

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
to you can take as thick as you want but

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.220 
to you can take as thick as you want but
I<00:01:55.370> don't<00:01:55.940> think<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.150> really<00:01:56.180> matters<00:01:56.450> just

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
I don't think it really matters just

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.780 
I don't think it really matters just
some<00:01:57.380> extent<00:01:57.980> they're<00:01:58.220> still<00:01:58.400> gonna<00:01:58.520> burn

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
some extent they're still gonna burn

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.900 
some extent they're still gonna burn
that<00:01:59.000> but<00:01:59.780> um<00:02:01.240> can<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.540> go<00:02:03.170> ahead<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:03.910> dig

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
that but um can you go ahead and dig

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.240 
that but um can you go ahead and dig

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
beloved basically going to do that as

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.520 
beloved basically going to do that as
far<00:02:28.610> down<00:02:28.670> as<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.330> place<00:02:29.750> objects

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
far down as you can place objects

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.040 
far down as you can place objects
because<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.490> have<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.730> also<00:02:32.240> put<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.600> tnd

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
because you have to also put the tnd

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.480 
because you have to also put the tnd
tanti<00:02:33.710> down<00:02:33.890> there<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.470> do<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.860> lavas

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
tanti down there so you can do to lavas

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.990 
tanti down there so you can do to lavas
or<00:02:37.670> one<00:02:37.850> lava<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.630> don't<00:02:38.930> know<00:02:39.050> if<00:02:39.490> 22<00:02:40.490> Lau's<00:02:40.700> is

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
or one lava I don't know if 22 Lau's is

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.970 
or one lava I don't know if 22 Lau's is
necessary<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.570> think<00:02:41.810> one<00:02:42.170> mob<00:02:42.380> will<00:02:42.590> get<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
necessary I think one mob will get the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.490 
necessary I think one mob will get the
job<00:02:43.160> done<00:02:43.510> but<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.810> can<00:02:45.020> do<00:02:45.580> many<00:02:46.580> as<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.910> want

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
job done but you can do many as you want

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.010 
job done but you can do many as you want
you<00:02:48.500> also<00:02:48.650> probably<00:02:48.890> want<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.720> block<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.900> off

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
you also probably want to block that off

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.630 
you also probably want to block that off
down<00:02:51.230> there<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:51.560> they<00:02:51.650> can't<00:02:51.890> crawl<00:02:52.220> out<00:02:52.400> while

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
down there so they can't crawl out while

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.280 
down there so they can't crawl out while
they're<00:02:52.790> reading<00:02:53.060> flames<00:02:54.700> first<00:02:55.700> it'll<00:02:55.910> die

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
they're reading flames first it'll die

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.370 
they're reading flames first it'll die
anyways<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.650> don't<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.520> would<00:02:58.790> just<00:02:58.970> do<00:02:59.090> it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
anyways but I don't I would just do it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.290 
anyways but I don't I would just do it
so<00:03:00.380> next<00:03:00.560> step<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.040> put<00:03:01.070> TNT<00:03:01.610> above<00:03:01.970> the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
so next step is to put TNT above the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.130 
so next step is to put TNT above the
lava<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:03.320> then<00:03:04.190> sand<00:03:04.580> on<00:03:04.910> top<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.300> TNT<00:03:05.870> and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
lava and then sand on top of the TNT and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.290 
lava and then sand on top of the TNT and
pressure<00:03:07.070> plates<00:03:07.370> on<00:03:07.519> top<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.850> sand<00:03:08.060> you

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
pressure plates on top of the sand you

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.150 
pressure plates on top of the sand you
can<00:03:08.450> use<00:03:08.540> gravel<00:03:09.019> if<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.230> want<00:03:09.440> i<00:03:09.709> find<00:03:10.040> it

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
can use gravel if you want i find it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.590 
can use gravel if you want i find it
looks<00:03:10.400> like<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.390> hides<00:03:11.630> better<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.440> in<00:03:12.769> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
looks like it hides better in the in the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.190 
looks like it hides better in the in the
cobblestone<00:03:14.600> it<00:03:14.750> looks<00:03:14.930> more<00:03:15.050> like

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
cobblestone it looks more like

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.250 
cobblestone it looks more like
cobblestone<00:03:15.380> in<00:03:15.769> San<00:03:16.010> des<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.840> also<00:03:17.989> want<00:03:18.080> to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
cobblestone in San des you also want to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.140 
cobblestone in San des you also want to
build<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.620> little<00:03:18.890> corral<00:03:19.310> around<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.910> side<00:03:20.120> of

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
build a little corral around the side of

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.400 
build a little corral around the side of
it<00:03:20.300> so<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:20.540> people<00:03:20.690> have<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.959> go<00:03:21.140> straight

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
they can't like hop to the side of it

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
they can't like hop to the side of it
and<00:03:23.530> then<00:03:24.530> they<00:03:24.709> burned<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.430> died<00:03:26.050> well

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050
