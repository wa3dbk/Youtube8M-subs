00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.060
 Item No .: SCP-1548 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.270
 Object class: Euclid Cutter 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.559
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1548 is currently not fit because of its position 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.690
 As an excellent body. Astronomers should be noted in the Research Unit -,, 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.470
 Currently in ███████,, SAARC. Three small size radio telescopes right now 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.390
 In use to allow a 24-hour message reception. All messages received are that written 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.649
 It is transferred to the SCP-1548 database. The MMA-5 MMA is currently set 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.039
 The task of suppressing knowledge of object properties in the media. 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:51.930
 Description: SCP-1548 is the foundation term for PSR B0531 + 21, the optical spring star in 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.289
 Crab Nebula. Originally discovered in 1942 by various scientific institutions, abnormal 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.550
 The nature of the star was unknown until 1968, when M██████ كيل, then L 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.290
 Astronomy world in [blocking], observations began via a wireless telescope. Radio observations revealed 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.620
 That star was, in fact, speeding toward the solar system, and that it was beating 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.170
 In Morse. The first fully written letter SCP-1548, translated from Russian 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.660
 It is broadcast in three blasts, which reads: "Wake up / I see all / and find it lacking." SCP-1548 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.400
 Pulses are usually at a rate of about 30HZ, although their transmission rates are high 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.000
 Has been registered (see Add SCP-1548-A). 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.330
 Over the next ten years, the star was observed to accelerate to nearly 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.710
 0.85c (2.55x108m / s). During this period, the pulsar began to move increasingly hostile 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.420
 Messages, with common phrases being "you can not hide" and "only death". And after I got her 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 Apparently the maximum speed by unknown in late 1978, the messages changed the radiated star, and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.660
 Has become remarkably more educated and coherent. 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.090
 It was at this point that SCP-1548 began to show awareness of this observation. 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.280
 Letters began to take on personal tone, insulting the object follower. Messages 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.819
 Received simultaneously on multiple telescopes will threaten individuals using all telescopes. 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.159
 Messages sent while telescopes are recorded automatically, without human intervention, 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.900
 Common threats are generally against humanity as a whole, although data [write off] push 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.209
 Create monitoring centers in these selected locations. Means by SCP-1548 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.480
 Apparently the future for the time is expected to receive its unknown pulses. 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:57.209
 The addition of SCP-1548-A: in / / / / 198,, O5-,, on medical leave from the duties of the enterprise, by mistake 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.159
 A small optical telescope is directed in the general direction of the Crab Nebula. The 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.459
 The SAAR telescopes recorded the following: "I just remembered this: coordinates 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.069
 All SCP facilities are safe. And has the personal information of O5 ". 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.939
 Tracking this transmission, the star pulse rate rose from 30Hz to more than 1KHZ, 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:23.260
 Requiring the use of high-speed cameras to record the message. Over the next eight 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.670
 Hours, SCP-1548 transmitted by data [write-off], totaling more than a gigabyte of information. 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.129
 This was the longest continuous message of history. 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:40.760
 SCP-1548: SCP-1548-B is added as a filter by order of O5-. 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.980
 I do not care if I stood here in 5,700 years. He knows too much. -O5-. 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:55.290
 Add SCP-1548-C: After the solar home illuminated on 04/11/2003, SAARC facility received 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.319
 A short message stating "your little world will be next". The letters were comparative 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.239
 Received after each major solar event since that date.
