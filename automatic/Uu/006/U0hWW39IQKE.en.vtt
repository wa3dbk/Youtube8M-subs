00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.300
 modern engines are subject to a 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.890
 large number of solicitations the filter 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.529
 of oil plays a role 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.650
 very important for the protection of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.410
 engine ensures a supply not of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.769
 oil in the case of starts in 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.930
 cold the short distances and the 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.710
 motorway journeys with speeds 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.989
 elevated the life of an engine depends on 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.809
 great measure of oil quality as well 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.850
 as of the oil filter since the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.160
 oil circuit is contaminated by 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.770
 combustion residues particles 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.590
 metal from abrasion and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.989
 other pollutants the use of a filter 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.789
 reliable that cleans the engine is a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.580
 dispensable a filter system that 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.490
 often used is the armored filter the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.399
 dirty oil is pumped to the filter 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.250
 by the oil pump and it goes through a 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.440
 filtering medium whose folding resists the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.630
 high pressure difference in addition 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.050
 Resists the components chemically 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.780
 Aggressive oil 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.390
 the most faithful have a capacity to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.520
 Particle separation practically 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.340
 absolute retaining even the most 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.200
 small the effects of low quality 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.810
 they have a folds geometry 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.500
 irregular and lower holding capacity 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.140
 of dirt 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.930
 in them the smallest particles do not 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.510
 they are retained while remaining in 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.960
 the lubrication circuit and causing a 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.820
 faster engine wear in those 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.650
 filters can even happen that your 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.020
 filter medium is scratched before 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.660
 high pressures allowing the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.580
 unfiltered oil return to the circuit and 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.119
 producing serious damage in a short time 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.119
 in the engine 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.479
 the handymen are designed to 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.610
 avoid it and give all their performance to what 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.430
 Throughout the time interval between the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.959
 changes because of the permanent 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.450
 waste formation in the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.670
 chemical aging of oil 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.480
 change of it as well as the filter are 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.300
 inevitable 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.909
 therefore you regularly change the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.959
 mann filter to cope with 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.959
 the different demands 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.519
 a well-designed filter body and 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:37.129
 built is essential for a filter 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.560
 reliable service pressures of 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.079
 up to 10 bars and the pressure tips 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.629
 even superiors suppose elevated 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.189
 solicitations for resistance to 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.790
 pressure of the body and of others 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:52.189
 components such as low bodies 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.950
 quality present a whole list of 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:57.139
 inconveniences due to the use of gaskets 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.359
 low quality material exists the 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:02.090
 danger of oil leakage between 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.639
 Filter body and motor block 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.189
 In addition , insufficient treatment of 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.949
 surface can lead to corrosion and 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.109
 drilling by the water splashing the 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.890
 consequence is also the loss of 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.270
 oil 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.340
 finally the use of infra materials 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.980
 sizing of low quality in the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.989
 filter body presents the danger of 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.190
 that it bursts causing a 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.190
 General engine failure 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.590
 ah 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.650
 The oil filter mann are robust 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.800
 resistant and comply with all 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.390
 Engine manufacturer's demands 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.610
 because besides the body and the matter 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.950
 filter there are other components 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.459
 decisive for filter quality and 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.230
 therefore for the safety of the motor 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.390
 so an oil conflict must have 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.420
 a bypass valve adapted to the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.560
 service pressure of the engine type 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.230
 valve that will be closed low 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.150
 normal operating conditions 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.880
 but that in case of need it will open 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.099
 and will drift into oil avoiding the medium 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.040
 filter in the case of a filter 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.700
 clogged or a cold and viscous oil 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.130
 to ensure the lubrication of the motor 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.530
 in low quality filters can occur 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.320
 that the bypass valve opens 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.300
 too late or even never creating 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.700
 thus the danger of interrupting for a 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.650
 time in lubrication of the engine what 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.650
 would quickly cause serious damage 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.440
 It would also be possible for the valve to 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.110
 closing too late or even never 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.240
 the consequence would be a very 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.570
 fast motor since it would circulate 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.880
 permanently makes unfiltered 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.580
 the mann filters work with precision 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.280
 and reliability are equipped with valves 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.780
 of derivation calibrated exactly by 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.540
 the service pressure of each motor 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.389
 another important component is the valve 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.880
 wide return this prevents it from emptying 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.310
 the engine oil filter stopped and 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.040
 guarantees the instantaneous appearance of 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.220
 oil pressure in the circuit in each 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.220
 start 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.810
 in low- quality centers the 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.780
 anti- return valve closes form 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.970
 does not stall the filter is emptied with what 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.010
 the engine does not receive oil from the 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.150
 first moment what produces a 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.150
 discarded important 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.449
 also regularly the mann filter 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:38.639
 because the mann filters have a 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.939
 High performance filtering year is 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:44.520
 say high figure of maximum filtering 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.110
 ability to retain impurities and 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.740
 remarkable resistance to agents 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.080
 chemists the filter mann have a 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.319
 Robust body with a high board 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.389
 quality a bypass valve 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:01.020
 exactly calibrated and an anti-valve 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.520
 return that works optimally all 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.620
 these functions are being 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.569
 constantly adapted to the 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.569
 requirements of engine manufacturers 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:12.409
 Mann filter offers a large number of 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:15.930
 oil filters of different types 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:18.599
 even complete filter modules of 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:22.649
 oil this underscores the leadership 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:25.439
 technological of the most mann filters 

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:28.319
 filter offers first team quality 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:31.639
 a full range of models and a large 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.639
 availability in the market
