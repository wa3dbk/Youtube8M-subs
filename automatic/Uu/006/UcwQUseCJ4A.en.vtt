00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
why don't we go ahead and make that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.710 
why don't we go ahead and make that
cappuccino<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> brewer<00:01:30.150> uses<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
cappuccino right now the brewer uses the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.450 
cappuccino right now the brewer uses the
rapid<00:01:31.049> steam<00:01:31.259> technology<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.250> steam

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
rapid steam technology so we get steam

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.800 
rapid steam technology so we get steam
very<00:01:32.729> quickly<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.299> first<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:33.689> we're<00:01:33.780> going

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
very quickly but first what we're going

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.890 
very quickly but first what we're going
to<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.560> purge<00:01:35.520> any<00:01:35.850> residual<00:01:36.540> water

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
to do is purge any residual water

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.390 
to do is purge any residual water
there's<00:01:37.229> always<00:01:37.380> some<00:01:37.590> condensation<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
there's always some condensation in the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.980 
there's always some condensation in the
steam<00:01:38.610> system<00:01:39.119> we're<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> run

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
steam system we're just going to run

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.160 
steam system we're just going to run
that<00:01:40.140> into<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.500> separate<00:01:40.829> pitcher<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:42.540> I

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that into a separate pitcher and now I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.440 
that into a separate pitcher and now I
have<00:01:43.350> my<00:01:43.470> milk<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:44.070> we're<00:01:45.000> gonna<00:01:45.119> put<00:01:45.329> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
have my milk here we're gonna put that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 
have my milk here we're gonna put that
under<00:01:45.659> we're<00:01:46.140> using<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.439> pannarello<00:01:47.009> wand<00:01:47.040> on

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
under we're using a pannarello wand on

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
under we're using a pannarello wand on
the<00:01:47.790> Brera<00:01:48.030> well<00:01:48.960> which<00:01:49.200> automatically

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the Brera well which automatically

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.179 
the Brera well which automatically
ejects<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.549> air<00:01:51.530> there's<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.619> little<00:01:52.770> hole<00:01:52.979> up

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
ejects the air there's a little hole up

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.240 
ejects the air there's a little hole up
here<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.759> sucks<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.240> air<00:01:54.420> through<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
here that sucks the air through and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.499 
here that sucks the air through and
automatically<00:01:56.250> frost<00:01:56.579> our<00:01:56.759> milk<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.180> us<00:01:57.210> so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
automatically frost our milk for us so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.990 
automatically frost our milk for us so
very<00:01:57.899> easy<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.439> use<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:59.430> once<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
very easy to use now once we get the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.090 
very easy to use now once we get the
froth<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.509> want<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.259> still<00:02:01.530> need<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> heat

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
froth we want if we still need to heat

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.940 
froth we want if we still need to heat
our<00:02:02.250> milk<00:02:02.490> some<00:02:02.729> more<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.810> raise<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
our milk some more we can raise the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.830 
our milk some more we can raise the
glass<00:02:05.159> top<00:02:05.430> cover<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.000> hole<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> stops

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
glass top cover that hole so it stops

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.000 
glass top cover that hole so it stops
the<00:02:06.990> air<00:02:07.259> intake

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
the air intake

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.820 
the air intake
now<00:02:08.400> typically<00:02:08.820> we<00:02:09.240> heat<00:02:10.050> our<00:02:10.080> milk<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.560> just

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
now typically we heat our milk to just

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.820 
now typically we heat our milk to just
under<00:02:11.100> 160<00:02:12.000> degrees<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.750> don't<00:02:13.500> have<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
under 160 degrees I don't have the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.050 
under 160 degrees I don't have the
thermometer<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.400> I'm<00:02:14.490> just<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.940> it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
thermometer so I'm just going to do it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.790 
thermometer so I'm just going to do it
till<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.330> glass<00:02:15.600> becomes<00:02:16.080> kind<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
till the glass becomes kind of

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.830 
till the glass becomes kind of
uncomfortable<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.490> hold<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.390> typically<00:02:18.720> I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
uncomfortable to hold and typically I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.360 
uncomfortable to hold and typically I
would<00:02:19.080> do<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.560> pitcher<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.100> not<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
would do this in the pitcher and not the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.360 
would do this in the pitcher and not the
glass<00:02:20.900> okay<00:02:21.900> I've<00:02:22.110> got<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.470> froth<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.920> want<00:02:23.190> so

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
glass okay I've got the froth I want so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.830 
glass okay I've got the froth I want so
I<00:02:23.400> buried<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.790> bowl<00:02:24.210> I'm<00:02:24.360> just<00:02:24.540> gonna<00:02:24.630> let<00:02:24.810> it

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
I buried that bowl I'm just gonna let it

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.530 
I buried that bowl I'm just gonna let it
heat<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> little<00:02:25.380> bit<00:02:25.470> more<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.790> okay<00:02:27.420> it's

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
heat a little bit more and okay it's

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.560 
heat a little bit more and okay it's
starting<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.900> get<00:02:27.960> nice<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.410> warm<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.570> there

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
starting to get nice and warm so there

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.320 
starting to get nice and warm so there

Morgan you can do the honors of your
espresso<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.830> glass<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.360> going<00:02:42.480> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
espresso in the glass so just going to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.560 
espresso in the glass so just going to
press<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.990> single<00:02:43.650> shot<00:02:43.920> button<00:02:44.240> in<00:02:45.240> first

it's<00:02:45.750> grinding<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.350> beans<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.040> it's

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
it's grinding the beans and then it's

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.520 
it's grinding the beans and then it's
going<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> go<00:02:47.550> through<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> pre<00:02:48.420> infusion<00:02:49.020> cycle

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
going to go through a pre infusion cycle

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.040 
going to go through a pre infusion cycle
which<00:02:49.740> just<00:02:50.040> what's<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> grounds<00:02:51.450> before<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
which just what's the grounds before the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.900 
which just what's the grounds before the
actual<00:02:52.410> pressure<00:02:52.680> extraction<00:02:53.370> takes<00:02:53.610> place

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
actual pressure extraction takes place

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.450 
actual pressure extraction takes place
so<00:02:54.330> there<00:02:54.480> was<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> pre<00:02:54.870> infusion<00:02:55.380> stop<00:02:56.100> for<00:02:56.430> a

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
so there was a pre infusion stop for a

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.610 
so there was a pre infusion stop for a
second<00:02:56.910> mm-hmm<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.810> now<00:02:58.170> it's<00:02:58.350> actually

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
second mm-hmm and now it's actually

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860 
second mm-hmm and now it's actually
gonna<00:02:58.710> do<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.980> pressure<00:02:59.400> brewing<00:03:00.030> right<00:03:00.570> and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
gonna do the pressure brewing right and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.670 
gonna do the pressure brewing right and
we<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.770> see

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
we can see

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.840 
we can see
