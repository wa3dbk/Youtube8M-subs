00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
is they're the only company that's going
to<00:01:46.109> make<00:01:46.289> this<00:01:46.530> specifically<00:01:47.219> for<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.789> car

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
to make this specifically for this car

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
to make this specifically for this car
so<00:01:48.840> all<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.170> wires<00:01:49.380> are<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.859> two

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
so all the wires are going to be two

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.889 
so all the wires are going to be two
lengths<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.119> connector<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.539> going<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.780> be

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
lengths all the connector is going to be

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.359 
lengths all the connector is going to be
there<00:01:52.109> all<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.409> grommets<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:53.039> going<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> be

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
there all the grommets are going to be

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.490 
there all the grommets are going to be
there<00:01:53.609> it's<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.359> well<00:01:54.570> engineered<00:01:55.200> kit

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
there it's a really well engineered kit

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.130 
there it's a really well engineered kit
and<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.399> how<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> comes<00:01:56.909> we've<00:01:57.750> laid<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and this is how it comes we've laid it

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
and this is how it comes we've laid it
out<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.710> table<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.549> kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> show<00:01:59.909> you<00:01:59.969> the
