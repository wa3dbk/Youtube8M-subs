00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello hello get drust me for 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.580
 next is a review of mods today we have a mod 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.300
 which is called super crafting frame 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.179
 and he adds two such frames which 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.850
 seriously facilitate your crafting process 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.980
 now you don't just have to stand and workbench 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.380
 and so began to nod nasche nod 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.949
 chopsticks no need no need not all 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.630
 do it for you frame and so kraft 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.360
 she's like 8 sticks around one workbench 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.899
 It turns out that such a frame is super 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.030
 crafting frame and also can be crafted 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.680
 super and this frame is needed for this 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.480
 to quickly drag things between 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.510
 chest and your inventory kravets she 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.449
 from here such here not ejector 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.140
 confused with the distribution of com craft from her such 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:00.329
 same simple 8 sticks around one 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.090
 ejector collect the frame there itself 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.070
 By the way, we are on the Kraft wine map. 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.990
 Kotlas city if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.670
 the frame itself 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 used in this way just 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.890
 put it somewhere you are for it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.869
 here is the window and here you need to configure 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.830
 crafting recipe for example and I want to craft 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.799
 workbenches 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.540
 without spending the boards yourself you just 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.060
 how do you post appears 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.729
 image and by pressing the right button 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.150
 mouse you start to craft itself 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.740
 things now i'm creative so i have 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.770
 logs are not wasted but you can do it 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.750
 infinitely very comfortable and do not need anything 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.710
 posting just come click 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.240
 about the mouse button and ready it works 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.939
 with all the frames to break clamp 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.820
 and shift, that is, crouch and left button 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.899
 I break the mouse now creative so 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.149
 the matter is instant 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.520
 but you have to do a bit of work 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.890
 palm here and also tune here 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.140
 recipes 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.860
 the next item that adds this 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.709
 the mod is called super wright frame that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.330
 translated literally as a super subject 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:20.680
 I do not know the framework, but in general everything is controlled 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.820
 very simply put the frame on the chest and 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.940
 right click put there 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.100
 some thing actually all the manipulations 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.320
 it will happen to her very 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.610
 convenient if you have a bunch of chests you do not 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.730
 you know what's where 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.820
 it's so easy to see when you go 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.910
 for example here dynamite music blocks 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.130
 you can also open the chest for example 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.310
 force everything here with other chests 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.019
 and at the same time it will work in general 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.880
 how it works right click 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.450
 click and one item goes inside 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.989
 a chest like this so do what if 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.750
 you 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.400
 but how would you quickly click 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.769
 move immediately Stuckey all things so 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.500
 same it can be done by pressing cattrall 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.829
 pkm you also move all items to 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.920
 the chest at the same time learn how much their left 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.260
 click and then you take just one 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.820
 any item that is in the frame 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.430
 if you hold shift and lkm then you break 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.370
 frame to hell with ordinary shouts 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.980
