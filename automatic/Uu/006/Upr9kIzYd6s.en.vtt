changed much what if you watch my
previous<00:00:09.150> videos<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.960> would<00:00:10.080> notice<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.530> big

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
previous videos you would notice a big

previous videos you would notice a big
change<00:00:11.120> for<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.210> graphics<00:00:12.540> card<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:13.440> for

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
change for the graphics card it's for

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.390 
change for the graphics card it's for
now<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.830> new<00:00:14.250> 7950<00:00:15.240> graphics<00:00:15.690> card<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.400> from

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
now the new 7950 graphics card and from

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.750 
now the new 7950 graphics card and from
the<00:00:17.550> old<00:00:17.840> 6870<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> pcr<00:00:19.980> 3.98

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the old 6870 so this is the pcr 3.98

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.200 
the old 6870 so this is the pcr 3.98

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.820 
the bios on here to the Black Edition I
might<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> guy<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.330> don't<00:00:30.710> then<00:00:31.710> it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
might have a guy that if I don't then it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.310 
might have a guy that if I don't then it
will<00:00:31.920> stay<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.219> 800<00:00:32.640> megahertz<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.320> my

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
will stay at 800 megahertz and my

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.889 
will stay at 800 megahertz and my
previous<00:00:34.770> 6870<00:00:35.610> was<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> thousand<00:00:36.570> i<00:00:36.660> think

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
previous 6870 was at a thousand i think

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.930 
previous 6870 was at a thousand i think
or<00:00:38.180> 908<00:00:39.500> 980<00:00:40.500> or<00:00:40.710> something<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.820> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
or 908 980 or something like that but it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
or 908 980 or something like that but it
was<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> highest<00:00:42.809> clocks<00:00:43.079> plopped

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
was one of the highest clocks plopped

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.690 
was one of the highest clocks plopped
cards<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.860> could<00:00:47.010> buy<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
cards and that you could buy when the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.779 
cards and that you could buy when the
six<00:00:47.940> series<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.570> from<00:00:49.379> stock<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.160> yeah<00:00:50.340> so

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
six series was out from stock so yeah so

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
six series was out from stock so yeah so
that's<00:00:50.940> my<00:00:51.090> hey<00:00:51.329> check<00:00:51.570> 621<00:00:52.199> power<00:00:52.379> supply

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that's my hey check 621 power supply

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.729 
that's my hey check 621 power supply
modular<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.480> there's<00:00:54.480> basically<00:00:55.079> free

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
modular and there's basically free

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.090 
modular and there's basically free
cables<00:00:56.160> coming<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.829> so<00:00:58.829> it's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
cables coming out of that and so it's

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.340 
cables coming out of that and so it's
really<00:00:59.399> clean<00:00:59.760> really<00:01:00.059> flat<00:01:00.600> whereas<00:01:00.989> my<00:01:01.170> old

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
really clean really flat whereas my old

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.609 
really clean really flat whereas my old
power<00:01:01.590> supply<00:01:01.620> would<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.309> about<00:01:03.149> 10<00:01:04.080> cables

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
power supply would have about 10 cables

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.820 
power supply would have about 10 cables
coming<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.309> which<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.580> ridiculous

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
coming out of here which is ridiculous

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.140 
coming out of here which is ridiculous
coolermaster<00:01:07.880> 120<00:01:08.880> will<00:01:09.650> send<00:01:10.650> me<00:01:10.799> a

120-millimeter fan so I was 12

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.460 
120-millimeter fan so I was 12
centimeters<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.430> 14<00:01:15.270> centimeter<00:01:15.840> fan<00:01:16.170> there

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
centimeters and 14 centimeter fan there

dust<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.340> quantum<00:02:02.729> oscillator<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.329> whatnot

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
dust for quantum oscillator and whatnot

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.080 
dust for quantum oscillator and whatnot
and<00:02:03.899> these<00:02:04.860> strips<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.460> removable<00:02:05.909> they're

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and these strips are removable they're

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.210 
and these strips are removable they're
actually<00:02:06.390> really<00:02:06.420> easy<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.079> remove<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:08.039> take

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
actually really easy to remove just take

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.180 
actually really easy to remove just take
out<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.940> then<00:02:09.119> there's<00:02:09.300> clips

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
out this and then there's clips

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.010 
out this and then there's clips
you<00:02:10.280> just<00:02:10.460> click<00:02:10.610> them<00:02:10.790> off<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.240> it's<00:02:11.840> really

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
you just click them off and it's really

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.600 
you just click them off and it's really
easy<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.350> mod<00:02:12.680> if<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.980> want<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.220> change<00:02:13.430> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
easy to mod if you want to change the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.270 
easy to mod if you want to change the
color<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.850> those<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.930> there's<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:16.070> fun<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.670> oh

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
color of those and there's the fun I oh

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.640 
color of those and there's the fun I oh
okay<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.340> yeah<00:02:19.780> from<00:02:20.780> what<00:02:20.810> in<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.410> case

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
okay so yeah from what in this case

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.960 
okay so yeah from what in this case
batteries<00:02:22.070> quite<00:02:22.250> low<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.580> want<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.820> rush

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
batteries quite low so I want to rush

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.560 
batteries quite low so I want to rush
here<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:23.920> modding<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.100> case<00:02:25.370> I'm<00:02:25.700> thinking

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
here and modding this case I'm thinking

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.830 
here and modding this case I'm thinking
of<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.710> get<00:02:27.860> my<00:02:28.010> i7<00:02:28.100> rig<00:02:28.460> in<00:02:28.730> here<00:02:28.940> putting

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
of and I get my i7 rig in here putting

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.440 
of and I get my i7 rig in here putting
this<00:02:29.930> pass<00:02:30.140> play<00:02:30.410> over<00:02:30.860> here<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.180> if<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.390> do

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
this pass play over here this is if I do

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.120 
this pass play over here this is if I do
walk<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.870> them<00:02:32.990> by<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.170> way<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.710> i<00:02:33.740> put<00:02:33.980> a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
walk on them by the way so i put a

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.480 
walk on them by the way so i put a
mirroring<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.210> over<00:02:35.750> here<00:02:35.960> so<00:02:36.310> those<00:02:37.310> will

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
mirroring this over here so those will

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.720 
mirroring this over here so those will
be<00:02:37.550> coming<00:02:37.850> out<00:02:38.260> from<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.560> going<00:02:40.190> into<00:02:40.580> that

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
be coming out from here going into that

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.390 
be coming out from here going into that
hole<00:02:41.300> there<00:02:41.630> that'll<00:02:42.410> leave<00:02:42.530> me<00:02:42.560> room<00:02:42.890> for<00:02:43.100> a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
hole there that'll leave me room for a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.900 
hole there that'll leave me room for a
reservoir<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:45.350> pump<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:46.520> up<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.820> this

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
reservoir and a pump going up to this

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.860 
reservoir and a pump going up to this
graphics<00:02:47.300> card<00:02:47.510> go<00:02:48.020> into<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.440> cpu<00:02:49.060> going<00:02:50.060> up

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
graphics card go into the cpu going up

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.350 
graphics card go into the cpu going up
to<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:52.360> 360<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.630> then<00:02:53.870> go<00:02:53.990> down<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:55.360> reservoir

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
to a 360 and then go down to a reservoir

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.390 
to a 360 and then go down to a reservoir
now<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:56.840> case<00:02:57.050> doesn't<00:02:57.290> natively<00:02:57.740> support

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
now this case doesn't natively support

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.120 
now this case doesn't natively support
360<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.960> few<00:03:00.140> some<00:03:00.290> modifications<00:03:00.950> are

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
360 but the few some modifications are

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.100 
360 but the few some modifications are
removing<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.790> which<00:03:02.330> has<00:03:02.540> nothing<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:02.960> there

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
removing that which has nothing in there

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.510 
removing that which has nothing in there
I<00:03:03.790> can<00:03:04.790> have<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:05.000> 360<00:03:05.510> as<00:03:06.140> well<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.650> i<00:03:07.400> was

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
I can have a 360 as well and i was

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.490 
I can have a 360 as well and i was
thinking<00:03:07.550> I'm<00:03:08.090> definitely<00:03:08.690> removing<00:03:09.320> all<00:03:09.470> of

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
thinking I'm definitely removing all of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.680 
thinking I'm definitely removing all of
this<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.040> all<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.210> won't<00:03:11.390> be<00:03:11.480> able<00:03:11.540> to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
this and all of this I won't be able to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.560 
this and all of this I won't be able to
use<00:03:11.810> those<00:03:11.990> anymore<00:03:12.050> which<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.740> don't<00:03:12.860> mind<00:03:13.570> so

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
use those anymore which I don't mind so

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.100 
use those anymore which I don't mind so
yeah<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.140> then<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.400> pass<00:03:16.640> by<00:03:16.880> be<00:03:17.150> chambered

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
yeah and then the pass by be chambered

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.130 
yeah and then the pass by be chambered
will<00:03:18.320> be<00:03:18.410> chamber<00:03:18.800> door<00:03:19.010> um<00:03:19.959> it'd<00:03:20.959> be<00:03:21.110> a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
will be chamber door um it'd be a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.199 
will be chamber door um it'd be a
compartment<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:21.920> although<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.940> will<00:03:23.090> be

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
compartment so although this will be

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.810 
compartment so although this will be
sealed<00:03:23.450> off<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.040> then<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.130> can<00:03:25.310> have<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.489> dual

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
sealed off and then I can have a dual

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.750 
sealed off and then I can have a dual
radio<00:03:26.120> here<00:03:26.480> with<00:03:27.140> two<00:03:27.320> fans<00:03:27.620> coming<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.610> hear

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
radio here with two fans coming to hear

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.600 
radio here with two fans coming to hear
blowing<00:03:29.060> air<00:03:29.239> from<00:03:30.110> event<00:03:30.470> straight<00:03:31.310> into

you enjoy it and I am rendering this off
windows<00:05:51.400> media<00:05:52.230> what's<00:05:53.230> cool<00:05:53.440> what's<00:05:53.770> the

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
windows media what's cool what's the

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.480 
windows media what's cool what's the
idea<00:05:54.100> over<00:05:54.280> windows<00:05:54.490> media<00:05:54.880> so<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:57.160> windows

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
idea over windows media so the windows

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.910 
idea over windows media so the windows
video<00:05:57.790> editor<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.480> basic<00:05:58.870> one<00:05:59.080> so<00:05:59.560> and

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
video editor the basic one so and

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.280 
video editor the basic one so and
apparently<00:06:00.850> that<00:06:00.880> doesn't<00:06:01.570> render<00:06:01.900> as<00:06:02.110> good

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
apparently that doesn't render as good

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.360 
apparently that doesn't render as good
as<00:06:02.470> Sony<00:06:02.860> Vegas<00:06:02.980> or<00:06:03.430> premier<00:06:04.710> probably<00:06:05.710> that's

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
as Sony Vegas or premier probably that's
