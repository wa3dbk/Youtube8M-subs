00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 but first the campfire first 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.930
 Nothing bonfire with the fire burning 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.550
 people can relax and start thinking about 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.530
 food on the water these things in a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.000
 camp the first fire 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.580
 Let's build the fire well. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.520
 cool, it 's a head little heartthrob. 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:24.320
 Chewing gum and strip the battery, that's it. 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.539
 use chewing gum laminate 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.820
 we will connect this terminal because as 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.830
 has metal will drive the heat when 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.270
 go through the narrow part and then sell 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.300
 paper behind 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.040
 the idea is to take fire and anyway and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.230
 will make a flame head is the plan 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.670
 you can use it to light 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.960
 This is really cool, I wanted to learn. 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.760
 a cool way to light a fire 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 I wanted to do something different is a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.780
 old simple trick I've been doing since 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.510
 child, she can stand there because she 's a 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:58.910
 well cool, then put it here and touch it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.910
 be good at nau 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.860
 I got it right on the first try. 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.810
 cool huh 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.690
 I always wanted it a little like that. 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.290
 first , cool, right 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.620
 omelette of an egg just coming out good this is 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:25.340
 a basic ingredient of the omelet bear 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:28.040
 grylls here is a new moment a car and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.690
 tower goes to bark is great has many 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.690
 vitamins and minerals in the house 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:40.910
 and apparently there is a lot of land and leaves 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.380
 Also great to give it a stir now 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:55.940
 people put on the edge of the fire is still 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:58.250
 cooking here nojo was in 2000 the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.759
 The kitchen of the new is well in the way it does not have 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.380
 way 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:08.090
 here they are filled through pain is 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.709
 sad but sometimes has to survive 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.200
 that kill two girls 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.450
 sometimes I like to cook without 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.820
 in the woods and I get super excited 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.860
 Thinking is going to look fantastic but I do not 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.470
 I'm going to make up this one of those that I 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.400
 I bet the river is going to stay the way it is. 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.150
 huh 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.790
 I better prove first that the ro 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.790
 of course the will to see how it is 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.640
 It's also bad but try closing your eyes. 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.370
 and imagine that you are in a good 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.840
 restaurant sir just effron the worms 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.390
 and your people are ready 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:54.930
 It's a lot smaller, that's it, look, it's just going to be 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.500
 a little bite on the eggshell is 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.010
 weird 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.750
 I like the house, it 's kind of provocative. 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.120
 I have ostrich stomach 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.120
 but it was too bitter to give up to my nose 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.319
 it was so disgusting
