00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.060
 I am android 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.379
 good 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.000
 Y 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.000
 the application 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.730
 it is also time 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.300
 I do not know what we're going to do 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.300
 3 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 Y 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.170
 but hopefully a bad antivirus 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.410
 install and once we have done this 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.970
 that 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.970
 we get to the application 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.610
 good 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.460
 this town you agile varied when 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.550
 download any application or something in 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.160
 the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.570
 and does it after it has 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.010
 downloaded and my list 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.010
 the analysis was bad 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.610
 for sure and all that as you can 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.810
 see your safety 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.350
 tell us that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.350
 yes 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.350
 not only then now what seems to be a 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.650
 courtesy lost device is worth this 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.970
 I do not know why they put it here because if 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.840
 are you from the mobile 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:20.670
 I do not think I do not have to use here 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.099
 this is worth the local what is that because 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.319
 when it does when you have a pattern 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.709
 well pib and fail it as many times as 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.349
 it can be 5 that is the pattern is in this 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.980
 camera this you have to have camera 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.680
 this one of these fronts to come 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.150
 I took a picture of it and sent it to the email 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.239
 that is exposed here because you have to 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.430
 register look at it that is the computer not 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.230
 I looked at it the computer can know has 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.510
 if it requires us to pass the police what 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.880
 complaint 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.880
 good what we do 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.110
 and we are at home I do not know what and it does not work 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.280
 that of the street because you do not have this 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.280
 page that I will now leave 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.639
 not here not product when you install the 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.609
 application we were asked to put simile 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.609
 and that once I 've done it vinyl 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.810
 they already take many my bad 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.150
 sorry 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.890
 I'm with your lord 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.180
 do not 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.970
 the devices there is only the number 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.330
 and good 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.110
 says important things 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.430
 and well here says it started a device 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.989
 for caps and restaurant and restorations 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.739
 count all 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.739
 follow 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.490
 You can block it from here 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.750
 device to ride the snoops 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:42.740
 array that other data can not do 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.740
 alarm that does not work and erase everything 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.990
 the vortex exactly not where it was 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.800
 I told them if they were any 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.949
 hostile wifi to wifi seen 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.900
 and if it's 3g I think it tells you where 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.000
 is exactly 1 then this already 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.280
 you have an idea for example is here 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.470
 because you go down this street and go to the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.160
 police and you are commuting it seems a 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.270
 asshole but you can find tumor 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.210
 and well, that was all 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.760
 you can also add more devices 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.920
 I only have one but you can if you have 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.410
