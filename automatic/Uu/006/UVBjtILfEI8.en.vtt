00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.880 
a little while a little laugh and in
like<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> couple<00:00:17.190> weeks<00:00:17.550> um<00:00:18.050> basically<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.680> I

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
like a couple weeks um basically like I

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
like a couple weeks um basically like I
did<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.580> because<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.000> know<00:00:21.060> there's<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.480> lot<00:00:21.510> out

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
did it because I know there's a lot out

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.599 
did it because I know there's a lot out
there<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.439> know<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.189> people<00:00:23.220> don't

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
there and I know that some people don't

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.349 
there and I know that some people don't
know<00:00:23.820> about<00:00:23.850> them<00:00:24.539> um<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
know about them um so I think that you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.089 
know about them um so I think that you
should<00:00:27.390> try<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.750> front<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.560> right<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.890> think

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
should try the front all right I think

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.310 
should try the front all right I think
you<00:00:29.310> should<00:00:29.490> try<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.670> find<00:00:29.910> someone<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.689> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you should try to find someone that you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.200 
you should try to find someone that you
like<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.890> enjoy<00:00:32.279> watching<00:00:32.550> um<00:00:34.040> somebody
