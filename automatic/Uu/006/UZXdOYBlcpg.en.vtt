00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.700
 from today I will start to climb 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.290
 videos on youtube I hope in next ones 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.210
 occasions to act with a little 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.080
 more naturalness and express myself more 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.270
 freely the truth is they say that 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.910
 because on the first occasions he gave a 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.790
 little bit of nerves and if it's something strange 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.860
 uncomfortable then sit down and talk to a 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.980
 camera is something so that there was never 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.649
 done and so as not to lengthen this 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.260
 introduction so let's start with what 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.540
 says the title of the video that is how 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.790
 do 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.030
 that our skin is a little cleaner 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.250
 with things we can do 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.250
 daily and that they give us on the coast 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.380
 yes 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.090
 of clean makeup is very important 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.050
 wash them frequently since these 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.220
 accumulate grease and grime that later goes to 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.440
 touch our skin when we 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.159
 make up and this is what makes 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.460
 generate new pimples and pimples 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.399
 blackheads and good things that do 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.590
 that our skin looks a little off 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.250
 in the second instance we can say that 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.630
 as well 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.530
 remove makeup from our skin in 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.560
 the night is to remove make-up 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.840
 makes our skin our pores 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.440
 can breathe freely and so the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.360
 Fat comes out and does not accumulate 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.480
 On the other hand we can also say that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.170
 It is very important that we do not have so much 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.710
 the lock on the forehead because good 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.080
 the hair is a great source of fat and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.700
 what he is going to do is that if he plays a lot 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.640
 our forehead then they are going to start 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.979
 generate pimples and pimples by 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.310
 these areas that are the ones that are most 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.270
 close to the hair 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.220
 otherwise you can also say 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.400
 it is better to keep the horse 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.400
 behind 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.400
 and not touching so much is very very 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.930
 important not to spend touching us the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.480
 hair all the time because our 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.530
 hands are not always clean and that's 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.660
 what makes our hair look 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.120
 soiled and that woman later passed it on 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.090
 Our skin 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.560
 on the other hand consume water is a fact 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.030
 super key because good water is 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.480
 very important in every aspect the water 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.940
 is basic is vital for life then 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.010
 the important thing when it comes to consuming water 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.110
 is not to exceed us because if we exceed 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.110
 let's start accumulating water and 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.030
 retain liquids and this will generate that 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.200
 we are overweight and that is not what 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.510
 we want the important thing is how to consume 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.950
 a strict one that are the two liters of 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.680
 Daily water that are recommended 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.480
 which are approximately eight glasses of 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.060
 Daily water to be or not to be 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.549
 consume everything in water but juices 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.440
 naturals are considered as vessels of 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.159
 water then we do not have to fill up 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.270
 eight glasses of water and five juices a day 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.640
 not because they are liquid 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.010
 which contains the water then we must is 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.980
 moderate the consumption of liquids because if 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.540
 not good if our thinking very well but 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.270
 let's start generating overweight 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.450
 that we do not want otherwise 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.300
 It is very important to do sports because 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.110
 when we do sports we release toxins 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.840
 that our body could reveal in 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.170
 our skin on our face with 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.210
 granites and spots and things like that and then 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.100
 if we exercise 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.290
 We are helping a lot of 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.159
 ways 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.849
 also in a certain amount of food 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:11.269
 dietary there that they avoid a lot 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.629
 gaseous fats 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.329
 junk food because this makes 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:20.780
 our skin starts to look a little 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.240
 more subdued and then also if they start 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.900
 generate all those uncomfortable neighborhoods and 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.900
 those your pinillos that are pretty 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.900
 unpleasant 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.080
 and now what we are going to do 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:47.270
 the infusion of ginger I do not know if what 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.780
 know is this is a little plant 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.790
 that looks like a root 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.080
 Well I already have it a little used 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.510
 because I use it so what 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.460
 we get in stores and supermarkets 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:07.220
 It is very common and this will help us 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.460
 make a skin tonic for 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.520
 apply it and also an infusion that 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.110
 We can fasting consume ie 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.230
 before breakfast let it be first 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.560
 that we consume and in the night the last 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.550
 that we consume before bedtime what 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.550
 what we have to do 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.169
 is to drink some hot water here 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:36.090
 I have some hot water 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.090
 let's warn him in a well 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.210
 and we are going to add a piece of ginger 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.180
 more or less of this size not very big 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.700
 because ginger is usually something 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.250
 spicy then if it is very large it is 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.340
 spicy and it's going to be a lot and it's going to 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.880
 be uncomfortable to take it after that 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.760
 let's put a talk or something that 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.300
 cover and let's wait for 5 minutes the 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.570
 final result is going to be a water like 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.400
 this color in water like yellow and this 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.610
 we will consume it preferably 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:17.290
 hot as if it were an aromatic water 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:20.440
 or a tea and after that when 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.960
 let us have that same good water 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.060
 what we are going to do is take something from 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.330
 cotton 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:32.020
 cotton this is cotton we're going to 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.840
 submerge in water and what we're going to 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.900
 to do is to pass it through our skin 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.020
 totally clean and is made up what 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:44.470
 we're going to do is go through it all 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.860
 our skin to clean as if it were 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.990
 a tonic, this we are going to do before 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.480
 make up in the morning is to say 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.580
 after bathing and after is 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.919
 make up at night 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.830
 I hope these tips serve you 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:03.520
 this has been all for today and I hope 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:06.250
