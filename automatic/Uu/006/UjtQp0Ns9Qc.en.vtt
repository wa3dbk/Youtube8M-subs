00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
now we're going to pump that damper rod

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.100 
now we're going to pump that damper rod
in<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.000> out<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> couple<00:02:57.390> more<00:02:57.569> times

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
in and out a couple more times

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.050 
in and out a couple more times
make<00:02:58.709> sure<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:58.980> extends<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.580> way<00:02:59.670> fully

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
make sure it extends all the way fully

make sure it extends all the way fully
by<00:03:00.269> itself<00:03:01.049> make<00:03:02.010> sure<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.340> action<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:02.849> smooth

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
by itself make sure the action is smooth

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.210 
by itself make sure the action is smooth
there's<00:03:03.420> no<00:03:03.540> air<00:03:03.690> bubbles<00:03:04.080> if<00:03:04.230> there<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.010> we'll

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
there's no air bubbles if there is we'll

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.339 
there's no air bubbles if there is we'll
need<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.430> go<00:03:05.549> ahead<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.000> redo<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:07.129> last<00:03:08.129> step

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
need to go ahead and redo that last step

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.809 
need to go ahead and redo that last step
there<00:03:10.349> might<00:03:10.560> be<00:03:10.590> some<00:03:10.920> oil<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.370> comes<00:03:11.549> back

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
there might be some oil that comes back

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.000 
there might be some oil that comes back
out<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.180> those<00:03:12.299> holes<00:03:12.599> if<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.349> overfilled<00:03:13.890> it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
out of those holes if you overfilled it

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.250 
out of those holes if you overfilled it
a<00:03:14.099> little<00:03:14.310> bit<00:03:14.599> go<00:03:15.599> ahead<00:03:15.629> and<00:03:15.840> dump<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.200> out

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
a little bit go ahead and dump that out

works<00:05:53.790> great<00:05:54.120> for<00:05:54.150> this<00:05:54.419> you<00:05:54.630> can<00:05:54.750> tell

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
works great for this you can tell

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.890 
works great for this you can tell
exactly<00:05:55.080> how<00:05:55.470> much<00:05:55.740> oil<00:05:56.150> you<00:05:57.150> need<00:05:57.300> to<00:05:57.360> put<00:05:57.510> in

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.439 

I'm<00:06:00.440> going<00:06:00.620> to<00:06:00.680> take<00:06:00.889> that<00:06:01.070> fork<00:06:01.699> cap<00:06:01.910> back<00:06:02.180> off

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
I'm going to take that fork cap back off

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:09.560 
I'm going to take that fork cap back off
again<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:04.190> outer<00:06:04.370> one

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.750 

slide<00:06:10.290> it<00:06:10.470> down<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.650> bit<00:06:11.160> slide<00:06:11.400> that<00:06:11.550> outer

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
slide it down a bit slide that outer

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.670 
slide it down a bit slide that outer
tube<00:06:12.060> down<00:06:12.270> a<00:06:12.330> bit

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.990 

and<00:06:14.770> pour<00:06:15.520> in<00:06:15.669> our<00:06:15.790> measured

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
and pour in our measured

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.120 
and pour in our measured
amount<00:06:18.630> of<00:06:18.750> oil<00:06:18.900> makes<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.830> little<00:06:19.920> bit<00:06:20.010> easier

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
amount of oil makes a little bit easier

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.120 
amount of oil makes a little bit easier
to<00:06:20.870> late<00:06:21.870> to<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.080> side<00:06:22.320> a<00:06:22.350> little<00:06:22.470> bit<00:06:22.680> so<00:06:22.830> you

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
to late to the side a little bit so you

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.900 
to late to the side a little bit so you
