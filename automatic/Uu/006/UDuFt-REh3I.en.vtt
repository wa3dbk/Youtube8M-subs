00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.620
 someone has installed my plot of the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.620
 entry let's see what 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.700
 it's so bad it's not horrendous today 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.090
 confidante let's go no no no no no no no no 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.090
 do not 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.630
 because there are very good signals now yes 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.020
 that we're serious and well we're done 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.699
 to see my new trap of reston and good 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.280
 we just saw that he tries to enter 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.440
 this house and upon entering everything has fallen 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.010
 the ground and I burned the lava well 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 that's a pretty useful reston trap 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 the bad thing about this trap that is from a 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.570
 only use and that you can not recover the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.750
 objects of the dead person but the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.000
 kill yes or yes and that is very very 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.100
 camouflaged and only people who have seen 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.629
 already this trap lately you may know 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.579
 what is that trap but a person 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 normal can neither be crazy nor can you 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.390
 happen well we just see what 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.890
 incoming enters this house expelled the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 prison plate because of another floor 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.420
 with me and I have calmed down in the lava well 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.000
 the reston mechanism is very very 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.770
 simple ok here we have another trap 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 that I created here to think that you can 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.160
 make a structure here as we want 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.770
 here we can make it the door of 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.450
 a house and here put a little door or 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.909
 whatever it is but mechanism is this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.909
 Okay, there's good below, so let's go 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.800
 see how well under the trap then 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.690
 basically there is a tnt block that 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.460
 is just above the plate of the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.080
 pressure plate that is this 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.640
 the cnt block is hooked a 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.830
 lots of posters that makes a network of 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.750
 posters throughout the sand structure 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.850
 or gravel think that these blocks of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.290
 here they can only only be those that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.140
 act with gravity or they can be 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.190
 gravel or sand is worth or red sand that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.690
 It's also worth it because if the sand 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.759
 red that is that I had forgotten about 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.770
 this latest version is worth any of these 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.600
 blocks work what happens when 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.820
 we activate the pressure plate activates 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.920
 the tnt and the tnt as you already know when 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.950
 ignite this theory by gravity 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.450
 so the tnt falls and when all this falls 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.450
 poster is here they break and man 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.220
 other posters that I get all the whole 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.900
 this is true and what happens then what happens 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.440
 next let's see it again from here 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.420
 but yes and everything falls like bomber and 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.459
 explode well now it will explode because 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.140
 I did not see water but in this case instead of 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.209
 put water as make is whether 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.519
 longer and put two lava blocks 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.530
 as in this case it's worth because two and one 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.680
 why think what 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.599
 that the gravel when it falls 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.219
 you can pass the following thing you should 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.230
 of staying a block so that we 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.579
 let's put on the one now it will happen 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.530
 this will stay and they recorded the 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.049
 we will burn to put two depth 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.370
 of the water is worth it well let's fix 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.540
 all this and we are going to build it the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.010
 materials that we will use to build 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.620
 this transfer the following are these 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.989
 three basic and then we can choose 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.609
 the floor we want is worth or combine 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.040
 I know a lot in this case I use 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.439
 gravel as you want spots and as not 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.329
 it looks like a more decorative path and 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.040
 well first we will have to create a 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.680
 surface where we want to make the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.239
 trap in this case chosen 13 by 3 a 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.519
 surface nine square blocks worth 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.709
 and well the first thing we have to do 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.750
 it's a pretty deep hole 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.459
 because because in this way the lava 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.469
 our the so close the tnt these maps 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.090
 before in the trials if the lava is 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.450
 quite close the tnt has it three 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.569
 understands alone knows yes it is clear now if 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.769
 you fall on the ground and can ruin the 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.230
 trap like that is what we have to do 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.730
 is to do this that is quite deep 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.840
 it does not matter the depth because we do not 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.419
 we are going to hurt because as 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.430
 we know the aba is a fluid and when 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.810
 we fall into a minecraft fluid but we 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.920
 we do fall damage so it's the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.660
 foolishness 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.300
 but deep enough to 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.920
 that the lava can not ignite the tnt a 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.690
 depth for example of blocks or 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.209
 something like this I do not know how much is the radio 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.920
 of propagation of the lava and well we do 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.630
 the hole once the hole is made 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.920
 we are going to place the tnt block in the 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.390
 tnt block we will place it where 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.860
 We want all this surface can 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.569
 be in the middle on a side where 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.910
 we want in this case what to put in the 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.970
 medium and we 're going to put it so that there are 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.440
 that putting it at this point is worth a 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.959
 block below where the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.130
 sand is worth and above we will make good the 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.680
 sand or anything that goes to 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.060
 to fall on top we put the block well 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.410
 now we have to go down and put all 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.010
 this surface here full of posters 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.810
 in this way we put like this and so and so 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.460
 we fill everything with posters when 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.620
 we can remember that they make up the poster 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.750
 on a poster in this way we have 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.190
 put this square here also talk 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.930
 of that because it can be quite useful 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.580
 so that you do not eat the coconut we can 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.919
 put posters on top of posters 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.960
 quite erring and it's okay we have to 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.720
 the surface made in area as how 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.030
 see no longer falls the the gravel of 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.950
 moca and how are we going to observe and be able to 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.960
 be to cover the floor 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.420
 Perfect for sewing to place the plate 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.620
 of pressure and we can already we can leave 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.780
 This is so, but of course this remains 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.890
 very very suspicious so what are we going 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.330
 to do is for example we are in the 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.090
 world resources for example the being 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.110
 barcelona minecraft we want to bring 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.300
 someone we make a metal dor and 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.590
 we make a tail so that and we do 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.120
 as well as if it were a house worth I'm not going to 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.340
 make a house but for you to do 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.670
 an idea the mechanism is not done yet 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.680
 Well , it looked like sorry guys 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.000
 forgot to put this so important good and 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.680
 if we want the person to die we have 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.600
 that putting two depth of water is 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.600
 say put it instead of putting it here that 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.190
 put it here up here is worth what 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.500
 we cover is almost the same as it is 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.570
 well and we can completely cover the 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.400
 trap and the trap is now ready to 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.350
 We are experienced users to a house 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.390
 well here is only the framework of the 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.370
 door but good to the house we go to 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.810
 enter and well we can see to simple 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.760
 view that is a pressure plate and that 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.980
 that's so that it opens not but when 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.100
 this happens we fall and everything falls to the 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.750
 lava and then explodes and good the person 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.770
 it will be lava cream and if not it will kill it 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.380
 The expression 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.270
 Y 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.760
 that is the mechanism or our trap of 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.100
 rest is quite simple to make a 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.050
 little complicated by the mere fact that 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.100
 we lose the objects good yes but the 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.280
 objects forever we can not 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.810
 recovering them was not like the trap of the 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.640
 fall that we can recover them with 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.230
 young but in this case do not try with 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.840
 the hop is work because of the problem of that 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.310
 is that he does not kill him because of not good fall 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.110
 Well, this is the trap 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.760
 useful and good I hope you like yourself 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.860
 of tutorial you already know you liked it and 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.090
