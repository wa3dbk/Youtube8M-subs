let's<00:00:16.039> have<00:00:16.129> a<00:00:16.219> look<00:00:16.250> and<00:00:16.580> see<00:00:16.610> if<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.480> tech

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
let's have a look and see if the tech

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.910 
let's have a look and see if the tech
last<00:00:18.050> x<00:00:18.380> 10<00:00:18.680> HD<00:00:19.100> 3g<00:00:19.970> can<00:00:20.420> run<00:00:20.660> them<00:00:20.840> now<00:00:21.770> these

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
last x 10 HD 3g can run them now these

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.330 
last x 10 HD 3g can run them now these
samples<00:00:22.310> are<00:00:22.400> taken<00:00:22.640> off<00:00:22.970> my<00:00:23.000> note<00:00:23.450> 4<00:00:24.160> so<00:00:25.160> the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
samples are taken off my note 4 so the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.230 
samples are taken off my note 4 so the
photos<00:00:25.730> here<00:00:26.000> are<00:00:27.250> 16<00:00:28.250> megapixel<00:00:28.880> i<00:00:29.000> want

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
photos here are 16 megapixel i want

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.520 
photos here are 16 megapixel i want
quickly<00:00:29.420> show<00:00:29.690> the<00:00:29.810> photos<00:00:30.110> before<00:00:30.260> i<00:00:30.380> get

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
quickly show the photos before i get

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.209 
quickly show the photos before i get
into<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.740> video<00:00:32.260> now<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:33.350> video<00:00:33.680> is<00:00:33.860> shot<00:00:34.040> in

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
into the video now this video is shot in

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.180 
into the video now this video is shot in
4k<00:00:34.989> so<00:00:35.989> if<00:00:36.289> you<00:00:36.410> do<00:00:36.589> have<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.829> 4k<00:00:37.070> monitor<00:00:39.190> you

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
4k so if you do have a 4k monitor you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.250 
4k so if you do have a 4k monitor you
can<00:00:40.370> take<00:00:40.609> advantage<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:41.149> that<00:00:42.789> and<00:00:44.050> run<00:00:45.050> it<00:00:45.140> in

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
can take advantage of that and run it in

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.410 
can take advantage of that and run it in
4k<00:00:45.679> so<00:00:46.429> you<00:00:46.489> can<00:00:46.640> see<00:00:46.820> that<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.030> screen<00:00:47.359> is

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
4k so you can see that the screen is

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.770 
4k so you can see that the screen is

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.379 

now<00:04:29.830> because<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.160> menu<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:30.639> small<00:04:30.910> yet<00:04:31.150> I

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
now because the menu is so small yet I

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.310 
now because the menu is so small yet I
or<00:04:31.660> need<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:32.380> use<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.620> mouse<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.900> menu<00:04:35.110> is

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
or need to use the mouse the menu is

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.870 
or need to use the mouse the menu is
tiny<00:04:35.590> because<00:04:35.889> windows<00:04:36.160> does<00:04:36.310> not<00:04:36.430> scale<00:04:36.669> that

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
tiny because windows does not scale that

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:45.960 
tiny because windows does not scale that
properly<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:38.020> our<00:04:38.260> load<00:04:38.669> an<00:04:39.669> image<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:45.790> can

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
properly so our load an image in you can

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.230 
properly so our load an image in you can
see<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.389> was<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.690> little<00:04:46.990> slow<00:04:47.440> in

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
see that that was a little slow in

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.950 
see that that was a little slow in
loading<00:04:49.620> but<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:51.580> does<00:04:51.880> work<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:52.360> apply<00:04:52.690> a

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
loading but it does work I apply a

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.280 
loading but it does work I apply a
filter<00:04:53.290> here<00:04:54.030> watch<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.210> applied<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:55.810> sharpen

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
filter here watch it applied is sharpen

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.879 
filter here watch it applied is sharpen
it<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:57.540> you'll<00:04:58.540> see<00:04:58.750> that<00:04:58.930> it's<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.620> little

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
it and you'll see that it's a little

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.770 
it and you'll see that it's a little
slow<00:05:00.160> but<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:01.810> has<00:05:02.199> sharpened<00:05:02.590> that
