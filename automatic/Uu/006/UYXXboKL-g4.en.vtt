00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
to make a run at Carmelo Anthony I think

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.250

this move is about all right I think

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.170 
this move is about all right I think
that<00:01:14.689> is<00:01:14.840> about<00:01:15.080> staying<00:01:15.710> in<00:01:15.920> Miami<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:16.700> don't

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
the way that's gonna do they might end

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.530 
the way that's gonna do they might end
up<00:01:21.260> opting<00:01:21.830> out<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.490> take<00:01:22.730> less<00:01:23.000> money<00:01:23.030> so

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
this do they think I think the writing

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.260 
this do they think I think the writing
on<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.290> wall<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.920> saying<00:01:46.190> that<00:01:46.520> they're<00:01:47.060> going

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
on the wall is saying that they're going

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.690 
on the wall is saying that they're going
to<00:01:47.390> try<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.570> make<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.870> run<00:01:47.960> at<00:01:48.110> Carmelo<00:01:48.830> they

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
to try to make a run at Carmelo they

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.219 
to try to make a run at Carmelo they
have<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.090> give<00:01:50.210> up<00:01:50.360> some<00:01:50.510> money<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.840> make<00:01:51.020> room

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
have to give up some money to make room

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.530 
have to give up some money to make room
for<00:01:51.290> Carmelo<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.700> think<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.479> is

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
for Carmelo and this I think this is

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.290 
for Carmelo and this I think this is
what<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.900> is<00:01:54.020> all<00:01:54.320> right<00:01:55.310> but<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:55.909> think<00:01:56.270> that

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
what it is all right but I think that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.510 
what it is all right but I think that
Carmelo<00:01:56.900> speaking<00:01:57.409> on<00:01:57.500> Carmelo<00:01:57.860> opting<00:01:58.400> out

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
Carmelo speaking on Carmelo opting out

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.960 
Carmelo speaking on Carmelo opting out
of<00:01:59.320> the<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.799> Knicks<00:02:01.100> contract<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.700> think<00:02:01.880> the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970
