00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.080
 It has long been noted that by Easter people start 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.199
 prepare in advance harvested eggs and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.140
 hoard onion peel to exactly one 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.080
 day before the holiday be ready for painting 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.930
 it is better to use it of course 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.900
 onion peel since it is she 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.619
 is an environmentally friendly dye 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.290
 unlike toxic chemistry and everything is simple 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.579
 subtract him husks put in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.579
 a separate saucepan 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.390
 Now we do with you a little 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.180
 billet 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.890
 so that then it can be 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.260
 paint for this we take with you a piece 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.080
 cheesecloths pre cut 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.080
 parsley leaf sizes 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.530
 Now in this way 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.380
 put the egg on the leaf and put it on top 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.090
 one more leaf 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.290
 parsley 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.690
 the main thing here is to make the leaves 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.310
 parsley is very tight 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.790
 came in contact with the testicle otherwise drawing 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 it just wo n't work out now we 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.670
 neatly tying all this 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.050
 composition so that it is a cooking process 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.050
 didn't fall apart 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.560
 now we are turned out 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.240
 glasses neatly so as not to break 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.890
 put in this crafty husk 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.890
 how would I drown every testicle 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.200
 in the last stage we pour cold 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.430
 a little water pot 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.430
 exactly half 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:34.170
 boil for about three minutes after we 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.170
 get eggs and dry them on a newspaper 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.580
 but
