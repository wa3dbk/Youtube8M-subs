I is<00:01:52.490> really<00:01:53.030> going<00:01:53.240> for<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.930> if<00:01:54.590> you're

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
I is really going for it and if you're

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.520 
I is really going for it and if you're
going<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:56.690> win<00:01:56.930> you're<00:01:57.200> going<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.380> really

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
going to to win you're going to really

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.620 
going to to win you're going to really
need<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.860> maximize<00:01:58.400> your<00:01:58.550> lap<00:01:58.700> time<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.210> every

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
need to maximize your lap time to every

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.930 
need to maximize your lap time to every
lap<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.680> course<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.700> lot<00:02:01.820> more

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
lap and of course it's a lot more

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.210 
lap and of course it's a lot more
challenging<00:02:02.150> now<00:02:02.600> in<00:02:02.810> terms<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.530> new

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
challenging now in terms of the new

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.410 
challenging now in terms of the new
physics<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:04.729> have<00:02:04.850> been<00:02:05.000> implemented

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
physics that have been implemented

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.270 
physics that have been implemented
that's<00:02:06.050> not<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.440> say<00:02:06.590> they're<00:02:06.800> perfect

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
that's not to say they're perfect

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.680 
that's not to say they're perfect
there's<00:02:07.430> always<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> work<00:02:07.970> in<00:02:08.000> progress<00:02:08.420> but

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
there's always a work in progress but

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.359 
there's always a work in progress but
there's<00:02:08.990> certainly<00:02:09.320> development<00:02:09.920> been<00:02:10.130> made

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
there's certainly development been made

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.460 
there's certainly development been made
I<00:02:10.610> think<00:02:11.240> it<00:02:11.480> shows<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:11.750> after<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.200> few<00:02:12.260> years

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
I think it shows that after a few years

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.100 
I think it shows that after a few years
of<00:02:12.680> codemasters<00:02:13.340> f1<00:02:13.570> they've<00:02:14.570> put<00:02:14.750> together<00:02:14.840> a

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
of codemasters f1 they've put together a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.130 
of codemasters f1 they've put together a
really<00:02:15.290> solid<00:02:15.650> title<00:02:16.420> I've<00:02:17.420> come<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.720> long<00:02:17.930> way

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
really solid title I've come a long way

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.080 
really solid title I've come a long way
from<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.530> early<00:02:18.770> f1<00:02:19.130> games<00:02:19.430> I'll<00:02:19.670> show<00:02:19.850> those

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
from the early f1 games I'll show those

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.330 
from the early f1 games I'll show those
in<00:02:20.270> another<00:02:20.540> video<00:02:20.720> when<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.110> talk<00:02:21.350> about<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.830> as

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
in another video when I talk about it as

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.010 
in another video when I talk about it as
we<00:02:22.550> go<00:02:22.580> round<00:02:22.910> down<00:02:23.209> into<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.690> tunnel<00:02:26.020> through

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
we go round down into the tunnel through

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.449 
we go round down into the tunnel through
the<00:02:27.080> tunnel<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.590> course<00:02:27.800> let's<00:02:28.010> hope<00:02:28.160> on<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
the tunnel of course let's hope on the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.920 
the tunnel of course let's hope on the
new<00:02:28.580> version<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.060> they<00:02:29.209> do<00:02:29.270> away<00:02:29.660> with<00:02:29.690> this

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
new version so they do away with this

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.650 
new version so they do away with this
silly<00:02:30.170> banking<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.920> doesn't<00:02:31.190> really<00:02:31.340> exist

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
silly banking that doesn't really exist

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.800 
silly banking that doesn't really exist
we<00:02:32.660> don't<00:02:32.810> need<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:34.910> either<00:02:35.030> way<00:02:35.330> looks

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
we don't need that but either way looks

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.420 
we don't need that but either way looks
fantastic<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:36.860> look<00:02:37.070> forward<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.340> seeing

fantastic and I look forward to seeing

fantastic and I look forward to seeing
what<00:02:37.910> codemasters<00:02:38.570> can<00:02:38.720> put<00:02:38.870> together<00:02:39.020> next

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
what codemasters can put together next

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.790 
what codemasters can put together next
year<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:40.340> know<00:02:40.489> improved<00:02:41.330> visuals<00:02:41.800> again

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800

further refinements on the physics and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.000 
handling how it's all going to work
perhaps<00:02:47.300> return<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.140> classic<00:02:48.530> cars<00:02:48.770> I'm

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
perhaps return the classic cars I'm

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.810 
perhaps return the classic cars I'm
expecting<00:02:49.660> as<00:02:50.660> long<00:02:50.930> along<00:02:51.350> with<00:02:51.550> God<00:02:52.550> find

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
the octusi perfect TV replays so there's

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.610 
the octusi perfect TV replays so there's
lots<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.510> little<00:02:56.690> features<00:02:57.110> in<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.410> game<00:02:57.590> that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
lots of little features in the game that

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.100 
lots of little features in the game that
we'd<00:02:57.890> like<00:02:58.070> to<00:02:58.220> see<00:02:58.430> improved<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.750> put<00:02:59.900> back

we'd like to see improved and put back
in<00:03:00.350> certainly<00:03:01.070> codemasters<00:03:01.940> have<00:03:02.030> got<00:03:02.209> all

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
in certainly codemasters have got all

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.240 
in certainly codemasters have got all
the<00:03:02.450> ideas<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.230> resource<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.890> do<00:03:04.040> that

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
the ideas and the resource to do that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.080 
the ideas and the resource to do that
now<00:03:04.430> one<00:03:04.700> would<00:03:04.880> expect<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.640> far<00:03:07.910> they've

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
now one would expect so so far they've

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.729 
now one would expect so so far they've
done<00:03:08.299> their<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.660> think<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.080> pretty<00:03:09.230> solid<00:03:09.470> job

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
done their I think a pretty solid job

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.710 
done their I think a pretty solid job
and<00:03:09.920> I've<00:03:09.980> really<00:03:10.370> enjoyed<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.850> visually

enjoying it enjoyed it a great deal and

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.050 
enjoying it enjoyed it a great deal and
I'll<00:03:31.450> play<00:03:31.629> it<00:03:31.719> a<00:03:31.870> great<00:03:32.079> deal<00:03:32.319> as<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.430> go<00:03:33.700> move

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
I'll play it a great deal as I go move

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.449 
I'll play it a great deal as I go move
on<00:03:34.239> after<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:35.079> my<00:03:35.290> extended<00:03:35.739> races<00:03:36.250> so

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
on after this to my extended races so

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.300 
on after this to my extended races so
you<00:03:36.519> will<00:03:36.790> see<00:03:36.819> some<00:03:37.269> longer<00:03:37.569> races<00:03:38.189> and<00:03:39.189> I'll

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
you will see some longer races and I'll

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.910 
you will see some longer races and I'll
commentate<00:03:39.879> those<00:03:40.120> as<00:03:40.390> well<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.739> can<00:03:41.829> hear

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
commentate those as well so you can hear

a wonderful flows of course it was

to be not supposed to see his level of
dick<00:04:53.380> but<00:04:53.590> I<00:04:53.680> am<00:04:53.830> noticing<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:55.180> you

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
dick but I am noticing it and you

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.120 
dick but I am noticing it and you
actually<00:04:55.750> notice<00:04:56.199> it<00:04:56.349> in<00:04:56.409> just<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.680> moment<00:04:57.039> I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
actually notice it in just a moment I

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.050 
actually notice it in just a moment I
think<00:04:57.310> we<00:04:57.400> go<00:04:57.520> down<00:04:57.729> to<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:59.940> tunnel<00:05:00.940> I'd

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
think we go down to the the tunnel I'd

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.430 
think we go down to the the tunnel I'd
come<00:05:01.240> at<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.479> time<00:05:01.659> on<00:05:01.780> posture<00:05:02.110> swimming

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
come at the time on posture swimming

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.430 
come at the time on posture swimming
pool<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:02.949> actually<00:05:03.490> hear<00:05:03.669> the<00:05:03.849> tires

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
pool and you actually hear the tires

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.570 
pool and you actually hear the tires
around<00:05:05.440> each<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.860> tunnel<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:06.310> I'm<00:05:06.370> already

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
around each of the tunnel so I'm already

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.490 
around each of the tunnel so I'm already
feeling<00:05:06.970> like<00:05:07.210> there's<00:05:07.449> a<00:05:07.539> big<00:05:07.720> loss<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:08.229> grip

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
feeling like there's a big loss of grip

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.129 
feeling like there's a big loss of grip
now<00:05:08.800> for<00:05:09.070> me<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.370> find<00:05:10.060> first<00:05:10.479> lap<00:05:10.750> you've<00:05:10.990> got

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
now for me I find first lap you've got

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.570 
now for me I find first lap you've got
to<00:05:11.229> get<00:05:11.320> a<00:05:11.380> bit<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.620> temperature<00:05:12.159> in<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.340> tires

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
to get a bit of temperature in the tires

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.029 
to get a bit of temperature in the tires
second<00:05:13.510> third<00:05:13.690> lap<00:05:13.930> tires<00:05:14.380> are<00:05:14.620> perfect

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
second third lap tires are perfect

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.310 
second third lap tires are perfect
halfway<00:05:15.789> through<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.240> fourth<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.930> tires<00:05:17.169> are

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
halfway through the fourth the tires are

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.689 
halfway through the fourth the tires are
falling<00:05:17.650> off<00:05:17.740> while<00:05:17.979> we<00:05:18.099> in<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.340> fifth<00:05:18.520> it's

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
falling off while we in the fifth it's

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:19.999 
falling off while we in the fifth it's
quite<00:05:18.940> a<00:05:18.970> struggle<00:05:19.270> so

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
quite a struggle so

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.489 
quite a struggle so
you<00:05:20.789> see<00:05:20.939> the<00:05:21.059> car<00:05:21.539> already<00:05:21.659> slidin<00:05:22.110> there

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:22.499 
you see the car already slidin there

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.859 
you see the car already slidin there
when<00:05:22.619> we<00:05:22.740> hit<00:05:22.979> the<00:05:23.699> curbing<00:05:24.330> see<00:05:24.689> another

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:24.869 
when we hit the curbing see another

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:27.019 
when we hit the curbing see another
example<00:05:25.349> on<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.979> breaking<00:05:26.490> after<00:05:26.939> the
