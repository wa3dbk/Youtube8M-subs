00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
antenna here the thickness has increased

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.089 
antenna here the thickness has increased
significantly<00:02:12.090> which<00:02:12.950> increases<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
significantly which increases the

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.130 
significantly which increases the
overall<00:02:14.129> durability<00:02:14.879> of<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.450> unit<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:15.930> we

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
overall durability of the unit if we

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.680 
overall durability of the unit if we
look<00:02:16.290> at<00:02:16.439> the<00:02:16.560> 220

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
look at the 220

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.010 
look at the 220
it<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.410> very<00:02:18.740> very<00:02:19.040> thin<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:20.720> easily

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
it is very very thin and it's easily

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.340 
it is very very thin and it's easily
damaged<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.180> very<00:02:23.390> soft<00:02:23.720> too

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
damaged and and it's very soft too

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.050 
damaged and and it's very soft too
so<00:02:25.180> overall<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.660> Astra<00:02:27.200> 320<00:02:27.910> provides<00:02:28.910> a

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
so overall the Astra 320 provides a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.770 
so overall the Astra 320 provides a
major<00:02:29.390> improvement<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.940> hardware<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
major improvement and hardware and the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.620 
major improvement and hardware and the
appearance<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:34.550> additional<00:02:35.360> software

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630

features<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.650> app<00:02:37.520> customization<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.630> will

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
features and app customization that will

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.820 
features and app customization that will
be<00:02:39.800> covered<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.370> different<00:02:40.400> video
