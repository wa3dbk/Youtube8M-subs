00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.009
My name is Karl-Heinz Maier, I am a biologist and I am teaching at the medical academy in Stuttgart.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:24.600
I want to introduce to you our new poster
on the digestive system which has never been introduced to the world.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:35.900
We managed to combine the departments of anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology and present it in a general
overview.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:46.400
On the left side of the poster-system is a healthy digestive
tract shown and on the right side a digestive tract with the important diseases that exist here.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:55.400
To get a better overview, we have organized
our poster system vertically and horizontally.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.500
The first column describes the anatomy that
is the structure of the individual organs.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.100
In the second column presented the physiology that is the processes which happens to digest food.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.500
The third column concerns with the pathology, there the disease is described.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.300
In the fourth and last column is the pharmacology specified what medications are prescribed for the particular disease.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.680
In addition, our poster is still divided horizontally, that means if someone, for example, is particularly

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.700
interested in the stomach, he can read here
the structure (anatomy), the functioning (physiology),

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.000
the disease (pathology) of the stomach and
the medication, which are used for the treatment.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:56.939
For example, a doctor could explain his patient,
where the gallstones are situated and what

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.149
problems they could cause when these gallstones
separate. They probably would hang there and

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:08.149
cause a backlog on the gallbladder and pancreas.
Thus, the patient would understand what disease

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.410
he has and would be glad that the doctor explained
this to him.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.410
A further feature of our poster-system is
the exchangeability of the fourth column.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.110
Here pharmaceuticals companies could bring
in their medication whether it is conventional

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.530
medicine or naturopathic medications or overall
all therapies could be brought in.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.290
Overall, it can be said that our poster system
has many advantages over conventional posters on the market.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.080
These are:

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.000
1. the interdisciplinary overview.
2. the holistic representation.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.100
3. several departments are combined.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.100
4. that our poster significantly improves learning process Conclusion.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.100
We accomplished an easy to understand postersystem.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.010
We accomplished an easy to understand postersystem.
