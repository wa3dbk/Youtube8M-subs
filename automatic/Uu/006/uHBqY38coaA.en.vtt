00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.900
 there was only a week early developer a week late 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.199
 i don't know places 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.460
 that stand there you would say today this is top swallow and this market 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.739
 it is namely the kicks km s 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.259
 to be the fastest and most busy 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.780
 with 550 hp towards 40 hp more than the normal work 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.790
 but that not only there is also a piece out of the tent 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.080
 and there is a lot thicker than that lower at the asphalt 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.800
 in addition, more the back 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.810
 I can my own back there is a training 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.810
 is that it could go a lot lighter as quickly as possible 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.600
 to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.639
 we 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:50.850
 from 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.390
 do it too 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.390
 a 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 after 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.780
 the company that, however, was not only known for sportiness Saturday for 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.050
 its convoy sophistication it's actually been around since the army demands that 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.560
 time for time certain lightning struck I am very curious how that 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.780
 with this from the swiss union for me and sportiness 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.470
 after the first answer you actually get more than it is state 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.470
 before that there are lightweight traces from the past 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.770
 here but this is nothing beautiful infotainment system learn the start already 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.380
 a lot of it so yes that's for each other but we knew that you will forget 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.270
 Immediately fight gas 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 to hear 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.030
 this 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.030
 they blame 550 hp 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.090
 but that's not the only thing from that 680 internet a couple 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.300
 owner 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.300
 he pulls the staff the traffic is not normal 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.639
 and 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.570
 one after the other 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.589
 handling and steering 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.739
 but the old is not only lay by the ground also suspension and damping are there 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.659
 made and the weel chemistry is adjusted 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.959
 but the result is really incredibly good when driving a car 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.299
 once smoked a lot 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.519
 add the power on the rear wheels 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.519
 just before that by the frost 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:44.569
 it is always listening soft side you can really come with the gas pedal 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.409
 were just him 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.409
 little changed from the united states 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.549
 enne 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.889
 but despite that she wants to have achieved them 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.149
 really razor sharp is the chassis not to sit still inside 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.149
 restraint 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.019
 like your used band trainer 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.529
 so I'm actually very curious what it says on 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:20.959
 a quarter 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.479
 we have to 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.870
 it says it's also time for the first time in ijmuiden oirschot 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.349
 how much sharper and direct it is, but still that little bit of restraint 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.359
 and the chassis 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.829
 the couple is very well off 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.889
 but that gives just that trust and the municipality itself in each other 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.109
 refuse 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.809
 I have here too, although it seems that the decision with which I can do anything 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:07.439
 change the price 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.499
 PSP throttle response but it really is 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.679
 circumstances and then the proft is also true 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.829
 very nice as it is 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.299
 actually in the first set is a hit 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.660
 yes there you come naturally because switching in the past and it takes it 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.659
 not about status but working for the rest and doing nothing about it 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.039
 nec 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.979
 so if you ask me, he says 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.219
 yes all pain actually 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.399
 this is the ultimate gentleman she said with a very long list 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.060
 Yes 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.100
 a
