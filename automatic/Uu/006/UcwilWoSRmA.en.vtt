 whiten our preparation that's why 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.039
 we say whitewashed 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.900
 to have the mixture bleached he become 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.440
 a little clearer me to add the 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.670

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.780
 little chinese working behind 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.640
 the screen game subcontractors portal not 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.580

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.580
 the Chinese from the corner of fuilla have

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.140
 soon 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.120
 we suffered well the preparation of the dough 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.700
 by tapping very strongly on the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.540
 table and I can 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.540
 bake at 240 ° his mentors 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.049
 we always leave the elves awake more 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.000
 than wait 5 minutes and after we go 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.980
 lower the oven to 200 ° and wait 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.469
 another 10 minutes which I do not 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.049
 could you come see I believe these 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:51.870

 that it's the best madeleine or 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.730
 so very complicated training without 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.750

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.959
 hop on is madeleine but the small side 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.049
 blistered on the top this is more 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.049
