outside<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.720> Haleiwa<00:02:52.990> Harbor<00:02:53.520> therefore<00:02:54.520> on

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
outside the Haleiwa Harbor therefore on

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.100 
outside the Haleiwa Harbor therefore on

larger swells you may find yourself

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.660 
larger swells you may find yourself
being<00:02:56.350> pulled<00:02:56.560> right<00:02:56.650> back<00:02:56.800> into<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.310> impact

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
how hard you paddle so don't fall off if

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.520 
how hard you paddle so don't fall off if
you're<00:03:01.270> on<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.450> first<00:03:01.690> wave<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.020> set<00:03:02.230> or<00:03:02.440> you

you're on the first wave the set or you
may<00:03:02.710> be<00:03:02.740> taking<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.220> beating<00:03:03.370> over<00:03:03.640> that
