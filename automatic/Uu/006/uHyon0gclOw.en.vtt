outward<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:30.730> get<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.000> even<00:02:31.270> with<00:02:31.390> his<00:02:31.510> arm

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.390 

you<00:02:38.410> don't<00:02:38.590> have<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.770> worry<00:02:38.950> about<00:02:39.040> every

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
you don't have to worry about every

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.380 
you don't have to worry about every
detail<00:02:39.690> but<00:02:41.730> that's<00:02:42.730> all<00:02:42.910> I'm<00:02:42.970> not<00:02:43.090> doing<00:02:43.360> that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
detail but that's all I'm not doing that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:55.880 
detail but that's all I'm not doing that
so<00:02:44.819> get<00:02:45.819> it<00:02:45.970> lined<00:02:46.300> up<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:52.770> no

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
whole way off his arm selective vertice

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.160 
whole way off his arm selective vertice
size<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.290> down<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:37.150> looks<00:03:37.360> good<00:03:37.630> it's<00:03:37.959> like

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
size it down that looks good it's like

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:48.690 
size it down that looks good it's like
the<00:03:38.349> vertices<00:03:38.910> down<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:47.410> all<00:03:48.010> this<00:03:48.160> one<00:03:48.400> don't

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
the vertices down and all this one don't

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.520 
the vertices down and all this one don't
make<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.090> small<00:03:49.450> just<00:03:49.780> make<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:50.140> kind<00:03:50.380> of

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
make it a small just make it kind of

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.580 
make it a small just make it kind of
small<00:03:50.769> okay<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:52.000> looks<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.420> lot<00:03:52.600> better<00:03:52.780> now

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
small okay that looks a lot better now

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.140 
small okay that looks a lot better now
let's<00:03:53.769> all<00:03:53.920> kind<00:03:54.130> of<00:03:54.250> look<00:03:54.400> stupid<00:03:54.790> pointing

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
let's all kind of look stupid pointing

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.720 
let's all kind of look stupid pointing
the<00:03:55.359> way<00:03:55.650> pointing<00:03:56.650> up<00:03:56.829> like<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.519> just

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
the way pointing up like it is so just

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.539 
the way pointing up like it is so just
take<00:03:57.910> these<00:03:58.060> vertices<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:59.440> just<00:04:00.310> move<00:04:00.519> that

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
take these vertices and just move that

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.979 
take these vertices and just move that
and<00:04:01.480> down<00:04:01.980> okay<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.130> looks<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.370> lot<00:04:03.489> better

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
and down okay that looks a lot better

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.620 
and down okay that looks a lot better
now<00:04:04.989> we'll<00:04:05.230> move<00:04:05.350> on<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.859> legs<00:04:06.630> underwater

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
now we'll move on to the legs underwater

is<00:04:48.949> it<00:04:49.130> out<00:04:49.449> this<00:04:50.449> is<00:04:50.630> how<00:04:50.750> i'm<00:04:50.960> doing<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:51.410> shoe

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
is it out this is how i'm doing a shoe

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.800 
is it out this is how i'm doing a shoe
you<00:04:51.919> don't<00:04:52.100> have<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.490> do<00:04:53.030> it<00:04:53.150> like<00:04:53.300> this<00:04:53.419> like

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
you don't have to do it like this like

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.750 
you don't have to do it like this like
you<00:04:53.990> can<00:04:54.139> add<00:04:54.290> another<00:04:54.620> object<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.430> work<00:04:55.580> from

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
you can add another object and work from

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.360 
you can add another object and work from
it<00:04:56.000> let's<00:04:56.960> needs<00:04:57.199> i<00:04:57.560> want<00:04:57.979> this<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.220> go<00:04:58.340> a

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
it let's needs i want this to go a

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.600 
it let's needs i want this to go a
little<00:04:58.490> faster<00:04:58.970> i'm<00:04:59.300> gonna<00:04:59.449> do<00:04:59.600> it<00:04:59.720> this<00:05:00.020> way

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
little faster i'm gonna do it this way

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.420 
little faster i'm gonna do it this way
so<00:05:01.610> these<00:05:01.729> vertices<00:05:02.060> moving<00:05:02.660> back<00:05:03.340> like<00:05:04.340> this

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
so these vertices moving back like this

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.830 
so these vertices moving back like this
percy<00:05:04.880> move<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.180> back<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:07.310> we've<00:05:08.300> cut<00:05:08.600> it<00:05:09.639> like

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
percy move it back and we've cut it like

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.120 
percy move it back and we've cut it like
that<00:05:11.840> now<00:05:12.620> take<00:05:13.280> this<00:05:13.400> vertice<00:05:14.830> these<00:05:15.830> road<00:05:16.010> is

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
that now take this vertice these road is

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.180 
that now take this vertice these road is
easily<00:05:16.639> back<00:05:17.260> get<00:05:18.260> that<00:05:18.290> straight<00:05:18.889> with<00:05:19.070> the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
easily back get that straight with the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.360
