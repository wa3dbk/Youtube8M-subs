00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.520
 great fighters with you three yeah well 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:28.079
 finally wait for the guys I saddled 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.660
 Ferdinand very much I did not want it if 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.809
 honestly resisted in my soul 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.950
 there was always a battle between good and evil 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.079
 inside of me 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.449
 yin yang and fought sit on ferdinand 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.149
 do not sit down 5 by suffer not sadists 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.219
 turn gray but still of course 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.420
 your requests guys I could not miss 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.539
 past so with tears in his eyes, I also 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.780
 McCall time after time a button in the battle and here 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.510
 you a small sketch of the random house immediately 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.350
 I will say that you are supernatural 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.750
 you will not see just this pain turned out 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.240
 so very interesting in terms of what 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.430
 in this fight, absolutely everything to each other 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.890
 and I was not an exception but 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.890
 spoiler enough let's move on to our 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.490
 grab points we took our position in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.189
 squared a6 and what we see there is that 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.270
 bots migrate from the bottom of the map up 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.310
 they run across the track happily smoking 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.460
 but nevertheless we have seen and in 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.130
 sight pulemetik I mean someone from 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.630
 heavy tank marker which just 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.759
 glowed on the road in h5 square she 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.700
 it means someone will be here soon 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.549
 shines again but I can't 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.310
 to identify 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.079
 the driver of this car that is to say 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.270
 tank itself I can not the only thing that I 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.399
 I realized that this is some kind of Soviet hard 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.100
 tank why because again we 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.520
 saw with you a machine gun dshk shichko which 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.420
 It stands on the turrets, that is, this is either out of 4 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.410
 either it is from 3 so so so it seems like 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.120
 someone appears someone somewhere something 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.660
 these marker gone sick he's somewhere 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.660
 rested 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.190
 she came out of 4 we are aiming hatch 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.370
 shot by them 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.040
 64 guys we have already done a lot in 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.230
 this battle, even if we are now struck 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.330
 lightning we exchanged for Isa the fourth 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.150
 guys this is a big and serious blow to 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.130
 enemy team but we are with you 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.130
 we understand that we have a chance to take more 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.990
 someone and here cracker without risking to shoot 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.530
 through the tree because yah nafig them 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.560
 therefore, in the lari board and drying 100 lavika in 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.020
 I had a rim of my ammunition 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.690
 nice to talk with you see that 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.300
 the a6 square is our heavy tank 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.230
 which we and we forge that she is there all 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.180

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.450
 save him help she see what kind of 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.700
 as in the center there is nobody in the passage between 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.130
 there is no one with stones according to us 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.490
 it is worth taking a position there and that's behind it 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.030
 Here is a white beautiful stone to keep 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.190
 defense and maybe shoot those who 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.860
 will move far and move 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.080
 there will be at least one IS-3 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.980
 which both stretch marks a and destroyed 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.170

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.650
 driver plus the fire was well 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.570

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.140
 caterpillar and attention guys on damage 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.769

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.380
 the transmission is black but she doesn't 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:14.100
 repaired this was the beginning guys 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.799
 of the end so that you understand ours now and without 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.250
 addition maneuverable over maneuverable 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.940
 Ferdinand aki ninja yes now ko 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.190
 everything else ceased to rotate at all 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.960
 we are now playing cosplay train 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.330
 that is, we chukh-chukh in 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.430
 we go ahead because of 3 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.380
 shot out 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.539
 we shot him killed the commander through 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.199
 turret let's there 130 millimeters 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:43.530
 just dock the subcaliber charged 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.889
 no podkaliber this insidious and we 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.340
 sent straight to the hole 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.280
 because the guy is us and and frankly 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.759
 Framed thanks to him for the extra frag already 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.830
 on two players I stress we exchanged 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.250
 that is, we killed two heavy tanks 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.380
 so I think our guys will win 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.620
 the more we have and mousey all on 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.590
 in the light and here it seems like from 3 2 that was wrong 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.710
 sort of shot out did not break through with me but 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.080

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:21.090

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.750
 I do not see to understand 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.889
