00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.820
 eh 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.010
 Ah 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.790
 I look Hello 8 this time it a little 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.460
 No way 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.460
 I 'm proud of that one as it has come 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.250
 From the research come true 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:26.330
 er 4 you do 4 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.960
 It is Do not price solder Let's here issues Well I 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.820
 I do around 30,000 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.150
 Or let a little up Huh 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.150
 I can do something good like this 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.610
 Yes, it's called the manual after the manual 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.450
 This to say 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.460
 Shot in the ear 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.350
 It is part of the chip that snow connected to anything in's finger 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.449
 Another Now it has I do not see a little Well I am three types It is E'Oh castle 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:01.030
 I will go to three types behind 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:04.480
 Sound insulation that do not hear you toe around and inserted until this Sad to say it is in pretty deep in Japan 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.300
 It is an excellent earphone 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.130
 Much each 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.180
 Well then the actual earphones 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.180
 I want to try 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.840
 Hey ! 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.250
 This is 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.140
 It is Yes 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:27.620
 Here it is located in the jack in the unit of the person who goes out of the sound 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.270
 Cable money is quite long, maybe it's like lightning 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.870
 There is about 1.5m a 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.130
 It's a cable It's a cable braid . 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.250
 It is quite a futon The cable that comes with the ipod is pretty soft 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.250
 Ne 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.030
 But in comparison with that, it's a bit hard, isn't it? 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.740
 It's a little hard to understand mousse 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:54.720
 Because it is out in the middle metal fairly strong, it is a fan 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.990
 I think that neo it will be a little less 9 sound of grass waves men do better 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.890
 The most easy point to achieve here 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.890
 It is these three 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.110
 The three here are black and bent in the country . 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.190
 You are most concerned about the sound of the case 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.620
 I would like to hear a little actually sound 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:18.890
 I would like to hear from the included earphones that come with the ipod 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.890
 In fact , why not actually listen to the comfort women's notes of 4 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.209
 It is the sound of 2. A picture book with Aiko of the child 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:46.050
 Something Toka Na little bit in trouble when I hear always done place and this 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.920
 I think that the bass is a little strong, and I think that ipod's equalizer 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.380
 Be flat 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.430
 That's right 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.439
 It is not because or strong bass is strong or Kou 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.439
 It is this we have heard here 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:10.079
 You do not hear at all First I Oh sound around 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.079
 Well the sound of the needle will not be heard at all Start it with it Start 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.650
 Hmm 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.290
 Here and there 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.720
 It is amazing 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:29.660
 That's amazing 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:31.010
 Cola What do you do when you compare something to what you like and why you like it so much the whole thing 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:38.030
 Words 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.420
 I don't think on the top I can not concentrate on the surrounding noise and can concentrate on music because the sound insulation is high at first 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.480
 Ne 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.650
 If this 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.650
 What's next for you 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:53.580
 I can hear the sound I couldn't hear 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:57.270
 also hear amazing that you did not hear the Honda I have been supplied with the iphone 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.810
 Such a thing is a one-base hit like a that of this is 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.760
 As an ugly phrase that these four characteristics of that 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.909
 That's right 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.800
 Loan rate of Nante recall the sound is amazing high 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:14.840
 In also a messed up the attack and range in after 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.770
 People so that if sound came in, for example, great clean become want to come to Gokitsu encouragement This is absolutely your 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.489
 It is recommended 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.579
 Just want you to be careful It is part of the resistance to say that impedance 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:27.220
 Is high 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:29.750
 It is hard to come out of sound It is hard to come out of volume, so it's great when you listen using an amplifier 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.460
 It becomes easier to train in 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.670
 I think it will be easy to hear the all sound 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.110
 This is really illegal 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.440
 Nature that will 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.009
 dr 4 44 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.930
 This is not Japan, though it is not 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:50.919
 Very Come in this is so well-known company in the earphone meeting 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.919
