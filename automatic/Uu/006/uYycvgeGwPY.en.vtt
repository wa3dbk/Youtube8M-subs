which<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.579> open<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.180> Windows<00:00:40.140> Store<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
which is open and Windows Store one to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.619 
which is open and Windows Store one to
close<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.050> actually<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.420> hover<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
close it is actually you can hover it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.290 
close it is actually you can hover it
and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.980> Red<00:00:47.670> Cross<00:00:48.000> here

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and then you will see the Red Cross here

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.360 
and then you will see the Red Cross here
but<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> will<00:00:48.899> not<00:00:49.110> close<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.680> completely<00:00:49.829> it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
but it will not close it completely it

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.860 
but it will not close it completely it
will<00:00:50.520> still<00:00:50.850> run<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:52.289> past<00:00:52.710> manager<00:00:53.250> so

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
will still run in your past manager so

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.389 
will still run in your past manager so
the<00:00:54.870> advantage<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.070> close<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the advantage is that when you close it

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.240 
the advantage is that when you close it
just<00:00:57.120> close<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> go<00:00:58.920> back<00:00:59.129> again

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
just close it and then you go back again

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
just close it and then you go back again

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
reopen it it will just started

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.719 
reopen it it will just started
immediately<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.530> was<00:01:05.040> still<00:01:05.309> running

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729

task manager so as you can see here the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780 
task manager so as you can see here the
photos<00:01:54.930> application<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> store<00:01:56.280> are

photos application in the store are
actually<00:01:57.299> still<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.960> past<00:01:58.560> manager<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.759> was

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
actually still in past manager it was

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.980 
actually still in past manager it was
not<00:02:00.360> completely<00:02:01.340> closed<00:02:02.340> from<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.990> windows

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
not completely closed from you windows

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.370 
not completely closed from you windows
so<00:02:04.259> let's<00:02:04.829> really<00:02:05.579> close<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.329> close<00:02:07.200> it
