00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
look at this this plants like why

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.630 
look at this this plants like why
anywhere<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:42.310> nice<00:03:42.490> and<00:03:42.670> snug<00:03:44.070> not<00:03:45.070> cool

anywhere it's nice and snug not cool
I<00:03:45.990> don't<00:03:46.990> think<00:03:47.260> I'll<00:03:47.350> have<00:03:47.380> space<00:03:47.770> for

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
I don't think I'll have space for

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.850 
I don't think I'll have space for
anymore<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> little<00:03:48.580> bigger<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:50.530> it's<00:03:50.680> pretty

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
anymore a little bigger but it's pretty

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.660 
anymore a little bigger but it's pretty
snug<00:03:51.420> now<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.480> concept<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.530> this<00:03:53.890> method<00:03:54.520> is

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
snug now the concept of this method is

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.010 
snug now the concept of this method is
to<00:03:57.030> give<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.120> support<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:01.000> wherever<00:04:01.870> it's

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
to give it support and wherever it's

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.380 
to give it support and wherever it's
going<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.230> be<00:04:02.320> located<00:04:02.680> in<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.100> fish<00:04:03.310> tank

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
going to be located in the fish tank

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.130 
going to be located in the fish tank
because<00:04:04.390> if<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.570> just<00:04:04.690> plan<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:04.930> the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
because if you just plan it the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.780 
because if you just plan it the
traditional<00:04:05.290> way<00:04:05.709> in<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:05.950> traditional<00:04:06.220> way

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
traditional way in the traditional way

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.690 
traditional way in the traditional way
and<00:04:06.820> just<00:04:07.030> like<00:04:07.360> this<00:04:07.600> it's<00:04:08.590> just<00:04:08.860> gonna<00:04:09.489> get

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
and just like this it's just gonna get

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.820 
and just like this it's just gonna get
pushed<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.330> uprooted<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.260> this<00:04:11.530> is<00:04:11.650> gonna

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
pushed and uprooted and this is gonna

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.920 
pushed and uprooted and this is gonna
provide<00:04:12.070> some<00:04:12.280> support<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:13.000> little<00:04:13.630> Wiggy<00:04:13.780> is

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
provide some support the little Wiggy is

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.960 
provide some support the little Wiggy is
gonna<00:04:14.110> keep<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:14.410> in<00:04:14.470> place<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:15.040> get<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.760> nice

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
gonna keep it in place and get a nice

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.159 
gonna keep it in place and get a nice
little<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.900> guess<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:17.919> little<00:04:18.419> extra<00:04:19.419> elf<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:20.079> it
