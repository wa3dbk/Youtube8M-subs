you're going to get several recipes
sometimes<00:00:42.180> two<00:00:42.420> sometimes<00:00:42.450> four<00:00:43.110> sometimes

sometimes two sometimes four sometimes

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
sometimes two sometimes four sometimes
six<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.940> sure<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.300> get<00:00:45.600> higher<00:00:45.780> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
six I'm sure as you get higher and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.779 
six I'm sure as you get higher and
higher<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.500> gets<00:00:46.680> lower<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.340> lower<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
higher it just gets lower and lower and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.049 
higher it just gets lower and lower and
lower

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
lower

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.549 
lower
I<00:00:48.210> believe<00:00:48.809> level<00:00:49.469> 5<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.340> current<00:00:50.969> cap

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
I believe level 5 is the current cap

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.569 
I believe level 5 is the current cap
because<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> achievement<00:00:53.430> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
because that's what the achievement is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.369 
because that's what the achievement is
but<00:00:53.969> I'm<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.149> sure<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.539> haven't<00:00:54.809> got<00:00:55.110> enough

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
but I'm not sure I haven't got enough

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.090 
but I'm not sure I haven't got enough
money<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.800> spend<00:00:56.219> yet<00:00:57.410> anyways<00:00:58.410> once<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.949> get

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
down regardless so you can make weapons

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.350 
down regardless so you can make weapons
that<00:02:26.100> are<00:02:26.160> significantly<00:02:26.760> better<00:02:27.000> than<00:02:27.240> it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
that are significantly better than it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.450

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
says but the level required should

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.000 
says but the level required should
always<00:02:29.760> be<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.270> same<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.470> can<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.800> eat

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
always be the same and you can just eat

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.070 
always be the same and you can just eat
basically<00:02:32.310> making<00:02:32.940> these<00:02:33.060> bad<00:02:33.330> boys<00:02:33.570> until

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
basically making these bad boys until

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.650 
basically making these bad boys until
you<00:02:34.230> get<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.100> want<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:36.480> one's

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you get the one that you want this one's

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.930 
you get the one that you want this one's
even<00:02:36.750> thirty-five<00:02:37.620> that's<00:02:38.070> ridiculous

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
even thirty-five that's ridiculous

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.760 
even thirty-five that's ridiculous
so<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.990> can<00:02:40.140> keep<00:02:40.260> making<00:02:40.620> these

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
so you know you can keep making these

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.640 
so you know you can keep making these
this<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.910> believe<00:02:42.209> kind<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.959> replaces<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
this I believe kind of replaces the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.650 
this I believe kind of replaces the
gambling<00:02:44.130> system<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.730> had<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:45.000> Diablo<00:02:45.360> 2

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
gambling system that you had in Diablo 2

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.170 
gambling system that you had in Diablo 2
it<00:02:46.590> also<00:02:46.650> serves<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.370> purpose<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.910> keeping

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
it also serves a purpose of keeping

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.180 
it also serves a purpose of keeping
money<00:02:48.870> low<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:49.770> you're<00:02:49.950> going<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.130> be

money low because you're going to be

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.360 
money low because you're going to be
buying<00:02:50.450> and/or<00:02:51.480> not<00:02:51.900> selling<00:02:52.560> your<00:02:52.890> magic

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
buying and/or not selling your magic
