 you 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.660
 hello to all I am delighted to you 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.040
 find to start this evil we 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.480
 are in the Paris region for 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.280
 find lÃ©onard who is this 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.590
 called a master composter 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.150
 yes here in montreuil the inhabitants have 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.340
 decided to reconnect with the practice 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.360
 ancestral way of composting to enhance 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.360
 their bio waste follow me 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.620
 but if leonard hello enough enough 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.490
 unusual to find such a place in 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.739
 full urban area 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.690
 Can you explain to me your 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.260
 role what exactly is a master 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.600
 composter 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.360
 I'm here to teach people to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.489
 make compost when explaining that they 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.400
 have an opportunity to manufacture their 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.020
 own compost with all that is ugly 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.220
 piot of leaders and concretely these are 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.280
 what biowaste 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.080
 it is all that is vegetal or which is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.650
 degrade and so what can 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.430
 put exactly what is waste 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.580
 natural cooking and then all that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.530
 is garden waste with the exception of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.530
 some things in citrus subway 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.390
 to allow things too dry and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.700
 laure that these composters bring 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.740
 collectives to the inhabitants of montreuil 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.509
 people are happy to do their 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.180
 own compost and especially they go 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.830
 happen to reduce their waste in 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.570
 their garbage and well thank you 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.880
 many mister nana of nothing it is necessary 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.069
 note that in europe these are between 118 to 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.119
 138 million tonnes of biowaste 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.560
 are produced every year 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.660
 most come from industry 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.039
 food industry catering 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.490
 collective or large 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.560
 surfaces 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.330
 yes but so how to do that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.700
 these structures can value their 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.590
 bio waste production to know it 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.130
 direction south west of france in 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.770
 gironde 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.119
 aso that's exactly where if you were 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.340
 rallys two subsidiaries of suez 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.420
 environment have created a 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.420
 treatment of packaged biowaste 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.270
 nicolas jaquet hello you are so 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.340
 manager of valorisation channels 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.320
 at sita is what you can 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.670
 explain to me exactly the offer that 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.410
 offers sita to organic producers 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.750
 sita waste offers a complete offer 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.890
 bio waste that goes from the sorting guide 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.110
 up to product valuation 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.300
 while going through the training of 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.070
 producers and collection before the 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.840
 product valuation via a 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.220
 bioeconditioner is then from which 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.040
 producer is it exactly 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.660
 this offer is for the big and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.250
 medium surface all that is big 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.930
 distribution 1 industries 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.730
 agribusiness and catering 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.050
 and then what is the interest of 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.000
 producers to entrust you with their bio 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.400
 waste the interest of the producers of 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.950
 biowaste and triple in us 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.510
 their waste an economic benefit 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.670
 a regulatory advantage does not help 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.140
 Environmental Environmental 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.160
 the extent to which biowaste is 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.810
 100% valued 90% as an amendment 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.480
 organic and 10% for 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.440
 packaging for energy recovery 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.239
 regulatory because it allows them 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.070
 to respect the grenelle of 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.870
 the environment that requires sorting a 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.900
 recovery of biowaste and 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.180
 economic as far as confident 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.650
 their bio waste they will decrease their 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.350
 current waste disposal budgets 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.269
 and above all they will avoid the flight of 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.250
 elimination treatment costs in 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.080
 the coming years among others via 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.690
 the evolution of the general tax of 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.930
 polluting activities tgap that is brought 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.130
 to evolve according to the law of finance 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.130
 soon, thank you very much 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.489
 yes very good day it's you me 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.360
 responsible operating account and 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.739
 realistic on this site 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.390
 then do you explain to me 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.879
 a little bit of waste tracking 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.370
 to pack that happen here yes so the 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.799
 trucks that bring us bio-waste 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.870
 so are posed identified and oriented 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.939
 towards the biowaste platform which are 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.859
 taken over by chargers to feed 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.780
 a machine called 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.549
 bioeconditioner ra we hope it's 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.769
 biodeconditioner the biodeconditioner 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.150
 has for property therefore to separate the 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.829
 solid phase and the liquid phase 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.599
 that is to say the solid phase the 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.549
 waste conditioning and 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.340
 recover in liquid form from 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.349
 organic substrates so the juices of these 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.329
 bio-waste in a 100-meter tank 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.010
 cubes and concretely what 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.510
 quantities fished in was worth treating you 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.849
 here we treat an annual 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.959
 amount of 7000 tons for the blow the 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.849
 bio-waste is now valued 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.620
 quite sometime past them and eliminate 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.329
 now they are valued as 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.280
 as a source of energy and as 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.039
 that organic amendment well thank you 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.599
 much written to summarize all the 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.370
 packaged biowaste that arrives on this 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.050
 site goes through the god of 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.240
 conditioners then by a step of 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.160
 anaerobic digestion before returning to the soil 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.300
 in the form of standardized compost I you 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.830
 proposes to find all 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.960
 following a farmer installed in Gironde 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.410
 who use compost from visit 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.410
 of saint selve 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.520
 hello hello so so here you have 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.050
 the compass that just came from you 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.419
 are delivered two plants of saint selve 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.479
 why you decided to use 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.770
 compost it's a compost that is very 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.449
 very very rich 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.300
 so in fact it saves me money 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.699
 so chemical products that makes me 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.930
 from the south a lot the doses and so that's me 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.120
 add organic matter that 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.760
 lack in all terrains generally 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.630
 there is an ease of use and 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.220
 proximity 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.310
 because the machined scene is not 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.740
 very far all that is a cycle we have 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.360
 actually goes around the problem 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.889
 we made the site all come back to 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.360
 starting point and concretely how 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.789
 how you use this compost 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.680
 so I used so after the 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.510
 collecting wheat or corn on the 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.710
 period I was looking for saint selve 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.080
 game the stock 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.180
 on the spot she so I thought I pass 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.529
 involved in unemployment and after these loans 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.639
 for now for the semi again 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.729
 this is simply 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.529
 well thank you very much for clarification 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.089
 you will understand it so there is a 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.710
 real challenge to value these 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.210
 bio-waste and the subsidiaries of suez 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.710
 environment contribute to their 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.629
 transformation to provide a 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.650
 quality resource I remind you 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.089
 besides that you too can 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.009
 intervene on your scale by doing 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:54.900
 your own compost or by sorting 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.370
 your waste and well here it is time 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.509
 to leave each other but we meet again 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.809
 next month for a new mag 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.809
 ciao
