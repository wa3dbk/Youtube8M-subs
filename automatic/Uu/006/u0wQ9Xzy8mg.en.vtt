00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
is important especially when it's

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.660 
is important especially when it's

aha we got hirokin already still a
little<00:02:20.090> bit<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.360> sludge<00:02:20.569> in<00:02:20.780> there<00:02:21.550> this<00:02:22.550> pop

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
little bit of sludge in there this pop

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.460 
little bit of sludge in there this pop
seems<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.450> be<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.630> little<00:02:24.190> unique<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.670> me<00:02:25.880> as<00:02:26.750> in

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
seems to be a little unique to me as in

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.560 
seems to be a little unique to me as in
the<00:02:27.770> offset<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.900> these<00:02:30.170> holes<00:02:30.670> versus<00:02:31.670> what

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
the offset of these holes versus what

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.330 
the offset of these holes versus what
comes<00:02:32.810> through<00:02:33.080> here<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.000> little<00:02:36.340> what's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
comes through here it's a little what's

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.680 
comes through here it's a little what's
a<00:02:37.430> word<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.700> want<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:37.910> use<00:02:38.000> unnerving<00:02:39.489> because

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
a word I want to use unnerving because

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.660 
a word I want to use unnerving because
it<00:02:41.690> just<00:02:41.930> looks<00:02:42.470> like<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.770> would<00:02:42.860> restrict<00:02:43.340> oil

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
it just looks like it would restrict oil

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.860 
it just looks like it would restrict oil
flow<00:02:43.910> right<00:02:44.180> off<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.510> bat<00:02:44.690> first<00:02:45.080> single<00:02:45.410> does

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
flow right off the bat first single does

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.160 
flow right off the bat first single does
we<00:02:47.870> got<00:02:48.019> our<00:02:48.170> drain<00:02:48.890> back<00:02:49.130> valve<00:02:49.459> which<00:02:49.730> is

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.610 

like<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.640> plasticy<00:02:55.640> rubber<00:02:56.200> goes<00:02:57.200> in<00:02:57.440> there

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
like a plasticy rubber goes in there

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.460 
like a plasticy rubber goes in there
goes<00:02:57.890> over<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.870> really<00:03:00.140> looks

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
goes over that and that really looks

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.820 
goes over that and that really looks
like<00:03:00.560> restricted<00:03:01.220> oil<00:03:01.459> flow<00:03:01.730> right<00:03:02.000> there<00:03:02.239> I

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
like restricted oil flow right there I

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.670 
like restricted oil flow right there I
could<00:03:03.830> be<00:03:03.950> wrong<00:03:04.160> but<00:03:04.989> it's<00:03:05.989> got<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.230> flow<00:03:06.470> in

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
could be wrong but it's got to flow in

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.520 
could be wrong but it's got to flow in
through<00:03:06.920> here<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.870> then<00:03:08.870> some<00:03:09.110> of<00:03:09.230> these<00:03:09.320> go

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
through here and then some of these go

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.979

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
seems you bottomed spring but what do we

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.140 
seems you bottomed spring but what do we
have<00:03:33.709> on<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:34.040> inside<00:03:34.190> here<00:03:36.579> we<00:03:37.579> have<00:03:37.610> a<00:03:37.760> seam

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
have on the inside here we have a seam

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.610 
have on the inside here we have a seam
that's<00:03:38.570> starting<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.200> separate<00:03:39.620> right<00:03:39.980> here

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
that's starting to separate right here

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.740 
that's starting to separate right here
when<00:03:42.620> I'm<00:03:42.709> running<00:03:42.829> my<00:03:43.100> finger<00:03:43.489> now<00:03:43.640> it's<00:03:44.630> not

when I'm running my finger now it's not

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.600 
when I'm running my finger now it's not

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
completely separated but it's starting

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.260 
completely separated but it's starting
to

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
to

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.420 
to
and<00:03:47.600> these<00:03:48.140> filters<00:03:48.590> all<00:03:48.740> have<00:03:48.920> roughly<00:03:49.160> about

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
and these filters all have roughly about

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.800 
and these filters all have roughly about
3,000<00:03:50.330> miles<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:53.000> ends<00:03:53.360> of<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:53.600> are

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
3,000 miles the ends of this are

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.290 
3,000 miles the ends of this are
cardboard<00:03:55.990> and<00:03:57.370> it's<00:03:58.370> molded<00:03:58.820> around<00:03:59.120> a

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
cardboard and it's molded around a

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.600 
cardboard and it's molded around a
plastic<00:03:59.800> insert<00:04:02.410> let's<00:04:03.410> go<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.740> yeah<00:04:04.220> you<00:04:04.280> can

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
plastic insert let's go to yeah you can

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.610 
plastic insert let's go to yeah you can
see<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:04.940> right<00:04:05.090> there<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.750> got<00:04:05.930> plastic<00:04:06.140> on

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
see that right there it's got plastic on

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.090 
see that right there it's got plastic on
the<00:04:06.740> inside<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.130> it<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:08.150> which<00:04:08.690> these<00:04:08.990> are<00:04:09.100> well

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
the inside of it on which these are well

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:17.140 
the inside of it on which these are well
I<00:04:10.130> thought<00:04:10.460> it<00:04:10.580> was<00:04:10.700> glued<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.700> then<00:04:16.850> this<00:04:16.940> one

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
I thought it was glued and then this one

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.550 
I thought it was glued and then this one
looks<00:04:17.330> like<00:04:17.420> it<00:04:17.690> Dahlia

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
looks like it Dahlia

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.420 
looks like it Dahlia
there<00:04:18.770> you<00:04:18.890> go<00:04:21.520> look<00:04:22.520> at<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:23.500> I'm<00:04:24.500> not<00:04:25.130> even

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
there you go look at that I'm not even

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.470 
there you go look at that I'm not even
trying<00:04:25.640> with<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:26.330> one<00:04:28.060> there's<00:04:29.060> your<00:04:29.270> filter

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
trying with this one there's your filter

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
trying with this one there's your filter
media<00:04:30.110> ACDelco<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:32.780> got<00:04:32.900> a<00:04:32.930> fair<00:04:33.200> bit<00:04:33.410> of

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
tried to pull a part of Fram and it

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.740 
tried to pull a part of Fram and it
wouldn't<00:04:47.030> come<00:04:47.210> out<00:04:47.330> like<00:04:47.510> this<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:50.600> all

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
wouldn't come out like this and all
