00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.579
 we are a agrarian company dieting and studying perugia a company with several 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.529
 purpose of activity as experimental productive and in these 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.880
 productive activities we have different films and cultivation females either 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:31.550
 conventional that biological ultrativity of 103 end up as bovine 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.110
 from dairy meat 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.360
 among those experimental projects we have been working on a project for some years 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.820
 fragrance of grass 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.800
 why 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250
 water the ultimate goal is to 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.770
 to fine-tune a production system for a little high 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.670
 quality aimed at a careful and demanding consumer 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.950
 high-quality flight from Rome to this point from the agricultural faculty 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.850
 of the University of Perugia studies 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.600
 this chicken with two fundamental elements 1 the use of the pasture 10 square meters 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200
 grazing for each chicken 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.040
 intel to the second fundamental element is the genetic type we use 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.200
 golden Livornese deiteles that are the hyenas of the animals that were examples of here 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.870
 colombo this combination allows to have chickens that move a lot 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:24.630
 healthy 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.390
 we do not use treatments elvira some fans 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.140
 and these animals are 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.470
 very useful for the 120 days of one's productive life 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.340
 outside. this allows you to have very consistent meats 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.230
 with the p 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.530
 very low percentage of fat letters high quantities 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.720
 Antioxidants d not believe a lot to admit they are these fatty acids 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 Weight profiled very beneficial for the skin 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.149
 finally in my hands and 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.420
 you think it's easy 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.050
 bring again 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.530
 the grass chicken 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.119
 and you saw it as it is raised 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.119
 in these spaces this field of freedom 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:17.669
 all the ebay grains convinced how i do i even made nice audience 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.490
 you can be cooked alla cacciatora 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.139
 but the hunter also clear because it is game 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.909
 the pepper factors were the biggest 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.580
 a pact made on board 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.989
 with the devil I said well and there was no we do the diagonal 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.439
 here is our pole of suffering grass but to the pre-cooked manzil 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.289
 you have to make him appreciate eco photo 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:53.349
 small part bite of the priest all the parts are extraordinary I have been 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.399
 fired 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.109
 how to accompany it 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.109
 a bit'. I want to renew 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.109
 sign in 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:07.489
 a suggestion suggestion with particular leek good and as is and 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.680
 historic chicken 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.609
 and the Rome in via is also historic 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.599
 a wild or private pea on the hills of civita di cascia near the 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.279
 famous i'm famous castelluccio plain that the mill ground 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.869
 in stone on stone after spelled 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.430
 from a family 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.459
 velvety bormida 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.509
 that you can cook polenta's sake 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:35.050
 and gives rise to the widespread split 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.339
 now more 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:38.360
 in the torah 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.160
 and it begins to cultivate it and 2 brave farmers of the near place 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.170
 home 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.510
 flight friend 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.349

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.520
 10 quintals 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.549
 20sat 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.779
 in all and I propose it as a modern alcohol side dish because it is a natural thing 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:04:01.589
 good to say goodbye to me with the equipment is good next to the power and why not 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:06.049
 always to close. I hate you extra virgin olive oil from the hills 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.689
 tecno remains other 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.560
