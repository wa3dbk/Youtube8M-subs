good thing about that then we've got a

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.979 
good thing about that then we've got a
delta<00:03:25.750> date<00:03:26.320> 3<00:03:26.640> 3300<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:28.420> looks<00:03:28.570> really<00:03:28.840> small

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
delta date 3 3300 it looks really small
