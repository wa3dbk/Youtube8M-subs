00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hey 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.700
 Yup 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:14.709
 Hello Welcome to the cup cake poisoning 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.119
 This time, we have a cup cake decoration with kitchen utensils and miniatures of cake. 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.750
 to introduce 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.530
 Necessary materials and tools are table knife 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.820
 Now flaver or this sugar 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:30.510
 It is a main body of gastronomic and white and light brown ones 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.640
 No cotton swabs for fondant and ordinary cotton swabs 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.149
 f day 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.250
 Toothpick with cupcake frosting 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:42.829
 Because I have introduced this video on how to protect this frosting I've kept since 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.769
 Please see from the link of the explanation column 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:51.660
 Prepare a water sprinkle carful one This is an option 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:55.140
 Sprinkles of heart to put on miniature cake 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.070
 Please prepare if there is a mini oleo cookie 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.150
 It is more than cookie-free type with south 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.940
 Let's start in the 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:10.360
 Stretch out from the main body of the body so that the colors are not mixed at the very beginning 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:14.290
 Shake cornflower or this sugar where you work 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.860
 When you roll the fondant out of the bag and crush it with your palm 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.100
 Let it blend on cornflower 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.850
 Please spread thinly 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.850
 Make a lace paper rather than a plate to put the cake 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:40.450
 When it is extended , cut it with a cookie mold and make a lacework of this 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.450
 Use a toothpick to make a hole and go around 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.530
 Now you have the lace paper on which you can put the cake 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.360
 Then make a cake with mini oleo cookies 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.670
 Cut one cookie in half with a knife 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.960
 Keep the other one as it is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:13.350
 If you attach the half-opened one to another Oreo cookie 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:18.260
 Now you're done with the main body of the economy. Then make a cream on the cake 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:23.689
 May I use the white fondant, but this time will use the Oreo cookies 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.530
 Now Oreo cookies Once you have opened in half by removing only the cream on top of the cake 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.579
 Attached 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.579
 Spread to the edge 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.510
 You do not need to finish it here 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.130
 From the convenience of the cream- put on the spray 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.040
 I think that form sound around with your finger When you put the whole while turning 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:58.420
 From now on it's optional, but this time I 'll put a hard sprinkle on this one 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.000
 Put a heart sprinkle on top with a color spray and you'll have a small cake 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.010
 It is finished 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.010
 I will put together on the cupcake later collectively 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:14.630
 Then use a brown book dart to make a wooden spoon and a year stick 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.770
 Because a little brown coloring is put in this column 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.780
 Finished like this 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.780
 Please adjust the color to your liking 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.090
 Flower is not necessary this time 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:36.160
 It will be difficult to stretch long and thin with a flaper now 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.810
 And sprouts that this does not stick only This can be on the surface. Therefore this true of finish 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.520
 I finish beautifully 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:48.530
 Since this extended thickness is the thickness of a cotton swab, it will be elongated 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:54.380
 I have heard only the necessary amount Once you reach out to the right size 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:58.330
 Please press round clean because a little both ends from collapsing when the cut 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.330
 Adjust so that absolutes are even 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.650
 I cut off the cotton swab handle first 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.650
 Make from the end part 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.700
 It's okay with just a little bit of it If you put it in a circle 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:16.320
 Attach to the body in the shape of a cone 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:23.380
 Apply a little water to the place of installation 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:27.480
 At this time, be careful about the amount of water, as it will be difficult to stick if you put too much water 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.480
 I will do the same for the other 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.400
 It will be finished when the last form is fixed 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:44.940
 Next will make a wooden spoon 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:48.930
 Use the door Naa 4 of the amount of a little less than when you made a year bar on a wooden spoon 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:55.340
 Roll with a little palm while correcting the shape of the cut 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.340
 Stretch the half size with your index finger and make a spoon handle 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.560
 You should be able to do this here just a little more 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.560
 And to narrow 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.560
 Please finish the fineness and length of your choice 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.029
 I cut it on the tip and the spoon of the taking 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:25.130
 Spoon will flatten burning fly a partial cut into round shape 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.130
 Please make a round shape cleanly again 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:37.940
 If you have a spoon like this , use the side of the little finger to make a dip in the spoon 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.940
 Please be careful not to get nail marks 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.280
 The wooden spoon is now complete 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:54.050
 In Place them in the cup cake 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:57.550
 If the frosting dries, the miniatures won't stick, so everything is in order 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.550
 Try to keep frosting 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:07.770
 Put some water on the lace paper and attach the cake 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:13.100
 After that please put a wooden spoon and cotton swab as you like 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:17.150
 Now you have a cupcake with kitchen utensils and a miniature of cake 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.550
 If this tutorial is liked by all means to the channel registration of cup cake poisoning 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.920
 Please give me 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.920
 Thank you for seeing
