00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.690 

so<00:00:01.230> these<00:00:01.380> are<00:00:01.560> some<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.949> techniques<00:00:02.550> that

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so these are some of the techniques that

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.539 
so these are some of the techniques that
I'm<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.750> be<00:00:03.870> using<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:04.710> Ken<00:00:05.009> Windows<00:00:05.339> I

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
I'm going to be using in Ken Windows I

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.160 
I'm going to be using in Ken Windows I
screamed<00:00:05.910> at<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.029> C<00:00:06.270> until<00:00:06.540> notes<00:00:06.779> swelled<00:00:07.049> up

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
screamed at the C until notes swelled up

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.810 
screamed at the C until notes swelled up
then<00:00:07.500> my<00:00:07.649> voice<00:00:07.859> became<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.280> resonant<00:00:08.639> noise

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
then my voice became the resonant noise

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.740 
then my voice became the resonant noise
with<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.090> C<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:10.050> begins<00:00:10.530> with<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.219> bunch<00:00:11.550> of

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
with the C it begins with a bunch of

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.379 
with the C it begins with a bunch of
sounds<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.870> are<00:00:13.559> not<00:00:13.920> sounding<00:00:14.880> strictly

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
sounds that are not sounding strictly

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.000 
sounds that are not sounding strictly
through<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> normal<00:00:15.900> way<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.619> instrument

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
through the normal way of the instrument

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:28.400 
through the normal way of the instrument
so<00:00:17.190> breath<00:00:17.910> sounds<00:00:26.510> there's<00:00:27.510> also<00:00:27.660> some

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
so breath sounds there's also some

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:44.180 
so breath sounds there's also some
singing<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.550> comes<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.910> fun

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.070 

and<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.960> we<00:00:47.110> have<00:00:47.230> some<00:00:47.470> of<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.840> more<00:00:49.840> key

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
and then we have some of the more key

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.840 
and then we have some of the more key
sounds<00:00:50.380> that<00:00:50.500> go<00:00:50.620> in<00:00:50.830> between<00:00:50.890> so<00:00:51.580> we<00:00:51.700> have

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
sounds that go in between so we have

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:07.760 
sounds that go in between so we have
singing<00:00:52.450> with<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.020> keys<00:00:53.200> at<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.530> same<00:00:53.650> time

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.850 

and<00:01:08.770> then<00:01:09.700> in<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:11.110> all<00:01:11.260> of<00:01:11.320> us<00:01:11.410> we<00:01:11.560> have<00:01:11.680> some

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
and then in with all of us we have some

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.790 
and then in with all of us we have some
multiphonics<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.910> will<00:01:13.030> come<00:01:13.240> on<00:01:14.080> that<00:01:14.440> same

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
multiphonics that will come on that same

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:25.109 
multiphonics that will come on that same
pitch<00:01:23.100> once<00:01:24.100> we've<00:01:24.369> gotten<00:01:24.580> into<00:01:24.759> a<00:01:24.880> little

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
pitch once we've gotten into a little

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.150 
pitch once we've gotten into a little
bit<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.390> there<00:01:26.050> will<00:01:26.170> be<00:01:26.200> some<00:01:26.530> microtonal

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
bit that there will be some microtonal

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:35.220 
bit that there will be some microtonal
kind<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.520> sounds

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.080 

with<00:01:36.230> some<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.470> these<00:01:36.560> right<00:01:37.159> hand<00:01:37.370> tremolo

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
with some of these right hand tremolo

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.410 
with some of these right hand tremolo
kind<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.450> characteristics<00:01:40.180> towards<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.240> very

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
kind of characteristics towards the very

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.960 
kind of characteristics towards the very
end<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:41.780> piece<00:01:41.960> we<00:01:42.409> also<00:01:42.590> have<00:01:42.970> an

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
end of the piece we also have an

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.210 
end of the piece we also have an
interaction<00:01:44.390> between<00:01:44.570> my<00:01:45.410> voice<00:01:45.650> and<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
interaction between my voice and the

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.380 
interaction between my voice and the
sounding<00:01:46.550> pitch<00:01:47.390> of<00:01:47.690> different<00:01:48.170> stones
