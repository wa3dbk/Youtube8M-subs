00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
obviously the short numbers can you guys

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.330 
obviously the short numbers can you guys
work<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.780> short<00:01:56.020> pass<00:01:56.259> game<00:01:56.530> effectively<00:01:57.160> if

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
work a short pass game effectively if

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.950 
work a short pass game effectively if
your<00:01:57.490> guys<00:01:57.670> aren't<00:01:58.030> breaking<00:01:58.240> tackles<00:01:58.600> in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
your guys aren't breaking tackles in

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.389 
your guys aren't breaking tackles in
space<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.440> how<00:01:59.500> important<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.100> moving

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
space and how important is that moving

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.580 
space and how important is that moving
forward<00:02:00.550> well<00:02:01.210> it's<00:02:01.330> very<00:02:01.509> important<00:02:01.899> but<00:02:02.500> we

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
forward well it's very important but we

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.410 
forward well it's very important but we
make<00:02:02.979> sure<00:02:03.100> we<00:02:03.220> get<00:02:03.340> them<00:02:03.460> in<00:02:03.580> space<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:04.330> know

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
make sure we get them in space you know

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.749 
make sure we get them in space you know
they<00:02:04.570> were<00:02:04.630> there<00:02:04.930> catching<00:02:05.560> tackles<00:02:06.310> right

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
they were there catching tackles right

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
in space where they have a chance to

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.100 
in space where they have a chance to
break<00:02:09.550> some<00:02:09.729> tackles<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:10.239> lot<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:10.929> has<00:02:11.080> to

will<00:02:33.160> still<00:02:33.310> be<00:02:33.430> effective<00:02:33.850> we<00:02:33.970> just<00:02:34.150> weren't

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
will still be effective we just weren't

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.300 
will still be effective we just weren't
quite<00:02:35.170> as<00:02:35.200> effective<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> runs<00:02:36.100> after

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
are there any areas in which he still

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.620 
are there any areas in which he still
needs<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.280> improve<00:02:45.579> I<00:02:45.910> was<00:02:46.360> very<00:02:46.480> impressed

with<00:02:46.840> Keenan<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.230> thought<00:02:47.380> he<00:02:47.440> had<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.590> very<00:02:47.709> good

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
with Keenan I thought he had a very good

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.979 
with Keenan I thought he had a very good
game<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.459> know<00:02:48.549> he's<00:02:48.700> one<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> few<00:02:49.180> are<00:02:49.810> not

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
game you know he's one of a few are not

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:50.940 
game you know he's one of a few are not
one<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.260> few<00:02:50.410> but<00:02:50.560> one<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.799> bright

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
one of the few but one of the bright

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.830 
one of the few but one of the bright
spots<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.459> this<00:02:51.640> team<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.000> think<00:02:52.269> just<00:02:52.690> his

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
spots of this team I think just his

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.990 
spots of this team I think just his
energy<00:02:53.049> his<00:02:53.769> understanding<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.610> defense

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
energy his understanding of the defense

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.490 
energy his understanding of the defense
is<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.299> ability<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.720> communicate<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.380> then

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
is that ability to communicate and then

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.020 
is that ability to communicate and then
tackle<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.070> thought<00:02:57.280> he<00:02:57.400> played<00:02:57.430> extremely

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
tackle I thought he played extremely

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.030 
tackle I thought he played extremely
well<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.420> he's<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> guy<00:02:59.440> that's<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.709> going<00:02:59.980> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
well and he's a guy that's just going to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.259 
well and he's a guy that's just going to
get<00:03:00.130> better<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.489> better<00:03:00.640> with<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.940> reps<00:03:01.150> that

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
get better and better with the reps that

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.840 
get better and better with the reps that
he<00:03:01.360> gets<00:03:01.600> in<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.870> game<00:03:02.290> time<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.860> he<00:03:02.950> gets<00:03:03.160> no

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
he gets in the game time that he gets no

last<00:05:03.880> week<00:05:04.229> lost<00:05:05.229> two<00:05:05.470> in<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.280> course<00:05:06.490> of<00:05:06.580> the

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
last week lost two in the course of the

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.520 
last week lost two in the course of the
game<00:05:06.820> but<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.270> think<00:05:07.750> five<00:05:07.990> is<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.229> good<00:05:08.409> number

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
game but I think five is a good number

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.110 
game but I think five is a good number
for<00:05:08.710> still<00:05:09.220> we<00:05:09.460> still<00:05:09.520> have<00:05:09.789> the<00:05:09.909> four

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
for still we still have the four

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.600 
for still we still have the four
linebackers<00:05:10.360> so<00:05:11.020> we<00:05:11.800> have<00:05:11.889> five<00:05:12.099> safeties<00:05:12.580> and

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
linebackers so we have five safeties and

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.610 
linebackers so we have five safeties and
you<00:05:13.270> know<00:05:13.360> so<00:05:13.539> we<00:05:13.630> have<00:05:13.930> a<00:05:13.960> good<00:05:14.169> number<00:05:14.470> of

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620
