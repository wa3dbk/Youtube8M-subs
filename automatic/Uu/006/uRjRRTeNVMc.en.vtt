the pdw-57 submachine gun this is a

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.460 
the pdw-57 submachine gun this is a
really<00:00:05.670> good<00:00:05.790> weapon<00:00:06.180> it<00:00:06.509> has<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.779> large<00:00:07.109> ammo

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
really good weapon it has a large ammo

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.440 
really good weapon it has a large ammo
capacity<00:00:07.649> for<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.189> submachine<00:00:08.670> gun<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.940> get<00:00:09.090> 50

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
capacity for a submachine gun you get 50

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.830 
capacity for a submachine gun you get 50
bullets<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:10.349> has<00:00:10.500> very<00:00:10.740> light<00:00:10.920> recoil<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.840> if

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
bullets it has very light recoil and if

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.680 
bullets it has very light recoil and if
you<00:00:13.019> want<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.290> compare<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.769> modern<00:00:14.009> warfare<00:00:14.130> 3

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
you want to compare to modern warfare 3

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.130 
you want to compare to modern warfare 3
it's<00:00:15.690> very<00:00:15.960> similar<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:17.039> way<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:18.140> mp7

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
it's very similar to the way the the mp7

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.890 
it's very similar to the way the the mp7
handled<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.039> game<00:00:20.600> mp7<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.689> modern

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
handled in that game mp7 in modern

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.630 
handled in that game mp7 in modern
warfare<00:00:22.020> 3<00:00:22.170> was<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.920> really<00:00:23.130> good<00:00:23.369> for

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
warfare 3 was really really good for

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.750 
warfare 3 was really really good for
mid-range<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.420> was<00:00:24.539> where<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.900> excelled<00:00:25.760> in

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
mid-range that was where it excelled in

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.670 
mid-range that was where it excelled in
this<00:00:27.029> gun<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.480> probably<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.960> equivalent<00:00:28.500> of

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
this gun is probably the equivalent of

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.710 
this gun is probably the equivalent of
that<00:00:28.890> although<00:00:29.310> there<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.730> an<00:00:29.880> mp7<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.539> black

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that although there is an mp7 in black

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.500 
that although there is an mp7 in black
ops<00:00:30.960> 2<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.949> really<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.820> good<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.239> mid

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
ops 2 it's really not that good for mid

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.720 
ops 2 it's really not that good for mid
ranges<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.380> mostly<00:00:34.590> shines<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.190> close<00:00:35.460> from

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
ranges it mostly shines up close from

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.280 
ranges it mostly shines up close from
the<00:00:35.790> hip<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.270> has<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.630> strong<00:00:36.870> hip<00:00:37.050> firing

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the hip it has really strong hip firing

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.440 
the hip it has really strong hip firing
right<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.829> saw<00:00:37.980> me<00:00:38.100> make<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> mistake<00:00:38.450> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
right there you saw me make a mistake I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.119 
right there you saw me make a mistake I
still<00:00:39.989> make<00:00:40.140> these<00:00:40.320> small<00:00:40.469> mistakes<00:00:40.890> every

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
still make these small mistakes every

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.380 
still make these small mistakes every
now<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:41.910> used<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> making

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
now and then that I'm not used to making

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.389 
now and then that I'm not used to making
and<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.250> my

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and it's just because you know my

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.369 
and it's just because you know my
awareness<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.120> UAV<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:46.020> up<00:00:46.170> I'm

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
awareness is down UAV is going up I'm

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.549 
awareness is down UAV is going up I'm
I'm<00:00:46.950> still<00:00:47.250> learning<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> maps<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> should

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I'm still learning the maps so I should

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.779 
I'm still learning the maps so I should
have<00:00:49.649> checked<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> ladder<00:00:50.129> right<00:00:50.370> there<00:00:50.550> but

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
have checked the ladder right there but

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.490 
have checked the ladder right there but
you<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.600> live<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.140> live<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.350> you

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
you know you live in you live in you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100 
you know you live in you live in you
learn<00:00:52.649> right<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> another<00:00:54.629> thing<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.870> I'm

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
learn right so another thing is I'm

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
learn right so another thing is I'm
playing<00:00:55.260> ground<00:00:55.590> war<00:00:55.739> kill<00:00:55.980> confirmed<00:00:56.190> kill

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
playing ground war kill confirmed kill

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.250 
playing ground war kill confirmed kill
confirmed<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.629> want<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:57.960> heavy<00:00:58.170> on

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
confirmed you really want to be heavy on

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.869 
confirmed you really want to be heavy on
the<00:00:58.469> objectives<00:00:58.949> even<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.670> than

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the objectives even more so than

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.990 
the objectives even more so than
domination<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:01.590> reason<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> every<00:01:02.430> kill<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
domination the reason is every kill you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.539 
domination the reason is every kill you
get<00:01:03.120> 50<00:01:03.690> points<00:01:04.290> towards<00:01:04.920> your<00:01:04.949> score<00:01:05.250> streak

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
get 50 points towards your score streak

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.210 
get 50 points towards your score streak
when<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.240> confirm<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> tag<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.530> worth<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
when you confirm a tag it's worth the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
when you confirm a tag it's worth the
equivalent<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.700> two<00:01:08.880> points<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.420> 100

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
equivalent of two points you get 100

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380 
equivalent of two points you get 100
points<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.310> extremely<00:01:11.820> crucial<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
points so it's extremely crucial to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
points so it's extremely crucial to
whenever<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.869> kill<00:01:13.080> somebody<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.159> can

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
whenever you kill somebody if you can

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.940 
whenever you kill somebody if you can
run<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.670> into<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.930> where<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> tag<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
run out into the to where the tag is and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070 
run out into the to where the tag is and
get<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.790> want<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.780> leave

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
get it you want to do it don't leave

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.039 
get it you want to do it don't leave
tags<00:01:19.530> unconfirmed<00:01:20.460> you're<00:01:20.909> leaving<00:01:21.270> you're

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
tags unconfirmed you're leaving you're

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
tags unconfirmed you're leaving you're
leaving<00:01:22.080> money<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> table<00:01:23.250> basically<00:01:23.820> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
leaving money on the table basically you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.760 
leaving money on the table basically you
know<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.570> when<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.229> when<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.619> in

know it when you get when you get in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.280 
know it when you get when you get in
there<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.640> kill<00:01:26.880> them

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
there you kill them

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.020 
there you kill them
make<00:01:28.290> sure<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.680> confirm<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.280> dude<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.850> so

make sure you confirm it dude I see so
many<00:01:30.090> people<00:01:30.420> running<00:01:30.600> past<00:01:30.900> tags<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.470> it's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
many people running past tags like it's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.170 
many people running past tags like it's
modern<00:01:31.770> warfare<00:01:32.009> 3<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> huge

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
modern warfare 3 you have a huge

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.149 
modern warfare 3 you have a huge
incentive<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.320> reason<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> want<00:01:35.100> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
incentive and a reason to want to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
incentive and a reason to want to
confirm<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.970> again<00:01:36.540> play<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.049> objective

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
confirm now so again play the objective

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
very very aggressive in this game a lot

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.780 
very very aggressive in this game a lot
of<00:02:32.410> people<00:02:32.650> will<00:02:32.770> tell<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.100> play<00:02:33.250> passive

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770

and I think it's the opposite most
people<00:02:36.130> expect<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.880> play<00:02:37.000> passes<00:02:37.600> and

people expect you to play passes and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.260 
people expect you to play passes and

then but if you're coming at them full
speed<00:02:40.740> Atena<00:02:41.740> it<00:02:42.040> kind<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.340> puts<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.640> little

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
speed Atena it kind of puts a little

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.700

hesitation<00:02:43.270> into<00:02:43.810> their<00:02:43.960> mind<00:02:44.200> when<00:02:44.560> they're
