but<00:00:24.529> this<00:00:24.650> is<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:24.830> game<00:00:24.949> very<00:00:25.250> very<00:00:25.369> basic

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
but this is the game very very basic

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.740 
but this is the game very very basic
each<00:00:27.980> kid<00:00:28.249> has<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.429> cone<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:31.210> they<00:00:32.210> are<00:00:32.480> trying

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
each kid has a cone and they are trying

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.540 
each kid has a cone and they are trying
to<00:00:32.900> get<00:00:33.020> a<00:00:33.079> serve<00:00:33.380> over<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:33.920> in<00:00:34.010> could<00:00:34.250> even<00:00:34.370> be

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
to get a serve over and in could even be

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.710 
to get a serve over and in could even be
a<00:00:34.579> little<00:00:34.640> underarm<00:00:35.000> serve<00:00:35.360> if<00:00:35.540> they're

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
a little underarm serve if they're

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.479 
a little underarm serve if they're
really<00:00:35.960> young<00:00:36.350> children<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:37.220> they're<00:00:37.370> going

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
really young children but they're going

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.760 
really young children but they're going
to<00:00:37.550> try<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:37.820> get<00:00:37.910> their<00:00:38.059> serve<00:00:38.270> in<00:00:38.590> every<00:00:39.590> time

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
to try and get their serve in every time

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.860 
to try and get their serve in every time
they<00:00:39.920> get<00:00:40.100> their<00:00:40.250> serve<00:00:40.520> in<00:00:40.760> they<00:00:41.449> move<00:00:41.660> their

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
they get their serve in they move their

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.279 
they get their serve in they move their
comb<00:00:42.140> back<00:00:42.949> one<00:00:43.489> racquet<00:00:43.850> length<00:00:44.199> simple<00:00:45.199> as

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
comb back one racquet length simple as

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.639 
comb back one racquet length simple as
that<00:00:45.410> okay<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.640> they're<00:00:47.629> trying<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:47.989> get<00:00:48.230> as

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
that okay and they're trying to get as

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.220 
that okay and they're trying to get as
far<00:00:48.949> back<00:00:49.219> as<00:00:49.640> possible<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.600> it's<00:00:50.719> a<00:00:50.809> race<00:00:50.989> to

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
far back as possible so it's a race to

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.200 
far back as possible so it's a race to
get<00:00:51.350> let's<00:00:51.829> say<00:00:51.949> pass<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.250> baseline<00:00:52.850> or<00:00:53.120> as

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
get let's say pass the baseline or as

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.400 
get let's say pass the baseline or as
far<00:00:53.420> back<00:00:53.570> in<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.840> court<00:00:54.079> as<00:00:54.320> they<00:00:54.829> can<00:00:56.410> okay

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
far back in the court as they can okay

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.410 
far back in the court as they can okay
this<00:00:57.559> is<00:00:57.710> how<00:00:57.829> you<00:00:57.890> can<00:00:58.160> adapt<00:00:58.550> this<00:00:58.699> game<00:00:58.969> for

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
this is how you can adapt this game for

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.919 
this is how you can adapt this game for
let's<00:00:59.960> say<00:01:00.079> for<00:01:00.230> older<00:01:00.440> juniors<00:01:01.570> very<00:01:02.570> simply

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
let's say for older juniors very simply

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.010 
let's say for older juniors very simply
we're<00:01:03.050> just<00:01:03.199> doing<00:01:03.320> on<00:01:03.620> a<00:01:04.040> big<00:01:04.610> high<00:01:05.330> score<00:01:05.600> so

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
we're just doing on a big high score so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.960 
we're just doing on a big high score so
same<00:01:06.230> game<00:01:06.470> they're<00:01:07.040> just<00:01:07.220> aiming<00:01:07.460> into<00:01:07.820> the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
same game they're just aiming into the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.510 
same game they're just aiming into the
service<00:01:08.300> box<00:01:08.920> every<00:01:09.920> time<00:01:10.100> they<00:01:10.250> get<00:01:10.340> their

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
service box every time they get their

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.780 
service box every time they get their
serve<00:01:10.730> in<00:01:11.950> move<00:01:12.950> their<00:01:13.130> cone<00:01:13.310> back<00:01:13.550> one

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
serve in move their cone back one

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.230 
serve in move their cone back one
racquet<00:01:14.120> length<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.660> work<00:01:15.500> their<00:01:15.680> way<00:01:15.770> back

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
racquet length and work their way back

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.430 
racquet length and work their way back
now<00:01:17.240> let's<00:01:17.510> say<00:01:17.660> we<00:01:17.780> want<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:17.990> make<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.380> a

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
now let's say we want to make it a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.620 
now let's say we want to make it a
little<00:01:18.620> bit<00:01:18.770> more<00:01:18.860> difficult<00:01:19.370> again<00:01:19.880> for

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
little bit more difficult again for

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.810 
little bit more difficult again for
better<00:01:20.870> players<00:01:21.080> I<00:01:21.500> don't<00:01:22.460> know<00:01:22.520> if<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.670> can

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
better players I don't know if you can

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.270 
better players I don't know if you can
see<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:23.240> I've<00:01:23.390> put<00:01:23.870> a<00:01:23.930> line<00:01:24.200> down<00:01:24.230> which<00:01:25.070> has

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
see but I've put a line down which has

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.570 
see but I've put a line down which has
split<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.760> service<00:01:26.150> box<00:01:26.390> into<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.130> for<00:01:28.370> better

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
split the service box into so for better

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.850 
split the service box into so for better
players<00:01:28.790> we<00:01:29.630> could<00:01:29.810> say<00:01:30.020> they<00:01:30.290> have<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.650> hit<00:01:30.830> a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
players we could say they have to hit a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.160 
players we could say they have to hit a
particular<00:01:31.280> area<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.030> service<00:01:32.480> box<00:01:32.720> so

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
particular area of the service box so

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.660 
particular area of the service box so
maybe<00:01:33.380> we<00:01:33.590> now<00:01:33.740> say<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.130> they<00:01:34.310> have<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.490> hit

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
maybe we now say that they have to hit

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.660 
maybe we now say that they have to hit
the<00:01:34.790> wide<00:01:35.620> area<00:01:36.620> of<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.950> service<00:01:37.280> box<00:01:37.430> that

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
the wide area of the service box that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.060 
the wide area of the service box that
was<00:01:37.760> out<00:01:37.910> so<00:01:38.150> I'm<00:01:38.210> going<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.480> stay<00:01:38.630> where<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.810> am

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
was out so I'm going to stay where I am

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.250 
was out so I'm going to stay where I am
and<00:01:40.240> if<00:01:41.240> we<00:01:41.420> want<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.690> make<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.990> more<00:01:42.110> difficult

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
and if we want to make it more difficult

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.920 
and if we want to make it more difficult
again<00:01:44.050> then<00:01:45.050> we<00:01:45.260> can<00:01:45.440> split<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:47.270> service<00:01:47.690> box

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
again then we can split the service box

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.800 
again then we can split the service box
into<00:01:48.410> three

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.319 

there<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:53.869> go<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.259> we've<00:01:54.380> got<00:01:54.590> middle<00:01:55.549> body<00:01:56.060> and

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
there we go so we've got middle body and

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.510 
there we go so we've got middle body and
white<00:01:56.659> like<00:01:57.439> all<00:01:57.590> these<00:01:57.770> three<00:01:58.009> segments<00:01:58.429> of

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
white like all these three segments of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.609 
white like all these three segments of
the<00:01:58.579> box<00:01:58.789> so<00:01:59.479> that's<00:01:59.630> getting<00:01:59.869> towards<00:02:00.350> quite

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
the box so that's getting towards quite

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.740 
the box so that's getting towards quite
advanced<00:02:01.159> players<00:02:02.090> now<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:05.270> can<00:02:05.450> go<00:02:05.630> as

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
advanced players now and you can go as
