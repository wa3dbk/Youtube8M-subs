00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.010
Water meditation (theta waves)
By Thomas Toivonen

00:00:41.010 --> 00:01:26.250
You are infinite.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:02:23.500
You are the universe.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:32.290
In your body runs the water,
that is over a billion years old.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.640
You are beautiful.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:49.060
There is nothing to be afraid of,
because everything is,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:04:44.000
has been and shall be forever.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:05:29.500
Water has 
never stoped.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:06:23.680
It is a cycle that repeats itself endlessly.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:32.889
There is nothing to be afraid of.

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:44.010
Water has never stoped.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:07:19.669
It is a cycle that repeats itself endlessly.

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:40.740
There is nothing to be afraid of.
