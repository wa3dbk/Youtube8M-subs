00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.980
Come and suffer for all eternity

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.220
Or, if you think you can turn this around..? but

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.540
Of course, don't you realize?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.270
There'll be nothing left waiting for you.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.020
Build up and break down

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.620
Throw away any hesitation

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.260
There's no turning back

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.860
You can only move forward.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.550
For every flower that blossoms beautifully

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.300
Is a fate to scatter, wither and die

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.410
No matter how much you cling to how you have lived...

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.540
You'll lose everything, weep and weep!

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.660
You have no idea what it means to fall!!

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.300
"Kill me! Kill me! Forgive me!!!"

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.950
With a pain so great you cannot cry out

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.020
Open your heart, Open your heart!

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.230
If it's blossomed then I'll rip it to shreds!

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.760
Break and break and be broken!

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.600
Until you cannot see anything anymore!

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.300
Why don't you just start from scratch?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.900
If you simply end all you've created

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.550
In that blank and empty time

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.160
All your regrets will fall into dreams...

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.770
Rip me to shreds!

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.390
I, who am ugly and cannot blossom!

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.070
Crimson, so crimson

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.750
With your bloodied hands...

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.810
Mend, create, and spout out your lies!

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.950
One day they will be seen through

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.510
Yes! Scream, scream!! If you scream louder

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.350
You'll be able to see it!

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.290
Now close that heart, close your heart

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.510
When someone comes to open it, you'll move forward

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.090
Now is the end, now is the end, farewell

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.930
Until I disappear...
