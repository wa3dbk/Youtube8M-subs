to now show you some of the basic
features<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.750> generator<00:00:28.820> first<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.000> all

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
features of this generator first of all

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.060 
features of this generator first of all
this<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> digital<00:00:31.019> inverter<00:00:31.500> generator

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
this is a digital inverter generator

this is a digital inverter generator
what<00:00:32.759> does<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.120> mean<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:34.200> generator<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
what does that mean this generator is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
what does that mean this generator is
different<00:00:35.700> from<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.210> older<00:00:36.540> generation<00:00:36.570> of
