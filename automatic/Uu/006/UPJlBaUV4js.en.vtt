noticed that added this year is plenty
of<00:00:06.910> explosion<00:00:07.480> like<00:00:07.889> say<00:00:08.889> of<00:00:09.190> Russell

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:09.549 
of explosion like say of Russell

that nature to explode to the basket I
haven't<00:00:17.650> seen<00:00:17.770> these<00:00:17.920> animations<00:00:18.280> before

haven't seen these animations before
here<00:00:18.970> we<00:00:19.060> go<00:00:19.210> why<00:00:20.140> should<00:00:20.320> he<00:00:20.440> explodes<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.310> the

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:21.370 
here we go why should he explodes to the

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.029 
here we go why should he explodes to the
basket<00:00:21.820> but<00:00:22.020> due<00:00:23.020> to<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.289> link<00:00:23.650> yo<00:00:23.770> this<00:00:23.980> is

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
basket but due to the link yo this is

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.880 
basket but due to the link yo this is
the<00:00:24.160> best<00:00:24.250> I've<00:00:24.670> seen<00:00:24.700> them<00:00:25.350> their<00:00:26.350> transition

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
the best I've seen them their transition

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.350 
the best I've seen them their transition
animations<00:00:27.430> without<00:00:27.700> have<00:00:27.850> been<00:00:28.000> like<00:00:28.210> they

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
animations without have been like they

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.420 
animations without have been like they
change<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.869> shot<00:00:29.080> to<00:00:29.289> some<00:00:29.500> stupid<00:00:29.860> shot<00:00:30.220> that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
change a shot to some stupid shot that

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.910 
change a shot to some stupid shot that
gives<00:00:31.030> you<00:00:31.180> like<00:00:31.360> 0%<00:00:32.079> chance<00:00:32.140> of<00:00:32.469> going<00:00:32.619> in

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
gives you like 0% chance of going in

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.640 
gives you like 0% chance of going in
like<00:00:33.550> you<00:00:34.210> can<00:00:34.360> explode<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.230> can<00:00:35.470> change

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
like you can explode and you can change

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.240 
like you can explode and you can change
the<00:00:35.860> people<00:00:36.160> shots<00:00:36.420> um<00:00:38.040> turns<00:00:39.040> up<00:00:39.190> the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
the people shots um turns up the

the people shots um turns up the
animations<00:00:39.730> there<00:00:39.880> is<00:00:40.000> no<00:00:40.180> animation<00:00:40.690> that

can't<00:00:41.140> be<00:00:41.260> stopped<00:00:41.500> like<00:00:41.680> spins<00:00:42.040> in<00:00:42.399> the<00:00:42.760> paint

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
can't be stopped like spins in the paint

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.080 
can't be stopped like spins in the paint
all<00:00:44.290> of<00:00:44.649> that<00:00:44.800> when<00:00:45.280> people<00:00:45.399> do<00:00:45.579> hop<00:00:45.760> steps

poster everything can be like
interrupting<00:00:48.760> everything<00:00:49.239> there<00:00:49.390> is<00:00:49.420> really

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
interrupting everything there is really

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.870 
interrupting everything there is really
no<00:00:49.899> canned<00:00:50.320> animations<00:00:51.010> going<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.520> basket

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
and where they almost eliminated can't

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.400 
and where they almost eliminated can't
animations<00:00:53.920> but<00:00:54.430> this<00:00:54.550> is<00:00:54.760> one<00:00:55.410> animation

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
animations but this is one animation

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.139 
animations but this is one animation
that<00:00:56.649> I've<00:00:56.710> seen<00:00:56.980> man<00:00:57.309> it's<00:00:57.520> beautiful<00:00:57.760> man

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
that I've seen man it's beautiful man

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.090 
that I've seen man it's beautiful man
you<00:00:58.300> can<00:00:58.420> explode<00:00:58.840> on<00:00:59.140> somebody<00:00:59.469> man<00:00:59.710> like<00:00:59.950> you

you can explode on somebody man like you

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.889 
you can explode on somebody man like you
could<00:01:00.250> really<00:01:00.399> come<00:01:00.670> off<00:01:00.850> look<00:01:01.570> at<00:01:01.660> this<00:01:01.719> this

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
could really come off look at this this

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.299 
could really come off look at this this
is<00:01:01.960> an<00:01:02.140> exponent<00:01:02.410> when<00:01:02.770> I<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:02.920> see<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.100> player

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
is an exponent when I you see a player

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.520 
is an exponent when I you see a player
gather<00:01:03.610> hard<00:01:03.910> gather<00:01:04.119> on<00:01:04.390> two<00:01:04.569> feet<00:01:04.809> that's

gather hard gather on two feet that's

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.459 
gather hard gather on two feet that's
the<00:01:05.649> Derrick<00:01:05.920> Rose<00:01:06.030> explosion<00:01:07.030> or<00:01:07.469> Westbrook

the Derrick Rose explosion or Westbrook

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.169 
the Derrick Rose explosion or Westbrook
with<00:01:08.590> Tyreke<00:01:08.859> Evans<00:01:09.009> you<00:01:09.340> say<00:01:09.490> explode<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.909> but

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
with Tyreke Evans you say explode a but

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:11.879 
with Tyreke Evans you say explode a but
I<00:01:10.329> could<00:01:10.509> interrupt<00:01:10.749> animation<00:01:11.590> he<00:01:11.679> just

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:11.889 
I could interrupt animation he just

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:13.199 
I could interrupt animation he just
wasn't<00:01:12.039> gonna<00:01:12.189> throw<00:01:12.399> it<00:01:12.520> down<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.969> do<00:01:13.030> some

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:13.209 
wasn't gonna throw it down and do some

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:15.929 
wasn't gonna throw it down and do some
strongly<00:01:13.689> up<00:01:13.840> I<00:01:13.959> interrupted<00:01:14.439> it<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.700> I<00:01:15.759> made

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
strongly up I interrupted it and I made

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.669 
strongly up I interrupted it and I made
him<00:01:16.090> change<00:01:16.209> up<00:01:16.389> a<00:01:16.479> shot<00:01:16.689> and<00:01:16.899> it<00:01:16.990> didn't<00:01:17.259> oh

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
him change up a shot and it didn't oh

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.879 
him change up a shot and it didn't oh
actually<00:01:18.009> get<00:01:18.249> it<00:01:18.340> dropped<00:01:18.520> but<00:01:18.789> actually<00:01:19.539> um

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889 
actually get it dropped but actually um

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.139 
actually get it dropped but actually um
today<00:01:20.889> they<00:01:21.039> have<00:01:21.189> so<00:01:21.310> many<00:01:21.340> animations<00:01:21.909> that

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
today they have so many animations that

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.760 
today they have so many animations that
you<00:01:22.329> can<00:01:22.479> interrupt<00:01:22.689> and<00:01:23.049> there<00:01:23.259> is<00:01:23.409> like<00:01:23.590> a

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
you can interrupt and there is like a

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.800 
you can interrupt and there is like a
like<00:01:24.189> a<00:01:24.279> balance<00:01:24.789> between<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.179> animations

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
like a balance between the animations

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.260 
like a balance between the animations
where<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.709> know<00:01:26.829> its<00:01:27.009> own<00:01:27.159> previous<00:01:27.819> two<00:01:28.060> K's

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
where you know its own previous two K's

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.999 
where you know its own previous two K's
if<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.689> guy<00:01:28.810> do<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:28.990> spin<00:01:29.259> don't<00:01:29.499> want<00:01:29.649> some<00:01:29.859> kind

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
if a guy do a spin don't want some kind

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.709 
if a guy do a spin don't want some kind
of<00:01:30.099> shot<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.609> a<00:01:30.639> great<00:01:30.939> leaning<00:01:31.270> shot

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
of shot and it a great leaning shot

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.289 
of shot and it a great leaning shot
layup<00:01:32.109> that<00:01:32.499> was<00:01:32.619> like<00:01:32.799> zero<00:01:33.249> it<00:01:33.729> was<00:01:33.849> like<00:01:33.969> one

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
layup that was like zero it was like one

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.480 
layup that was like zero it was like one
out<00:01:34.569> of<00:01:34.779> 20<00:01:35.079> times<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.469> shot<00:01:35.649> with<00:01:35.799> drop<00:01:36.039> it's

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
out of 20 times a shot with drop it's

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.889 
out of 20 times a shot with drop it's
like<00:01:36.609> a<00:01:36.639> balance<00:01:37.149> some<00:01:37.299> shots<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.689> drop

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
like a balance some shots to drop

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.330 
like a balance some shots to drop
depending<00:01:38.289> on<00:01:38.349> the<00:01:38.439> player<00:01:38.649> some<00:01:38.889> shots<00:01:39.099> won't

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
depending on the player some shots won't
