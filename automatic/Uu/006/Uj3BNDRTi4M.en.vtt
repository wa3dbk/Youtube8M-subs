00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.279
 how 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.849
 welcome to another video today 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.849
 We will analyze the best 5 aircraft of 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.239
 close support cast that means close 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.820
 the support or translated into Spanish 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:33.219
 Close air support advised me with a 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.920
 Spanish military will leave the link in the 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.519
 description without saying more let's see the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.550
 video 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:42.040
 I hope you like them nowadays 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.870
 Air forces of the powers center 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.000
 all its resources to the development of 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.800
 furtive fighters and high bombers 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.799
 technology or even actions not 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.720
 manned or drones but the reality is 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.089
 that current wars demand another 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.100
 type of aircraft which are designed 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.229
 for the ground attack these are still 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.780
 fulfilling missions around the globe 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.119
 either clearing the Colombian jungle of 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.970
 drug traffickers or attacking bases and 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.560
 edges in iraq these are the best 5 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.560
 close air support aircraft 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.299
 the text a scorpion an airplane 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.579
 relatively new designed by the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.289
 American company textron is the 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.570
 fifth on the list for your goal 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.750
 commercial which is to replace the a 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.630
 10 f 16i at 715 in the tasks of 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.149
 patrol and support close this plane 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.250
 was designed with that intention taking 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.259
 of example the experiences lived by 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.470
 American pilots in the wars 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.509
 of the gulf in which afghanistan though 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.030
 currently has not participated in any 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.310
 real combat according to military analysts 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.530
 this subsonic jet aircraft to be 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.240
 able to carry heavy weapons and be 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.700
 equipped with modern avionics could 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.740
 increase its effectiveness this because of the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.530
 rising price of bombers and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.539
 furtive fighters leaving us like 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.549
 conclusion that perhaps within about 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.880
 years this airplane has an important 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.880
 demand 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.500
 he makes 130 a modified cargo plane 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.959
 to the limit to carry out missions of 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.989
 ground attack support ban and 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.000
 escort designed and perfected from 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.680
 the vietnam war were boeing and 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.420
 lockheed those that made it a 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.550
 true fighter from the air 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.440
 depending on the version this plane 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.650
 can be armed with a variety of 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.530
 weapons like a 105-mm howitzer 2 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.500
 7 62 mm minibus or a truck 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.510
 20 mm vulcan is enabled 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.760
 to operate day and night possessing 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.910
 regular countermeasures and elements of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.400
 electronic warfare has experience in 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.720
 combats since his predecessor the c40 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.720
 he fought in vietnam 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.890
 and to this day this plane continues 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.750
 being used summarizing the plane 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.849
 can annihilate everything that moves and 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.970
 surround the endless area until you meet your 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.970
 mission 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.870
 the super tucano of the Brazilian company 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.209
 The clutch is an aircraft designed for 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.180
 light attack counterinsurgency and for 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.980
 training your current versions 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.290
 they are equipped with modern equipment 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.270
 avionics equipment and a system of 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.610
 weapons 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.010
 his goal is to be an attack aircraft to 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.950
 light ground for both patrol and 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.390
 to support regular forces the plane 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.760
 itself is characterized by a high 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.800
 Maneuverability easy handling and good 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.980
 performance at a very low price to 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.690
 comparison of their contricantes also 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.760
 It is characterized by being a very 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.040
 used in Latin America 'for control 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.020
 of borders especially to provide 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.840
 support when attacking in areas of 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.940
 jungle or leafy vegetation according to 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.430
 experts the tucano is a perfect medium 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.530
 to fight insurgents because he is capable 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.450
 of chasing and attacking enemies and of 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.120
 patrol the area until the task is 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.100
 fulfilled is currently used by 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.110
 the Colombian air forces for 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.150
 fight the farc for the republic 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.100
 Dominican Republic to bring down shipments of 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.190
 drugs and by malaysia to fight the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.140
 pirates on their borders I think those 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.560
 there are enough reasons for the third 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.560
 Market Stall 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.920
 the Russian plane its co and 25 slow but fine 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.060
 armed and capable of carrying a lot of ammunition 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.950
 currently fighting against the state 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.010
 Islamic and so far has had 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.140
 quite successful at being an attack aircraft 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.150
 to medium-weight earth and motor and with 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.370
 tall straight wings has large 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.320
 stabilizers and air brakes for 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.510
 have a better performance in flight to 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.120
 medium and low altitude where the air is 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.920
 more dense humid and heavy but also 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.020
 it serves for penetration missions 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.150
 deep within enemy territory and 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.730
 naval attack with flush flights over 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.860
 the sea to be an attack aircraft to 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.870
 earth is equipped with shielding in the 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.880
 cockpit the lower part of the 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.070
 central fuselage and the sides of the 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.020
 engines this to be able to resist the 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.780
 impact of light weapons and ammunition 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.730
 fired from the ground it also has 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.010
 large capacity for transporting weapons 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.530
 pumps free fall pumps 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.840
 precision GPS and laser launch 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.500
 rockets naval air surface missiles 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.410
 and external fuel tanks 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.460
 also his 25 is heavily armed 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.440
 with a 30-millimeter csh 32 truck and 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.780
 can carry a maximum load on weapons 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.920
 of more than 4,000 kilograms in pylon is 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.920
 load under the wings 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.060
 the 10 nicknamed boar was designed in the 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.390
 60s with the air support function 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.420
 close the plane according to experts was 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.590
 built around a heavy truck 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.100
 specialized in tank destruction 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.690
 enemies the a10 successfully completed their 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.700
 chores in iraq and afghanistan and 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.520
 recently it has been used against 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.830
 the Islamic state its strong structure 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.320
 can survive direct impacts of 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.970
 projectiles up to 23 mm both 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.000
 of piercing type as high 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.460
 explosive although in the pgje can carry 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.710
 a big load lan tablet external his weapon 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.140
 main integrated is the rotating cannon 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.660
 go ochoa a vejer with seven cannons 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.850
 caliber 30 millimeters in terms of 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.590
 external weaponry 10 uses 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.860
 usually the surface air missile 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.260
 to 65 Madrid with different variations 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.820
 for optical piano on television 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.740
 or infrared 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.840
 the maverick missile allows to attack 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.700
 objectives a lot more distance than the 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.170
 cannon so it's safer in 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.560
 presence of anti-aircraft systems 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.750
 modern even the updated version 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.250
 thunder vol 2 also usually carries a 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.180
 electronic countermeasure container 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.580
 in 1131 under one of the wings and a couple 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.550
 of air-to-air missiles hain 9 without dewinter 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.410
 under the other for self-defense in 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.000
 conclusion this boar of the air is 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.000
 deserves the first place today 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.340
 that has been everything I hope you liked it 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.340
 and if you liked sharing it 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.509
 ah
