00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.140
 gentlemen I welcomed with a lot 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.270
 of pleasure the president of the equator and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.869
 we defined a strategy beyond 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.750
 of the cooperation friendship do everything 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.090
 for academic exchanges 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 technologies are worn or more 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.670
 High level is the interest of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.469
 the equator is the will of France 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.710
 so there have been several agreements that have 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.410
 been signed as well on the plane 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.089
 academic than on a plane 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.160
 scientific and economic to go 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.089
 in the center 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.699
 the equator is a country that knows a 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.339
 rapid development that needs to 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.470
 funding surely but who is waiting 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.720
 especially gold technology like the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.440
 French companies are ready to 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.840
 share and make work 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.780
 French employees in this direction 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.689
 we could very quickly find a 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.320
 agreement on this strategic pact between 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.110
 our two countries 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.990
 besides there is on the plane of the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.939
 culture of language and values 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.740
 policies so many points that we 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.100
 gather that we do not have here 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.520
 need to emphasize them thanks sir 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.520

 this important factor commercial contract 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:34.560

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.970
 party policies 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.430
 I want to thank the government 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.100
 French we spent a few 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.960
 days here we were hard intense but 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.550
 have been extremely happy and 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.200
 satisfied with what we did 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.480
 during this visit 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.610
 France is a country that has always been 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.590
 very close to the equator it's a country 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.720
 which is dear to us is a country that is 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.280
 important to us we have indeed 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.870
 many businesses that are realized 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.640
 between our two countries 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.730
 we have French investments 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:53.050
 in Ecuador but I think we 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.820
 can do better so we thank 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.130
 france france again 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.200
 we actually signed two 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.850
 agreements today one in the field 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.460
 of science and technology 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.660
 another in the field of education 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.250
 it's actually a pretty thing 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.900
 curious because in general we sign 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.860
 rather cooperation agreements or 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.170
 commercial agreements 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.730
 but for us the science and the 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.320
 technology are the most 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.180
 important everything to do with the 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.850
 human talent that's what we 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.190
 believe and France is full of talent 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.320
 human beings and makes available to 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.920
 science is an insect so notes its 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.410
 technology 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.990
 so I want to thank again the 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.990
 French president and the French people 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:41.650
 we are waiting for you in nick author 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:43.060
 had only one correction and the other the 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.000
 president wants to forget to talk about 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:56.560
 the other agreement in popular economy and 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:57.570
 solidarity also evoked the conference 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.100
 on the climate 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.100
 since the equator is fully 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.810
 committed to this deadline and 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.530
 with the same principles as ours 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.030
 first in Peru for the year 2014 then 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.480
 then in paris everything 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.220
 the year 2015 and here we show our 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.160
 design of a freedom of information 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.590
 that is, heads of state do 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.590
 in the rain and the press and protect 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.200
 the interests of the masses and climates 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.340
 14 euros but who knows
