00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.040
 ari to play it in the middle for the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.510
 season number 4 letting it is 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.219
 clear from nothing, many people have already 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.780
 said I've been talking a lot of people 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.910
 when someone asks me about ska 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.310
 in anything just answer like that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.410
 I added skype mind on twitter on 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.460
 the organ of pilláis I usually help 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.760
 always what I can 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.350
 she told people not to use 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.420
 the same runas masters that I see 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.550
 some some failures that are not right 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.439
 in my masters I do not know that I do not know how much 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.700
 think that I do masters of everything 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.960
 this trying to do those of all 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.940
 champions of the game I can not know 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040
 how 120 champions are played or those who 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.020
 there is, I'm doing some 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.149
 basic things things very very very 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 basic so that the person who says 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.120
 I would like to buy the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 question of an input was how it 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.780
 play then look at my videos idea worth I'll go 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.809
 to set me standard stars because they are 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.129
 they are not shit but they are not 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.469
 best in the world but there is not a single 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.300
 shit is to say that more or less 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.620
 to start I say search put here 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.120
 I would put it here let's try what 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.690
 happens if I put it here and if it suits me better or 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.730
 worst 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.229
 they are basic masters how is it like 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.270
 a template this from this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.950
 Stitched Cando putting enough staff 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.929
 in requirement here you will find your 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.149
 masters that you really are 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.649
 masters yes they are the bitch supported by 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.320
 I say that it was not always too much 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.170
 I put some very good template things 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.210
 that what I say is like to start 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.799
 start from there you put the test there 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.929
 If you like the leaves if you do not remove him 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.729
 you are changing something but I 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.159
 I always say that with these master's degrees in 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.929
 my opinion you can play perfectly not 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.520
 they will change the damage a lot and you can 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.110
 use them any kind of problem worth 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.549
 what I mean by this is that I do not 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.560
 you always look at the putty that 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.840
 I put them, I'm a little bit like 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.369
 I kept saying okay I put this here 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.259
 this I put here this little there this that 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.849
 he has put here the I do not like it I prefer 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.039
 put it here and see what happens this is a 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.539
 starting pair watching what happens with what 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.849
 that you have arranged after 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.319
 make the changes is that what I 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.939
 I put it is not what you can for mass 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.229
 make the changes you want is worth 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.539
 that nothing started that I rolled up a 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.250
 little bit we're going to put 21 in attack and 9 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.659
 in defense it's worth it here we start 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.979
 putting the 4 in witchcraft for the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.170
 3 cooling reduction in force 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.030
 mental and 1 in attack to the weak point and 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.280
 people who put it here but I need 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.660
 price but here why because there are with 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.060
 a hit the down when you can of the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.840
 heart we will give everyone normally in 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.120
 a time 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.620
 the heart to someone normally everything 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.450
 our group is going to hit that 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.220
 person therefore that person is going to 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.519
 suffer much more than he would suffer 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.519
 if we did not have this master version 4 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.080
 for symptoms of damage worth so nothing 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.700
 we put this here let's go down here 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.620
 for portability we put 3 here for 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.840
 Do more damage or say less than 50% of 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.819
 life we ​​have one here for him if we kill 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.560
 recover life 3 here to have more 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.700
 ability power 1 here for when 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.470
 stick to hurt by putting the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.420
 skill and this day this to do more 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.459
 harm simply ok we're going to the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.110
 defense and just the usual for 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.180
 have more defense I've always said 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.980
 what are these masters have put 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.910
 There, I think that they are from 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.500
 the best subjects they have put 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.599
 because with this we gain enough life 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.510
 more than start and with this we have more 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.129
 armor to endure in late energy and 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.110
 whatever it is there are people who prefer 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.790
 putting it here to me does not just me 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.590
 convince to put it here simply 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.959
 because mana regeneration in law already 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.239
 we have a truth that beats at the minute 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.819
 20 we have no more mana regeneration 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.170
 so nothing I recommend these and if 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.610
 It is good to use them and if it is not right 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.829
 what I told you to do that in 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.209
 you do well for us because it is 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.990
 first in you and then I looked for 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.100
 help 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.360
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.360
 the video and until next time
