sex robots in relationship to the robots

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.720 
sex robots in relationship to the robots
is<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.420> principally<00:01:13.050> about<00:01:13.170> myself<00:01:14.010> rather

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
is not principally about myself rather

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.610 
is not principally about myself rather
than<00:01:14.970> understanding<00:01:15.870> of<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.200> people<00:01:16.230> are

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
than understanding of what people are

than understanding of what people are
like<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.010> I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.400> when<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:17.970> become

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
like and I think that when they become

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
like and I think that when they become
widely<00:01:18.930> available<00:01:19.250> it's<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.730> be

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
widely available it's just going to be

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.250 
widely available it's just going to be
too<00:01:20.970> difficult<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.420> people<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> turn<00:01:21.960> down

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
too difficult for people to turn down

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.650 
too difficult for people to turn down
it's<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> strictly<00:01:23.070> sexual<00:01:23.550> thing<00:01:23.790> look<00:01:24.570> at

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
it's not a strictly sexual thing look at

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.050 
it's not a strictly sexual thing look at
like<00:01:24.900> what's<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.410> on<00:01:25.620> in<00:01:25.680> I'll<00:01:26.550> just<00:01:26.610> say

might<00:01:46.230> think<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.710> their<00:01:46.890> friend<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.520> some

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
might think it's their friend at some

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.730 
might think it's their friend at some
point<00:01:47.940> if<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.150> talk<00:01:48.390> back<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.660> them<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.560> easy

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
point if you talk back to them it's easy

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.260 
point if you talk back to them it's easy
to<00:01:49.890> say<00:01:50.070> oh<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.460> not<00:01:50.610> really<00:01:50.820> thinking<00:01:51.090> those

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
to say oh it's not really thinking those

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.250 
to say oh it's not really thinking those
things<00:01:51.390> does<00:01:51.600> really<00:01:51.810> believe<00:01:52.020> those<00:01:52.200> things

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
things does really believe those things

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.190 
things does really believe those things
look<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.340> human<00:01:53.640> mind<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.150> not<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.480> driven<00:01:54.930> by

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
look the human mind is not is driven by

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.320 
look the human mind is not is driven by
free<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.800> most<00:01:55.980> people<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.310> most<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
free will as most people think most of

free will as most people think most of
what<00:01:57.510> we<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.960> free<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.410> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
what we see is free will is a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.050 
what we see is free will is a
rationalization<00:01:59.040> after<00:01:59.790> an<00:01:59.850> emotional

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
rationalization after an emotional

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
rationality we can think of robots -

relationship with a robot I would be

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699

whole point of having a fucking robot we

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.360 
whole point of having a fucking robot we
all<00:02:37.080> have<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.380> think<00:02:37.410> about<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.860> devil<00:02:38.130> yeah

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
can't replace human interaction with a

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.690 
can't replace human interaction with a
robot<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.290> has<00:02:43.500> artificial<00:02:43.980> intelligence

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
robot that has artificial intelligence

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.910 
robot that has artificial intelligence
like<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.850> guess<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.270> can<00:02:45.420> rise<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:46.260> sure<00:02:46.440> you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
like I guess you can rise it sure you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.250 
like I guess you can rise it sure you
can<00:02:47.100> convince<00:02:47.430> yourself<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:48.270> it's<00:02:48.630> real<00:02:48.900> but

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
can convince yourself that it's real but

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.600 
can convince yourself that it's real but
at<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.500> end<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.770> day<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.100> not<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.340> real

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
at the end of the day it's not a real

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.420 
at the end of the day it's not a real
person<00:02:51.060> who<00:02:51.090> has<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> spontaneous<00:02:51.930> reaction<00:02:52.430> to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
person who has a spontaneous reaction to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.830 
person who has a spontaneous reaction to
something<00:02:53.940> that's<00:02:54.060> happening<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.570> your<00:02:54.630> life

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
something that's happening in your life

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.520 
something that's happening in your life
code<00:02:55.140> spontaneity<00:02:56.000> why<00:02:57.000> not<00:02:57.209> oh<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.720> think<00:02:58.140> that

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
code spontaneity why not oh I think that

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.140 
code spontaneity why not oh I think that
look<00:02:58.920> look<00:02:59.160> there's<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.790> believe<00:03:00.060> it's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
look look there's a I believe it's

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.820 
look look there's a I believe it's
called<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.390> Turing<00:03:00.660> test<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.500> what<00:03:01.650> they<00:03:01.770> do

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
called the Turing test and what they do

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.070 
called the Turing test and what they do
is<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:02.610> have<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.120> communicate<00:03:03.720> through

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
is they have you communicate through

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.290 
is they have you communicate through
computer<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> person<00:03:05.160> or<00:03:05.340> robot<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.150> don't

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
computer to a person or robot you don't

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.910 
computer to a person or robot you don't
know<00:03:06.450> which<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.350> idea<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.680> they're

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
know which and the idea is they're

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.010 
know which and the idea is they're
trying<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.250> create<00:03:08.670> artificial<00:03:09.450> intelligence

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
trying to create artificial intelligence

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.140 
trying to create artificial intelligence
that<00:03:10.080> can<00:03:10.320> fool<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:11.130> think<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.459> at<00:03:11.550> least<00:03:11.640> 50%

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
that can fool I think it's at least 50%

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.970 
that can fool I think it's at least 50%
of<00:03:12.450> people<00:03:12.690> talk<00:03:12.930> with<00:03:13.050> them<00:03:13.170> into<00:03:13.440> thinking

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
of people talk with them into thinking

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.560 
of people talk with them into thinking
it's<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.190> human<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.970> it's<00:03:15.269> been<00:03:15.450> getting

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
it's a human and it's been getting

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.870 
it's a human and it's been getting
better<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.230> better<00:03:16.440> over<00:03:16.560> time<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.640> not

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
better and better over time it's not

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.970 
better and better over time it's not
long<00:03:18.269> off<00:03:18.480> if<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.590> might<00:03:19.769> already
