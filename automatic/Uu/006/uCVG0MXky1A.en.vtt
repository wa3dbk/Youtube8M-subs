going to adjust it exactly the way we
want<00:01:40.869> go<00:01:41.470> through<00:01:41.740> here<00:01:42.070> tone<00:01:42.850> down<00:01:43.060> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
want go through here tone down the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.240 
want go through here tone down the
texture<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.659> little<00:01:43.720> bit<00:01:43.960> maybe<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.470> little

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
texture a little bit maybe a little

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.850 
texture a little bit maybe a little
saturation<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.360> maybe<00:01:47.289> brighten<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:47.740> up

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
saturation to it maybe brighten it up

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.090 
saturation to it maybe brighten it up
just<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.310> tad<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:50.049> then<00:01:50.619> we<00:01:50.680> can<00:01:50.799> take<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.979> look

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
just a tad and then we can take a look

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.770 
just a tad and then we can take a look
at<00:01:51.189> what<00:01:51.280> we've<00:01:51.399> done<00:01:51.490> from<00:01:51.729> before<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.420> after

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
at what we've done from before to after

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.380 
at what we've done from before to after
so<00:01:53.770> everything<00:01:54.369> we<00:01:54.460> can<00:01:54.610> do<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:55.060> can<00:01:55.090> process

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
so everything we can do we can process

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.240 
so everything we can do we can process
it<00:01:55.659> really<00:01:55.930> really<00:01:56.140> quickly<00:01:56.350> because<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.130> the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
it really really quickly because of the

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.859 
it really really quickly because of the
Tegra<00:01:57.789> 3<00:01:57.820> processor<00:01:57.970> inside<00:01:58.539> of<00:01:58.659> here<00:01:58.780> it's

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
Tegra 3 processor inside of here it's

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:59.940 
Tegra 3 processor inside of here it's
really<00:01:59.080> really<00:01:59.289> fast<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.770> snappy

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
really really fast and snappy

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.529 
really really fast and snappy
everything's<00:02:00.429> done<00:02:00.550> in<00:02:00.640> real<00:02:00.789> time<00:02:01.000> we're

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
everything's done in real time we're

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.540 
everything's done in real time we're
processing<00:02:01.750> right<00:02:02.080> now<00:02:02.229> 16<00:02:02.770> megapixel<00:02:03.340> files

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
processing right now 16 megapixel files

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.919 
processing right now 16 megapixel files
you<00:02:03.850> can<00:02:03.940> see<00:02:04.090> how<00:02:04.210> quickly<00:02:04.450> were<00:02:04.659> able<00:02:04.840> to

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
you can see how quickly were able to

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.139 
you can see how quickly were able to
update<00:02:05.080> them<00:02:05.380> what<00:02:06.100> we're<00:02:06.250> done<00:02:06.399> with<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.729> we
