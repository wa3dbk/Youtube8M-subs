 and forget 1995 - in November 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.569
 there they speak of an iguana 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:55.550
 that generated me 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.649
 and how life began working as a pastor a decade ago on the ranch 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.699
 of sheep uncles Saturday was 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.360
 in vic the colorado where both came in search of the American dream 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.000
 such as these as well as sheep dogs are used by shepherds 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.930
 to follow his sheep 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.550
 who spend most of their time in the hills west of Colorado 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620
 here are the girls and 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.830
 and if it suits them 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.110
 yes 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.210
 not because I like lying on the grass 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.210
 we work legally established

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.360
 people who work in agriculture fields earn $ 9 with 88 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.270
 cents per hour while two shepherds 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.240
 they receive a salary of 4 dollars with 68 cents an hour and their contract 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.319
 specifies 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.089
 that should be available 24 hours a day seven days a week 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.890
 it's important to know 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 that there are things that are happening legally 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.570

 many years those who come people and of sure quality that this is not their 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.699
 case you can say no to 1 100 workers like 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.760
 in a statement to be like that 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.569
 on the sword 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.509
 according to the contra 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:16.090

 pastor has solar panels that allows him to have access to electricity 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.120
 the parity as well as the fact 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.129
 do not 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.009
 clark 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.009
 those things I do not know why they say everything we're not just slaves 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.059
 within the list they have 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.879
 It's not as lethal as three o'clock in the afternoon 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.380
 that then why 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.740
 a lot ovarian tissue growth 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.889
 finally I donate many things I believe that he is not a slave 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.889
 other people will be slave management 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.759
 I like it 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.069
 yes it will be 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.039
 ashtrays to be well their conditions and it seems that if your employer 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.259
 if you are trying to see if you are following the 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.710
 i of his fortune the mind that is not with a with us as examples 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.089
 they think they are not satisfied 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.849
 have not yet filed formal complaints 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.720
 one can just haha 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.550
 because they decide if we understand what 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.520
 they have a lot to lose 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.360
 and yes they do complain to what we can say that this one has its 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.889
 low rights of the l 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.539
 that factor should not be those low costs ahead they have to make their own 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:41.520
 decision 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.840
 whether to complain or not because those are the people who do things that 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.740
 you have 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.280
 the shepherds come in search of a dream 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.939
 had been found 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:54.599
 since his work as a pastor in colorado has allowed him to move forward 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.439
 to his seven children in Peru 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.529
 that was going down sent for work at the university because this one of d 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:05.349
 good to finish studying some are working in a teaching center 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.930
 produced ap with a dream 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.979
 but 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.979
 really the use of power and the senate 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.250
 because really the no no was what I thought I am here and 40m 9 years 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.699
 in United States 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.430
 with 29 years old 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.919
 and I've never left this job I'm happy doing this job 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.749
 comes from 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:36.509
 a life of sacrifice and solitude in which as in a Russian roulette the 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.119
 workers play all the benidormí in search of a better future 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.159
 I sent a court 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:44.129
 pioneer hands 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.330
 families I do not want 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.960
 they want to come to work here 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.419
 they want to excel 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.520
 up to 10 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.080
 31 of 2010 this 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.380
 and until October 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.560
 also hired 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.110
 ensures david showing his contract that has just been renewed for another year 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.030
 same keeps under your address next to your cell phone 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.050
 assistance 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.090
 I take estro that good for the children of st 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.649
 It is also an extra patron of fresh fruit 

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:15.730
 you can notice them if you can if you can transcend conditions like this 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.690
 you have to continue with your business 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.690
 but in a day no no no it is not very common in Yemen 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.680
 so so that is false 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.960
 a luck with which according to colorado of 12 months 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.979
 there have not run many shepherds who like life 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:34.639
 they work for their families without rest after being well here to make 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.130
 all right 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.540
 to the Peruvians that are not we are really but have had 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.210
 jorge rossi the others 19 

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:47.589
 in this report it became public some state legislators have been 

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:50.900
 working to review existing regulations 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.449
 in this way look for a way to avoid possible abuses to shepherds 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:59.490
 who by the nature of their work depend completely on their patterns 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.880
 reported out less there will be red univision news 

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:08.039
 we have seen that the pattern is good if there are hand patterns if you work in 

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:09.039
 the field and has been 

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:14.529
 for many you can call 1 808 6 4 43 30 to make a complaint
