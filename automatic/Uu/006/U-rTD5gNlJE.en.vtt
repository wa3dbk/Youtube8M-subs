the photographer that autographs is the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.259 
the photographer that autographs is the
original<00:00:12.590> scriptures<00:00:13.590> why<00:00:14.549> don't<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:15.030> have

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
original scriptures why don't we have

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.040 
original scriptures why don't we have
the<00:00:15.890> autographs<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.070> originals<00:00:17.930> well<00:00:18.930> when

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the autographs the originals well when

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.570 
the autographs the originals well when
you<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.410> about<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:19.949> very<00:00:20.100> unlikely

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
you think about it it's very unlikely

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.420 
you think about it it's very unlikely
that<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:21.060> would<00:00:21.240> ancient<00:00:22.140> writing<00:00:22.890> materials

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
that we would ancient writing materials

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.220 
that we would ancient writing materials
did<00:00:23.670> not<00:00:23.850> last<00:00:24.060> particularly<00:00:24.750> long<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.050> think

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
did not last particularly long you think

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.670 
did not last particularly long you think
of<00:00:25.320> something

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
of something

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.790 
of something
papyrus<00:00:26.570> or<00:00:27.570> even<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.960> ink<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.349> they<00:00:28.500> use<00:00:28.650> on

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
papyrus or even the ink that they use on

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.479 
papyrus or even the ink that they use on
it<00:00:28.920> would<00:00:29.099> fade<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.730> virus<00:00:30.060> over<00:00:30.210> time<00:00:31.489> so

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
it would fade the virus over time so

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.209 
it would fade the virus over time so
therefore<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.809> less<00:00:34.500> manuscripts

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
therefore we see less manuscripts

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.920 
therefore we see less manuscripts
written<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.610> papyrus<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.510> more<00:00:36.719> on

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
written on papyrus and we see more on

written on papyrus and we see more on
vellum<00:00:37.170> some<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:37.829> durable

life and persecution these were not
particularly<00:00:48.270> wealthy<00:00:48.510> people<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.649> they

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
particularly wealthy people so they

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
particularly wealthy people so they
didn't<00:00:50.039> necessarily<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.510> time<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.809> the

something under those circumstances it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
something under those circumstances it
was<00:00:55.920> usually<00:00:56.309> done<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.120> hurry<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
was usually done but of a hurry and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
was usually done but of a hurry and
often<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.050> secret<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> try<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.980> keep<00:00:59.100> these

often in secret to try and keep these

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.590 
often in secret to try and keep these
documents<00:00:59.850> from<00:01:00.050> authorities<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.649> also<00:01:02.600> the

weren't intended to be Holy Scripture

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.200 
weren't intended to be Holy Scripture
from<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> beginning<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
from the beginning if you think of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
from the beginning if you think of
Paul's<00:01:09.450> writings<00:01:09.570> these<00:01:10.080> were<00:01:10.320> letters<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
Paul's writings these were letters that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.399 
Paul's writings these were letters that
were<00:01:11.010> meant<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.460> circulated<00:01:12.290> within<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409

church<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> copied<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.729> sent<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.689> there

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
church and copied and sent on so there

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.270 
church and copied and sent on so there
were<00:01:15.930> more<00:01:16.110> working<00:01:16.560> documents<00:01:17.130> than

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
were more working documents than

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
were more working documents than
necessarily<00:01:17.729> something<00:01:18.060> needs<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.570> saved

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
necessarily something needs to be saved

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.289 
necessarily something needs to be saved
if<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> Old<00:01:20.040> Testament<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
if you think of the Old Testament the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
if you think of the Old Testament the
Jewish<00:01:21.659> history<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.320> such<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.979> even

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
Jewish history is just such that even

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
Jewish history is just such that even
though<00:01:23.340> they<00:01:23.490> had<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> tremendous<00:01:24.000> Crabill

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
though they had a tremendous Crabill

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.289 
though they had a tremendous Crabill
tradition<00:01:25.729> persecution<00:01:26.729> especially<00:01:27.210> of

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
tradition persecution especially of

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
tradition persecution especially of
their<00:01:27.420> holy<00:01:27.659> places<00:01:28.020> where<00:01:28.439> these<00:01:28.590> scrolls

their holy places where these scrolls

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.940 
their holy places where these scrolls
were<00:01:29.340> kept<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.970> burning<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.950> torah

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
were kept you know burning of torah

scrolls and things like that that was
just<00:01:34.590> happening<00:01:34.950> all<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> time<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.090> it's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
just happening all the time and so it's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.690 
just happening all the time and so it's
understandable<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> don't<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.280> the

original text from such a long time ago
and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:42.000> finally<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> some<00:01:43.409> people<00:01:43.649> would<00:01:43.799> say

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and then finally I some people would say

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
and then finally I some people would say
you<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> hand<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> God's<00:01:45.030> providence<00:01:45.329> in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you see the hand of God's providence in

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
you see the hand of God's providence in
this<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.380> imagine<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.100> did<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
this because imagine if we did have the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.060 
this because imagine if we did have the
autographs<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> temptation<00:01:49.829> for
