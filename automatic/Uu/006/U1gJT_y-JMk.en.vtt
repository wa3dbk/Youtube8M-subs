know<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.880> fake<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.450> is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
know that it's fake and this is

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200 
know that it's fake and this is
definitely<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.110> surefire<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.909> really

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
definitely a surefire way and the really

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.770 
definitely a surefire way and the really
good<00:01:57.630> replicas<00:01:58.469> won't<00:01:59.189> do<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.000> there's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
good replicas won't do this but there's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.149 
good replicas won't do this but there's
some<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.200> bold<00:02:01.439> enough<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.979> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
some that are bold enough to do this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.550 
some that are bold enough to do this
like<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.759> go<00:02:02.939> online<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.079> match<00:02:04.290> up

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
like if you go online and you match up

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.679 
like if you go online and you match up
the<00:02:04.649> name<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> polish<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.149> actual

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the name of the polish to the actual

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.749 
the name of the polish to the actual
color<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.320> see<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:08.459> don't<00:02:08.580> match

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
color that you see and they don't match

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.820 
color that you see and they don't match
up<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:09.420> that's<00:02:09.720> clearly<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
up like that's clearly a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.100 
up like that's clearly a
that's<00:02:12.370> clearly<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.790> fake<00:02:13.120> OPI<00:02:13.510> nail<00:02:13.720> polish

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
that's clearly a fake OPI nail polish

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.930 
that's clearly a fake OPI nail polish
another<00:02:14.470> less<00:02:14.740> obvious<00:02:14.770> way<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:15.490> tell<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
another less obvious way to tell the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.820 
another less obvious way to tell the
difference<00:02:15.970> between<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.630> fake<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.170> real<00:02:17.200> OPI

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
difference between a fake and real OPI

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.670 
difference between a fake and real OPI
is<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.210> real<00:02:19.480> OPI<00:02:19.870> nail<00:02:20.110> polish<00:02:20.500> will

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
is that a real OPI nail polish will

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.970 
is that a real OPI nail polish will
actually<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.400> serial<00:02:22.030> number<00:02:22.650> right<00:02:23.650> down

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
actually have a serial number right down

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.610 
actually have a serial number right down
here<00:02:24.490> if<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.600> see<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.960> it's<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.440> black

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
here if you can see that it's in black

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.610 
here if you can see that it's in black
it'll<00:02:27.370> have<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.520> serial<00:02:28.000> number<00:02:28.030> right<00:02:28.540> there

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
it'll have a serial number right there

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.980 
it'll have a serial number right there
also<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.100> code<00:02:30.340> should<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.670> printed<00:02:31.300> at<00:02:31.480> the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
also the code should be printed at the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.740 
also the code should be printed at the
bottom<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.310> nail<00:02:33.430> polish<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.510> like

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
bottom of the nail polish if it's like

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.990 
bottom of the nail polish if it's like
near<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.260> top<00:02:35.500> or<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.160> side<00:02:36.280> or<00:02:36.790> somewhere

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
near the top or on the side or somewhere

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.660 
near the top or on the side or somewhere
else<00:02:37.120> then<00:02:37.960> it's<00:02:38.410> not<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.920> real<00:02:39.280> one

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
else then it's not a real one

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.850 
else then it's not a real one
well<00:02:39.850> as<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.450> serial<00:02:40.990> number<00:02:41.380> it'll<00:02:41.620> be<00:02:41.740> the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
well as a serial number it'll be the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.920 
well as a serial number it'll be the
same<00:02:42.070> serial<00:02:42.490> number<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:42.940> it'll<00:02:43.090> be<00:02:43.240> on<00:02:43.450> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
same serial number and it'll be on the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.530 
same serial number and it'll be on the
bottom<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.860> nail<00:02:45.010> polish

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.860 

another<00:02:50.230> less<00:02:50.560> obvious<00:02:50.590> indicator<00:02:51.549> is<00:02:51.879> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
another less obvious indicator is the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.710 
another less obvious indicator is the
actual<00:02:53.500> brush<00:02:53.950> OPI<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.760> kind<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.090> famous<00:02:55.510> for

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
actual brush OPI is kind of famous for

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.899 
actual brush OPI is kind of famous for
their<00:02:56.500> brush<00:02:56.829> that's<00:02:57.250> one<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.670> things

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
their brush that's one of the things

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.420 
their brush that's one of the things
that<00:02:58.120> makes<00:02:58.329> them<00:02:58.629> you<00:02:59.620> know<00:02:59.709> stand<00:03:00.010> out<00:03:00.159> one

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
that makes them you know stand out one

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.429 
that makes them you know stand out one
of<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.610> things<00:03:00.819> significant<00:03:01.659> of<00:03:01.810> an<00:03:01.900> OPI<00:03:02.200> nail

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
of the things significant of an OPI nail

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.490 
of the things significant of an OPI nail
polish<00:03:02.829> but<00:03:03.430> if<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.879> can<00:03:04.060> see<00:03:04.329> their<00:03:04.930> brushes

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
polish but if you can see their brushes

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.920 
polish but if you can see their brushes
are<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:05.799> little<00:03:06.310> bit<00:03:06.489> wider<00:03:06.849> than<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.569> normal

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
are a little bit wider than the normal

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.190 
are a little bit wider than the normal
brush<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.680> if<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.760> get<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.180> nail<00:03:10.390> polish<00:03:10.690> and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
brush and if you get a nail polish and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.670 
brush and if you get a nail polish and
the<00:03:11.920> brush<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.640> give<00:03:13.209> money<00:03:13.450> your<00:03:13.690> real<00:03:14.049> OPI

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the brush like give money your real OPI

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.610 
the brush like give money your real OPI
nail<00:03:14.829> polishes<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:16.019> compare<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.140> brush<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.590> a

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
nail polishes and compare the brush to a

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.319 
nail polishes and compare the brush to a
fake<00:03:17.920> brush<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:18.790> will<00:03:18.939> see<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
fake brush and you will see that the

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.440 
fake brush and you will see that the
brushes<00:03:19.720> are<00:03:19.870> different<00:03:20.319> OPI<00:03:21.250> brushes<00:03:22.209> are

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
brushes are different OPI brushes are

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.530 
brushes are different OPI brushes are
pretty<00:03:22.720> hard<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.049> duplicate<00:03:23.609> so<00:03:24.609> if<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.329> get<00:03:25.510> a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
pretty hard to duplicate so if you get a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.880 
pretty hard to duplicate so if you get a
fake<00:03:25.810> one<00:03:25.959> you'll<00:03:26.109> see<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.500> brush<00:03:26.709> is

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
fake one you'll see that the brush is

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.399 
fake one you'll see that the brush is
completely<00:03:27.340> different<00:03:27.519> than<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.389> real<00:03:28.569> OPI<00:03:28.989> a

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
completely different than the real OPI a

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.800 
completely different than the real OPI a
really<00:03:29.980> good<00:03:30.159> way<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.370> figure<00:03:31.239> out<00:03:31.389> if<00:03:31.659> you

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
really good way to figure out if you

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.580 
really good way to figure out if you
have<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:32.019> fake<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:33.159> look<00:03:33.489> at<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.810> top<00:03:35.109> part

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
have a fake is to look at the top part

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.819 
have a fake is to look at the top part
of<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:36.430> brush<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:37.120> it's<00:03:37.840> actually<00:03:38.319> so<00:03:38.560> small

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
of the brush and it's actually so small

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.500 
of the brush and it's actually so small
I<00:03:39.069> can't<00:03:39.099> even<00:03:39.639> show<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.269> on<00:03:40.299> this

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
I can't even show it to you on this

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.800 
I can't even show it to you on this
camera<00:03:40.840> but<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:42.069> if<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:42.790> remove<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.629> nail

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
camera but the if you remove the nail

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.339 
camera but the if you remove the nail
polish<00:03:44.290> off<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.940> plastic<00:03:46.810> part<00:03:47.049> of<00:03:47.260> the

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
polish off of the plastic part of the

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.259 
polish off of the plastic part of the
brush<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:47.950> if<00:03:48.099> you<00:03:48.190> just<00:03:48.310> wipe<00:03:48.579> it<00:03:48.760> off<00:03:48.940> like
