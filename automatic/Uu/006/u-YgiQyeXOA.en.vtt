oh<00:00:28.910> hey<00:00:29.329> just<00:00:29.570> because<00:00:29.749> I<00:00:29.869> didn't<00:00:30.050> have<00:00:30.169> an

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
oh hey just because I didn't have an

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.390 
oh hey just because I didn't have an
understanding<00:00:30.619> of<00:00:32.260> focal<00:00:33.260> distance<00:00:33.650> and<00:00:34.040> how

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
understanding of focal distance and how

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.550 
understanding of focal distance and how
close<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:35.000> could<00:00:35.150> focus<00:00:35.570> with<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:35.780> camera<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:36.530> a

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
close you could focus with a camera to a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.920 
close you could focus with a camera to a
subject<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:38.180> difference<00:00:38.480> between<00:00:38.600> macro

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
subject the difference between macro

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.500 
subject the difference between macro
photography<00:00:39.230> versus<00:00:39.950> a<00:00:39.980> wider<00:00:40.510> viewpoint

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
photography versus a wider viewpoint

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.750 
photography versus a wider viewpoint
with<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.750> broad<00:00:42.290> landscape<00:00:42.740> and<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.610> what

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
with a broad landscape and and what

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.320 
with a broad landscape and and what
worked<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.310> you<00:00:46.310> know<00:00:46.430> that<00:00:47.060> was<00:00:47.180> really

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
worked and so you know that was really

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.460 
worked and so you know that was really
disheartening<00:00:47.570> I<00:00:47.990> actually<00:00:48.140> stopped

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
disheartening I actually stopped

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.230 
disheartening I actually stopped
photographers<00:00:49.010> like<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:49.550> is<00:00:49.700> like<00:00:49.910> just<00:00:50.090> too

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
photographers like this is like just too

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.890 
photographers like this is like just too
much<00:00:50.390> work

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
much work

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.960 
much work
but<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.440> reality<00:00:51.890> is<00:00:51.980> is<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:52.190> if<00:00:52.490> you<00:00:52.700> keep

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
but the reality is is that if you keep

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.140 
but the reality is is that if you keep
plugging<00:00:53.390> away<00:00:53.510> at<00:00:53.840> it<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:54.880> don't<00:00:55.880> take

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
plugging away at it and don't take

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.040 
plugging away at it and don't take
failure<00:00:56.690> as<00:00:57.250> as<00:00:58.250> an<00:00:58.820> excuse<00:00:59.330> to<00:00:59.360> stop<00:00:59.780> I<00:01:00.020> mean

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
failure as as an excuse to stop I mean

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.540 
failure as as an excuse to stop I mean
you<00:01:00.440> have<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:00.680> look<00:01:00.770> at<00:01:00.890> that<00:01:01.010> as<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.130> stepping

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
you have to look at that as a stepping

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.539 
you have to look at that as a stepping
stone<00:01:01.790> no<00:01:02.750> great<00:01:03.020> photographers<00:01:03.710> were

that's<00:01:42.409> a<00:01:42.499> very<00:01:42.530> interesting<00:01:42.799> question

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
that's a very interesting question

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.910 
that's a very interesting question
because<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:44.270> number<00:01:44.899> one<00:01:45.049> problem<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:45.469> I

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
because the number one problem that I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.309 
because the number one problem that I
see<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.850> lot<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.060> photographers<00:01:47.569> that<00:01:47.899> they

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
see a lot of photographers that they

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.499 
see a lot of photographers that they
have<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.799> that<00:01:48.979> they<00:01:49.850> don't<00:01:49.999> quite<00:01:50.149> change

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
have is that they don't quite change

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.260 
have is that they don't quite change
gears<00:01:50.899> that<00:01:51.469> quickly<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.159> I<00:01:52.189> think<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.729> it's

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
gears that quickly so I think that it's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.129 
gears that quickly so I think that it's
important<00:01:53.600> for<00:01:53.630> photographers<00:01:54.049> to

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
important for photographers to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.709 
important for photographers to
understand<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.799> is<00:01:54.979> normal<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:56.479> that

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
understand that that is normal and that

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.330 
understand that that is normal and that
is<00:01:56.899> a<00:01:56.929> normal<00:01:57.499> part<00:01:57.679> of<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:57.950> creation<00:01:58.189> process

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
is a normal part of the creation process

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.919 
is a normal part of the creation process
that<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.149> know<00:01:59.240> you're<00:01:59.359> not<00:01:59.450> going<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.689> jump
