up<00:04:55.930> completing<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.560> wall<00:04:56.770> with<00:04:56.950> a<00:04:57.180> supply

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
up completing that wall with a supply

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.230 
up completing that wall with a supply
depot<00:04:58.210> not<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.990> find<00:04:59.140> out<00:04:59.320> soon<00:05:00.060> but<00:05:01.060> this

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
depot not to find out soon but this

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.710 
depot not to find out soon but this
should<00:05:01.450> be<00:05:01.720> enough<00:05:02.140> for<00:05:03.030> anti<00:05:04.030> vulture<00:05:04.479> right

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
should be enough for anti vulture right

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.980 
should be enough for anti vulture right
now<00:05:05.010> this<00:05:06.010> bunker<00:05:06.610> at<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.880> front

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
now this bunker at the front

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.080 
now this bunker at the front
I'd<00:05:08.560> be<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.710> bit<00:05:08.890> tricky<00:05:09.100> what<00:05:09.670> the<00:05:09.790> vultures

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
I'd be a bit tricky what the vultures

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.760 
I'd be a bit tricky what the vultures
starts<00:05:10.480> trying<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:10.900> skirt<00:05:11.170> by<00:05:11.380> there<00:05:11.590> is<00:05:11.650> the

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
starts trying to skirt by there is the

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.770 
starts trying to skirt by there is the
first<00:05:12.010> vulture<00:05:12.490> coming<00:05:13.240> in<00:05:13.390> it<00:05:13.540> could

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
first vulture coming in it could

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.470 
first vulture coming in it could
definitely<00:05:14.080> sneak<00:05:14.680> right<00:05:14.890> by<00:05:15.190> this<00:05:15.940> bunker

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
definitely sneak right by this bunker

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.690 
definitely sneak right by this bunker
it'll<00:05:16.720> take<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:16.900> few<00:05:16.990> shots<00:05:17.170> of<00:05:17.590> course<00:05:17.860> but

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
it'll take a few shots of course but

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.860 
it'll take a few shots of course but
sneaking<00:05:19.000> inside<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.480> main<00:05:19.630> would<00:05:19.780> be

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
sneaking inside the main would be

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.000 
sneaking inside the main would be
devastating<00:05:20.500> for<00:05:20.880> fantasy<00:05:22.320> so<00:05:23.320> he's<00:05:23.470> made<00:05:23.650> the

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
devastating for fantasy so he's made the

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.760 
devastating for fantasy so he's made the
right<00:05:24.250> wall<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.970> think<00:05:25.450> it's<00:05:25.630> pretty<00:05:25.810> tough<00:05:26.110> for

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
right wall I think it's pretty tough for

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.620 
right wall I think it's pretty tough for
the<00:05:26.830> vulture<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:27.520> go<00:05:27.610> all<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.060> way<00:05:28.090> around<00:05:28.270> the

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
the vulture to go all the way around the

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.620 
the vulture to go all the way around the
left<00:05:28.870> side<00:05:29.020> of<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.620> bunker<00:05:30.180> without<00:05:31.180> fantasy

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
left side of that bunker without fantasy

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.150 
left side of that bunker without fantasy
knowing<00:05:31.930> about<00:05:32.020> it<00:05:32.170> and<00:05:32.350> pulling<00:05:32.500> SUVs<00:05:32.980> off

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
knowing about it and pulling SUVs off

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.610 
knowing about it and pulling SUVs off
the<00:05:33.280> line<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.610> block<00:05:33.900> for<00:05:34.900> it<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.440> once

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
the line to block for it the once

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.350 
the line to block for it the once
vulture<00:05:35.950> speed<00:05:36.220> comes<00:05:36.490> up<00:05:36.700> this<00:05:37.000> might<00:05:37.180> be<00:05:37.210> a

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
vulture speed comes up this might be a

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.580 
vulture speed comes up this might be a
different<00:05:37.540> story<00:05:37.920> for<00:05:38.920> fantasy<00:05:40.140> okay<00:05:41.140> action

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590

wins if brush wins the winners in the
next<00:06:02.530> two<00:06:02.740> games<00:06:03.040> will<00:06:03.580> move<00:06:03.760> out<00:06:03.940> into<00:06:04.150> the

next two games will move out into the

next two games will move out into the
round<00:06:04.450> of<00:06:04.600> eight<00:06:04.750> which<00:06:05.350> is<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.560> very

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
round of eight which is a very

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.660 
round of eight which is a very
interesting<00:06:07.680> type<00:06:08.680> of<00:06:08.860> situation<00:06:09.430> because

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
interesting type of situation because

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.310 
interesting type of situation because
minion<00:06:10.090> rush<00:06:10.300> will<00:06:10.630> be<00:06:10.720> the<00:06:10.840> next<00:06:10.930> one<00:06:11.230> the

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
minion rush will be the next one the

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.990 
minion rush will be the next one the
winner<00:06:11.470> that<00:06:11.740> will<00:06:11.890> move<00:06:12.010> out<00:06:12.220> and<00:06:12.370> great

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
winner that will move out and great

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.550 
winner that will move out and great
versus<00:06:13.330> fantasy<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.900> last<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.290> winner<00:06:14.470> of

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
versus fantasy the last the winner of

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.930 
versus fantasy the last the winner of
that<00:06:14.800> moves<00:06:15.130> out<00:06:15.250> into<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.610> round<00:06:15.730> of<00:06:15.820> eight

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
that moves out into the round of eight

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.120 
that moves out into the round of eight
so<00:06:16.600> that's<00:06:16.750> what<00:06:16.900> happens<00:06:17.170> if<00:06:17.380> rush<00:06:17.650> when's

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
so that's what happens if rush when's

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.670 
so that's what happens if rush when's
this<00:06:18.370> TBT<00:06:19.030> but<00:06:19.750> you<00:06:19.870> see<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.230> fancy<00:06:20.530> is

terrorist tactics with the vultures how

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.220 
terrorist tactics with the vultures how
probably<00:06:33.790> researching<00:06:34.330> vulture<00:06:34.630> speed<00:06:34.930> right

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
probably researching vulture speed right

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.670 
probably researching vulture speed right
now<00:06:35.470> well<00:06:36.310> maybe<00:06:36.640> the<00:06:36.820> siege<00:06:37.290> he<00:06:38.290> wants<00:06:38.530> to<00:06:38.590> get

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
now well maybe the siege he wants to get

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.110 
now well maybe the siege he wants to get
the<00:06:38.830> defense<00:06:39.160> on<00:06:39.400> since<00:06:39.670> he<00:06:39.760> went<00:06:39.880> for<00:06:40.060> an

the defense on since he went for an

the defense on since he went for an
earlier<00:06:40.420> second<00:06:40.930> base<00:06:41.110> rush<00:06:42.040> has<00:06:42.310> his<00:06:42.760> second
