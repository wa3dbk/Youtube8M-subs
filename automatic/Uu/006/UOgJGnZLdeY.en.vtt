to go back because as we move forward

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.960

we're<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.539> building<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.350> those

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
we're going to be building on those

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.429 
we're going to be building on those
principles<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> strong

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
principles and if we don't have a strong

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.380 
principles and if we don't have a strong
foundation<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:26.310> when<00:00:26.519> bad<00:00:26.730> habits<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
foundation that's when bad habits and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.380 
foundation that's when bad habits and
poor<00:00:27.900> execution<00:00:28.170> creep<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.920> all<00:00:29.130> right<00:00:29.400> so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
poor execution creep in all right so

separate<00:03:51.770> sixteenth<00:03:52.250> notes<00:03:52.550> I'm<00:03:53.270> trying<00:03:53.660> to

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
separate sixteenth notes I'm trying to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.800 
separate sixteenth notes I'm trying to
keep<00:03:53.840> them<00:03:54.020> fairly<00:03:54.350> close<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:54.950> each<00:03:55.070> other<00:03:55.810> but

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
keep them fairly close to each other but

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.170 
keep them fairly close to each other but
I'm<00:03:57.050> also<00:03:57.230> not<00:03:57.670> double/double<00:03:58.670> stopping<00:03:59.090> it

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
I'm also not double/double stopping it

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.350 
I'm also not double/double stopping it
and<00:03:59.950> hitting<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.160> drum<00:04:01.430> at<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.790> exact<00:04:02.150> same

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
and hitting the drum at the exact same

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.230 
and hitting the drum at the exact same
time<00:04:02.600> with<00:04:02.780> both<00:04:02.960> steps<00:04:03.320> intentionally

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
time with both steps intentionally

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.850 
time with both steps intentionally
alright<00:04:05.240> I<00:04:05.270> have<00:04:05.480> my<00:04:05.600> metronome<00:04:05.990> set<00:04:06.200> for<00:04:06.380> 70

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
alright I have my metronome set for 70

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.060 
alright I have my metronome set for 70
beats<00:04:07.070> per<00:04:07.220> minute<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:08.810> it's<00:04:09.290> gonna<00:04:09.440> give<00:04:09.710> us<00:04:09.740> a

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
beats per minute so it's gonna give us a

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.010 
beats per minute so it's gonna give us a
good<00:04:10.460> steady<00:04:10.790> beat<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.420> start<00:04:11.780> on<00:04:11.900> these

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
good steady beat to start on these

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.690 
good steady beat to start on these
flam's<00:04:12.350> because<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.010> can<00:04:13.160> be<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.340> little<00:04:13.580> bit

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
flam's because it can be a little bit

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.220 
flam's because it can be a little bit
difficult<00:04:13.910> because<00:04:14.240> first<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:14.900> have<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.080> get

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
difficult because first you have to get

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.570 
difficult because first you have to get
your<00:04:15.410> brain<00:04:15.590> Raptor<00:04:15.980> all<00:04:16.130> kind<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.460> the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
your brain Raptor all kind of the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.610 
your brain Raptor all kind of the
mechanics<00:04:17.120> of<00:04:17.210> what<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.989> is<00:04:18.020> that<00:04:18.170> we're<00:04:18.440> doing

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
mechanics of what it is that we're doing

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.979 
mechanics of what it is that we're doing
and<00:04:19.489> then<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:19.760> have<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:20.210> get<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.510> somehow<00:04:20.930> to

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
and then you have to get that somehow to

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.680 
and then you have to get that somehow to
transfer<00:04:21.560> down<00:04:21.710> into<00:04:21.980> your<00:04:22.070> hands<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:22.730> become

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
transfer down into your hands and become

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.180 
transfer down into your hands and become
a<00:04:23.720> little<00:04:23.930> more<00:04:24.020> coordinated<00:04:24.740> with<00:04:24.890> it

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
a little more coordinated with it

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.070 
a little more coordinated with it
once<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:25.730> understand<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.510> flam<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:26.990> you

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
once you understand the flam and you

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.870 
once you understand the flam and you
play<00:04:27.290> it<00:04:27.410> enough<00:04:27.620> times<00:04:27.890> it<00:04:28.130> becomes<00:04:28.370> smoother

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
play it enough times it becomes smoother

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.350 
play it enough times it becomes smoother
and<00:04:29.060> you're<00:04:29.210> it's<00:04:29.840> easier<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:31.130> execute<00:04:31.610> but

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
and you're it's easier to to execute but

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.880 
and you're it's easier to to execute but
for<00:04:32.540> right<00:04:32.600> now<00:04:32.660> let's<00:04:33.020> keep<00:04:33.170> it<00:04:33.320> at<00:04:33.410> 70<00:04:33.740> beats

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
for right now let's keep it at 70 beats

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.280 
for right now let's keep it at 70 beats
per<00:04:34.010> minute<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.460> we'll<00:04:34.670> do<00:04:34.930> eight<00:04:35.930> with<00:04:36.260> the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
per minute and we'll do eight with the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.110 
per minute and we'll do eight with the
right<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.920> then<00:04:37.100> eight<00:04:37.310> with<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.610> left<00:04:37.850> all

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
right and then eight with the left all

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:54.030 
right and then eight with the left all
right<00:04:39.160> ready<00:04:40.160> go<00:04:40.810> right<00:04:47.140> left

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:09.670 

right<00:05:07.180> let's<00:05:08.180> try<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.419> alternative<00:05:08.960> right<00:05:09.320> I

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
right let's try to alternative right I

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:23.530 
right let's try to alternative right I
left<00:05:10.190> right<00:05:11.000> left<00:05:22.060> so<00:05:23.060> if<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.240> continue

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
left right left so if you continue

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.540 
left right left so if you continue
practicing<00:05:23.810> like<00:05:24.320> that<00:05:24.590> for<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.130> next<00:05:25.340> week

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
practicing like that for the next week

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.610 
practicing like that for the next week
then<00:05:25.820> I'm<00:05:26.090> pretty<00:05:26.389> sure<00:05:26.630> that<00:05:26.780> you'll<00:05:26.960> become

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
then I'm pretty sure that you'll become

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.020 
then I'm pretty sure that you'll become
a<00:05:27.770> little<00:05:27.919> more<00:05:28.040> familiar<00:05:28.160> and<00:05:28.639> a<00:05:28.700> little<00:05:28.910> bit

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
a little more familiar and a little bit

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.610 
a little more familiar and a little bit
more<00:05:29.210> comfortable<00:05:29.540> with<00:05:29.720> your<00:05:29.960> flans

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.140 

now<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.430> next<00:05:34.670> note<00:05:34.790> that<00:05:34.880> we're<00:05:35.000> going<00:05:35.090> to

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
now the next note that we're going to

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.420 
now the next note that we're going to
look<00:05:35.300> at<00:05:35.450> is<00:05:35.600> called<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.990> drag<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:37.070> drag<00:05:37.280> is

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
look at is called the drag the drag is

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.800 
look at is called the drag the drag is
similar<00:05:37.730> to<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:37.940> flam<00:05:38.180> in<00:05:38.420> that<00:05:38.570> there's<00:05:38.750> a

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
similar to the flam in that there's a

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.110 
similar to the flam in that there's a
main<00:05:39.020> note<00:05:39.290> and<00:05:39.680> there's<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.070> grace<00:05:40.340> note<00:05:40.610> but

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
main note and there's a grace note but

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.820 
main note and there's a grace note but
the<00:05:41.210> grace<00:05:41.390> note<00:05:41.600> in<00:05:41.750> this<00:05:41.900> instance<00:05:42.590> for<00:05:42.800> a

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
the grace note in this instance for a

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.890 
the grace note in this instance for a
drag<00:05:43.250> is<00:05:43.610> going<00:05:43.820> to<00:05:43.880> be<00:05:43.970> a<00:05:44.000> dead<00:05:44.270> stick<00:05:44.540> which

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
drag is going to be a dead stick which

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.470 
drag is going to be a dead stick which
means<00:05:45.110> I'm<00:05:45.260> just<00:05:45.560> touching<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.640> on<00:05:46.820> to<00:05:47.150> the

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
means I'm just touching it on to the

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.240 
means I'm just touching it on to the
drum<00:05:47.660> head<00:05:47.840> and<00:05:47.900> trying<00:05:48.740> not<00:05:48.890> to<00:05:48.950> let<00:05:49.190> it

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
drum head and trying not to let it

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.540 
drum head and trying not to let it
bounce<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:50.260> try<00:05:51.260> not<00:05:51.380> to<00:05:51.440> let<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:51.650> buzz<00:05:51.980> but

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
bounce and try not to let it buzz but

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.310 
bounce and try not to let it buzz but
trying<00:05:52.790> to<00:05:52.820> just<00:05:53.030> be<00:05:53.180> a<00:05:53.210> dead<00:05:53.450> stick<00:05:53.810> to<00:05:53.990> it<00:05:54.110> all

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
trying to just be a dead stick to it all

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.880 
trying to just be a dead stick to it all
right<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:56.300> a<00:05:56.570> right<00:05:56.780> handed<00:05:57.140> drag<00:05:57.440> would<00:05:57.740> look

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
right so a right handed drag would look

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.810 
right so a right handed drag would look
like<00:05:58.040> this<00:06:02.950> left<00:06:03.950> handed<00:06:04.310> drag<00:06:04.490> would<00:06:04.700> look

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
like this left handed drag would look

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:11.050 
like this left handed drag would look
like<00:06:04.970> this<00:06:09.340> so<00:06:10.340> we're<00:06:10.550> going<00:06:10.640> to<00:06:10.700> do<00:06:10.790> the<00:06:10.880> same

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
like this so we're going to do the same

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.130 
like this so we're going to do the same
thing<00:06:11.270> we're<00:06:11.420> going<00:06:11.510> to<00:06:11.570> have<00:06:11.630> my<00:06:11.840> metronome

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
thing we're going to have my metronome

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.800 
thing we're going to have my metronome
at<00:06:12.350> 70<00:06:12.800> beats<00:06:12.980> per<00:06:13.100> minute<00:06:13.490> and<00:06:13.760> we're<00:06:14.720> gonna

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
at 70 beats per minute and we're gonna

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.410 
at 70 beats per minute and we're gonna
do<00:06:15.080> eight<00:06:15.710> with<00:06:16.040> the<00:06:16.190> right<00:06:16.370> and<00:06:16.730> then<00:06:17.180> eight

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.420 
do eight with the right and then eight

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
that my grip changes if I'm bouncing my

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
I'm dead sticking it I actually grip it

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.590 
I'm dead sticking it I actually grip it
a<00:07:15.230> lot<00:07:15.470> harder<00:07:15.830> because<00:07:16.550> I<00:07:16.880> don't<00:07:17.120> want<00:07:17.360> it<00:07:17.420> to

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600 
a lot harder because I don't want it to

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.440 
a lot harder because I don't want it to
bounce<00:07:17.780> I<00:07:18.200> want<00:07:18.440> to<00:07:18.500> control<00:07:19.100> what<00:07:19.940> that<00:07:20.150> stick

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:20.450 
bounce I want to control what that stick

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.770 
bounce I want to control what that stick
is<00:07:20.600> doing<00:07:20.960> and<00:07:21.140> it<00:07:21.440> takes<00:07:21.650> a<00:07:21.770> little<00:07:21.860> practice

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:22.780 
is doing and it takes a little practice

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.820 
is doing and it takes a little practice
transitioning<00:07:23.780> with<00:07:24.260> your<00:07:24.560> grip<00:07:24.800> strength

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
transitioning with your grip strength

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.100 
transitioning with your grip strength
and<00:07:25.430> where<00:07:25.880> you're<00:07:26.060> holding<00:07:26.480> that<00:07:26.510> stick<00:07:26.960> and

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
and where you're holding that stick and

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.740 
and where you're holding that stick and
that's<00:07:27.650> why<00:07:27.950> it<00:07:28.790> requires<00:07:29.180> so<00:07:29.390> much<00:07:29.510> practice

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
that's why it requires so much practice

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.470 
that's why it requires so much practice
I<00:07:30.200> really<00:07:30.860> want<00:07:31.070> you<00:07:31.190> to<00:07:31.310> work<00:07:31.520> on<00:07:31.760> continue
