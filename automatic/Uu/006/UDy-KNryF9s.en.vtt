overall<00:03:14.519> Samsung<00:03:15.120> could<00:03:15.390> have<00:03:15.600> put<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:15.930> a

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
overall Samsung could have put in a

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.990 
overall Samsung could have put in a
bigger<00:03:16.230> battery<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.860> made<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.250> Galaxy<00:03:17.760> alpha

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
bigger battery and made the Galaxy alpha

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.780 
bigger battery and made the Galaxy alpha
thicker<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.900> heavier<00:03:19.200> but<00:03:19.890> while<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.370> Alpha

thicker and heavier but while the Alpha

thicker and heavier but while the Alpha
doesn't<00:03:21.180> conquer<00:03:21.510> its<00:03:21.810> segment<00:03:22.290> battery<00:03:22.950> life

certainly<00:03:23.760> isn't<00:03:24.269> an<00:03:24.450> issue
