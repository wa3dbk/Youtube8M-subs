the best they could do was a dollar 36
on<00:02:04.680> silver<00:02:05.040> taking<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.549> down<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> dollar<00:02:06.000> 36<00:02:06.570> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
on silver taking it down a dollar 36 and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.919 
on silver taking it down a dollar 36 and
they<00:02:07.680> dumped<00:02:07.950> three<00:02:08.340> times<00:02:08.899> which<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
they dumped three times which is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
they dumped three times which is
actually<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.379> think<00:02:10.410> technically<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.190> quarter

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
actually I think technically a quarter

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.090 
actually I think technically a quarter
of<00:02:11.970> world

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
of world

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.310 
of world
production<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.760> silver<00:02:14.060> annually<00:02:14.570> I<00:02:14.750> think

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
production of silver annually I think

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.700 
production of silver annually I think
it's<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.530> quarter<00:02:15.770> roughly<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.670> amount<00:02:17.710> my

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
it's a quarter roughly that amount my

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.250 
it's a quarter roughly that amount my
fact<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.270> almost<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.570> quarter<00:02:20.930> roughly<00:02:21.230> a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
fact it is almost a quarter roughly a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.010 
fact it is almost a quarter roughly a
quarter<00:02:22.000> thirty-eight<00:02:23.000> thousand<00:02:23.540> four

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
quarter thirty-eight thousand four

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.860 
quarter thirty-eight thousand four
hundred<00:02:24.050> contracts<00:02:24.950> x<00:02:25.310> 5000<00:02:26.270> because<00:02:26.660> each

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
hundred contracts x 5000 because each

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.450 
hundred contracts x 5000 because each
contract<00:02:27.380> represents<00:02:27.830> five<00:02:28.010> thousand<00:02:28.430> ounces

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
contract represents five thousand ounces

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.940 
contract represents five thousand ounces
so<00:02:31.460> it's<00:02:32.450> obvious<00:02:32.900> who<00:02:33.050> doing<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so it's obvious who doing it it's the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.460

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
two years no problem for them to do this

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.250 
two years no problem for them to do this
they<00:03:52.130> can<00:03:52.340> do<00:03:52.460> it<00:03:52.640> however<00:03:52.960> with<00:03:53.960> all<00:03:54.110> these

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
they can do it however with all these

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.810 
they can do it however with all these
countries<00:03:54.530> asking<00:03:55.130> for<00:03:55.310> their<00:03:55.430> money<00:03:55.610> back

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
countries asking for their money back

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.790 
countries asking for their money back
their<00:03:56.120> gold<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.230> know<00:03:57.320> their<00:03:57.590> precious

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
their gold and you know their precious

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.700 
their gold and you know their precious
metals<00:03:58.280> back<00:03:59.350> it's<00:04:00.350> going<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.530> cause<00:04:00.680> some

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
metals back it's going to cause some

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.730 
metals back it's going to cause some
problems<00:04:01.010> for<00:04:01.280> delivery<00:04:01.790> so<00:04:01.940> I<00:04:01.970> think<00:04:02.620> what<00:04:03.620> we

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
problems for delivery so I think what we

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.340 
problems for delivery so I think what we
could<00:04:03.770> see<00:04:04.070> first<00:04:04.310> would<00:04:04.610> be<00:04:04.750> some<00:04:05.750> slight

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
could see first would be some slight

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.410 
could see first would be some slight
delays<00:04:06.740> and<00:04:06.980> comics<00:04:07.340> deliveries<00:04:07.850> that<00:04:08.090> become

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
delays and comics deliveries that become

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.720 
delays and comics deliveries that become
a<00:04:08.450> lot<00:04:08.780> longer<00:04:09.050> delays<00:04:09.530> in<00:04:09.920> delivering<00:04:10.520> you

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
a lot longer delays in delivering you

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.540 
a lot longer delays in delivering you
know<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.030> physical<00:04:11.750> gold<00:04:11.960> is<00:04:12.110> over<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:12.560> then

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
know the physical gold is over and then

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.220 
know the physical gold is over and then
they<00:04:13.640> run<00:04:13.940> in<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.120> row<00:04:14.270> big<00:04:14.450> problems<00:04:14.840> where

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
they run in a row big problems where

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.250 
they run in a row big problems where
they<00:04:15.500> can't<00:04:15.710> deliver<00:04:15.860> period<00:04:16.930> once<00:04:17.930> that

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
they can't deliver period once that

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.070 
they can't deliver period once that
economy<00:04:18.650> but<00:04:18.770> happens<00:04:19.480> that's<00:04:20.480> what<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:20.690> expect

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
economy but happens that's what I expect

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.890
