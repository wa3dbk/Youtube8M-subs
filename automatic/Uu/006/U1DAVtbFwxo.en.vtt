00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.600
We wanted to offer a soundscape

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.760
of Congolese music,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.520
starting in 1925,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.240
since there are a few old
78 rpm records

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.000
that were made then,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.520
until nowadays,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.800
meaning 2015,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.120
with the latest hits.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.480
The links between painting
and popular music

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.680
were often self-evident.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.680
It's often about the same thing.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.320
Sometimes they're free associations.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.040
Since we know the history
of music quite well,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.400
we can always find a song
about the same theme

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.240
as any painting.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.360
We worked quite literally,
in general.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.960
The popular painters
were looking at society.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.200
And have shown

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.800
to those who wanted
to understand

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.160
what that society was.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.200
When you look at ChÃ©ri Samba,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.960
at the younger ones like Mika,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.320
you cannot do away
with fashion, women, music

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.680
or the issues of urban life.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.160
In any case, Congolese artists,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.840
whether they are musicians
or painters,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.680
are politicised.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.960
They take a stance.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.600
And sometimes,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.560
since they live on the margins
of society,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.360
they are the ones
who question things.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.040
Our media are oral media,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.200
including music.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.200
So that the lyrics
of modern Congolese music

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.880
are our literature

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.960
because they talk about

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.240
our daily lives.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.680
Congolese was,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.320
more than painting,
according to me,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.680
the Congolese's main
form of expression.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.000
It was the only form of expression
not controlled

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.800
by the colonisers.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.080
So there was a game
of hide-and-seek

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.200
between the colonisers
and the colonised

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.320
to convey messages.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.120
A good example is
the song, &lt;i&gt;Ata Ndele.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.960
It simply says,
in a way that is almost Biblical,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.160
"One day, the world will change.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.400
"The higher will be the lower,
and the lower the higher."

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.480
Everybody knew
what it was really saying.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.480
There were many songs like that.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.880
They reclaimed

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.840
the future of Congo

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.280
by promising better days,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.240
between the lines.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.960
Double meanings became
the way they expressed things.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.640
The music that had been discredited,
like ethnic music,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.000
the music that we set aside
and danced to on the side,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.080
took back its place

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.800
with Congolese rumba.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.680
Including with Franco.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.560
If African Jazz was

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.720
a "repeater" or an "imitator"

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.320
of Cuban music,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.880
then Franco and the others,
who are so very popular,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.040
did try their hands at Cuban music,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.120
with odd cha-chas
in odd Spanish.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.800
They invented some languages,
some slangs.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.120
But they were anchored

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.760
in a fully Congolese rumba,
Congolese music.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.040
They gradually reinserted
the old ethnic themes

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.200
into urban sets.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.280
Since the first popular songs
of modern Congolese music,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.120
there have been two trends.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.160
On the one hand, the truly
popular ones, close to the people.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.920
On the other hand, those
who meant their music for the elite.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.680
They were more languid,
calmer, more polite,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.960
and more chic.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.080
It started with Franco

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.000
and African Jazz.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.480
Then it evolved.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.960
The last avatars of this rivalry

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.720
were the two wings
of Winged Muzika.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.120
But there might be a new generation
of Congolese musicians,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.600
very young kids,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.000
who are taking over.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.320
Everything is getting diluted

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.040
and individuals do not care
about picking a side anymore.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.640
We are getting to a moment

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.720
which matters greatly
to Congolese music.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.480
But with the same popular themes

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.160
that can be found in popular paintings.
