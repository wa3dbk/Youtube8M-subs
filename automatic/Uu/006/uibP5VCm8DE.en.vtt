00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hello, today's video I want 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.019
 dedicate to repairing the tractor t-40 in 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.160
 particulars this is such a longitudinal traction 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:21.199
 all probably faced this 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.199
 malfunction you of us here these balls 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.010
 how can it be repaired like this 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.930
 can recover 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 I used to repair the weld 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.910
 here the wire is six millimeters or 8 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.399
 millimeters and for a while this 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.760
 enough but still this longitudinal 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.540
 backlash 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.170
 how would he stay recently i decided 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.329
 try a different way now i 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.660
 I will show you in detail what it means 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.670
 initially you need to do here in 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.949
 in this place make a tapered here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 further here it is all places 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.670
 try pressing squeeze and then 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.689
 fill up this place for see what of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.369
 it will turn out well that's how we see 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.140
 the apple squeezed she rotates the lungs 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.240
 small is but we become it I will not 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.650
 I will not fully compress now 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.549
 try to boil 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.390
 right there inside make root went 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.390
 had to use two jacks 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.190
 alone he could not squeeze 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.830
 so well, everything is looking further 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.910
 so well so i failed did one pass 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.150
 Immediately filled the root of the seam 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.490
 here a little bit is left as it's 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.600
 then I fill it all with a solid stitch 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:50.830
 same few passes and how to see an apple 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.990
 has a backlash rotates easily but not 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:02:00.490
 fall out well and see everything further 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.000
 the end result here is the final 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.730
 result 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.810
 what I got means as we see 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.000
 the apple has a little bit loose there 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:16.090
 hanging out but at least not 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.940
 I digest here I can scalded everything 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.470
 even a little grind Volga . 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.870
 Well, this way you can restore 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.390
 old thrusts are broken and i want to eat 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.080
 immediately running ahead 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.410
 suggest another way 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.660
 restoring here with this 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.780
 hand thrust 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.510
 you are such that we are here and even if I 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.970
 I'll push this part of the apple to everyone there 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.390
 stick here for this i decided to do 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.840
 differently and the old fatherly traction 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.140
 amateur prosecutor sawed off part of here 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.010
 this hinge and by connecting 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.000
 dovetail of drink this here 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.989
 connection at an angle boil this end 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.310
 traction like this all will look further 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.310
 I will show further 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:17.290
 so well i have made you cut the edges 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.210
 It turned out a little bit here, but this 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.570
 nothing wrong 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.270
 Basically itâ€™s better to fill the seam and now 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.010
 slowly begin to brew first 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.180
 I will pass 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.850
 thin electrons two and a half 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.710
 deeper there with a big current I will try 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:39.310
 boil the seam root as best you can 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:44.980
 I will continue to persuade 10 process I 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:48.180
 I will try to remove and show all the stages well 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.290
 so I went through the first pass 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.420
 polished his grinder by the way very 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.750
 I advise each pass to grind 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:02.160
 grinder it gives opportunities better 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:04.600
 impose the next show and took away the parties 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.600
 everything is good and here is one small 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.330
 a hole but I think is not critical 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:15.820
 cook it is not for clearance strength enough 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:20.140
 well here and then fill the whole here 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:23.050
 This neckline is usually recommended this 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.169
 steel is kind of heated before welding 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.660
 I usually never warm up a pony 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:32.800
 I warm up I cook so electrodes me 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.660
 simple ano-21 though they are for such 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.990
 designs and not very fit not me 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.930
 already dumped like I do not know for mts 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.980
 Well, not one dozen already in those places 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.850
 where i brew 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.770
 never burst anything ever 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.230
 in other places 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:55.790
 in those places I usually say everything to serve 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:58.640
 ok here and hereafter show how i would 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.030
 filling this seam will not speak on 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:07.040
 I'll just show the camera how they will be 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.710
 each layer here I went through the second layer 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.050
 put the second seam 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:19.460
 immediately removed a little Kalina and slag 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:21.290
 Bulgarian looks the other side I'm not 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.360
 professional welder so in how 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.450
 It turns out there are several ways 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.010
 I usually use a seam filling 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:34.190
 the moon backwards from edge to edge 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:38.690
 Well, then I will show how the final 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:40.630
 option to look here it is final 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.460
 what option did you get 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.460
 I was almost flattened 

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:57.249
 MTZ extension will be a little bit thinner 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:58.719
 so as if there is a small depression 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:02.739
 It turned out but I think that strength 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:05.169
 enough is enough 

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:07.269
 and simpler option on the cashier and make 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.649
 hints that the swallowtail is this one 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:17.499
 to the compound will give more strength 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:20.679
 here before you do it already seen 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:22.989
 thrust him not center 

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:25.929
 I shifted a little bit on purpose 

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:27.039
 under actress winch so me so 

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:33.969
 had to do 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:38.609
 were shifted well that's all for principle 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.609
 attention thank you all bye
