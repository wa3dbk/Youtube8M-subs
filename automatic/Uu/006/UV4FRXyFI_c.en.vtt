 100 milliseconds to go from one 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.410

 I click on the site of wikipedia I 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.840
 put in 16/9 and that's another 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.459
 application that we use a lot on 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.709
 smartphones and tablets and who 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.900
 makes sense on a television that's 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.550
 Youtube 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.180
 here I downloaded small videos 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.450
 on the ptb 3000 this was a review 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:55.580

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:58.760
 interesting eyes so that's it 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.350
 really thrilling because we're going 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.290
 to be able to actually transform 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.730

 joystick to play my games 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.239
 as the latency is minimal less than 100 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.950
 I said milliseconds where we play 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.479
 watch TV and we play with the 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.410
 the phone as a remote control 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.190
 after there are obviously others 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.700
 more apps to elect as per 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.050
