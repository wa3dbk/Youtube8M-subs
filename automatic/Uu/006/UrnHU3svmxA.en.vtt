00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.070 
today we're gonna be taking a look at
the<00:00:05.040> urban<00:00:05.430> armor<00:00:05.730> gear<00:00:05.879> case<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.990> your

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
the urban armor gear case for your

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.370 
the urban armor gear case for your
Galaxy<00:00:07.649> Note<00:00:07.859> 3<00:00:08.210> this<00:00:09.210> case<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.630> not<00:00:09.809> only<00:00:10.019> able

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
Galaxy Note 3 this case is not only able

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.709 
Galaxy Note 3 this case is not only able
to<00:00:10.530> provide<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.190> with<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.519> protection<00:00:11.719> that

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
to provide you with the protection that

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.299 
to provide you with the protection that
most<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.500> consumers<00:00:14.070> are<00:00:14.160> actually

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
most of the consumers are actually

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.910 
most of the consumers are actually
looking<00:00:14.670> for<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.870> also<00:00:16.020> offers<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.619> most

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
looking for but it also offers the most

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.429 
looking for but it also offers the most
unique<00:00:17.340> design<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.090> seen<00:00:18.390> from<00:00:18.900> any<00:00:19.140> case

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
unique design I have seen from any case

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.150 
unique design I have seen from any case
manufacturer<00:00:20.340> let's<00:00:21.150> get<00:00:21.539> started<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.289> of

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
manufacturer let's get started so of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.980 
manufacturer let's get started so of
course<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.670> whole<00:00:23.699> point<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.180> getting<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.660> case

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
course the whole point of getting a case

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.960 
course the whole point of getting a case
for<00:00:25.260> your<00:00:25.320> device<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.279> want<00:00:26.490> your<00:00:26.640> device

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
for your device is you want your device

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.750 
for your device is you want your device
to<00:00:27.210> be<00:00:27.330> protected<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.230> how<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.250> case<00:00:29.519> is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to be protected and how this case is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.089 
to be protected and how this case is
made<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.240> they<00:00:30.449> fuse<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.050> hard<00:00:31.710> outer<00:00:31.920> shell

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
made is they fuse a hard outer shell

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.540 
made is they fuse a hard outer shell
with<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.059> soft<00:00:33.420> impact<00:00:34.020> resistant<00:00:34.590> core<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
with the soft impact resistant core so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.340 
with the soft impact resistant core so
this<00:00:35.760> way<00:00:35.940> if<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.210> drop<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.510> device

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
this way if you drop your device

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.260 
this way if you drop your device
there'll<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:37.770> no<00:00:38.010> damage<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:38.670> device<00:00:39.000> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
there'll be no damage to your device and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.930 
there'll be no damage to your device and
that's<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.170> big<00:00:40.350> reason<00:00:40.530> why<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.250> cases<00:00:41.520> as

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that's a big reason why we get cases as

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.380 
that's a big reason why we get cases as
I<00:00:42.090> said<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.190> comes<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.610> design<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
I said so when it comes to design as I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.440 
I said so when it comes to design as I
said<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.200> most<00:00:46.520> sexiest<00:00:47.520> unique

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
said this is the most sexiest unique

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.380 
said this is the most sexiest unique
case<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.620> ever<00:00:49.920> seen<00:00:50.120> for<00:00:51.120> any

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
case that I have ever seen for any

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.260 
case that I have ever seen for any
device<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:53.520> into<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:54.030> eyes

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
device I want you to look into my eyes

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
device I want you to look into my eyes
and<00:00:54.629> tell<00:00:54.930> me<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.260> you've<00:00:55.469> seen<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> case

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and tell me that you've seen a case

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.150 
and tell me that you've seen a case
before<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.210> had<00:00:57.390> screws<00:00:57.870> no<00:00:58.530> there<00:00:58.920> just

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
before that had screws no there just

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.520 
before that had screws no there just
hasn't<00:00:59.370> been<00:00:59.609> any<00:00:59.940> other<00:01:00.180> cases<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.020> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
hasn't been any other cases and this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.250 
hasn't been any other cases and this
design<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.370> makes<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.359> case<00:01:03.660> stand<00:01:04.019> out

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
design really makes this case stand out

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.590 
design really makes this case stand out
so<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> problem<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.880> usually<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.479> with

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
so a problem that we usually get with

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.170 
so a problem that we usually get with
some<00:01:06.900> cases<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.939> try<00:01:09.150> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
some cases is that when you try to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.240 
some cases is that when you try to
access<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:10.320> ports<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.890> come<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.220> your

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
access your ports that come on your

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.539 
access your ports that come on your
device<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:12.510> makes<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.020> harder<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.400> have

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
device it makes it harder and you have

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490 
device it makes it harder and you have
to<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.119> squeeze<00:01:15.450> through<00:01:15.869> different

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to kind of squeeze through different

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
to kind of squeeze through different
things<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.130> sometimes<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.970> doesn't<00:01:18.150> work

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
things and sometimes it doesn't work

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.140 
things and sometimes it doesn't work
well<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.110> UAG<00:01:19.619> did<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.250> they<00:01:20.490> actually<00:01:20.909> made

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
well what UAG did is they actually made

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.990 
well what UAG did is they actually made
the<00:01:21.840> room<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> ports<00:01:22.770> bigger<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:23.909> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the room for the ports bigger so if you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.510 
the room for the ports bigger so if you
look<00:01:24.180> around<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.570> device<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.890> case<00:01:26.220> on

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
look around the device with this case on

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.190 
look around the device with this case on
you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.119> tell<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.479> they're<00:01:27.689> still<00:01:27.930> really

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you can tell that they're still really

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.499 
you can tell that they're still really
easy<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.650> access<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.549> they<00:01:30.270> did<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> really

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
easy to access and they did a really

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.060 
easy to access and they did a really
good<00:01:30.869> job<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.920> almost

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
good job at that because it's almost

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.969 
good job at that because it's almost
like<00:01:32.430> there's<00:01:33.180> no<00:01:33.720> case<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.320> covering<00:01:34.829> your

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
like there's no case on covering your

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.310 
like there's no case on covering your
ports<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.270> really<00:01:36.420> big<00:01:36.659> bonus<00:01:37.079> all

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
ports so that's a really big bonus all

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.590 
ports so that's a really big bonus all
the<00:01:37.439> ports<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.890> wide<00:01:38.130> open<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.759> easy<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the ports are wide open and easy to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.350 
the ports are wide open and easy to
access<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.409> another<00:01:41.400> cool<00:01:41.640> feature<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:42.240> this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
access so another cool feature with this

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.990 
access so another cool feature with this
case<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> bezel<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.490> front<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
case is that the bezel in front of the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.690 
case is that the bezel in front of the
camera<00:01:45.420> actually<00:01:45.899> deflects<00:01:46.560> unwanted<00:01:47.340> flash

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
camera actually deflects unwanted flash

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.389 
camera actually deflects unwanted flash
interference<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.439> should<00:01:49.829> actually<00:01:50.070> be

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
interference so you should actually be

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.600 
interference so you should actually be
getting<00:01:50.520> glare<00:01:51.000> free<00:01:51.270> photos<00:01:52.130> as<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.310> stated

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
getting glare free photos as I stated

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.609 
getting glare free photos as I stated
before<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.270> volume<00:01:54.570> rockers<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.439> home

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
before the volume rockers and the home

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
before the volume rockers and the home
button<00:01:55.649> are<00:01:56.130> still<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:57.090> easy<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.509> press

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
button are still really easy to press

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.289 
button are still really easy to press
and<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.890> actually<00:01:59.040> gives<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.820> little<00:02:00.180> more

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and it actually gives it a little more

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.270 
and it actually gives it a little more
click<00:02:00.840> enos<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.740> actually<00:02:01.890> maybe

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
click enos to it so it's actually maybe

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.789 
click enos to it so it's actually maybe
even<00:02:02.670> easier<00:02:03.200> another<00:02:04.200> addition<00:02:04.680> they

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
even easier another addition they

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.190 
even easier another addition they
included<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.369> should<00:02:05.610> also<00:02:05.790> add<00:02:06.149> some<00:02:06.810> extra

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
included that should also add some extra

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.070 
included that should also add some extra
protection<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.280> hard<00:02:08.520> edges<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
protection are the hard edges so if you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.990 
protection are the hard edges so if you
drop<00:02:10.289> your<00:02:10.349> device<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.129> one<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> edges

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
drop your device on one of the edges

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.670 
drop your device on one of the edges
it's<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> be<00:02:13.080> able<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.349> read

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's not going to be able to read

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.190 
it's not going to be able to read
to<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.890> screen<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:15.450> course<00:02:15.750> they<00:02:16.019> also

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
to the screen and of course they also

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.770 
to the screen and of course they also
add<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.799> higher<00:02:17.069> edge<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:18.060> goes<00:02:18.239> above<00:02:18.599> your

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
add a higher edge that goes above your

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.599 
add a higher edge that goes above your
screen<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.439> if<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.650> set<00:02:19.859> it<00:02:19.890> down<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.159> a<00:02:20.340> table

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
screen so if you set it down on a table

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.459 
screen so if you set it down on a table
