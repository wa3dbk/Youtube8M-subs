00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.130
 This video will explain about tankless inserts 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.880
 Then please take the insert hand first 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.490
 There are three major differences from conventional products 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:27.590
 The first one has no tongue as you see 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:32.080
 So work to find out the punk caged bird and covered words 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.080
 There is no need to check gauges 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.730
 The second is 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:45.520
 There is a hook that is called a hook instead of a tongue 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.850
 I use this part to insert and remove 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.590
 There is no direction because it is attached to the gourd 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.590
 There is no need to confirm 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:03.730
 For third is that can be easily withdrawn using an insertion same notch 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:08.130
 There is no damage to the internal thread 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.130
 In Prepare for insertion 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.560
 First is torque adjustment 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.640
 Rotate while pressing torque adjustment natto 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.640
 Remove 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.719
 Set the blade that matches the size of the insert you want to use 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.150
 And submarine Well worn while pressing the torque adjustment Do again 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.210
 Adjust torque with reference to memory here 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.730
 Install the tool while pressing the joint shaft collar 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.670
 The same is true for removal 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.720
 Confirm switch forward 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.840
 Power on 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.840
 Make sure the output switch is on the road 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:28.250
 Then mount it on the insert tool 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.250
 Loosen the housing and lock nut 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.440
 On the ground with the insert 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.440
 Wear until your nails catch 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:55.240
 Then guard and reason about 1000 form one roll the gap between the insert 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.240
 Set the housing and lock nut 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.700
 Diamond to one and 1.5 diamonds can be inserted in one of the tool by the set to width 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.709
 Let's insert it 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.780
 Keep alternating vertically for when the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:21.020
 Insert this 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:25.750
 The DENSO tool will automatically determine if there is a contact with the ger part . 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.750
 Please do not touch Ever in the middle 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.300
 If you do not insert smoothly , the following may be considered 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.870
 Not vertical 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.870
 management 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.350
 And when the force is weak 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.400
 Yeah 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:59.670
 There is also the case of the following pressing the tool against the other base material 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.670
 Inserted Please try to try the last note of the above if you do not go smoothly 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.660
 Removal work using a red one eye of direction up tools make it easy to 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.120
 Like soy milk from the joint shaft 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.549
 Good 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.549
 Insert the hex part of Kofu 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.030
 Keep the tool perpendicular to you 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.180
 Unwrapping Map 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:33.180
 While taking Miki , the insertion degree is too much to press the tool for 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.180
 Please note that do not speak the stearyl bar on the way 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.640
 When removing the insert from Koga 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.360
 Turn the insert while the red lever 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.360
 Remove 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:56.090
 I explained the work by electric motor so far 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.090
 It is possible to do the same operation manually 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.080
 Attach the handle to the rear as well as Akaishi 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:09.750
 The insertion method is the same as in the hall of fame 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.750
 Hold the tool vertically and insert it 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.740
 Turn the tool backwards when there is a guard 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:30.710
 It is complete here 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.710
 It is also possible to remove it manually by replacing it with the unprosecuted position Kofu 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.320
 What did you think 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:51.190
 Please feel free to contact us if there is a country name 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.190
 Then thank you very much for insurance etc.
