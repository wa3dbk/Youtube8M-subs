00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.310
 good guys how are we going to the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.309
 part 7 of the ear 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.750
 I do not know well about this because I saw them in the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.700
 previous videos and there's no relation 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.530
 between what the video says and what 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.150
 figure on the cover but good nothing 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.100
 There are 2 correlatives if none is missing 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.619
 What we are going to talk about here is the wall 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.230
 external eardrum box wall 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.050
 external the eardrum box is formed 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.829
 by a bony ridge that is called 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.329
 tympanic groove and that delimits a 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.670
 hole that is closed by the 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.120
 tympanic membrane a membrane tri 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.120
 laminate 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.400
 is the eardrum or time in a primary 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.960
 the tympanic groove is uneven is in 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.730
 its upper part a little forward 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.020
 a notch that is called 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.200
 rivi notch news 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.670
 and they receive all their extension to the soul of 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.399
 tympanum which 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.050
 it is inserted by means of a thickening 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.780
 ring that is called annular ring 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.630
 gerlache then that is the re finish 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.649
 of gerlache is a thickening 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.390
 peripheral by which the 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.259
 membrane of the eardrum is inserted into the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.259
 tympanic sulcus 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.340
 in it the handle of the hammer is sheathed 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.729
 that pulls from its end more 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.930
 bottom and the pump in from 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 way such that the membrane of the eardrum 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.420
 it is concave out slightly 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.909
 concave outward measures roughly a 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.009
 centimeter high by 9 millimeters in 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.820
 anteroposterior sense this is anterior 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.899
 this is posterior superior and inferior 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:43.020
 then we see that then we see that the 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.200
 hammer handle depresses it and forms what 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.840
 called a navel that is not the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.909
 geometric center of the center membrane 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.740
 geometric would be more or less here 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.110
 the navel has been a little bit 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.150
 below a little behind 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.820
 Let's see what 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.100
 from the navel to the anterior 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.030
 and after the cutting of rivi news 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.580
 the female is totally thin 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.280
 because that lifts and separates 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.260
 its layers on the handle of the hammer and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.620
 form what is called part flag aids 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.830
 or membrane of germs is a triangle 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.900
 of base its but previous that corresponds 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.510
 to the seams of arribeÃ±os and have fun 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.150
 umbilical where the membrane is much 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.319
 thinner and is called a flaccid part 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.450
 the beto is called pass condens 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.299
 at the level of the flax pair is already seen 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.090
 transparency the handle of the hammer and the 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.530
 anvil head 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.420
 that are going to be inside the middle ear 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.340
 obviously within the tympanic cavity 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.050
 and finally we are going to see these 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.720
 thickening that the female of the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.670
 eardrum in front and behind the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.800
 jacmel membrane which are the so-called 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.720
 ligaments, eardrums, malleolar 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.300
 Previous and subsequent trolls 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.660
 yes and there is not much more to say about 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.970
 tympanum I ended up in what would be what it is 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.280
 the eardrum over the course of one or two 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.410
 copies or two copies is to look for a 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.430
 device that has light the constructive 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.040
 external and look at the membrane of the eardrum 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.340
 from outside and here the hammer marked 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.400
 relief of the manubrium 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.850
 falsehood scharner membrane this that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.040
 go here 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.310
 it's called luminous snack they're going to 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.870
 see in otorhinolaryngology is normal 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.910
 membrane of the eardrum when it does not have 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.680
 no pathology when there is no 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.230
 utility none its healing none 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.660
 tubaria instruction or nothing of it is 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.910
 bright transparent and has this 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.880
 reflex core or luminous in the quadrant 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.360
 lower superior here reflex with the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.550
 income that is normal 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.340
 demarcated calabar condenses that would be all 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.530
 what is the navel that is edited and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.630
 there 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.630
 and apart from what weapons is this 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.350
 good tempered normal broken eardrum 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.210
 when we talk about breaking the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.640
 eardrum is nothing more than a break 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.000
 perforation of this eardrum membrane 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.610
 and will alter alter the hearing 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.160
 because I am to break the eardrum for a 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.500
 cachetazo smack with pressure 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.630
 negative with negative pressure notes 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.840
 and take off this breaks the membrane of 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.060
 eardrum for an infection this by a 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.430
 foreign body that is introduced and the 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.410
 treatment called plastic milingo the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.750
 repair of this eardrum 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.970
 it really heals and repairs itself 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.250
 but sometimes you have to do some techniques 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.840
 surgical procedures that others do 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.790
 rhythms 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.990
 good old view of the box 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.510
 eardrum as is 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.699
 look with an external objective hammer 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.290
 is a chris tribe for internal of the 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.600
 box which in turn is the external part 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.870
 as we said and from the inner ear and 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.430
 poti hand spitting for not the 'pit 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.130
 Hispanic is the part of the box of the 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.600
 eardrum above the level rim 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.210
 from the top edge of with a goal 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.360
 external and is open are the chain or 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.490
 circulate mainly and finish the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.669
 membrane of the eardrum that has three 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.620
 layers an outer layer that is skin a 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.070
 middle layer that is connective tissue and 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.680
 an inner layer that is mucus 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.960
 the handle of the hammer are introduced t the 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.830
 middle layer the inner layer and lifts it 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.270
 in such a way that refines at this level the 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.800
 membrane of time in the form of the membrane 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.590
 in jacmel and leave a pocket here that 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.960
 called bag of pressing prozac bag 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.210
 They are two pockets ahead and for 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.710
 behind the neck and the handle of the 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.320
 hammer 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.750
 well here we continue is the wall 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.550
 later this triangular building of 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.590
 Lower entry orifice 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.780
 ture landrum area below we have 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.670
 the pyramid where the muscle will come out 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.280
 of the stirrup we had seen this from 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.070
 the external face we have since 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.040
 forward here marked them if this is the 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.050
 oval window is the round window and 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.800
 here we have the first round of the snail 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.229
 or promontory 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.680
 this can not be the aqueduct of 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.449
 Fallopian and here above the salience almost 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.909
 external semicircular canal in the 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.699
 inner wall of the eardrum and 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:11.979
 now if I put the previous wall of the 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.360
 end box for what it is or that is 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.250
 accidents we had in the previous part 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.830
 we have two things down the 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.759
 hole of the eustachian tube and 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.669
 upwards 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:23.110
 the hammer duct building 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.860
 without injuries I put transparency this 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.830
 anterior wall 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:30.009
 let's see next transparency I see 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.560
 that comes from the inside out and from 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.870
 the inner wall the muscle conduit 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.460
 of the hammer that is where the 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.389
 hammer muscle that goes to the neck of the 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.949
 hammer this is not another way of looking 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.349
 the elements that we saw alone we look 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:47.229
 from another place and here finally they 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.800
 I show the handle of the sheathed hammer 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:52.599
 and lifting the mucosa of the eardrum 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.069
 forming here the crusat bag and the 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.920
 ligaments eardrums mineral droid 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:58.720
 anterior and posterior 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.870
 and I think we're done with what it is 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.290
 middle ear 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.500
 I hope they come following the where 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.500
 go understand
