another<00:01:36.420> lemon<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.170> recipe

another lemon I think the recipe

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.100 
another lemon I think the recipe
probably<00:01:37.920> only<00:01:38.040> calls<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.720> don't

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
probably only calls for one but I don't

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.510 
probably only calls for one but I don't
know<00:01:40.170> I'm<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:40.650> lemon<00:01:40.920> crazy<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.430> I'll

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
know I'm a little lemon crazy so I'll
give<00:01:41.640> another<00:01:41.759> squeeze<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.659> I'll<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.170> add
