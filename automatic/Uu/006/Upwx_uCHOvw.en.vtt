itself

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
itself

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.810 
itself
another<00:04:12.350> thought<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.890> just<00:04:13.310> something<00:04:13.670> to

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
another thought and just something to

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.850 
another thought and just something to
note<00:04:14.060> is<00:04:14.300> that<00:04:14.660> if<00:04:14.900> we<00:04:15.020> did<00:04:15.290> go<00:04:15.470> down<00:04:15.500> this

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
note is that if we did go down this

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.910 
note is that if we did go down this
route<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.430> could<00:04:16.820> also<00:04:17.120> potentially<00:04:17.660> open<00:04:18.560> up

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
route it could also potentially open up

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.699 
route it could also potentially open up
