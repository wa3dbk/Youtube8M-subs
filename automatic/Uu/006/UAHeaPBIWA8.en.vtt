00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.020
 leave him or yes I think of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.490
 such a player can learn something 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.259

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.630

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.420
 can also be used on the left 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.890

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.870

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.780
 played as a left-back is that 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.710

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.950
 further ahead 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.800
 So I was retrained at that time 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.080
 by said trainer of the former 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.330

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.960

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.800
 both left defends also left with 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.860
 but I want to play 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.880
 looked at both positions well 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.070
 and I do not really see any 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.110
 difference if you do not grade football 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.940
 What do you do best then yes 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.380
 I like being away when not exercising 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.850
 outside or I like to play basketball 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.990
 or just relax a bit 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.950
