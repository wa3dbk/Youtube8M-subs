question<00:00:04.529> let's<00:00:04.830> just<00:00:04.980> think<00:00:05.130> about<00:00:05.250> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
question let's just think about the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.150 
question let's just think about the
different<00:00:06.210> number<00:00:06.690> sets<00:00:07.020> there<00:00:07.259> are<00:00:07.440> there

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
different number sets there are there

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.089 
different number sets there are there
are<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.490> real<00:00:08.730> numbers<00:00:09.320> the<00:00:10.320> real<00:00:10.590> numbers

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
are the real numbers the real numbers

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.009 
are the real numbers the real numbers
and<00:00:11.340> these<00:00:11.820> are<00:00:11.969> literally<00:00:12.480> all<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
and these are literally all of the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.450 
and these are literally all of the
numbers<00:00:13.320> we've<00:00:13.530> been<00:00:13.679> dealing<00:00:13.889> with<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.280> date

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
numbers we've been dealing with to date

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.550 
numbers we've been dealing with to date
we're<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.820> when<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.630> go<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> more<00:00:16.109> advanced

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
we're in when we go to more advanced

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.380 
we're in when we go to more advanced
topics<00:00:16.590> you'll<00:00:17.100> learn<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.760> there<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:18.119> such

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
topics you'll learn that there are such

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.689 
topics you'll learn that there are such
things<00:00:18.449> as<00:00:18.810> imaginary<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.710> complex<00:00:19.740> numbers

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
things as imaginary and complex numbers

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.189 
things as imaginary and complex numbers
or<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.210> least<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> mathematical<00:00:22.140> sense

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
or at least in the mathematical sense

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.800 
or at least in the mathematical sense
they<00:00:22.710> exist<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:23.939> now<00:00:24.180> real<00:00:24.420> numbers<00:00:24.720> are

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
they exist but for now real numbers are

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.939 
they exist but for now real numbers are
essentially<00:00:25.109> everything<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.740> know<00:00:25.920> of

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
essentially everything that we know of

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.679 
essentially everything that we know of
on<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> number<00:00:26.789> line<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.180> if<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.330> were<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> draw

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
on the number line so if I were to draw

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.859 
on the number line so if I were to draw
the<00:00:27.750> number<00:00:28.109> line<00:00:28.140> right<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.599> real<00:00:30.599> number

to be a little bit more restrictive we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.580 
to be a little bit more restrictive we
get<00:01:09.510> two<00:01:09.689> rational<00:01:10.170> numbers<00:01:10.700> we<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.909> two

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
get two rational numbers we get two

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.899 
get two rational numbers we get two
rational<00:01:13.590> numbers<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.610> best<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:14.880> to

rational numbers and the best way to

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.370 
rational numbers and the best way to
think<00:01:15.030> about<00:01:15.240> rational<00:01:15.930> there's<00:01:16.110> two<00:01:16.229> ways<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
think about rational there's two ways to

think about it these are numbers numbers

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.230 
think about it these are numbers numbers
that<00:01:20.900> can<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.460> expressed<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:27.000> could<00:01:27.150> say

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that can be expressed as you could say

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.440 
that can be expressed as you could say
as<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> rational<00:01:27.840> expression<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:30.570> a

fraction as a fraction so for example
negative<00:01:36.869> 1<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> rational<00:01:38.100> number<00:01:38.369> because

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
negative 1 is a rational number because

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.609 
negative 1 is a rational number because

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
negative 1 could be written as negative

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.060 
negative 1 could be written as negative

1 over 1 0 is a rational number can be

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.219

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
all of these are rational numbers what

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.350 
all of these are rational numbers what
aren't<00:01:52.740> rational<00:01:53.040> numbers<00:01:53.610> are<00:01:53.729> numbers<00:01:54.329> like

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
aren't rational numbers are numbers like

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.620 
aren't rational numbers are numbers like
square<00:01:54.930> root<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> 2<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.619> 3.14<00:01:56.520> or<00:01:56.640> PI<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.240> E

these numbers that cannot be represented
as<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> fraction<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.229> imagine<00:02:01.860> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
as a fraction so you can imagine that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.950 
as a fraction so you can imagine that
the<00:02:02.070> rational<00:02:02.520> numbers<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.450> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.780> like

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the rational numbers it's kind of like

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.929 
the rational numbers it's kind of like
the<00:02:04.200> set<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.649> real<00:02:05.040> numbers<00:02:05.460> maybe<00:02:05.670> I'll<00:02:05.850> write

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
the set of real numbers maybe I'll write

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
the set of real numbers maybe I'll write
it<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> set<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.170> real

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
it like this it's the set of real

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.729 
it like this it's the set of real
numbers<00:02:08.179> -<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.420> were<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> take<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.319> you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
numbers - if you were to take out if you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.620 
numbers - if you were to take out if you
were<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.890> take<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.280> irrational<00:02:12.000> numbers

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
were to take out irrational numbers

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.520 
were to take out irrational numbers
you<00:02:13.230> were<00:02:13.320> take<00:02:13.620> out<00:02:13.770> irrational<00:02:15.380> take<00:02:16.380> out

you were take out irrational take out

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.010 
you were take out irrational take out
irrational<00:02:17.100> numbers<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.490> these<00:02:17.550> are<00:02:17.820> like<00:02:18.270> so

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
irrational numbers and these are like so

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.840 
irrational numbers and these are like so
for<00:02:19.380> example<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:20.460> have<00:02:20.610> things<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.320> pi<00:02:22.320> e

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
for example we have things like pi e

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.760 
for example we have things like pi e
these<00:02:23.850> are<00:02:23.970> actual<00:02:24.270> numbers<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.720> know<00:02:24.780> 3.1415

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
these are actual numbers you know 3.1415

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.600 
these are actual numbers you know 3.1415
the<00:02:26.400> e<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.210> know<00:02:27.330> between<00:02:27.990> 2<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.560> 3<00:02:28.860> square

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
the e is you know between 2 and 3 square

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.250 
the e is you know between 2 and 3 square
root<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.850> 2<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.270> can<00:02:30.390> go<00:02:30.570> on<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.960> on<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.200> on

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
root of 2 we can go on and on and on

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.170 
root of 2 we can go on and on and on
there's<00:02:31.530> an<00:02:31.800> infinite<00:02:32.280> number<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.640> irrational

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
there's an infinite number of irrational

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.850 
there's an infinite number of irrational
numbers<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:33.960> a<00:02:34.020> little<00:02:34.230> abstract<00:02:34.350> but

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
numbers so it's a little abstract but

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.020 
numbers so it's a little abstract but
anything<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.190> can<00:02:35.310> be<00:02:35.460> represented<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:35.940> a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
anything that can be represented as a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.620 
anything that can be represented as a
fraction

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
fraction

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.320 
fraction
you<00:02:36.900> definitely<00:02:37.140> know<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.770> irrational<00:02:38.340> now<00:02:39.210> if

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
you definitely know is irrational now if

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.280 
you definitely know is irrational now if
we<00:02:39.450> want<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.660> get<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> little<00:02:40.020> bit<00:02:40.140> more

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
we want to get a little bit more

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.570 
we want to get a little bit more
restrictive<00:02:40.560> than<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.100> we<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.220> want<00:02:41.520> to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
restrictive than that if we just want to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.640 
restrictive than that if we just want to
deal<00:02:42.120> with<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.510> numbers<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.350> aren't

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
deal with the numbers that aren't

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.710 
deal with the numbers that aren't
fractions<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.640> traditional<00:02:45.180> sense<00:02:45.420> that

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
fractions in the traditional sense that

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.360 
fractions in the traditional sense that
are<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.050> guess<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:46.560> could<00:02:46.680> use<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.010> word<00:02:47.130> whole

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
are I guess we could use the word whole

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.770 
are I guess we could use the word whole
numbers<00:02:47.820> although<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.210> want<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.390> be<00:02:48.450> careful

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
numbers although we want to be careful

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.000 
numbers although we want to be careful
in<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:48.930> word<00:02:49.110> because<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.440> could<00:02:49.590> also<00:02:49.800> be

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
in that word because that could also be

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.060 
in that word because that could also be
considered<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:51.170> number<00:02:52.170> set<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.740> we're

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
considered a number set if we're

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.620 
considered a number set if we're
thinking<00:02:53.250> about<00:02:53.460> just<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.000> four<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.600> three

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
thinking about just the four the three

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.530 
thinking about just the four the three
the<00:02:55.050> two<00:02:55.230> all<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.800> kind<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.240> I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the two all of the kind of the the the I

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.470 
the two all of the kind of the the the I
guess<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.500> know<00:02:58.620> whole<00:02:59.250> numbers<00:02:59.700> then<00:03:00.300> we

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
guess you know whole numbers then we

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.850 
guess you know whole numbers then we
could<00:03:00.630> we're<00:03:00.780> talking<00:03:01.080> about<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.320> integers

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
could we're talking about the integers

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.260 
could we're talking about the integers
we're<00:03:02.520> talking<00:03:02.850> about<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.150> integers<00:03:05.270> the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
we're talking about the integers the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.960 
we're talking about the integers the
integers<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:07.620> these<00:03:07.800> are<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.490> know<00:03:08.520> we<00:03:08.820> could

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
integers so these are you know we could

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.150 
integers so these are you know we could
just<00:03:09.120> go<00:03:09.330> from<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.170> negative<00:03:10.380> direction<00:03:10.500> you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
just go from the negative direction you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.790 
just go from the negative direction you
know<00:03:11.250> maybe<00:03:11.490> negative<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:12.210> negative<00:03:12.630> 1<00:03:13.140> then<00:03:13.530> 0

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
know maybe negative to negative 1 then 0

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.180 
know maybe negative to negative 1 then 0
then<00:03:14.220> we<00:03:14.640> get<00:03:14.760> 1<00:03:15.030> 2<00:03:15.570> 3<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:17.010> get<00:03:17.160> the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
then we get 1 2 3 I think you get the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.950 
then we get 1 2 3 I think you get the
idea<00:03:17.610> it's<00:03:17.970> all<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.390> positive<00:03:18.870> and

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
idea it's all of the positive and

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.800 
idea it's all of the positive and
negative<00:03:19.320> whole<00:03:19.800> numbers<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:21.180> includes<00:03:21.600> 0

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
negative whole numbers and it includes 0

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.840 
negative whole numbers and it includes 0
so<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.410> do<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.710> integers<00:03:23.100> on<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.550> line

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
so if you do the integers on this line

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.690 
so if you do the integers on this line
it<00:03:24.060> would<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.210> everything<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.750> I'm<00:03:24.930> doing<00:03:24.960> in

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
it would be everything that I'm doing in

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.970 
it would be everything that I'm doing in
orange<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:27.330> there's<00:03:27.900> two<00:03:28.110> other<00:03:28.140> sets<00:03:28.740> that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
orange now there's two other sets that

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.970 
orange now there's two other sets that
are<00:03:29.040> subsets<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.850> integers<00:03:30.560> depending<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:31.710> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
are subsets of integers depending on the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.980 
are subsets of integers depending on the
interpretation<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:33.060> look<00:03:33.270> at<00:03:33.450> so

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
interpretation you you look at so

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.990 
interpretation you you look at so
sometimes<00:03:34.650> you'll<00:03:34.920> hear<00:03:35.160> people<00:03:35.310> say<00:03:35.490> whole

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
sometimes you'll hear people say whole

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.760 
sometimes you'll hear people say whole
numbers<00:03:36.740> whole<00:03:37.880> whole<00:03:38.880> numbers<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.960> this<00:03:40.590> is

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
numbers whole whole numbers and this is

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.560 
numbers whole whole numbers and this is
a<00:03:40.800> bit<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.160> an<00:03:41.250> ambiguous<00:03:41.580> statement<00:03:42.030> because

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
a bit of an ambiguous statement because

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.390 
a bit of an ambiguous statement because
sometimes<00:03:43.170> when<00:03:43.380> people<00:03:43.410> say<00:03:43.650> whole<00:03:44.010> numbers

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
sometimes when people say whole numbers

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.480 
sometimes when people say whole numbers
they're<00:03:44.880> referring<00:03:45.240> to<00:03:45.410> integers<00:03:46.490> sometimes

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
they're referring to integers sometimes

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.920 
they're referring to integers sometimes
when<00:03:47.760> they're<00:03:47.910> referring<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.300> whole<00:03:48.540> numbers

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
when they're referring to whole numbers

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.440 
when they're referring to whole numbers
they're<00:03:49.380> referring<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:50.450> non-negative

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
they're referring to non-negative

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.540 
they're referring to non-negative
integers<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.050> 0<00:03:52.410> 1<00:03:52.800> 2<00:03:53.070> 3

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
integers so 0 1 2 3

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.490 
integers so 0 1 2 3
sometimes<00:03:54.450> they're<00:03:54.660> referring<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.020> just

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
sometimes they're referring to just

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.030 
sometimes they're referring to just
positive<00:03:56.190> integers<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.150> 1<00:03:57.420> 2<00:03:57.810> 3<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.500> on<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.890> so

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
positive integers so 1 2 3 so on and so

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.190 
positive integers so 1 2 3 so on and so
forth<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.880> this<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.300> little<00:04:00.570> bit<00:04:00.720> ambiguous

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
forth so this is a little bit ambiguous

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.580 
forth so this is a little bit ambiguous
it's<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.160> little<00:04:02.870> ambiguous<00:04:03.870> I've<00:04:04.290> seen<00:04:04.470> it

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
it's a little ambiguous I've seen it

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.340 
it's a little ambiguous I've seen it
used<00:04:05.060> I've<00:04:06.060> seen<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.420> used<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:06.750> all<00:04:07.020> of<00:04:07.050> those

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
used I've seen it used in all of those

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.440 
used I've seen it used in all of those
different<00:04:07.560> ways<00:04:07.970> but<00:04:08.970> if<00:04:09.060> someone<00:04:09.270> says<00:04:09.420> a

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
different ways but if someone says a

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.090 
different ways but if someone says a
whole<00:04:09.630> number<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:10.050> generally<00:04:10.709> think<00:04:10.740> of

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
whole number I generally think of

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.820 
whole number I generally think of
non-negative<00:04:12.000> numbers<00:04:12.330> it's<00:04:12.840> ambiguous<00:04:13.200> but

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
non-negative numbers it's ambiguous but

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.310 
non-negative numbers it's ambiguous but
for<00:04:14.640> our<00:04:14.760> purposes<00:04:15.209> let's<00:04:15.420> think<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.810> as<00:04:15.959> 0

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
for our purposes let's think of it as 0

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.880 
for our purposes let's think of it as 0
1<00:04:16.799> 2<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:18.299> on<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.660> so<00:04:18.780> forth<00:04:19.049> now<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.350> last<00:04:19.680> one

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
1 2 so on and so forth now the last one

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.460 
1 2 so on and so forth now the last one
to<00:04:20.130> consider<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.580> natural<00:04:21.030> numbers<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.960> once

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
to consider is natural numbers and once

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.300 
to consider is natural numbers and once
again<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:22.830> one<00:04:23.040> is<00:04:23.070> also<00:04:23.460> ambiguous<00:04:24.470> natural

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
again this one is also ambiguous natural

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.370 
again this one is also ambiguous natural
numbers<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.930> reason<00:04:28.139> why<00:04:28.200> it's<00:04:28.290> called

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
numbers and the reason why it's called

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.200 
numbers and the reason why it's called
natural<00:04:28.740> numbers<00:04:28.980> these<00:04:29.220> are<00:04:29.340> numbers<00:04:30.090> that

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
natural numbers these are numbers that

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.670 
natural numbers these are numbers that
you<00:04:30.330> would<00:04:30.419> actually<00:04:30.570> encounter<00:04:31.320> if<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.590> were

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
you would actually encounter if you were

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.320 
you would actually encounter if you were
to<00:04:31.800> either<00:04:32.190> try<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.490> order<00:04:32.760> things<00:04:33.120> or

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
to either try to order things or

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.140 
to either try to order things or
actually<00:04:33.450> count<00:04:33.810> things<00:04:34.050> in<00:04:34.380> nature<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.820> it

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
actually count things in nature so it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.340 
actually count things in nature so it
definitely<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:37.680> is<00:04:37.800> also<00:04:38.190> ambiguous

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
definitely so this is also ambiguous

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.110 
definitely so this is also ambiguous
this<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.560> also<00:04:40.889> ambiguous<00:04:41.220> but<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:41.910> definitely

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
this is also ambiguous but it definitely

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.570 
this is also ambiguous but it definitely
excludes<00:04:43.010> but<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.100> definitely<00:04:47.330> excludes

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
excludes but it definitely excludes

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.840 
excludes but it definitely excludes
negative<00:04:50.580> numbers<00:04:50.910> negative<00:04:52.070> numbers<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.310> so

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
negative numbers negative numbers and so

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.950 
negative numbers negative numbers and so
if<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.030> definitely<00:04:54.330> excludes<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.690> negative

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
if it definitely excludes a negative

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.150 
if it definitely excludes a negative
number<00:04:55.050> just<00:04:55.290> like<00:04:55.440> why<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.889> ambiguous

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
number just like why is it ambiguous

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.590 
number just like why is it ambiguous
well<00:04:56.490> it's<00:04:56.610> ambiguous<00:04:56.820> whether<00:04:57.210> it<00:04:57.360> includes

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
well it's ambiguous whether it includes

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.719 
well it's ambiguous whether it includes
0<00:04:57.830> so<00:04:58.940> sometimes<00:04:59.940> zero<00:05:00.180> is<00:05:00.630> natural<00:05:01.139> so<00:05:01.440> 0<00:05:01.770> may

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
0 so sometimes zero is natural so 0 may

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:09.680 
0 so sometimes zero is natural so 0 may
or<00:05:03.979> may<00:05:04.979> not<00:05:06.260> be<00:05:07.260> natural<00:05:08.100> depending<00:05:08.910> on<00:05:09.060> the

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
or may not be natural depending on the

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.020 
or may not be natural depending on the
context<00:05:10.290> may<00:05:10.530> or<00:05:10.770> may<00:05:10.950> not<00:05:10.979> be<00:05:11.430> natural<00:05:11.610> now

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
context may or may not be natural now

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.390 
context may or may not be natural now
let's<00:05:12.690> answer<00:05:12.960> our<00:05:13.169> actual<00:05:13.800> question<00:05:14.160> what

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
let's answer our actual question what

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.150 
let's answer our actual question what
number<00:05:14.820> sets<00:05:15.060> does<00:05:15.360> 8<00:05:15.570> belong<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.380> well<00:05:16.979> 8

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
number sets does 8 belong to well 8

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.920 
number sets does 8 belong to well 8
definitely<00:05:17.940> belongs<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.720> real<00:05:18.870> numbers

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
definitely belongs to the real numbers

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.200 
definitely belongs to the real numbers
it<00:05:19.620> is<00:05:19.770> on<00:05:19.919> the<00:05:20.100> number<00:05:20.250> line<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.880> is

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
it is on the number line it is

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.820 
it is on the number line it is
definitely<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.780> rational<00:05:22.350> number<00:05:22.380> we<00:05:22.710> can

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
definitely a rational number we can

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.510 
definitely a rational number we can
express<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.280> as<00:05:23.430> 8<00:05:23.729> over<00:05:24.180> 1<00:05:24.210> or<00:05:24.450> 16<00:05:25.380> over<00:05:25.800> 2<00:05:26.040> or

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
express it as 8 over 1 or 16 over 2 or

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.270 
express it as 8 over 1 or 16 over 2 or
even<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.450> know<00:05:27.479> negative<00:05:28.050> 8<00:05:28.320> over<00:05:28.710> negative<00:05:28.889> 1

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
even you know negative 8 over negative 1

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.320 
even you know negative 8 over negative 1
I<00:05:29.310> mean<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:29.580> could<00:05:29.700> actually<00:05:29.820> have<00:05:30.060> an

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
I mean you could actually have an

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.719 
I mean you could actually have an

infinite number of ways to express it as
a<00:05:33.120> fraction<00:05:33.539> so<00:05:33.840> it's<00:05:34.020> definitely<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.560> rational

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
a fraction so it's definitely a rational

if I go out and count trees I can count
8<00:05:52.740> trees<00:05:53.220> so<00:05:53.789> it<00:05:53.880> is<00:05:54.030> a<00:05:54.120> positive<00:05:54.360> you<00:05:54.840> know<00:05:54.960> if

it might be a natural number but eight

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.600 
it might be a natural number but eight
definitely<00:06:00.750> is<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:00.990> natural<00:06:01.620> number<00:06:01.889> so<00:06:02.039> it's<00:06:02.490> a

definitely is a natural number so it's a

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.710 
definitely is a natural number so it's a
