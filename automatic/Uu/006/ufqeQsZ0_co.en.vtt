out<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.240> Clippers<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.750> let's<00:01:06.930> face<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
out with the Clippers and let's face it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.310 
out with the Clippers and let's face it
this<00:01:07.680> dude<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:09.060> an<00:01:09.180> all-star<00:01:09.390> he<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.140> has

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
this dude can be an all-star he just has

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170 
this dude can be an all-star he just has
to<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.490> floor<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:11.970> quite

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
to be out on that floor and it's quite

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
to be out on that floor and it's quite
apparent<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> Phoenix<00:01:13.560> Suns<00:01:13.770> don't

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
apparent that the Phoenix Suns don't

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
apparent that the Phoenix Suns don't
want<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> pay<00:01:14.640> him<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> max<00:01:15.119> contract<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:16.049> he

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
want to pay him a max contract that he

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
want to pay him a max contract that he
will<00:01:16.350> probably<00:01:16.590> only<00:01:17.280> stick<00:01:17.549> around<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
will probably only stick around for a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
will probably only stick around for a
year<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.659> become<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> free<00:01:19.439> agent<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
year and become a free agent so go get a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.359 
year and become a free agent so go get a
max<00:01:20.759> deal<00:01:21.000> from<00:01:21.479> some<00:01:21.840> warehouse<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.890> people

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
max deal from some warehouse and people

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.039 
max deal from some warehouse and people
have<00:01:23.549> their<00:01:23.759> reservations<00:01:24.420> about<00:01:24.570> whether<00:01:24.869> or

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
have their reservations about whether or

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
have their reservations about whether or
not<00:01:25.140> he<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.500> flourish<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.280> Goran<00:01:26.670> Dragic

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
not he can flourish with Goran Dragic

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.210 
not he can flourish with Goran Dragic
but<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.840> he<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.380> an<00:01:28.500> all-star<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
but I think he will be an all-star this

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700 
but I think he will be an all-star this
year<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.610> he<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.119> out<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.840> floor<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
year if he is out on that floor and the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
year if he is out on that floor and the
Phoenix<00:01:32.040> Suns<00:01:32.280> probably<00:01:32.850> won't<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.210> surprised

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
Phoenix Suns probably won't be surprised

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.990 
Phoenix Suns probably won't be surprised
in<00:01:33.750> anybody<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.320> upcoming<00:01:34.530> season<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.700> Eric

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
in anybody this upcoming season so Eric

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.969 
in anybody this upcoming season so Eric
