dark damage to kind of crank up crank

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
dark damage to kind of crank up crank
that<00:02:02.070> stat<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.579> little<00:02:02.729> bit<00:02:02.990> because<00:02:03.990> it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that stat up a little bit because it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
that stat up a little bit because it
usually<00:02:04.409> seems<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.740> scale<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.159> quite<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> bit

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
usually seems to scale it quite a bit

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.119 
usually seems to scale it quite a bit
better<00:02:05.729> than<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.240> pure<00:02:06.600> physical<00:02:07.129> so

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
better than just going pure physical so

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.210 
better than just going pure physical so
I<00:02:08.399> guess<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.970> best<00:02:09.060> way<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.239> describe<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.629> is

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
I guess the best way to describe that is

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.950 
I guess the best way to describe that is
if<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.430> said<00:02:11.670> dark<00:02:12.270> roaring

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
if it said dark roaring

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.010 
if it said dark roaring

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
anyway let's take a look at the move set

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.850 
anyway let's take a look at the move set
completely<00:02:24.540> standard<00:02:24.930> move<00:02:25.110> set<00:02:25.350> for<00:02:25.530> Albert

completely standard move set for Albert

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.350 
completely standard move set for Albert
but<00:02:26.100> let's<00:02:26.310> go<00:02:26.430> through<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.670> all<00:02:26.760> anyway<00:02:27.030> if

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
but let's go through it all anyway if

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.410 
but let's go through it all anyway if
you're<00:02:27.570> blocking<00:02:28.790> or<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.210> have<00:02:30.300> your

you're blocking or if you have your
guard<00:02:30.600> up<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.900> then<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> basic<00:02:31.380> attack

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
guard up and then you do a basic attack

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770 
guard up and then you do a basic attack
you<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.550> attack<00:02:32.880> without<00:02:33.030> dropping<00:02:33.690> your

you<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.290> follow<00:02:46.470> up<00:02:46.620> with<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> left-to-right

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
you can follow up with a left-to-right

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.310 
you can follow up with a left-to-right
sweep<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.820> then<00:02:51.180> another<00:02:51.540> overhand<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.200> just

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
sweep and then another overhand it just

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.610 
sweep and then another overhand it just
keeps<00:02:52.500> doing<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:52.800> sequence<00:02:53.730> right<00:02:53.880> there

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
keeps doing that sequence right there

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.190 
keeps doing that sequence right there
the<00:02:55.620> step-back<00:02:56.070> attack<00:02:56.570> one-handed<00:03:00.200> which

the step-back attack one-handed which

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.380 
the step-back attack one-handed which
transitions<00:03:01.800> very<00:03:01.860> nicely<00:03:02.190> into<00:03:02.460> more<00:03:02.730> normal

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
transitions very nicely into more normal

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.280 
transitions very nicely into more normal
attacks<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:06.420> same<00:03:06.600> thing<00:03:06.840> sprinting

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
attacks and the same thing sprinting

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.770 
attacks and the same thing sprinting
it's<00:03:07.740> actually<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.070> very<00:03:08.250> good<00:03:08.580> move<00:03:08.820> for

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
it's actually a very good move for

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.150 
it's actually a very good move for
chasing<00:03:10.050> down<00:03:10.320> people<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.830> are<00:03:10.920> sprinting

chasing down people that are sprinting

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.180 
chasing down people that are sprinting
away<00:03:11.490> in<00:03:11.730> PvP<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:13.550> then<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.790> roll<00:03:15.150> attack

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.260 
away in PvP and then the roll attack
look<00:03:17.190> I'm<00:03:17.340> an<00:03:17.460> uppercut<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:17.940> also

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
look I'm an uppercut that also

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.110 
look I'm an uppercut that also
transitions<00:03:18.960> very<00:03:19.170> nicely<00:03:19.830> into<00:03:20.220> more<00:03:20.640> normal

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
right there and I think that's it so now

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.830 
right there and I think that's it so now
let's<00:04:26.650> go<00:04:26.770> try<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.550> kill<00:04:28.300> somebody<00:04:28.510> with<00:04:28.780> this

so I invaded the world of powerlifter 76
I<00:04:38.100> think<00:04:39.100> that's<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.400> year<00:04:39.699> that<00:04:40.000> Arnold<00:04:40.479> won

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160
