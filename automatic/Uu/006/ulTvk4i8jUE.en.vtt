00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.960
 introduction to manual controls of 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.880
 fifa 14 let's move on to the second part we have 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.800
 spoken so far of what are the 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.650
 manual controls let's see now 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.620
 something less tangible because you have to play 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.599
 with manual controls go ahead 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.159
 the following if someone who is watching 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.810
 this video has the following mentality 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.609
 is in the wrong place what 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.009
 mentality one that leads you to think what 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.869
 next I open quotes is that it's better 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.669
 assisted control because it's easier 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.529
 I close quotes 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.539
 if someone relates the facility with the 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.399
 The fact of being better or worse is evident 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.800
 that for him manual controls do not 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.300
 they are not even a possibility the same 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.190
 it happens the other way if someone thinks 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.780
 The harder the better, then 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.609
 their controls are and should be the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.589
 manuals but much less in the fact 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.120
 of being more difficult to finish 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.280
 differences with the assisted controls 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.809
 for me there are several reasons why 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.280
 manual control is the only way in 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.929
 the one that I can conceive a soccer game 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.760
 Today we will look at these reasons 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.480
 less to more important according to my point 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.370
 of sight 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.019
 first the aforementioned difficulty that 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.909
 no need to explain the game in 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.159
 manual is infinitely more difficult than 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.750
 have attended for obvious reasons second 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.900
 the fixed realism appears a want and not 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.640
 I can constant your search for a game 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 but the fact of playing with controls 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.420
 manuals increases many points that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.980
 set aside especially when you start 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.470
 to master the game the little mistakes 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.850
 in the countries the almost total disappearance 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.230
 of the perfect high balls 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 Impossible from the back of the defense 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.220
 some shots much more according to what 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.780
 you can see in a real game the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.520
 need to pause the rhythm of each 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.050
 match because every assistance you do 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.210
 has to be very well thought of in the 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.130
 list really is infinite and it starts and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.540
 ends with absolutely any type 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.180
 of a pass or shot that occurs in the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.770
 game third the balance no 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.600
 fifa player has stopped hearing 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.460
 innumerable number of times per year the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.560
 famous phrase the shots to place are 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.479
 too much about power 2 it changes it 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 of shots to be placed by shooting centers 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.750
 head to the snowy hole or what 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.790
 be it also the famous ping-pong 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.110
 passing all this does not exist manual 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.640
 because now every action has a 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.770
 difficulty according to the danger that can 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.479
 carry because good very easy to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.250
 explain let's take the example of the pass 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.660
 at the time of trying to give up the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.830
 ball to a partner is not the same 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.510
 do it to a free defense that is 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.950
 five meters with this case you find 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.119
 this gap between rival defenses 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.860
 to take advantage of an uncheck of this 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.660
 style in this case we have no opposition 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.890
 it's easy to find the exact address 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.690
 with the left stick because the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.510
 partner is relatively close is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.790
 just because we have time 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.140
 because we can afford not to 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.909
 sending the ball is exactly at 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.819
 goal that would be the defense's foot 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.470
 nothing to do with something like this between these 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.450
 two ends of passes one 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.610
 very simple and very difficult one we have 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.629
 through everything else and equally is 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.629
 applicable to high passes 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.140
 High depth passes 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.670
 centers 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.980
 and shots 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.780
 in manual there are not only easy passes 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.130
 or difficult passes there is a line of 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.810
 infinite difficulty where they remain 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.640
 embedded the different pass actions 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.380
 and shot all with their correct scale 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.940
 of difficulty starting with the most 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.830
 basic to go up little by little and 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.110
 end the almost impossible everything is 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.640
 logical the assisted controls also 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.080
 they have a margin of error based on the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.120
 difficulty of the action difficulty that 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.500
 is decided by the cpu but one of the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.330
 problems that it has is that rarely 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.800
 we see that it is well adjusted and hence 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.750
 complaints are born about the previously 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.370
 mentioned about potentially 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.200
 certain actions there is no balance 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.000
 some have attended and one thing has to 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.620
 continues to be clear as if to give 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.209
 the key to make it in assisted 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.470
 I saw a logical percentage of success 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.270
 depending on the difficulty of each 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.770
 action the result of each play 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.840
 it would still be completely decided 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.520
 by cpe 1 or by the player what today 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.930
 would work for example 95 percent 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.820
 of the times may in the future what 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.740
 did 50 percent but he wanted to 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.270
 be inter in the fourth control the 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.250
 freedom a synonym of controls 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.690
 manuals could be free controls is 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.940
 As simple as you put the ball 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.500
 where you indicate with the command just like that 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.580
 we will delve deeper into this in the fourth 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.920
 video of this introduction but of 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.510
 moment a small preview at the end of 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.380
 first video we saw this example was not 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.820
 chance that put it there is to try 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.740
 the best proof of what can be done 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.250
 with manual controls and nails the pass 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.590
 what are you looking for 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.930
 this in assisted is impossible because 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.120
 because you execute unattended what the 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.950
 cpe or consider an advance pass the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.840
 question is where does that pass 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.400
 advanced in a situation like that 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.820
 example is simple there is no possibility 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.440
 of doubt and really spending here here or 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.020
 here is not going to make a big difference 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.820
 to the play but here yes here only worth 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.590
 this place and this place corresponds to 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.480
 an exact address and an exact force 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.060
 and that the cpu finds this path 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.580
 it's pure luck the manual is pure 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.040
 skill last point the fifth and for 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.260
 me the most important justice to what 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.510
 I mean good the following sentence what 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.600
 It explains pretty well if I hit right 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.460
 If I fail, I fail the end of the 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.290
 history the cpu stops being finally 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.000
 participant of our assistance 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.470
 perfect or goals sung fails 2 for 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.150
 give us total control 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.040
 we talked before the cpu in 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.780
 assisted decides the pass that normally 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.950
 it is not well balanced especially 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.780
 for actions that are really 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.130
 quite complicated now when we 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.140
 we face any situation of 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.730
 match the manual we have the certainty of 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.830
 that in the vast majority of 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.750
 chances we are going to do 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.520
 the culprits of the success of the failure of 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.950
 all passes and shots that failed 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.600
 this very simple pass I fail that 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.400
 hit this simple pass what 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.680
 hit me what shooting failures to 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.600
 point of view I miss that I hit on 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.760
 this hand to hand hit I 've taken 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.260
 to the extreme that this Chilean takes the 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.350
 palo has sued the stick 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.910
 I pointed to the stick not the cpu that 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.610
 I nail the whole squad from outside 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.080
 of the area this volley has nailed it I have 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.480
 put the exact power and has directed 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.010
 the ball on the line stuck to the club and 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.570
 it is not the machine as it happens in assisted 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.160
 who decides to give me a goal 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.480
 anthological is not the machine that 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.130
 indeci to fail me a shot to door 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.750
 empty this is for me the big difference 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.580
 between manual control and control 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.590
 assisted the success of all actions 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.230
 of pass and shot in assisted what decides 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.750
 the cpu in manual decides the player what 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.040
 we decide we will see each other in the 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.600
 third introductory video to the 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.340
 manual controls will talk about a 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.590
 rather complicated issue not at the level of 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.330
 gameplay but of options is none other than 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.350
 the online game the manual here the subject 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.350
 Believe me until then
