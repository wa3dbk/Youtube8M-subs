00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.730
 Now I'm sleeping in the final stage sound progressed so far look at the contents of the underside 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.789
 It looks white. 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.910
 Rammy's all about the same two lines. 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:19.500
 The next town is yellow. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:25.730
 If you look at the end of the year like this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.730
 They come in the same color. They all have the same color. 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:37.050
 What's that you two colors coming out of the two sides of the same color Page 1 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.140
 One example is John coming on the other side, then so it is their color tools 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.300
 Only one side has color 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.030
 If you have 2.0, maybe there are colors inside. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.500
 In this case 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.120
 I use the formula now on the same side. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.420
 If you keep this in mind, then 2.4 is the same as green. 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.300
 There 's a time when both sides come out on the same side . 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.449
 Just like this one, 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.860
 There are times when everything here is the same here and there. 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.660
 Sometimes there's something wrong with everything or everything. 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:19.020
 All 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:21.060
 When this bounce both the composer's it's all right or the far side or no 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.990
 You can use the formula you use. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:31.500
 This closes one side 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:35.580
 On the other side of the trim, hold the same face and use the formula now 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:41.600
 The formula you use is the same. 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.600
 Not the other hand, in the front give this right will put right 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.060
 Give it back , then give it back. 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:56.270
 Amen . Raise your right . 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.270
 Returns Ian said that's twice 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:06.320
 4 Down the right side . 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.320
 Return the beating face again 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.520
 You raise the right side. 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.610
 Return the migration plane twice 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.970
 These days I do not think so. 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.110
 Dame makes two more on the left side 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:29.690
 Give me two times. Give it to me. 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:35.050
 I gave it to 4, and it looks like this now. 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.050
 So the interiors are now tangy red green 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.310
 So the color in the orange color looks like a side towards the society too 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.390
 It's coming out. 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.420
 Now if this looks like it, you can use it now and use it again. 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.420
 Ah 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.489

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.489
 Years 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.799
 Give it back first, give it up front and put it up. 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.799
 Show the front face 2 times to the left 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:07.920
 Two times to give it back. 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:12.750
 Drop the right side down. 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:17.750
 Press and to embellish the back of the system 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.750
 And then you put the right side up. 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.170
 Return the front face twice 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.170
 Give me a little more. 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:36.750

 3 Confucius wrong gatjiyo in group 1 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.270
 Until you can use the formula now and use it again based on one side 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.180
 You can. 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:55.320
 Mark Chagal, four people, practice one more time. 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.060
 It will again put to sleep the back 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.959
 Let's'm left model 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.959

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.069
 Return the front face to the second lantern 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.069
 2 half 4 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.580
 Down right down . 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:18.290

 Two rooms then two heavens down 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.700
