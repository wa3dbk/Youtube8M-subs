called Microsoft edge the new browser

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.110 
called Microsoft edge the new browser
and<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.460> notice<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:43.190> address<00:00:44.190> bar<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.700> down

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and you notice the address bar is down

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.690 
and you notice the address bar is down
here<00:00:45.480> at<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.930> bottom<00:00:46.079> where<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.399> in

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
here at the bottom where it was in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.760 
here at the bottom where it was in
Windows<00:00:48.030> Phone<00:00:48.450> 8<00:00:48.719> 1<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.320> think<00:00:49.440> he<00:00:49.590> works

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
Windows Phone 8 1 and I think he works

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.920 
Windows Phone 8 1 and I think he works
much<00:00:49.980> better<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.489> fans<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> down

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
much better for fans to have it down

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.549 
much better for fans to have it down
there<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.469> good<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.820> back

there so it's good to see that that back

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.900 
there so it's good to see that that back
so<00:00:55.559> i'll<00:00:55.649> show<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.980> animation<00:00:56.340> again<00:00:56.640> fo

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it to do it you see how it slides away

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.720 
it to do it you see how it slides away
like<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.600> definitely<00:01:00.960> new<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
like that that is definitely new now the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.170 
like that that is definitely new now the
other<00:01:02.940> thing<00:01:03.059> that's<00:01:04.460> new<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.939> bill

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
other thing that's new in this bill

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
other thing that's new in this bill
really<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.990> more<00:01:07.170> general<00:01:07.590> refinements<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
really it's more general refinements and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
really it's more general refinements and
using<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> face<00:01:09.060> fixie<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.320> probably

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
using to face fixie so you probably

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.140 
using to face fixie so you probably
can't<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.310> tell<00:01:11.460> too<00:01:11.580> much<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.880> video

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
can't really tell too much in this video

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870 
can't really tell too much in this video
but<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.570> lot<00:01:12.720> sharper<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.619> text<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
but it's a lot sharper the text on the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.359 
but it's a lot sharper the text on the
pinned<00:01:15.140> items<00:01:16.140> look<00:01:16.380> sharper<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.040> everything

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
pinned items look sharper and everything

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.550 
pinned items look sharper and everything
looks<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.700> lot<00:01:17.820> cleaner<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.869> i<00:01:19.080> think

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
looks a lot cleaner as well so i think

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.490 
looks a lot cleaner as well so i think
that<00:01:19.740> looks<00:01:20.009> quite<00:01:20.250> nice<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.170> as<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.320> seen

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that looks quite nice and as you seen

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.289 
that looks quite nice and as you seen
with<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.850> animations<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:23.939> well<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> whole

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
with the animations as well the whole

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
with the animations as well the whole
visual<00:01:24.630> look<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:26.220> OS<00:01:26.640> seems<00:01:27.210> better<00:01:28.009> if<00:01:29.009> i

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
visual look of the OS seems better if i

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.789 
visual look of the OS seems better if i
go<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.490> another<00:01:29.790> app<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:34.439> music

going to the notebook here in Cortana

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.300 
going to the notebook here in Cortana
you<00:03:46.109> can<00:03:46.290> see<00:03:46.410> you've<00:03:46.530> got<00:03:46.620> quiet<00:03:46.920> hours

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
you can see you've got quiet hours

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.880 
you can see you've got quiet hours
settings<00:03:48.299> on<00:03:48.510> there<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.260> all<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.530> has<00:03:49.739> been

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
settings on there and all this has been

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.740 
settings on there and all this has been
cleaned<00:03:50.670> up<00:03:50.790> quite<00:03:51.000> nicely<00:03:51.030> actually<00:03:51.480> with

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
cleaned up quite nicely actually with

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.810 
cleaned up quite nicely actually with
the<00:03:51.840> new<00:03:52.019> UI<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.769> there<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.160> that's<00:03:53.609> definitely

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
the new UI on there so that's definitely

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.440 
the new UI on there so that's definitely
looking<00:03:54.239> better<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:56.120> showed<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.299> before

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
looking better I showed you this before

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.990 
looking better I showed you this before
so<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.109> value<00:03:58.500> have<00:03:58.620> installed<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.310> OneNote

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
so I value have installed it and OneNote

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.900 
so I value have installed it and OneNote
now<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.359> if<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.630> click<00:04:00.750> on<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.049> note<00:04:01.579> it<00:04:02.579> takes

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
now so if you click on the note it takes

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.630

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.780
