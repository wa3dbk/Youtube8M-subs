earlier that the person from Bug's to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.910 
earlier that the person from Bug's to
one<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.660> engineers<00:02:36.170> from<00:02:36.410> 20<00:02:36.650> years<00:02:36.800> ago

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
one of the engineers from 20 years ago

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.070 
one of the engineers from 20 years ago
was<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:37.820> oh<00:02:37.940> he's<00:02:38.180> still<00:02:38.360> alive<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.959> was

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
making me wonder like maybe he put them

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270 
making me wonder like maybe he put them
in<00:02:41.540> there<00:02:41.900> while<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.200> do<00:02:42.350> what<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.770> what's

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
in there while you do what like what's

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.979 
in there while you do what like what's
going<00:02:43.580> on<00:02:43.730> like<00:02:43.910> how<00:02:44.060> did<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.330> what<00:02:44.780> words

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
going on like how did this what words

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.780 
going on like how did this what words
get<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.620> feel<00:02:46.100> like<00:02:46.190> why<00:02:46.459> would<00:02:46.640> they

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
get in that I feel like why would they

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.610 
get in that I feel like why would they
ask<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.269> stuff<00:02:47.570> in<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.870> head<00:02:48.019> like<00:02:48.380> what

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
ask this stuff in the head like what

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.050 
ask this stuff in the head like what
they<00:02:48.769> asked<00:02:49.010> its<00:02:49.130> engineer<00:02:49.550> stuff<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.910> ask

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
they asked its engineer stuff and ask

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.790 
they asked its engineer stuff and ask
him<00:02:50.330> for<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.600> question<00:02:50.989> why<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.470> know<00:02:51.620> why<00:02:51.650> you

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
him for a question why you know why you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.130 
him for a question why you know why you
NASA<00:02:52.220> would<00:02:52.459> like<00:02:53.000> stop<00:02:53.180> questioning<00:02:53.660> him<00:02:53.840> if

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
NASA would like stop questioning him if

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.930 
NASA would like stop questioning him if
there<00:02:54.470> wasn't<00:02:54.800> some<00:02:54.950> sort<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.280> meaning<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.670> it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
there wasn't some sort of meaning to it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.180 
there wasn't some sort of meaning to it
so<00:02:56.239> I'm<00:02:56.780> guessing<00:02:57.080> maybe<00:02:57.380> he<00:02:57.709> has<00:02:57.800> a<00:02:57.830> little

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
so I'm guessing maybe he has a little

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.830 
so I'm guessing maybe he has a little
bit<00:02:58.280> more<00:02:58.489> than<00:02:58.700> I'm<00:02:58.820> imagining<00:02:59.269> like<00:02:59.630> he<00:02:59.720> has

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
bit more than I'm imagining like he has

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.750

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
like eight minutes of this episode it

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.879 
like eight minutes of this episode it
was<00:05:01.639> amazing<00:05:02.210> it<00:05:02.330> did<00:05:02.479> change<00:05:02.720> it<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:02.990> deadly

I would say the first couple minutes in
thickness<00:05:07.430> was<00:05:07.669> needed<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.330> develop<00:05:08.630> these

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
thickness was needed to develop these

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.250 
thickness was needed to develop these
characters<00:05:09.380> so<00:05:10.070> I'm<00:05:10.690> really<00:05:11.690> conflicted<00:05:11.960> with

it but I'm also going to give this an
ar-10<00:05:13.940> I<00:05:14.150> thought<00:05:14.389> this<00:05:14.540> was<00:05:14.660> like<00:05:14.690> a<00:05:14.930> very

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.050 
good episode and I think episode free is
going<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.130> be<00:05:19.220> that<00:05:19.430> stuff<00:05:19.669> that<00:05:19.700> everyone
