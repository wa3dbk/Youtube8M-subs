00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.570 

okay<00:00:02.370> here's<00:00:02.610> this<00:00:02.820> engine<00:00:03.950> not<00:00:04.950> be<00:00:05.130> easier<00:00:05.460> if

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
okay here's this engine not be easier if

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay here's this engine not be easier if
I<00:00:05.700> just<00:00:05.730> made<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> little<00:00:06.240> video<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.750> it

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
I just made a little video of it

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.100 
I just made a little video of it
attached<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:07.649> because<00:00:08.450> these<00:00:09.450> bottoms<00:00:09.929> on

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
attached it because these bottoms on

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.200 
attached it because these bottoms on
these<00:00:10.290> ones<00:00:10.559> are<00:00:10.710> always<00:00:10.950> kind<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.519> weird<00:00:11.730> and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
these ones are always kind of weird and

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.930 
these ones are always kind of weird and
so<00:00:13.049> here's<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.410> bottom<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.460> can<00:00:14.580> see<00:00:14.790> how

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
so here's the bottom so you can see how

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.929 
so here's the bottom so you can see how
there's<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.740> another<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:19.279> extension<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.460> metal

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
there's a another a extension of metal

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.849 
there's a another a extension of metal
down<00:00:21.150> before<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> shaft<00:00:22.020> comes<00:00:22.350> out<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.769> it

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
down before the shaft comes out and it

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.560 
down before the shaft comes out and it
actually<00:00:22.980> melts<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.269> there's<00:00:24.480> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
actually melts you know there's a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.019 
actually melts you know there's a
mounting<00:00:24.869> hole<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:26.279> there's<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.699> mounting

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
mounting hole and there's a mounting

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.810 
mounting hole and there's a mounting
hole<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.869> one<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> hate<00:00:28.830> 1<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> 1/8

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
hole this is one and a hate 1 and 1/8

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.650 
hole this is one and a hate 1 and 1/8
inch<00:00:30.150> long<00:00:30.449> from<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.560> from<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.660> point

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
inch long from there from that point

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.200 
inch long from there from that point
right<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:33.960> there<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.710> then<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> key<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.989> 3

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
right in there and then the key is 3

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.959 
right in there and then the key is 3
3/16<00:00:41.030> it's<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> choke<00:00:43.040> start<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
3/16 it's got the choke start and it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.450 
3/16 it's got the choke start and it
just<00:00:45.420> runs<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> automatic<00:00:46.620> speed<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.340> know

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
just runs the automatic speed you know

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.590 
just runs the automatic speed you know
to<00:00:47.550> make<00:00:47.789> up<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.210> any<00:00:48.840> loads<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.410> whatever

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
to make up for any loads or whatever

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.350 
to make up for any loads or whatever
there's<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> key<00:00:52.489> there's<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> Woodruff<00:00:54.120> key

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
there's the key there's a Woodruff key

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.750 
there's the key there's a Woodruff key
that<00:00:54.719> kind<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> looks<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.590> somebody<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that kind of looks like somebody you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.790 
that kind of looks like somebody you
know<00:00:56.879> cut<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> circular<00:00:59.870> blade<00:01:00.870> from

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
know cut it with a circular blade from

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.490 
know cut it with a circular blade from
the<00:01:01.890> side<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.870> key<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the side you know it's in the key is

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.950 
the side you know it's in the key is
actually<00:01:04.710> looks<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> little

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
actually looks like it's a little

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.750 
actually looks like it's a little
rounded<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.320> edge<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
rounded on one edge this is not that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.859 
rounded on one edge this is not that
this<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.390> straight<00:01:10.520> square<00:01:11.520> stock<00:01:11.880> key

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this is just a straight square stock key

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.320 
this is just a straight square stock key
that<00:01:13.380> goes<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:13.950> slides<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> there's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that goes in there slides in so there's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.719 
that goes in there slides in so there's
the<00:01:18.509> bottom<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> bottom<00:01:19.229> weird

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.859 

so<00:01:25.299> there's<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.670> makes<00:01:27.880> any<00:01:28.060> sense<00:01:28.149> if

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
so there's the that makes any sense if

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.160 
so there's the that makes any sense if
that<00:01:29.079> helps<00:01:29.530> with<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:30.070> bolt<00:01:30.250> pattern<00:01:30.729> it's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that helps with the bolt pattern it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.319 
that helps with the bolt pattern it's
this<00:01:32.170> one<00:01:32.469> and<00:01:32.890> that<00:01:33.130> one<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.700> then<00:01:34.119> there's

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
this one and that one and then there's

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.990 
this one and that one and then there's
one<00:01:35.140> there<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:36.070> one<00:01:36.159> there

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
one there and one there

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.990 
one there and one there
they're<00:01:37.299> right<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.869> know<00:01:38.020> they're<00:01:38.289> oddly

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
they're right you know they're oddly

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.399 
they're right you know they're oddly
space<00:01:40.000> so<00:01:40.299> it's<00:01:40.450> kind<00:01:40.659> of<00:01:40.720> hard<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:41.170> this

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
space so it's kind of hard that this

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.279 
space so it's kind of hard that this
this<00:01:42.100> one<00:01:42.340> here<00:01:42.579> in<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.149> middle<00:01:43.479> they're

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
this one here in the middle they're

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.929 
this one here in the middle they're
threaded<00:01:44.679> and<00:01:45.130> they<00:01:45.220> can<00:01:45.399> be<00:01:45.520> used<00:01:45.729> for

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
threaded and they can be used for

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.789 
threaded and they can be used for
mountings<00:01:46.329> as<00:01:46.509> well<00:01:47.069> I<00:01:48.929> think<00:01:49.929> I<00:01:50.439> have<00:01:50.649> the

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
mountings as well I think I have the

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.469 
mountings as well I think I have the
measurements<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.490> there<00:01:51.700> let<00:01:51.880> me<00:01:51.969> see<00:01:52.240> if<00:01:52.360> I

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
measurements on there let me see if I

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.789 
measurements on there let me see if I
can<00:01:52.659> get<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.929> measurements<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.909> that<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
can get the measurements for that the

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:05.630 
can get the measurements for that the
look<00:01:58.950> let's<00:01:59.950> see<00:02:00.159> we<00:02:00.340> got<00:02:00.490> one<00:02:01.950> two<00:02:02.950> two<00:02:03.880> and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
look let's see we got one two two and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.699 
look let's see we got one two two and
I'd<00:02:06.640> say<00:02:07.380> 9/16<00:02:09.030> two<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.239> 9/16<00:02:11.110> Center<00:02:11.560> to

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
I'd say 9/16 two and 9/16 Center to

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.970 
I'd say 9/16 two and 9/16 Center to
Center<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:13.239> those<00:02:13.599> holes<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:14.709> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
Center on those holes and then the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.280 
Center on those holes and then the
diameter<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:17.500> about<00:02:18.010> whatever<00:02:19.290> looks

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
diameter of the is about whatever looks

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.740 
diameter of the is about whatever looks
like<00:02:20.530> three<00:02:22.590> three<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:24.360> three<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.450> three

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
like three three and a three and three

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.809 
like three three and a three and three
quarters<00:02:26.230> give<00:02:26.470> or<00:02:26.590> take<00:02:26.769> just<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.549> little<00:02:27.670> bit

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
quarters give or take just a little bit

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.090 
quarters give or take just a little bit
of<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:29.230> diameter<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.130> circle<00:02:30.450> around

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
of the diameter of the circle around

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.720 
of the diameter of the circle around
from<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.609> the<00:02:33.730> center<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.329> hole<00:02:35.730> when

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
from this to the center of the hole when

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.729 
from this to the center of the hole when
there's<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:37.319> shot<00:02:38.319> there<00:02:39.329> shaft<00:02:40.329> that<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.380> not

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
there's a shot there shaft that is not
