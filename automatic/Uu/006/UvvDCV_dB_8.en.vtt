00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 all about dear friends with you is sindy 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.710
 all of them we continue to take a review on 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.719
 ps3 today we are the second part and perhaps 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.509
 let's start with the fact that we need general police 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.920
 3 we already have us connected to it 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.320
 in and in cable 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.279
 It all turns out to be exactly the same 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.519
 connector here as you can see well yes 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.250
 like I give a closer look will show visible 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:33.210
 here here is such a connector plus here 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.340
 there we insert this cable here 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.660
 these things are what causes tulips we 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.360
 connect them to the tower 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 usually either on the side or on the back 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 on my body some kind of site and in 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 special cutout for different about there 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.300
 ready to bask so that's luck 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.899
 sports and I will connect but rather 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:00.090
 I 'll cut it all out 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:03.510
 so I connected everything further that her question 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.909
 us goes to not supply this one 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.640
 internal special connector of many 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.290
 will be seen like this there we insert it into 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.290
 principle is understandable and disgust 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:32.689
 I connected everything and now we go further it 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.979
 lan cable, connect it here 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.030
 a special connector will be written there 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.670
 you, in principle, for the Internet 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.409
 not really needed but what life do you want 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.159
 play it your way you can buy it 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.069
 and if you want want i remember 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:59.349
 should just have to buy it in general 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:02:01.970
 all of us are all connected to the TV so 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:04.280
 I forgot the charging wire 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.269
 gamepad these principle is not particularly important so 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.819
 everything is clear one wide connector already i 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:16.910
 just don't know what it's called him 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:19.150
 insert here you can see there are no 2 guns or 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.850
 micro and call him over here 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:28.130
 goals okay what we do next 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.739
 included salt can press the button 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.420
 you can click here but itâ€™s better to click 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:40.700
 gamepad 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:43.040
 include money we get yes we 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.540
 Vine is worth it is necessary to click on 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.239
 the sauce button is now a reason only sauce 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.910
 you need to click on it and like so here 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.630
 the choice is there with you or the exterior of something 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.660
 worth one and you like that all choose
