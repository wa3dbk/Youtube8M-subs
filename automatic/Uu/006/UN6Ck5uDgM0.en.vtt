00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
of hard for you guys to find that so

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.130 
of hard for you guys to find that so
instead<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.209> guys<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.599> always<00:02:12.930> use

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
instead of that you guys can always use

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.700 
instead of that you guys can always use
the<00:02:13.319> rice

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
the rice

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.780 
the rice
our<00:02:14.000> next<00:02:15.000> thing<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.320> yogurt<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.490> if<00:02:17.700> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
our next thing is the yogurt so if you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.630 
our next thing is the yogurt so if you
guys<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.390> oily<00:02:19.020> skin<00:02:19.280> you're<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.490> have

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
guys have oily skin you're going to have

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.880 
guys have oily skin you're going to have
to<00:02:20.850> put<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.360> yogurt<00:02:21.870> or<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.590> don't<00:02:22.740> have

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
to put in yogurt or if you don't have

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.670 
to put in yogurt or if you don't have
yogurt<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.550> your<00:02:23.700> house<00:02:24.170> more<00:02:25.170> likely<00:02:25.560> you'll

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
yogurt in your house more likely you'll

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.130 
yogurt in your house more likely you'll
probably<00:02:26.160> help<00:02:26.370> milk<00:02:26.910> instead<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.420> yogurt<00:02:27.900> so

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
probably help milk instead of yogurt so

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.040 
probably help milk instead of yogurt so
you<00:02:28.200> can<00:02:28.470> use<00:02:28.650> milk<00:02:29.310> too<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:30.450> all<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.780> girls

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
you can use milk too for all you girls

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.750 
you can use milk too for all you girls
that<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.410> dry<00:02:31.740> skin<00:02:32.130> you're<00:02:32.340> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.580> need

that have dry skin you're going to need

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.210 
that have dry skin you're going to need
an<00:02:32.940> oil<00:02:33.210> instead<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.350> use<00:02:34.500> olive<00:02:34.980> oil

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
an oil instead so you can use olive oil

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.880 
an oil instead so you can use olive oil
coconut<00:02:35.580> oil<00:02:36.000> or<00:02:36.330> almond<00:02:36.810> oil<00:02:37.290> whatever<00:02:37.710> you

have in your house you can use that

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.170 
have in your house you can use that
instead<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.620> yogurt<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.250> last<00:02:41.880> but<00:02:42.060> not

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
rice flour and this just works as a

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.950 
rice flour and this just works as a
scrub<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.700> also<00:03:03.120> helps<00:03:03.420> bind<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.810> mixture

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960
