qualities<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.350> had<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> put<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.800> on

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
qualities because I had to put this on

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.200 
qualities because I had to put this on
my<00:00:41.070> editing<00:00:41.460> software<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:41.940> i<00:00:42.000> could

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
my editing software so i could

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.500 
my editing software so i could
microphone<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:45.390> i

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
microphone over it as like because i

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.670 
microphone over it as like because i
thought<00:00:45.690> i<00:00:45.750> was<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.260> speeded<00:00:46.620> up

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
thought i was going to be all speeded up

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.639 
thought i was going to be all speeded up
but<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.950> won't<00:00:47.100> let<00:00:47.309> me<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.670> some<00:00:47.700> reason<00:00:47.850> um

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
but it won't let me for some reason um

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.900 
but it won't let me for some reason um
so<00:00:49.649> i<00:00:49.829> thought<00:00:50.010> i<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> edit<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.789> but

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
so i thought i was going to edit it but

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
so i thought i was going to edit it but
i'm<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.570> i'm<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.840> microphone<00:00:52.500> and

i'm really not i'm just microphone and
over<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> now<00:00:54.660> we're<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> go<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410
