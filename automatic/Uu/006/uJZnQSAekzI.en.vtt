00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
and I thought it was Raptors but they're

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.270 
and I thought it was Raptors but they're
not<00:03:26.620> actually<00:03:26.829> Raptors<00:03:28.799> but<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.130> from

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.440 
the pack and you can see this is a
sample<00:03:31.540> because<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.870> has<00:03:31.989> no<00:03:33.299> coloring<00:03:34.299> on<00:03:34.389> the

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.719 
can tell like the combination of the
suede<00:04:57.439> and<00:04:57.710> leather<00:04:57.830> again<00:04:58.550> on<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.759> hair<00:04:58.939> so

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
suede and leather again on the hair so

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.580 
suede and leather again on the hair so
definitely<00:05:01.729> worth<00:05:01.909> repeating<00:05:02.479> that<00:05:02.659> and<00:05:03.139> it

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
definitely worth repeating that and it

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.260 
definitely worth repeating that and it
and<00:05:04.009> I<00:05:04.129> don't<00:05:04.400> know<00:05:04.639> about<00:05:04.759> the<00:05:05.000> year<00:05:05.150> the

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409

material or whatever and the leather
combination<00:05:14.150> it<00:05:14.810> just<00:05:15.020> makes<00:05:15.259> it<00:05:15.409> that<00:05:15.620> much

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210
