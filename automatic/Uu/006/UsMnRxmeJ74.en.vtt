us a little bit about this okay a lot of
people<00:00:32.320> have<00:00:32.529> started<00:00:32.650> calling<00:00:32.890> Brent<00:00:33.370> Iser

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
people have started calling Brent Iser

people have started calling Brent Iser
method<00:00:33.970> some<00:00:34.510> people<00:00:34.720> call<00:00:34.870> it<00:00:34.900> bokeh

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
method some people call it bokeh

panorama<00:00:35.920> which<00:00:36.250> is<00:00:36.370> something<00:00:36.580> a<00:00:37.120> little<00:00:37.660> bit

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
panorama which is something a little bit

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.680 
panorama which is something a little bit
descriptive<00:00:38.530> for<00:00:38.830> it<00:00:39.330> it's<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.390> little<00:00:40.600> bit

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
descriptive for it it's a little bit

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.210 
descriptive for it it's a little bit
complicated<00:00:40.960> so<00:00:41.320> maybe<00:00:41.500> it's<00:00:41.710> easiest<00:00:42.010> to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
complicated so maybe it's easiest to

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.549 
complicated so maybe it's easiest to
start<00:00:42.280> with<00:00:42.580> an<00:00:42.670> anecdote<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:43.480> few<00:00:44.140> years<00:00:44.320> ago<00:00:44.530> I

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
start with an anecdote a few years ago I

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.560 
start with an anecdote a few years ago I
was<00:00:44.860> in<00:00:44.980> Ireland<00:00:45.160> and<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:46.090> had<00:00:46.210> this<00:00:46.329> beautiful

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
was in Ireland and I had this beautiful

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.880 
was in Ireland and I had this beautiful
scene<00:00:46.989> in<00:00:47.170> front<00:00:47.410> of<00:00:47.500> me<00:00:47.590> a<00:00:47.620> lot<00:00:47.770> of

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
scene in front of me a lot of

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.130 
scene in front of me a lot of
interesting<00:00:48.250> architectural<00:00:48.850> details<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:50.050> I

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
interesting architectural details and I

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.750 
interesting architectural details and I
looked<00:00:50.379> at<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.649> I<00:00:50.770> said<00:00:50.800> you<00:00:51.190> know<00:00:51.250> I<00:00:51.280> want

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
looked at and I said you know I want

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.360 
looked at and I said you know I want
this<00:00:51.969> scene<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:52.719> kind<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:52.989> wide<00:00:53.230> scene<00:00:53.620> but<00:00:54.340> I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
this scene this kind of wide scene but I

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.610 
this scene this kind of wide scene but I
really<00:00:55.000> I<00:00:55.030> want<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.690> isolate<00:00:55.899> some<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.559> the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
really I want to isolate some of the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.540 
really I want to isolate some of the
elements<00:00:56.980> I<00:00:57.039> want<00:00:57.219> to<00:00:57.280> shallow

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
elements I want to shallow

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.959 
elements I want to shallow
depth-of-field<00:00:58.030> in<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.840> so<00:00:59.770> as<00:01:00.100> you<00:01:00.820> may

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
depth-of-field in it and so as you may

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.939 
depth-of-field in it and so as you may
know<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:02.230> you're<00:01:02.440> shooting<00:01:02.620> with<00:01:02.800> like<00:01:02.890> a

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
know if you're shooting with like a

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.859 
know if you're shooting with like a
normal<00:01:03.309> lens<00:01:03.489> or<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.730> wider<00:01:04.000> lens<00:01:04.330> there's<00:01:04.629> only

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
normal lens or a wider lens there's only

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.900 
normal lens or a wider lens there's only
so<00:01:05.440> much<00:01:05.649> depth<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.100> field<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.430> can<00:01:06.550> get<00:01:06.729> no

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
so much depth of field you can get no

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.180 
so much depth of field you can get no
matter<00:01:07.090> what<00:01:07.420> your<00:01:07.600> aperture<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.190> because

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
matter what your aperture is because

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.139 
matter what your aperture is because
it's<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.990> shallower<00:01:10.990> focal<00:01:11.440> length<00:01:11.649> so<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:12.490> said

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
it's a shallower focal length so I said

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.669 
it's a shallower focal length so I said
to<00:01:13.210> myself<00:01:13.300> I<00:01:13.600> really<00:01:13.630> want<00:01:14.259> that<00:01:14.320> shallow

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
to myself I really want that shallow

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.179 
to myself I really want that shallow
depth<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.039> field<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.460> like<00:01:15.640> a<00:01:15.850> 200<00:01:16.750> at<00:01:16.869> 2.8<00:01:17.530> but

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
depth of field of like a 200 at 2.8 but

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.940 
depth of field of like a 200 at 2.8 but
I<00:01:18.400> want<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:19.180> wider<00:01:19.450> frame<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.930> U<00:01:20.110> so<00:01:20.470> kind<00:01:20.890> of

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
I want that wider frame of U so kind of

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.499 
I want that wider frame of U so kind of
a<00:01:21.040> light<00:01:21.250> bulb<00:01:21.430> went<00:01:21.700> off<00:01:21.759> in<00:01:21.850> my<00:01:22.060> head<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.299> I

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
a light bulb went off in my head and I

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.480 
a light bulb went off in my head and I
said<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:23.350> know<00:01:23.409> if<00:01:23.500> I<00:01:23.650> stitch<00:01:24.009> these<00:01:24.250> together

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
said you know if I stitch these together

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.319 
said you know if I stitch these together
I<00:01:25.030> should<00:01:25.570> be<00:01:25.689> able<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:26.200> get<00:01:26.590> both<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.250> so<00:01:27.729> you

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
I should be able to get both and so you

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.700 
I should be able to get both and so you
know<00:01:28.420> I<00:01:28.450> shot<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.960> I<00:01:29.049> put<00:01:29.290> them<00:01:29.409> all<00:01:29.530> together

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
know I shot it I put them all together

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.050 
know I shot it I put them all together
and<00:01:30.189> I<00:01:30.939> took<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.750> home<00:01:31.869> that<00:01:32.049> night<00:01:32.259> and<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:33.220> it

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
and I took it home that night and and it

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.640 
and I took it home that night and and it
worked<00:01:34.540> out<00:01:34.659> even<00:01:34.780> better<00:01:35.140> than<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.500> could

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
worked out even better than I could

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.090 
worked out even better than I could
imagine

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
imagine

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.819 
imagine
so<00:01:36.670> essentially<00:01:37.540> what<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:38.350> using

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
so essentially what it is is it's using

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.700 
so essentially what it is is it's using
a<00:01:38.950> panorama<00:01:39.549> not<00:01:40.390> for<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.840> traditional

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
a panorama not for the traditional

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.380 
a panorama not for the traditional
things<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.220> we've<00:01:42.399> used<00:01:42.640> panorama<00:01:43.119> store

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
things that we've used panorama store

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.120 
things that we've used panorama store
which<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.720> either<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.960> really<00:01:44.259> wide<00:01:44.590> frame<00:01:44.920> of

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
which is either a really wide frame of

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.090 
which is either a really wide frame of
you<00:01:45.369> or<00:01:45.909> really<00:01:46.240> high<00:01:46.509> resolution<00:01:47.290> you<00:01:47.530> can<00:01:47.979> do

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
you or really high resolution you can do

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.310 
you or really high resolution you can do
both<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.310> those<00:01:48.520> too<00:01:48.850> but<00:01:49.149> what<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.720> is<00:01:49.990> to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
both of those too but what it is is to

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.649 
both of those too but what it is is to
get<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.920> really<00:01:51.430> intensely<00:01:52.030> shallow<00:01:52.329> depth

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
get that really intensely shallow depth

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.050 
get that really intensely shallow depth
of<00:01:52.780> field<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.920> than<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.250> could<00:01:54.399> physically

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
of field more than you could physically

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.440 
of field more than you could physically
possibly<00:01:55.810> get<00:01:56.110> with<00:01:56.290> normal<00:01:56.649> lenses<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.909> what

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
possibly get with normal lenses so what

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.120 
possibly get with normal lenses so what
equipment<00:01:58.810> do<00:01:59.079> you<00:01:59.140> really<00:01:59.409> recommend<00:01:59.860> for

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
equipment do you really recommend for

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.660 
equipment do you really recommend for
someone<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.549> do<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:00.850> with<00:02:01.360> well<00:02:02.079> the<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:03.490> get

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
someone to do this with well the you get

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.399 
someone to do this with well the you get
going<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.090> get<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.270> most<00:02:04.479> advantage<00:02:04.930> of<00:02:05.259> it

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
going to get the most advantage of it

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.170 
going to get the most advantage of it
from<00:02:05.860> lenses<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.579> are<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.850> little<00:02:07.000> bit

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
from lenses that are a little bit

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.960 
from lenses that are a little bit
telephoto<00:02:07.719> and<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.649> as<00:02:08.829> fast<00:02:09.220> as<00:02:09.459> possible

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
telephoto and and as fast as possible

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.060 
telephoto and and as fast as possible
have<00:02:10.149> sort<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.570> widest<00:02:11.079> maximum<00:02:11.650> aperture

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
have sort of a widest maximum aperture

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.680 
have sort of a widest maximum aperture
as<00:02:12.220> possible<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.090> you're<00:02:13.329> going<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.510> want<00:02:13.630> to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
as possible and you're going to want to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.870 
as possible and you're going to want to
actually<00:02:13.780> shoot<00:02:14.530> at<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.860> wide<00:02:15.040> aperture<00:02:15.489> the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
actually shoot at that wide aperture the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.630 
actually shoot at that wide aperture the
point<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.750> basically<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:18.190> lens<00:02:18.489> is

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
point of this is basically that lens is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.500 
point of this is basically that lens is
like<00:02:18.940> an<00:02:19.239> 85<00:02:19.720> 1<00:02:20.110> 4<00:02:20.410> or<00:02:20.739> canons<00:02:21.160> 85<00:02:21.549> 1/2<00:02:22.120> or

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
like an 85 1 4 or canons 85 1/2 or

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.340 
like an 85 1 4 or canons 85 1/2 or
something<00:02:23.440> like<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.590> 135<00:02:24.310> one<00:02:24.609> two<00:02:24.850> or<00:02:25.389> even<00:02:25.449> a

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
something like a 135 one two or even a

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.060 
something like a 135 one two or even a
200<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.250> 8:00<00:02:27.490> at<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:28.390> long<00:02:28.720> end<00:02:29.070> anything

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
200 to 8:00 at that long end anything

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.070 
200 to 8:00 at that long end anything
that<00:02:30.250> creates<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.030> really<00:02:31.540> really<00:02:31.810> shallow

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
that creates that really really shallow

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.150 
that creates that really really shallow
depth-of-field

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
depth-of-field

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.250 
depth-of-field
but<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:34.090> know<00:02:34.150> doesn't<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:34.930> maybe<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
but you know doesn't have maybe the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.230 
but you know doesn't have maybe the
frame<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.220> want<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.670> something

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
frame of you that you want is something

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.060 
frame of you that you want is something
that's<00:02:37.510> going<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.690> be<00:02:37.840> handy<00:02:38.260> when<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.860> when

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
that's going to be handy when you when

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
that's going to be handy when you when
you<00:02:39.160> stitch<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.520> together<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:39.910> going<00:02:40.000> to

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
you stitch it together it's going to

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.760 
you stitch it together it's going to
create<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.390> really<00:02:40.690> really<00:02:41.050> dramatic<00:02:41.440> effect

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
create a really really dramatic effect

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.530 
create a really really dramatic effect
alright<00:02:42.460> Ryan<00:02:42.640> why<00:02:42.850> don't<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.090> show<00:02:43.270> us<00:02:43.300> how

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
we do this on the computer then

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.990 
we do this on the computer then
absolutely<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.360> we<00:02:47.110> went<00:02:47.290> out<00:02:47.440> we<00:02:47.590> took<00:02:47.740> a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
absolutely so we went out we took a

absolutely so we went out we took a
International<00:02:49.000> supermodel<00:02:49.240> Chris<00:02:49.630> camp<00:02:49.900> it

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
International supermodel Chris camp it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.040

out in the New York piers and we shot

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.050 
out in the New York piers and we shot
some<00:02:53.260> example<00:02:53.650> photos<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.250> guys<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.670> kind

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
like to start with the things that are

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.340 
like to start with the things that are
most<00:03:06.880> important<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.780> things<00:03:08.020> that<00:03:08.260> are

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
most important and the things that are

most important and the things that are
going<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.650> move<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.490> if<00:03:09.760> you're<00:03:09.880> shooting

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
going to move and if you're shooting

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.740 
going to move and if you're shooting
people<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:11.290> means<00:03:11.560> shooting<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.390> area

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
people that means shooting the the area

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.680 
people that means shooting the the area
that<00:03:13.900> includes<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.620> face<00:03:14.860> first<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.270> here's<00:03:16.600> a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
that includes the face first so here's a

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.130 
that includes the face first so here's a
nice<00:03:16.870> little<00:03:17.110> example<00:03:17.230> frame<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.100> we<00:03:18.220> did<00:03:18.430> I

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
nice little example frame that we did I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.350 
nice little example frame that we did I
started<00:03:20.140> as<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.620> can<00:03:20.740> see<00:03:20.980> first<00:03:21.760> him<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.210> want

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
started as you can see first him I want

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.490 
started as you can see first him I want
to<00:03:22.390> make<00:03:22.540> sure<00:03:22.720> I've<00:03:22.870> got<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.050> good<00:03:23.230> expression

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
to make sure I've got a good expression

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.860 
to make sure I've got a good expression
if<00:03:23.920> his<00:03:24.370> expression<00:03:24.880> is<00:03:25.000> terrible<00:03:25.480> then<00:03:25.660> we're

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
if his expression is terrible then we're

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.780 
if his expression is terrible then we're
going<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.050> do<00:03:26.140> all<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.380> work<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:26.920> be

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
going to do all this work and be

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.490 
going to do all this work and be
producing<00:03:28.240> a<00:03:28.330> bad<00:03:28.510> photo<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:28.960> mean<00:03:29.200> who<00:03:29.350> wants

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
producing a bad photo I mean who wants

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.810 
producing a bad photo I mean who wants
to<00:03:29.680> do<00:03:29.830> that<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.820> shot<00:03:31.240> right<00:03:31.750> around<00:03:32.200> him

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
to do that so I shot right around him

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.700 
to do that so I shot right around him
first<00:03:33.820> so<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.300> know<00:03:34.450> that<00:03:34.630> in<00:03:34.960> just<00:03:35.170> four<00:03:35.380> frames

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
first so I know that in just four frames

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.150 
first so I know that in just four frames
very<00:03:36.580> simple<00:03:37.000> he<00:03:37.120> hasn't<00:03:37.570> moved<00:03:37.920> we've<00:03:38.920> got

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
very simple he hasn't moved we've got

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.050 
very simple he hasn't moved we've got
him<00:03:39.970> looking<00:03:40.630> good<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.640> I'd<00:03:42.640> rather<00:03:42.910> have

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
him looking good and I'd rather have

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.760 
him looking good and I'd rather have
stitching<00:03:43.510> here<00:03:43.630> somewhere<00:03:44.110> off<00:03:44.260> way<00:03:44.500> off<00:03:44.530> to

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
stitching here somewhere off way off to

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.130 
stitching here somewhere off way off to
the<00:03:44.800> left<00:03:45.070> in<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.280> background<00:03:45.760> then<00:03:46.390> on<00:03:46.570> you

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
the left in the background then on you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.140 
the left in the background then on you
know<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.320> subject<00:03:47.710> of<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.920> actual<00:03:48.280> photo<00:03:48.520> we

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
know the subject of the actual photo we

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.810 
know the subject of the actual photo we
took<00:03:49.180> 25<00:03:50.050> photos<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:51.130> I'll<00:03:51.460> walk<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.790> through

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
took 25 photos and I'll walk you through

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.000 
took 25 photos and I'll walk you through
them<00:03:52.060> very<00:03:52.150> quickly<00:03:52.390> I'm<00:03:52.990> starting<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:53.830> fill

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
them very quickly I'm starting to fill

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.820 
them very quickly I'm starting to fill
in<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.250> background<00:03:54.760> I've<00:03:55.230> gotten<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.530> know

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
in the background I've gotten I know

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.590 
in the background I've gotten I know
what<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.220> want<00:03:57.490> in<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.640> frame<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.090> said<00:03:58.300> that<00:03:58.480> you

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
what I want in the frame I said that you

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.500 
what I want in the frame I said that you
know<00:03:58.660> this<00:03:59.520> this<00:04:00.520> pole<00:04:00.910> is<00:04:01.150> going<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.360> look

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
know this this pole is going to look

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.780 
know this this pole is going to look
interesting<00:04:02.110> out<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.620> focus<00:04:02.830> yeah<00:04:03.400> it's<00:04:03.580> kind

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
interesting out of focus yeah it's kind

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.700 
interesting out of focus yeah it's kind
of<00:04:03.820> kind<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.180> an<00:04:04.270> interesting<00:04:04.420> background<00:04:04.750> so

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
of kind of an interesting background so

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.790 
of kind of an interesting background so
so<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.400> wanted<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:06.730> fill<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.800> we've

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
so I wanted to fill that in and we've

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.310 
so I wanted to fill that in and we've
got<00:04:08.950> 25<00:04:09.430> frames<00:04:09.760> for<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.090> full<00:04:10.300> set<00:04:10.570> then<00:04:11.170> you

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
got 25 frames for the full set then you

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.990 
got 25 frames for the full set then you
go<00:04:11.710> into<00:04:11.860> Photoshop<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.370> whenever<00:04:12.820> you're

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
go into Photoshop and whenever you're

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.680 
go into Photoshop and whenever you're
stitching<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:15.790> want<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.120> go<00:04:16.210> down<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.570> the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
stitching you you want to go down to the

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.610 
stitching you you want to go down to the
the<00:04:17.049> file<00:04:18.570> automate<00:04:20.190> photo<00:04:21.190> merge<00:04:21.520> and<00:04:22.620> you

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
the file automate photo merge and you

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.090 
the file automate photo merge and you
can<00:04:23.770> use<00:04:23.950> auto<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:24.370> can<00:04:24.640> use<00:04:26.100> sometimes

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
can use auto you can use sometimes

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.910 
can use auto you can use sometimes
perspective<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:27.970> will<00:04:28.690> tend<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.200> start<00:04:29.590> with

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
perspective I will tend to start with

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.360 
perspective I will tend to start with
the<00:04:30.850> reposition<00:04:31.570> option<00:04:31.960> because<00:04:32.890> sometimes

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
the reposition option because sometimes

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.830 
the reposition option because sometimes
especially<00:04:33.520> if<00:04:34.000> you're<00:04:34.090> shooting<00:04:34.240> very<00:04:34.570> wide

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
especially if you're shooting very wide

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.770 
especially if you're shooting very wide
like<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.740> IO<00:04:35.919> can<00:04:36.310> get<00:04:36.520> wacky<00:04:36.910> like<00:04:37.479> if<00:04:37.660> you're

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
like the IO can get wacky like if you're

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.450 
like the IO can get wacky like if you're
shooting<00:04:37.990> with<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.380> 50<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:38.979> turning

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
shooting with a 50 and turning

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.629 
shooting with a 50 and turning
to<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:39.669> 24<00:04:40.389> millimeter<00:04:40.569> or<00:04:41.169> a<00:04:41.199> really<00:04:41.440> wide<00:04:42.250> wide

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
to a 24 millimeter or a really wide wide

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.150 
to a 24 millimeter or a really wide wide
frame<00:04:43.000> you'll<00:04:43.780> see<00:04:43.960> some<00:04:44.139> really<00:04:44.169> wacky

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
frame you'll see some really wacky

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.340 
frame you'll see some really wacky
stretching<00:04:45.639> on<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.819> edges<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:46.419> I<00:04:46.660> want<00:04:47.289> to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
stretching on the edges so I want to

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.010 
stretching on the edges so I want to
start<00:04:47.590> with<00:04:47.740> with<00:04:48.060> repositioning<00:04:49.060> simple<00:04:49.750> and

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
start with with repositioning simple and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.820 
start with with repositioning simple and
just<00:04:50.919> see<00:04:51.460> how<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.849> looks<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.500> I've<00:04:53.500> got<00:04:53.680> it

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
just see how it looks and I've got it

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.110 
just see how it looks and I've got it
the<00:04:54.220> images<00:04:54.520> are<00:04:54.610> going<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.759> be<00:04:54.819> blend

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
the images are going to be blend

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.460 
the images are going to be blend
together<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:56.699> I've<00:04:57.699> said<00:04:58.449> it<00:04:58.569> to<00:04:58.690> reposition

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
together and I've said it to reposition

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.050 
together and I've said it to reposition
so<00:04:59.919> that<00:05:00.069> there's<00:05:00.220> not<00:05:00.370> going<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.669> be<00:05:00.729> any<00:05:00.880> sort

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
so that there's not going to be any sort

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.240 
so that there's not going to be any sort
of<00:05:01.150> whacking<00:05:01.389> stretching<00:05:02.380> of<00:05:02.500> any<00:05:02.650> individual

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
of whacking stretching of any individual

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.300 
of whacking stretching of any individual
images<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:04.710> Photoshop<00:05:05.710> does<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.009> rest<00:05:06.190> of

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
images and Photoshop does the rest of

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.700 
images and Photoshop does the rest of
the<00:05:06.400> work<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.810> here<00:05:07.990> we<00:05:08.050> go<00:05:08.139> you<00:05:08.349> can<00:05:08.380> look<00:05:08.620> at

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
the work so here we go you can look at

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.510 
the work so here we go you can look at
this<00:05:08.889> and<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:09.340> can<00:05:09.370> see<00:05:10.199> first<00:05:11.199> of<00:05:11.319> all<00:05:11.520> for

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
this and you can see first of all for

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.520 
this and you can see first of all for
kind<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.150> wide<00:05:13.360> frame<00:05:13.690> of<00:05:13.900> you<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.139> mean<00:05:14.349> this

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
kind of a wide frame of you I mean this

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.350 
kind of a wide frame of you I mean this
is<00:05:14.650> something<00:05:14.860> that<00:05:15.160> really<00:05:15.430> looks<00:05:15.849> to<00:05:15.970> me

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
is something that really looks to me

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.719 
is something that really looks to me
like<00:05:16.660> it<00:05:17.289> was<00:05:17.380> shot<00:05:17.680> with<00:05:17.949> maybe<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.340> 50

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
like it was shot with maybe a 50

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.350 
like it was shot with maybe a 50
millimeter<00:05:18.960> maybe<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:20.050> 35<00:05:20.560> millimeter

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
millimeter maybe a 35 millimeter

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.960 
millimeter maybe a 35 millimeter
somewhere<00:05:22.360> in<00:05:22.479> that<00:05:22.539> range<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:24.250> don't<00:05:24.820> care

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
somewhere in that range and I don't care

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.640 
somewhere in that range and I don't care
what<00:05:25.150> you<00:05:25.270> were<00:05:25.360> using<00:05:25.599> there<00:05:26.110> there<00:05:26.349> is<00:05:26.470> not<00:05:26.620> a

what you were using there there is not a

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.189 
what you were using there there is not a
50<00:05:27.099> millimeter<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.550> lot<00:05:27.789> that<00:05:28.419> would<00:05:28.900> shoot

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
50 millimeter a lot that would shoot

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.810 
50 millimeter a lot that would shoot
that<00:05:29.440> with<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:29.949> kind<00:05:30.220> of<00:05:30.280> depth<00:05:30.490> of<00:05:30.610> field

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
that with that kind of depth of field

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.850 
that with that kind of depth of field
and<00:05:31.360> what<00:05:31.780> are<00:05:31.870> some<00:05:31.900> tips<00:05:32.259> that<00:05:32.380> you<00:05:32.470> can<00:05:32.800> give
