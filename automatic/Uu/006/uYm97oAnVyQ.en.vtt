directed to mr. Mediacom slash contact
and<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:33.329> took<00:00:33.510> me<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> while<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> figure<00:00:34.230> out<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and it took me a while to figure out a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.959 
and it took me a while to figure out a
good<00:00:34.500> workflow<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.219> really<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.850> make

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
good workflow that I really like to make

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.819 
good workflow that I really like to make
using<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> color<00:00:36.600> checker<00:00:36.809> chart<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.350> fit

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
using the color checker chart really fit

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.250 
using the color checker chart really fit
into<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.790> way<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.120> grade<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.960> figured

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
into the way that I grade but I figured

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.720 
into the way that I grade but I figured
it<00:00:40.379> out<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.829> I've<00:00:41.010> been<00:00:41.219> using<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.610> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it out and I've been using it for a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.389 
it out and I've been using it for a
while<00:00:41.850> now<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.500> we're

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
while now I really like it so we're

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.799 
while now I really like it so we're

the color checker chart to our interview

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.040 
the color checker chart to our interview
I<00:00:54.559> used<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.730> just<00:00:56.730> copy<00:00:56.910> grades<00:00:57.539> over<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:57.960> that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
I used to just copy grades over but that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.900 
I used to just copy grades over but that
was<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.350> bad<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.100> doing<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.699> would

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
was a really bad way of doing it I would

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
was a really bad way of doing it I would
not<00:01:00.030> recommend<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.320> instead<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
not recommend it we can do instead is

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.260 
not recommend it we can do instead is
use<00:01:02.039> groups<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> select<00:01:03.120> both

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
use groups I'm going to select both

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.149 
use groups I'm going to select both
clips<00:01:03.690> by<00:01:03.870> clicking<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:04.409> holding<00:01:04.799> down<00:01:04.890> shift

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
clips by clicking one holding down shift

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.399 
clips by clicking one holding down shift
and<00:01:05.369> clicking<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> other<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:07.049> an<00:01:07.140> actual

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and clicking the other one in an actual

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.600 
and clicking the other one in an actual
project<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.010> probably<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.400> more

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
project this will probably have more

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.670 
project this will probably have more
than<00:01:08.760> two<00:01:08.939> clips<00:01:09.240> obviously<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.590> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
than two clips obviously but for this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.960 
than two clips obviously but for this
one<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.189> two<00:01:11.490> because<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
one it's just two because it's a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.340 
one it's just two because it's a
tutorial<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.450> nice<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.840> simple<00:01:13.110> then

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
tutorial it's nice and simple then

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.050 
tutorial it's nice and simple then
you're<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:13.830> click<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.310> go<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you're going to right click and go to

that<00:01:28.259> these<00:01:28.350> are<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.710> group<00:01:28.920> together<00:01:29.100> we've

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that these are in a group together we've

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.300 
that these are in a group together we've
got<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.939> nice<00:01:30.150> little<00:01:30.329> link<00:01:30.630> icon<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.310> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
got this nice little link icon here so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.219 
got this nice little link icon here so
now<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> next<00:01:33.119> step<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
now what the next step is is to go and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
now what the next step is is to go and
change<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:35.220> nodes<00:01:35.520> we're<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> be

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
change which nodes we're going to be

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.310 
change which nodes we're going to be
working<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.720> we've<00:01:36.840> got<00:01:36.990> our<00:01:37.140> normal

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
working with so we've got our normal

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.960 
working with so we've got our normal
clip<00:01:37.740> nodes<00:01:38.040> page<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.520> we've<00:01:38.640> been<00:01:38.759> using

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
clip nodes page that we've been using

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
clip nodes page that we've been using
for<00:01:39.299> grading<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.259> we're<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.650> into

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
for grading but we're going to go into

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.700 
for grading but we're going to go into
group<00:01:41.400> pre<00:01:41.790> clip<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.200> will<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.500> is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
group pre clip and what this will do is

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.670 
group pre clip and what this will do is
be<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> grade<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> entire<00:01:45.509> group<00:01:45.869> before

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
be a grade for the entire group before

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
be a grade for the entire group before
our<00:01:47.130> clip<00:01:47.399> grade<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.270> workflow<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
our clip grade so the workflow this is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
our clip grade so the workflow this is
going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:50.430> sort<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
going to be is going to have a sort of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.389 
going to be is going to have a sort of
color<00:01:51.180> correction<00:01:51.500> quote-unquote<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.710> this

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
color correction quote-unquote in this

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.999 
color correction quote-unquote in this
pre<00:01:54.270> clip<00:01:54.509> group<00:01:54.930> grade<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:55.920> get

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
pre clip group grade and little get

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.410 
pre clip group grade and little get
everything<00:01:56.219> sort<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.610> started<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.000> work

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
everything sort of started to work

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
everything sort of started to work
together<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.259> way<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.680> want<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
sort of a basic pre grade that we've

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.399 
sort of a basic pre grade that we've
been<00:02:03.119> doing<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> lot<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.659> other<00:02:03.840> tutorials

pre clip selected in this first node
here<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.000> could<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.300> go<00:02:13.230> oh

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
here we could just go oh

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.980

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
our viewer and go-to color chart now we

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.320 
our viewer and go-to color chart now we
get<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.580> know<00:02:20.670> thing<00:02:20.910> was<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.300> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.940 
get a you know thing was just like a
color<00:02:21.540> chart<00:02:21.780> popped<00:02:22.110> up<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.410> window<00:02:22.740> you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
color chart popped up in the window you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.460 
color chart popped up in the window you
can<00:02:23.550> drag<00:02:23.880> these<00:02:24.090> corners<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.320> you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
can drag these corners just like you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.220 
can drag these corners just like you
would<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:26.010> power<00:02:26.430> window<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.060> resize<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.200> to

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
would a power window and resize it to

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.990 
would a power window and resize it to
the<00:02:28.320> size<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.710> your<00:02:28.770> color<00:02:29.040> chart<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.820> see

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the size of your color chart and you see

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.760 
the size of your color chart and you see
it<00:02:30.150> only<00:02:30.330> really<00:02:30.690> matters<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.260> these<00:02:31.470> inner

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
it only really matters that these inner

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.710 
it only really matters that these inner
boxes<00:02:32.250> are<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.790> color<00:02:33.000> place<00:02:33.270> it's<00:02:33.510> going

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
boxes are in the color place it's going

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.150 
boxes are in the color place it's going
to<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:33.840> not<00:02:33.960> super<00:02:34.290> precise<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.040> is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
to be not super precise so this is

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.010 
to be not super precise so this is
looking<00:02:35.280> pretty<00:02:35.520> good<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:36.270> next<00:02:36.420> step<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.900> to

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
looking pretty good the next step is to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.050 
looking pretty good the next step is to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.810 
your settings and see what game you're
shooting<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.070> or<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.430> want<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.670> play

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
shooting on or if you want to play

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.310 
shooting on or if you want to play
around<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.390> know<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:00.930> have<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> lot<00:03:01.170> of

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
around you know you can have a lot of

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.220 
around you know you can have a lot of
fun<00:03:01.410> experimenting<00:03:01.830> using<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> wrong<00:03:03.230> gammas

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
fun experimenting using the wrong gammas

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.990 
fun experimenting using the wrong gammas
and<00:03:04.380> color<00:03:04.530> spaces<00:03:05.070> I've<00:03:05.400> had<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> lot<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.790> fun

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
and color spaces I've had a lot of fun

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.980 
and color spaces I've had a lot of fun
doing<00:03:06.240> that<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.390> got<00:03:06.570> some<00:03:06.720> really

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
doing that and got some really

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.410 
doing that and got some really
interesting<00:03:07.490> looks<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.850> say<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.150> very<00:03:09.360> least

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
interesting looks to say the very least

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.080 
interesting looks to say the very least
but<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.470> know<00:03:10.620> that's<00:03:11.310> part<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.000> learning

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
but you know that's part of the learning

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.330 
but you know that's part of the learning

process the next we're going to do is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.120 
process the next we're going to do is
select<00:03:14.430> our<00:03:14.670> target<00:03:15.060> gamma<00:03:15.300> so<00:03:15.990> we're<00:03:16.920> coming

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
select our target gamma so we're coming

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
from this gamma BMD film and we're

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.020 
from this gamma BMD film and we're
wanting<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.020> go<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.560> target<00:03:19.830> gamma<00:03:20.190> so

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
wanting to go to this target gamma so

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.910 
wanting to go to this target gamma so
I've<00:03:21.180> been<00:03:21.330> having<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.630> lot<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.900> fun<00:03:22.110> with<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.800> s

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
I've been having a lot of fun with the s

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.510 
I've been having a lot of fun with the s

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
log2 gamma for grading rec.709 will get

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.180 
log2 gamma for grading rec.709 will get
you<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:27.080> -<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.110> closer<00:03:28.350> grade<00:03:28.680> faster<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.160> I

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
you a - a closer grade faster but I

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.590 
you a - a closer grade faster but I
really<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:29.460> coming<00:03:29.640> from<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.940> s<00:03:30.180> log<00:03:30.390> -

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
really like coming from the s log -

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.070 
really like coming from the s log -

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
gamma

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.180

it's<00:03:31.200> just<00:03:31.350> sort<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.620> personal<00:03:32.010> preference

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
it's just sort of a personal preference

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.400 
it's just sort of a personal preference
of<00:03:32.490> mine<00:03:32.520> you<00:03:33.360> can<00:03:33.480> use<00:03:33.600> whatever<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.990> want

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
of mine you can use whatever you want

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.320 
of mine you can use whatever you want
like<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:34.890> said<00:03:34.950> experiment<00:03:35.670> figure<00:03:36.030> out<00:03:36.150> what's

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
like I said experiment figure out what's

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.240 
like I said experiment figure out what's
good<00:03:36.510> for<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.680> next<00:03:37.800> thing<00:03:38.040> you're<00:03:38.100> going

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
good for you the next thing you're going

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.180 
good for you the next thing you're going
to<00:03:38.310> do<00:03:38.490> is<00:03:38.670> pick<00:03:38.880> your<00:03:39.000> target<00:03:39.390> color<00:03:39.600> space

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
to do is pick your target color space

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.230 
to do is pick your target color space
it's<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.280> lot<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.520> fun<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.700> play<00:03:41.850> are<00:03:42.000> not<00:03:42.030> these

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
it's a lot of fun to play are not these

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.820 
it's a lot of fun to play are not these
and<00:03:42.450> get<00:03:42.540> some<00:03:42.660> interesting<00:03:43.050> looks<00:03:43.230> basically

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
and get some interesting looks basically

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.650 
and get some interesting looks basically
if<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.670> haven't<00:03:44.910> read<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.150> bunch<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.450> stuff

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
if you haven't read a bunch of stuff

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.940 
if you haven't read a bunch of stuff
about<00:03:45.780> what<00:03:46.050> these<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.590> when<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.709> should

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
about what these do and when you should

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.160 
about what these do and when you should
use<00:03:46.980> them<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:47.820> with<00:03:47.940> rec.709<00:03:48.720> it'll<00:03:49.050> make

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
use them just go with rec.709 it'll make

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.070 
use them just go with rec.709 it'll make
your<00:03:49.290> life<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.560> lot<00:03:49.650> easier<00:03:50.070> but<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:51.270> know<00:03:51.390> it's

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
your life a lot easier but you know it's

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.420 
your life a lot easier but you know it's
fun<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.350> play<00:03:52.500> with<00:03:52.590> these<00:03:52.740> sometimes<00:03:53.190> and

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
fun to play with these sometimes and

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.550 
fun to play with these sometimes and
then<00:03:53.940> finally<00:03:54.420> you've<00:03:54.810> got<00:03:54.840> your<00:03:55.200> target

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
then finally you've got your target

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.290 
then finally you've got your target
color<00:03:55.680> temp<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.610> know<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.880> my<00:03:57.120> white

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
color temp and I know that my white

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.550 
color temp and I know that my white
balance<00:03:57.420> is<00:03:57.630> just<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.870> little<00:03:58.080> bit<00:03:58.200> off<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:58.470> when

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
balance is just a little bit off so when

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.530 
balance is just a little bit off so when
we<00:03:58.620> change<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.910> 68-hundred<00:03:59.910> i<00:04:00.060> wouldn't

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
we change the 68-hundred i wouldn't

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.600 
we change the 68-hundred i wouldn't
recommend<00:04:00.600> doing<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.170> for<00:04:01.440> re<00:04:01.980> sort<00:04:02.550> of

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
recommend doing this for re sort of

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.830 
recommend doing this for re sort of
white<00:04:02.730> balancing<00:04:03.120> footage<00:04:03.390> there's<00:04:03.660> other

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
white balancing footage there's other

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.480 
white balancing footage there's other
techniques<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.350> should<00:04:04.590> use<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.770> are<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.160> lot

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
techniques you should use that are a lot

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.640 
techniques you should use that are a lot
better<00:04:05.959> but<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.080> know<00:04:07.140> for<00:04:07.290> little<00:04:07.500> things

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
better but you know for little things

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.260 
better but you know for little things
like<00:04:07.770> this<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.250> work<00:04:08.400> out<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.910> then

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
like this it can work out and then

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.630 
like this it can work out and then
finally<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.870> just<00:04:09.959> hit<00:04:10.200> match<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.950> boom

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
finally you just hit match and boom

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.130 
finally you just hit match and boom
there<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.090> go<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.600> now<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.720> see<00:04:12.900> our<00:04:12.990> other

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
there we go and now you see our other

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.160 
there we go and now you see our other
clip<00:04:13.440> has<00:04:13.770> got<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:14.160> happen<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.610> it<00:04:14.730> also

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
clip has got that happen to it also

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.789 
clip has got that happen to it also
great<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:18.030> now<00:04:18.120> I've<00:04:18.180> got<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.480> now

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
great so now I've got this now

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.039 
great so now I've got this now
sort<00:04:19.009> of<00:04:19.099> creamy<00:04:20.060> s<00:04:20.180> log<00:04:20.419> stuff<00:04:20.720> with<00:04:20.900> this

little bit oversaturated rec709

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.050 
little bit oversaturated rec709
colorspace<00:04:24.259> is<00:04:24.590> looking<00:04:24.830> pretty<00:04:24.949> neat<00:04:25.220> the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
colorspace is looking pretty neat the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.580
