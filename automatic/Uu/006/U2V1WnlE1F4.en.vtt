00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.030 
should but this works wonders um I kind
of<00:01:35.070> tried<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.140> my<00:01:37.140> not<00:01:37.560> my<00:01:37.740> tattoo

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
of tried this out on my not my tattoo

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
of tried this out on my not my tattoo
per<00:01:38.190> se<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.670> my<00:01:38.790> girlfriend's<00:01:39.270> tattoo<00:01:39.690> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
per se but on my girlfriend's tattoo and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.560 
per se but on my girlfriend's tattoo and
it<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:41.010> does<00:01:41.310> moisturize<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:41.940> to<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> point

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
it really does moisturize it to a point

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.969 
it really does moisturize it to a point
where<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.840> doesn't<00:01:43.020> restore<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> color

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
where it doesn't restore the color

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.350 
where it doesn't restore the color
because<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.060> impossible

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
because that would be kind of impossible

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.690 
because that would be kind of impossible
I<00:01:45.840> mean<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> ink<00:01:46.799> comes<00:01:47.040> off<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.520> not

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I mean if the ink comes off it's not

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.920 
I mean if the ink comes off it's not
going<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> restore<00:01:48.270> its<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> paint

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
going to restore its not going to paint

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.550 
going to restore its not going to paint
it<00:01:49.049> back<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:50.479> moisturizes<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.720> area

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it back on but it moisturizes the area

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.520 
it back on but it moisturizes the area
so<00:01:52.920> well<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.729> brightens<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> color<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
so well that it brightens the color to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.140 
so well that it brightens the color to
make<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.830> look<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> colors<00:01:56.700> restored

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
make it look as if the colors restored

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.730 
make it look as if the colors restored
