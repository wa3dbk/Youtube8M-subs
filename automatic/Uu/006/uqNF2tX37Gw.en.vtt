00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.660
 how the car should be for you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.020
 fun to ride powerful stiff with 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.020
 a nice noise 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.139
 what in other words makes it sporty 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.849
 a car the type of bodywork for sure 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.680
 a minivan is not as agile as one 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.210
 coupÃ© is a spider, of course, but it is 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.220
 also true that a normal sedan 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.720
 let's call it so if in the essay well can 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.490
 make me smile a lot in the middle of the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.090
 curves and it's something that few brands 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.090
 they can do 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.110
 the risk however is that of exaggerating e 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.239
 that is, to make a car too extreme 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.710
 on the street and often not as smooth as 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.280
 a track here is the meaning of this 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.540
 peugeot 308 gti without the final iii no 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.420
 extreme indeed for more horses 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.269
 lowered suspension like more sporty 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.430
 but all with the right mix of determination 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.010
 and comfort that is what allows 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.230
 to enjoy different situations on 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.980
 roads of all kinds and therefore for more 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.050
 time 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.059
 205 horses may seem few at 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.280
 present day to this 1600 and not gods 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.320
 turbo petrol which I prefer destroyed 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.630
 horses just fine without ever putting on 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 front-wheel drive is in difficulty e 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.640
 wanting to travel on the highway too 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.600
 resting only the foot 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.390
 accelerator 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.550
 when instead you will try to exploit 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.539
 all the services for example for 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.420
 going from 0 to 100 takes just 7.5 seconds 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:30.060
 you will consume on average 8 9 liters per 100 km 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.060
 making about 11 12 km with a liter 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 all right, remember the peugeots of the end 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.150
 90s begins in 2000 106 206 306 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.430
 even the non-sports versions had it 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.780
 they did an agile and fun attitude 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.610
 want to go and find some 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.950
 of curves before returning home in the evening 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.830
 here is this a bit the same 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.470
 philosophy applied to a car 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.690
 modern and that is with more comfort accessories 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.789
 and therefore more weight and then as in 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.860
 passed on this gt is very intuitive 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.840
 immediately take a nice driving rhythm 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.209
 fast fluids because the machine is 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.940
 it took only a few interventions 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.860
 here and there shock absorbers stiffer than the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.350
 10 percent ahead and 20 percent 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.720
 behind suspensions lower than a 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.530
 centimeter and front brake discs from 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.600
 330 mm but there is also some modernity 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.890
 pressing the sport button 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.440
 the accelerator becomes more responsive e 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.230
 is electronically amplified the 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.840
 exhaust sound the sound is fuller 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.350
 even if a little artificial for my parents 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.670
 tastes and the equipment changes too 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.950
 power levels can be read 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.410
 torque and pressure of the turbo and pass 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.260
 from white to red in reality 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.350
 the steering setting also changes 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.570
 electric that gets heavier but up 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.209
 I prefer this small steering wheel 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.640
 the standard one because it is more linear 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.769
 in the trajectories and homogeneous in the load 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.450
 with fewer reactions on other 108 others 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.579
 he drove in the past he had not given me 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.340
 problems instead on the gt change 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.950
 6-speed manual seems to me a little more 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.290
 rough even if short is nice solid 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.000
 in fast changes 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.640
 maybe I notice it more because this 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.090
 version invites you to drive more cheerful 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.090
 than usual 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.880
 however small wheel on the 308 gti is 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.160
 in perforated leather and the grand initials 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.480
 touring dashboard doors with shift lever 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.330
 instead the coatings are in Alcantara 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.890
 or leather with red stitching while i 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.870
 door sill in stainless steel and the 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.430
 pedal in imperial aluminum of the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.500
 roof and black as used on sports cars 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.959
 with red and black details for the screen 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.400
 central touch screen and the seats are 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.410
 more enveloping they give good support 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.330
 side cornering are more comfortable than 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.370
 those of the others at 308 but a space 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.020
 practicality does not change get an idea 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.560
 looking at our proof of why 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.560
 buy it 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.769
 surely you have noticed in 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.750
 beautiful images true the blue color 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.640
 magnetic bodywork is a tribute 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.530
 a historical tint of French cars from 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.420
 run with a few touches here and there of black 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.160
 the mirrors and the bumper are shiny 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.700
 rear embracing the exhausts 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.170
 sports 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.270
 the thing for the rest was not 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.190
 distorted compared to the normal 308 so 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.470
 like the front and some changes in 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.330
 however, there are 62 LED headlights 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.190
 light points and direction indicators 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.720
 they are sequential there are present 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.640
 Additional and the grille to three 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.900
 slats and is all chrome to give a 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.120
 look sportier then alloy wheels 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.860
 are key are 18-inch 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.870
 they have a particular milling 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.700
 diamond and mountain surface 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.700
 michelin pilot sport tires 3 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.880
 in short, the 308 gti not a car 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.770
 exaggerated but with which you can also 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.510
 overdo it when you feel like wanting 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.430
 also with a 2000 turbodiesel engine from 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.560
 180 horses and station wagon bodywork 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.670
 at prices starting at just over 28 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.920
 thousand and 500 euros 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.530
 not enough for me then know that it is in 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.030
 Check the 308 with an extra letter cti 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:24.990
 we talk about 270 horses but how to say who 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.990
 is satisfied enjoy
