00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.460 
build up because you know stop a fight
so<00:06:38.669> I<00:06:38.729> think<00:06:38.820> are<00:06:39.120> around<00:06:39.390> we<00:06:39.630> can<00:06:39.810> assume<00:06:40.140> one

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
so I think are around we can assume one

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.000 
so I think are around we can assume one
thing<00:06:40.740> but<00:06:40.950> we<00:06:41.100> get<00:06:41.370> different<00:06:41.580> result
