00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.380 
eat energy crystals if you fail to kill
them<00:00:26.550> you're<00:00:27.210> gonna<00:00:27.330> lose<00:00:27.599> them<00:00:29.000> this<00:00:30.000> mission

all<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:38.390> basically<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.450> gotta<00:00:39.570> support

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
all we do basically we gotta support

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
station up and running because if we

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.770 
station up and running because if we
don't<00:02:19.500> yeah<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.870> while<00:02:23.290> my<00:02:23.500> guys<00:02:23.740> are<00:02:24.190> working

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
don't yeah and while my guys are working

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.500 
don't yeah and while my guys are working
I<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:25.990> close<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.740> ice<00:02:29.920> monsters<00:02:30.550> cannot

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
I can close the ice monsters cannot

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.050 
I can close the ice monsters cannot
appear<00:02:31.930> from<00:02:32.260> walls<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.730> are<00:02:33.790> reinforced<00:02:34.480> so

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
appear from walls that are reinforced so

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.660 
appear from walls that are reinforced so
earlier<00:02:37.060> they<00:02:37.840> were<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.980> waiting<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.520> come

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
earlier they were just waiting to come

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.130 
earlier they were just waiting to come
out<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:39.970> we<00:02:40.930> no<00:02:41.050> longer<00:02:41.080> can<00:02:43.140> because

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
out of that we no longer can because

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.500 
out of that we no longer can because
there<00:02:44.290> are<00:02:44.350> no<00:02:44.470> walls<00:02:44.770> they<00:02:45.130> can<00:02:45.340> appear<00:02:46.270> from

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
there are no walls they can appear from

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.580 
there are no walls they can appear from
because<00:02:46.810> they<00:02:46.930> can't<00:02:47.170> go<00:02:47.320> from<00:02:47.470> solid<00:02:47.920> rock

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
because they can't go from solid rock

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:03.510 
because they can't go from solid rock
then<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.710> should<00:02:50.980> see<00:02:52.440> another<00:03:02.250> crank<00:03:03.250> up<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
then I should see another crank up the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:19.260 
then I should see another crank up the
speed<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.850> over<00:03:03.910> here<00:03:08.910> yeah<00:03:11.250> get<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:18.270> it's

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
speed of over here yeah get that it's

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.870 
speed of over here yeah get that it's
only<00:03:19.420> two<00:03:19.780> or<00:03:20.050> other<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:21.190> doesn't<00:03:21.550> count<00:03:21.730> for

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
only two or other it doesn't count for

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.610 
only two or other it doesn't count for
some<00:03:22.120> reason<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.540> don't<00:03:22.840> understand<00:03:25.590> can<00:03:26.590> you

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
some reason I don't understand can you

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:39.450 
some reason I don't understand can you
guys<00:03:26.890> pick<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:28.030> stuff<00:03:28.210> up<00:03:37.710> you<00:03:38.710> guys<00:03:38.920> clear

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
guys pick that stuff up you guys clear

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
guys pick that stuff up you guys clear
all<00:03:39.610> of<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:42.900> now<00:03:45.060> one<00:03:46.060> thing<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.300> definitely

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
all of that now one thing I definitely

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.260 
all of that now one thing I definitely
notice<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.800> have<00:03:48.160> nowhere<00:03:48.460> near

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
notice is that I have nowhere near

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.760 
notice is that I have nowhere near
enough<00:03:49.480> energy<00:03:49.930> crystals<00:03:50.560> actually<00:03:50.950> do<00:03:51.100> this

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
enough energy crystals actually do this

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.210 
enough energy crystals actually do this
correct<00:03:53.770> I<00:03:54.070> don't<00:03:55.770> however<00:03:58.050> if<00:03:59.050> memory<00:03:59.950> serves

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
correct I don't however if memory serves

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.930 
correct I don't however if memory serves
