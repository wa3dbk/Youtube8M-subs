well<00:00:01.430> I<00:00:01.460> got<00:00:01.730> some<00:00:01.850> more<00:00:02.000> worked<00:00:02.209> on<00:00:02.389> today

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:02.769 
well I got some more worked on today

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:05.920 
well I got some more worked on today
what<00:00:03.769> I<00:00:03.800> did<00:00:04.070> is<00:00:04.220> I<00:00:04.370> made<00:00:04.399> a<00:00:04.580> jig<00:00:05.060> on<00:00:05.660> the

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
what I did is I made a jig on the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.759 
what I did is I made a jig on the
Bridgeport<00:00:06.399> in<00:00:07.399> order<00:00:07.669> to<00:00:08.530> allow<00:00:09.530> me<00:00:09.740> to

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
Bridgeport in order to allow me to

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.970 
Bridgeport in order to allow me to
plasma<00:00:10.490> cut<00:00:10.700> holes<00:00:11.230> for<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:12.320> side<00:00:12.530> lights<00:00:12.799> on

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
plasma cut holes for the side lights on

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.940 
plasma cut holes for the side lights on
that<00:00:13.099> on<00:00:13.250> the<00:00:13.370> dump<00:00:13.580> bed<00:00:14.530> that's<00:00:15.530> a<00:00:15.650> two<00:00:15.769> and<00:00:15.889> a

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
that on the dump bed that's a two and a

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.609 
that on the dump bed that's a two and a
quarter<00:00:16.129> inch<00:00:16.400> hole<00:00:16.520> and<00:00:16.990> then<00:00:17.990> this<00:00:18.109> is<00:00:18.320> a<00:00:18.350> two

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
quarter inch hole and then this is a two

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.550 
quarter inch hole and then this is a two
and<00:00:18.800> 3/8<00:00:19.189> hole<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.300> I<00:00:20.330> calculated<00:00:21.050> my<00:00:21.230> torch

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
and 3/8 hole so I calculated my torch

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.000 
and 3/8 hole so I calculated my torch
offset<00:00:22.130> from<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:22.430> plasma<00:00:22.640> cutter<00:00:24.010> about

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
offset from the plasma cutter about

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.320 
offset from the plasma cutter about
comes<00:00:25.279> out<00:00:25.430> to<00:00:25.609> about<00:00:25.699> two<00:00:26.000> and<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.150> quarter

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
comes out to about two and a quarter

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.359 
comes out to about two and a quarter
inch<00:00:26.599> hole<00:00:27.609> and<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.730> results<00:00:29.210> are<00:00:30.130> my<00:00:31.130> side

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
inch hole and the results are my side

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:31.960 
inch hole and the results are my side
lights

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
lights

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.530 
lights
I<00:00:32.000> just<00:00:32.570> plasma<00:00:32.960> cut<00:00:33.140> these<00:00:33.260> holes<00:00:33.320> I<00:00:34.540> don't

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
I just plasma cut these holes I don't

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.910 
I just plasma cut these holes I don't
want<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.720> pop<00:00:35.900> it<00:00:36.050> out<00:00:36.110> now<00:00:36.350> because<00:00:36.380> it's<00:00:36.770> in

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
want to pop it out now because it's in

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.520 
want to pop it out now because it's in
there<00:00:37.040> pretty<00:00:37.070> tight<00:00:37.750> but<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:38.780> just<00:00:39.200> had<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.410> do

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
there pretty tight but I just had to do

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.210 
there pretty tight but I just had to do
some<00:00:39.740> minor<00:00:39.980> touch-up<00:00:40.880> with<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.120> grinder<00:00:41.810> and<00:00:42.220> I

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
some minor touch-up with a grinder and I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.300 
some minor touch-up with a grinder and I
got<00:00:43.580> on<00:00:43.760> all<00:00:43.880> four<00:00:44.150> corners<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:44.690> got<00:00:45.160> yellows<00:00:46.160> in

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
got on all four corners I got yellows in

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.310 
got on all four corners I got yellows in
the<00:00:46.400> front<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.600> red<00:00:47.750> ones<00:00:47.930> in<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.140> back

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
the front and the red ones in the back

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.460 
the front and the red ones in the back
these<00:00:48.770> are<00:00:48.800> LED<00:00:49.370> lights<00:00:49.900> this<00:00:50.900> whole<00:00:51.110> bed<00:00:51.290> will

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
these are LED lights this whole bed will

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.600 
these are LED lights this whole bed will
be<00:00:51.550> LED<00:00:52.550> lights<00:00:52.760> throughout<00:00:53.860> and<00:00:54.860> I<00:00:55.070> also<00:00:55.250> have

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
be LED lights throughout and I also have

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.780 
be LED lights throughout and I also have
the<00:00:55.790> cure<00:00:56.030> for<00:00:56.060> my<00:00:56.390> cross<00:00:56.600> members<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:57.640> want<00:00:58.640> to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
the cure for my cross members I want to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.070 
the cure for my cross members I want to
make<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.060> light<00:00:59.270> I<00:00:59.510> also<00:00:59.660> want<00:00:59.870> to<00:00:59.900> make<00:01:00.020> it

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
make it light I also want to make it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.100 
make it light I also want to make it
strong<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:02.000> I'm<00:01:02.450> gonna<00:01:02.630> use<00:01:03.460> angle<00:01:04.510> this<00:01:05.510> is<00:01:05.780> I

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
strong so I'm gonna use angle this is I

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.420 
strong so I'm gonna use angle this is I
think<00:01:06.350> three<00:01:07.010> and<00:01:07.160> a<00:01:07.220> half<00:01:07.540> by<00:01:08.540> one<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:08.990> half

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
think three and a half by one and a half

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.010 
think three and a half by one and a half
and<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.670> angle<00:01:11.120> instead<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.480> feet<00:01:11.750> channel

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
and the angle instead of feet channel

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.530 
and the angle instead of feet channel
going<00:01:12.230> across<00:01:12.470> there's<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.770> lot<00:01:12.920> lighter<00:01:13.130> so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
going across there's a lot lighter so

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.890 
going across there's a lot lighter so
I'm<00:01:14.540> gonna<00:01:14.720> weld<00:01:15.020> angle<00:01:15.620> all<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.770> way<00:01:15.860> across

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
I'm gonna weld angle all the way across

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.480 
I'm gonna weld angle all the way across
see<00:01:17.900> here<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.680> side<00:01:18.920> of<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.070> bed

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
see here the side of the bed

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.550 
see here the side of the bed
I'm<00:01:19.880> gonna<00:01:20.060> leave<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.240> lip<00:01:20.510> so<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:23.560> diamond

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
I'm gonna leave a lip so the diamond

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.800 
I'm gonna leave a lip so the diamond
plate<00:01:24.770> can<00:01:25.040> be<00:01:25.070> weld<00:01:25.670> on<00:01:25.820> top<00:01:26.060> of<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
plate can be weld on top of it the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.480 
plate can be weld on top of it the
reason<00:01:26.960> why<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.260> do<00:01:27.380> I<00:01:27.500> want<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.860> do<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.250> way

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
reason why I do I want to do it this way

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.630 
reason why I do I want to do it this way
is<00:01:29.330> because<00:01:29.770> once<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.920> Diamonds<00:01:31.250> plate<00:01:31.520> is

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
is because once the Diamonds plate is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.060 
is because once the Diamonds plate is
welded<00:01:31.790> on<00:01:32.060> top<00:01:32.300> it's<00:01:32.510> gonna<00:01:32.630> actually<00:01:32.930> act<00:01:33.770> as

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
welded on top it's gonna actually act as

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.230 
welded on top it's gonna actually act as
C<00:01:34.310> channel<00:01:34.670> itself

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
C channel itself

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.470 
C channel itself
and<00:01:35.870> also<00:01:36.050> be<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.350> lot<00:01:36.530> lighter<00:01:37.000> if<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.150> use<00:01:38.300> C

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
and also be a lot lighter if I use C

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.100 
and also be a lot lighter if I use C
channel<00:01:39.100> like<00:01:40.100> this<00:01:40.420> where<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.540> flats<00:01:41.780> here

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
channel like this where the flats here

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.580 
channel like this where the flats here
and<00:01:42.320> I<00:01:42.380> will<00:01:42.590> on<00:01:42.890> each<00:01:43.550> side<00:01:44.380> what's<00:01:45.380> going<00:01:45.560> to

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
and I will on each side what's going to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.030 
and I will on each side what's going to
happen<00:01:45.979> is<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.850> dirt<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.500> sand<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.800> salt

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
happen is the dirt and sand and salt

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.980 
happen is the dirt and sand and salt
from<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:49.820> winter<00:01:50.210> gets<00:01:50.479> caught<00:01:50.720> up<00:01:50.870> in

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
from the winter gets caught up in

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.870 
from the winter gets caught up in
between<00:01:51.290> there<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:51.680> that's<00:01:52.400> why<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.670> get

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
between there and that's why you get

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.510 
between there and that's why you get
rust<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.810> surf's<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.260> grow<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.220> that's<00:01:55.430> a

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
rust and surf's to grow so that's a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.550 
rust and surf's to grow so that's a
problem<00:01:55.760> but<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.510> have<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:56.810> get<00:01:56.930> more<00:01:57.080> material

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
problem but I have to get more material

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.920 
problem but I have to get more material
on<00:01:57.620> having<00:01:57.979> this<00:01:58.100> material<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:58.640> sauk<00:01:58.909> I<00:01:59.270> feel<00:01:59.900> a

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
on having this material in sauk I feel a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.860 
on having this material in sauk I feel a
steel<00:02:00.229> place<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.770> week<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.540> believe<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:02.720> is
