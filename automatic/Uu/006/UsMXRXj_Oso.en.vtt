00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
they can use mismatch density memory

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.280 
they can use mismatch density memory
modules<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.390> still<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.810> even<00:01:57.990> 2

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

gigs<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.579> even<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.880> 660<00:02:00.479> T<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.810> that

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
gigs or you can even get 660 T is that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
gigs or you can even get 660 T is that
have<00:02:01.259> all<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.560> power<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.130> three<00:02:02.729> gigs<00:02:03.060> of

have all that power and three gigs of
graphics<00:02:04.110> memory<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:06.030> cool

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
graphics memory so that you can do cool

stuff<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.610> smooth<00:02:08.899> now<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.319> this

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320 
stuff like this smooth now all of this
is<00:02:10.619> useless<00:02:11.009> information<00:02:11.400> without<00:02:12.030> knowing

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.880 
is useless information without knowing
how<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.599> performs<00:02:13.170> compared<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
solutions that are out there so we took

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.050 
solutions that are out there so we took
the<00:02:16.020> liberty<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.380> testing<00:02:17.190> northern<00:02:17.640> 3d<00:02:17.940> again

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the liberty of testing northern 3d again

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.870 
the liberty of testing northern 3d again
so<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.830> non<00:02:20.130> stereoscopic

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
so this is in this is a non stereoscopic

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.140 
so this is in this is a non stereoscopic

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.550 
believe there are actually other
advanced<00:03:39.269> graphics<00:03:39.630> we<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:40.049> high<00:03:40.290> res

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
advanced graphics we have high res

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.190 
advanced graphics we have high res
textures<00:03:41.100> enabled<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.390> one<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.989> key

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
textures enabled that is one of the key

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.020 
textures enabled that is one of the key
differences<00:03:43.680> between<00:03:43.739> our<00:03:44.280> last<00:03:44.519> generation

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
differences between our last generation

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.960 
differences between our last generation
560<00:03:45.690> Ti<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.500> current<00:03:46.799> 660ti<00:03:47.489> because<00:03:47.850> it

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
560 Ti and the current 660ti because it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.060 
560 Ti and the current 660ti because it
has<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.360> much<00:03:48.510> memory<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.530> don't<00:03:49.739> have<00:03:49.920> to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
has so much memory you don't have to

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.920 
has so much memory you don't have to
worry<00:03:50.250> about<00:03:50.430> enabling<00:03:50.880> high<00:03:51.239> res<00:03:51.420> textures

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
worry about enabling high res textures

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.220 
worry about enabling high res textures
and<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:53.100> destroying<00:03:53.790> your<00:03:54.090> frame<00:03:54.330> rates<00:03:54.570> so

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
and just destroying your frame rates so

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.430 
and just destroying your frame rates so
yeah<00:03:55.440> can<00:03:56.310> we<00:03:56.459> run<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.820> ultra<00:03:57.209> play<00:03:57.510> ibly<00:03:57.750> no

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
yeah can we run it on ultra play ibly no

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.009 
yeah can we run it on ultra play ibly no
you<00:03:58.709> probably<00:03:58.950> need<00:03:59.370> like<00:03:59.640> dual<00:03:59.970> DT<00:04:00.390> X<00:04:00.510> 6<00:04:00.750> 80s

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
you probably need like dual DT X 6 80s

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.960 
you probably need like dual DT X 6 80s
for<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.890> we<00:04:02.070> run<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:02.489> very<00:04:02.760> high

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
for that can we run it on very high

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.289 
for that can we run it on very high
details<00:04:03.390> in<00:04:03.600> 3d<00:04:04.019> again<00:04:04.530> probably<00:04:05.280> not<00:04:05.700> 3d<00:04:06.180> is

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
details in 3d again probably not 3d is

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.840 
details in 3d again probably not 3d is
very<00:04:06.840> demanding<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:07.650> you're<00:04:07.920> gonna<00:04:08.040> want<00:04:08.760> like

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
very demanding so you're gonna want like

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.900 
very demanding so you're gonna want like
yeah<00:04:09.239> dual<00:04:09.540> 6<00:04:09.870> 80s<00:04:10.260> or<00:04:10.530> even<00:04:10.890> like<00:04:11.340> triple<00:04:11.700> 6

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
yeah dual 6 80s or even like triple 6

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.880 
yeah dual 6 80s or even like triple 6
80s<00:04:12.269> if<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.540> want<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.810> run<00:04:12.959> very<00:04:13.260> high<00:04:13.470> details

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
80s if you want to run very high details

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.880 
80s if you want to run very high details
and<00:04:14.280> triple<00:04:15.090> surround<00:04:15.420> 3d<00:04:16.229> vision<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:16.739> you
