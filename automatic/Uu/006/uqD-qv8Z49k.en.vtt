00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.950 
for more options and also it's a light I
think<00:02:03.840> easier<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.350> use<00:02:05.390> here<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.810> all

different apps that I'd like to run all
the<00:02:47.650> time<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:47.950> this<00:02:48.010> might<00:02:48.220> slow<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.670> down<00:02:48.700> just

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
the time so this might slow it down just

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.090 
the time so this might slow it down just
a<00:02:49.180> tad<00:02:49.360> first<00:02:50.200> let<00:02:50.410> me<00:02:50.440> show<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.709> how<00:02:50.799> good<00:02:50.950> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
a tad first let me show you how good the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.800 
a tad first let me show you how good the
high<00:02:51.220> resolution<00:02:51.430> screen<00:02:52.030> looks<00:02:52.239> on<00:02:52.420> here<00:02:52.630> so

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
high resolution screen looks on here so

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.150 
high resolution screen looks on here so
go<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.080> take<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.260> screen<00:02:53.560> capture<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:54.069> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
go and take a screen capture of the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.580 
go and take a screen capture of the
desktop<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:54.970> look<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.720> up<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:55.930> quick<00:02:56.140> pic<00:02:56.380> and

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
desktop and look it up and quick pic and

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.380 
desktop and look it up and quick pic and
you<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:56.860> see<00:02:57.130> on<00:02:57.280> here<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.610> can<00:02:57.760> really<00:02:58.060> zoom

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
you can see on here you can really zoom

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.180 
you can see on here you can really zoom
in<00:02:58.599> and<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:58.870> still<00:02:59.140> looks<00:02:59.410> good<00:02:59.650> that's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
in and it still looks good that's

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.030 
in and it still looks good that's
because<00:03:00.549> it's<00:03:00.700> captured<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.239> 1048<00:03:02.230> by<00:03:02.440> 1536

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
because it's captured it 1048 by 1536

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.720 
because it's captured it 1048 by 1536
instead<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:03.970> regular<00:03:04.319> 1920<00:03:05.319> by<00:03:05.470> 1080<00:03:05.920> so

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
instead of the regular 1920 by 1080 so

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.130 
instead of the regular 1920 by 1080 so
I'm<00:03:06.849> pretty<00:03:07.239> happy<00:03:07.420> with<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.660> screen<00:03:07.989> it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
I'm pretty happy with the screen it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.780 
I'm pretty happy with the screen it
looks<00:03:08.170> good<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.860> actually<00:03:09.069> plays<00:03:09.430> videos

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
looks good and it actually plays videos

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.440 
looks good and it actually plays videos
and<00:03:10.000> HD<00:03:10.510> really<00:03:10.780> nicely<00:03:10.959> as<00:03:11.260> well<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:13.239> the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
and HD really nicely as well so the

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.610 
and HD really nicely as well so the
first<00:03:13.480> thing<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> wanted<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.049> show<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.500> the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
first thing I wanted to show you was the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.680 
first thing I wanted to show you was the
video<00:03:14.860> playback<00:03:15.160> capability<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.180> tablet

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
video playback capability of this tablet

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.479 
video playback capability of this tablet
and<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:17.109> worked<00:03:17.230> pretty<00:03:17.380> well<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.680> think<00:03:17.859> that<00:03:18.190> a

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
and it worked pretty well I think that a

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.699 
and it worked pretty well I think that a
31<00:03:19.209> processor<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:19.810> actually<00:03:20.109> geared<00:03:20.350> towards

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
31 processor is actually geared towards

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.039 
31 processor is actually geared towards
video<00:03:20.980> decoding<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:21.700> encoding<00:03:21.760> so<00:03:22.420> does<00:03:23.019> a

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
video decoding and encoding so does a

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.800 
video decoding and encoding so does a
good<00:03:23.230> job<00:03:23.290> on<00:03:23.680> there<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.730> used<00:03:25.120> also<00:03:25.299> MX

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
good job on there and I used also MX

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.500 
good job on there and I used also MX
player<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.320> worked<00:03:26.470> really<00:03:26.680> well<00:03:26.769> as<00:03:27.100> well

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
player and it worked really well as well

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.849 
player and it worked really well as well
you<00:03:28.510> can<00:03:28.660> also<00:03:28.780> have<00:03:29.079> put<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.380> video<00:03:29.620> from

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
you can also have put the video from

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.220 
you can also have put the video from
this<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.250> your<00:03:30.400> TV<00:03:30.760> using<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.269> mini<00:03:31.510> HDMI<00:03:32.049> plug

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
this to your TV using the mini HDMI plug

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.800

the<00:03:32.769> output<00:03:33.069> is<00:03:33.190> only<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.489> 720p<00:03:34.060> though<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.690> it

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
the output is only in 720p though and it

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.090 
the output is only in 720p though and it
was<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.930> little<00:03:35.200> bit<00:03:35.319> jumpy<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:35.769> hopefully<00:03:36.069> a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
was a little bit jumpy so hopefully a

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.640 
was a little bit jumpy so hopefully a
software<00:03:36.640> update<00:03:36.970> will<00:03:37.329> fix<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.750> next<00:03:38.530> up

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
software update will fix that next up

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.440 
software update will fix that next up
I'll<00:03:38.799> run<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.190> benchmarking<00:03:39.760> app<00:03:39.940> Linpack

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
I'll run the benchmarking app Linpack

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.599 
I'll run the benchmarking app Linpack
and<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:40.780> just<00:03:41.019> does<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.230> quick<00:03:41.500> CPU<00:03:42.069> benchmark

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
and this just does a quick CPU benchmark

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.340 
and this just does a quick CPU benchmark
and<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.510> getting<00:03:43.720> pretty<00:03:43.900> respectable

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
and it's getting pretty respectable

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.379 
and it's getting pretty respectable
scores<00:03:44.799> between<00:03:45.130> ninety<00:03:45.639> and<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.819> hundred<00:03:45.850> so

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
scores between ninety and a hundred so

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:47.819 
scores between ninety and a hundred so
that's<00:03:46.630> actually<00:03:46.810> pretty<00:03:47.170> good<00:03:47.290> about<00:03:47.410> double

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
that's actually pretty good about double

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.440 
that's actually pretty good about double
what<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.010> lot<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.190> Android<00:03:48.430> mini<00:03:48.670> pcs<00:03:49.150> get

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
what a lot of Android mini pcs get

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.420 
what a lot of Android mini pcs get
especially<00:03:50.049> considering<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.829> resolution<00:03:51.340> of

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
especially considering the resolution of

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.099 
especially considering the resolution of
this<00:03:51.519> tablet<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.150> I'm<00:03:52.209> happy<00:03:52.389> with<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.600> I

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
this tablet so I'm happy with that I

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.379 
this tablet so I'm happy with that I
also<00:03:54.010> ran<00:03:54.340> an<00:03:54.519> tutu<00:03:54.880> on<00:03:55.030> here<00:03:55.239> which

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
also ran an tutu on here which

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.059 
also ran an tutu on here which
benchmarks<00:03:56.049> all<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.380> different<00:03:56.650> components

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
benchmarks all the different components

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.170 
benchmarks all the different components
on<00:03:57.160> your<00:03:57.280> system<00:03:57.549> and<00:03:57.579> then<00:03:57.730> gives<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.030> one

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
on your system and then gives you one

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.720 
on your system and then gives you one
overall<00:03:58.510> score<00:03:59.049> and<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.920> did<00:04:00.040> pretty<00:04:00.250> good<00:04:00.340> my

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
overall score and it did pretty good my

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.699 
overall score and it did pretty good my
samsung<00:04:01.090> galaxy<00:04:01.150> s3<00:04:01.630> gets<00:04:02.079> about<00:04:02.319> this<00:04:02.500> same

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
samsung galaxy s3 gets about this same

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.050 
samsung galaxy s3 gets about this same
score<00:04:03.040> although<00:04:03.160> it's<00:04:03.400> super<00:04:03.730> bogged<00:04:03.940> down

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
score although it's super bogged down

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.210 
score although it's super bogged down
with<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.630> million<00:04:04.930> different<00:04:05.019> apps<00:04:05.319> but<00:04:05.709> pretty

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
with a million different apps but pretty

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.520 
with a million different apps but pretty
happy<00:04:06.459> with<00:04:06.549> this<00:04:06.639> score<00:04:06.970> next<00:04:07.900> let's<00:04:08.230> look<00:04:08.410> at

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
happy with this score next let's look at

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.770 
happy with this score next let's look at
some<00:04:08.680> more<00:04:08.709> details<00:04:08.829> about<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.459> CPU<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:10.660> you

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
some more details about the CPU so you

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.900 
some more details about the CPU so you
can<00:04:11.019> see<00:04:11.200> here<00:04:11.410> it's<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.650> quad<00:04:11.980> core<00:04:12.489> ARM<00:04:12.819> based

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
can see here it's a quad core ARM based

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.780 
can see here it's a quad core ARM based
CPU<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:14.440> it<00:04:14.620> goes<00:04:14.709> up<00:04:14.829> to<00:04:14.920> one<00:04:15.069> gigahertz

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
CPU and it goes up to one gigahertz

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.060 
CPU and it goes up to one gigahertz
now<00:04:16.570> I'm<00:04:16.690> gonna<00:04:16.810> run<00:04:17.049> root<00:04:17.380> checker<00:04:17.590> on<00:04:17.889> here

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
now I'm gonna run root checker on here

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.970 
now I'm gonna run root checker on here
which<00:04:18.250> verifies<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.419> yeah

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
which verifies that yeah

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.830 
which verifies that yeah
we<00:04:20.160> do<00:04:20.310> have<00:04:20.520> root<00:04:20.760> access<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.510> can<00:04:21.690> run

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
we do have root access so you can run

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.780 
we do have root access so you can run
all<00:04:22.050> sorts<00:04:22.230> of<00:04:22.440> good<00:04:22.650> tweaking<00:04:23.160> apps<00:04:23.370> on<00:04:23.610> this

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
all sorts of good tweaking apps on this

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.150 
all sorts of good tweaking apps on this
tablet<00:04:24.350> here's<00:04:25.350> how<00:04:25.470> your<00:04:25.620> internet<00:04:25.950> surfing

works<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:27.000> f9x

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
works on the f9x

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
so I'm using Dolphin Browser and I think

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.740 
so I'm using Dolphin Browser and I think
it<00:04:29.880> was<00:04:29.970> already<00:04:30.180> running<00:04:30.330> in<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.600> background

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750

loaded up Google News and it seems to

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.170 
loaded up Google News and it seems to
scroll<00:04:33.990> nice<00:04:34.170> and<00:04:34.380> fast

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
scroll nice and fast

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
scroll nice and fast
zooming<00:04:36.180> works<00:04:36.360> pretty<00:04:36.600> well<00:04:36.720> once<00:04:37.050> it's

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
zooming works pretty well once it's

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.110 
zooming works pretty well once it's

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
on this tablet also I'm happy with it

on this tablet also I'm happy with it
here's<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.000> comparison<00:04:42.330> with<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.930> f9x<00:04:43.560> versus

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
here's a comparison with the f9x versus

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.980 
here's a comparison with the f9x versus
my<00:04:44.070> iPad<00:04:44.490> 3<00:04:44.850> both<00:04:45.060> running<00:04:45.360> Dolphin<00:04:45.870> Browser

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
my iPad 3 both running Dolphin Browser

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.690 
my iPad 3 both running Dolphin Browser
it<00:04:46.350> was<00:04:46.470> already<00:04:46.650> loaded<00:04:46.950> in<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.250> background

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
and loading up Google News it goes up a

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.070 
and loading up Google News it goes up a
little<00:04:50.550> bit<00:04:50.760> quicker<00:04:50.940> on<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.210> iPad<00:04:51.510> 3<00:04:51.810> but

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
little bit quicker on the iPad 3 but

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.410 
little bit quicker on the iPad 3 but
they're<00:04:52.320> both<00:04:52.440> pretty<00:04:52.650> snappy<00:04:53.010> on<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.490> you

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
they're both pretty snappy on it you

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.330 
they're both pretty snappy on it you
have<00:04:54.480> to<00:04:54.570> consider<00:04:54.840> also<00:04:55.200> that<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.470> f9x<00:04:55.950> costs

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
have to consider also that the f9x costs

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.000 
have to consider also that the f9x costs
about<00:04:56.490> half<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:56.910> price<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.390> iPad<00:04:58.010> now

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
about half the price of the iPad now

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.890 
about half the price of the iPad now

the<00:06:01.980> bug<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.460> play<00:06:02.730> itself<00:06:03.090> is<00:06:03.330> what<00:06:03.510> matters

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720
