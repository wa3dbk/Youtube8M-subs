would think it's

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.380 
would think it's
makes<00:04:26.530> more<00:04:26.740> pressure<00:04:27.070> than<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.790> really<00:04:28.180> know

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.870 
know it doesn't sound like you make
sense<00:04:40.690> but<00:04:40.960> it's<00:04:41.140> true<00:04:41.440> so<00:04:41.950> you're<00:04:42.670> running

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
sense but it's true so you're running

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.920 
sense but it's true so you're running
your<00:04:43.060> fingers<00:04:43.300> through<00:04:43.330> your<00:04:43.480> hair<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.750> you
