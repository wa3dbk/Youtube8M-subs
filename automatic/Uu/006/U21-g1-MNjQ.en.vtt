00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you're going to notice there's a balance

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.770 
you're going to notice there's a balance
point<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.369> hit<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.390> very<00:01:57.570> similar

to the balance point that you get in the
regular<00:01:59.369> nose<00:01:59.550> manual<00:01:59.759> except<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.300> both

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
key to the holding that balance point is

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.510 
key to the holding that balance point is
just<00:02:04.050> focused<00:02:04.470> on<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.650> first<00:02:04.950> two<00:02:05.190> or<00:02:05.340> three

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
just focused on the first two or three

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.969 
just focused on the first two or three
feet<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.940> doing<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.660> after<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.410> you're<00:02:07.800> sort

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
feet of doing it after that you're sort

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.169 
feet of doing it after that you're sort
of<00:02:08.009> locked<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.700> becomes<00:02:08.880> much<00:02:09.149> easier

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
of locked in and it becomes much easier

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.600 
of locked in and it becomes much easier
to<00:02:09.600> hold<00:02:09.830> okay<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.130> you're<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.370> your

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
to hold okay so now that you're in your

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.100 
to hold okay so now that you're in your
hang<00:02:11.730> ten<00:02:11.910> nose<00:02:12.090> manual<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.840> found<00:02:12.990> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
hang ten nose manual and you found that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.050 
hang ten nose manual and you found that
balance<00:02:13.500> point<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.220> next<00:02:14.459> thing<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.640> being

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
balance point the next thing is being

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.820 
balance point the next thing is being
able<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.390> hold<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.720> for<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.900> while<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.620> is

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
able to hold it for a while and this is

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.100 
able to hold it for a while and this is
just<00:02:17.100> like<00:02:17.190> nose<00:02:17.850> manuals<00:02:18.300> or<00:02:18.540> regular

might not be exactly what you think it
might<00:02:32.730> seem<00:02:33.000> like<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.570> just<00:02:33.810> set<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.019> down<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
might seem like you just set it down and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.080 
might seem like you just set it down and
then<00:02:34.530> step<00:02:34.800> back<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.640> makes<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.030> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
then step back but that makes it a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.670 
then step back but that makes it a
little<00:02:36.209> more<00:02:36.360> difficult<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:37.170> would<00:02:37.410> highly

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
little more difficult I would highly

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.560 
little more difficult I would highly
recommend<00:02:37.709> from<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.730> Hank<00:02:39.030> temp<00:02:39.209> position

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
recommend from the Hank temp position

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.509 
recommend from the Hank temp position
pushing<00:02:40.230> forward<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.620> little<00:02:40.739> bit<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.430> then

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
pushing forward a little bit and then

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
one side or the other alright so now

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:48.860 
one side or the other alright so now
that<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.790> guys<00:02:47.850> got<00:02:48.120> your<00:02:48.180> hang<00:02:48.480> ten<00:02:48.690> nose

that you guys got your hang ten nose

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.390 
that you guys got your hang ten nose
manis<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.290> getting<00:02:49.739> balanced<00:02:50.100> with<00:02:50.250> it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
manis and getting balanced with it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.039 
manis and getting balanced with it
eventually<00:02:50.940> if<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.480> want<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.720> step<00:02:51.840> up<00:02:51.959> your

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
eventually if you want to step up your

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.750 
eventually if you want to step up your
game<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.739> try<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.040> do<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.340> with<00:02:53.370> your<00:02:53.519> feet

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
game you can try to do it with your feet

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.759 
game you can try to do it with your feet
straight<00:02:54.120> forward<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.989> much<00:02:55.290> harder<00:02:55.500> to

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
straight forward this is much harder to

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.800 
straight forward this is much harder to
learn<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.190> basically<00:02:57.060> what<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.330> involves

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
learn and basically what this involves

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.530 
learn and basically what this involves
is

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
is

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.940 
is
when<00:02:58.750> you're<00:02:58.900> first<00:02:59.409> getting<00:02:59.620> into<00:02:59.769> the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
when you're first getting into the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.009
