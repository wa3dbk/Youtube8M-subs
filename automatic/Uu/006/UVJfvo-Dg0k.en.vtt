00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.740
 hey I'm linda von braiding hairstyle 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.380
 com and today I'll show you how to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.299
 a Dutch braid over the side 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.110
 go over the shoulder duty go 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:15.299
 first you trend yourselves you trend 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.099
 you share your hair with one 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.919
 from the top of the page and then do three 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.869
 small strands the little i at the beginning 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:31.169
 makes the finer the whole afterwards 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.180
 train and then it starts as well 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:39.210
 at the normal braid hh not wrong 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.400
 but always braiding underneath 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.630
 once the small hairs are here 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.420
 I can also try one 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.010
 a little more to catch up and then it works 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 already going on with the aspiration of taking 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.660
 I always share with my index finger 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.420
 and puts me the strand then if 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.770
 you make so little google easy then 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.320
 go back a bit 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.890
 so that everything is smooth afterwards 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.560
 so then from the top as always the hair 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.150
 First place in middle finger and then 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.150
 a strand from above to 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.600
 Divide it from above is important 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.549
 We only ever take the hair up 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.289
 go to the braid so bad first 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.789
 I always the strand that is called the 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.729
 hour that is up now give her 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.790
 once down through in the middle finger 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.470
 then split off with the index finger and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.000
 But that is really only up to the height of 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.560
 So if I'm here with my head 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.890
 index finger arrived I draw him 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.810
 in front 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.780
 and that is the strand that I have 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.049
 Now take with you in the pot if you 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.190
 that goes further than the braid then 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.769
 it does not fit anymore after that 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.750
 right together and then it will all be 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.750
 fluffy and is not so close to the head 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:53.500
 you can now turn my piece 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:56.190
 after and let's come now already 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.620
 the first complicated job namely 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.360
 if we're in the back of the crest 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.579
 Once that's even your head 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.829
 Direction camera tilt you see now 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.079
 Here is the crest to end 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.180
 and now you try when you split off 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.680
 at the top only very narrow from 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.630
 divide and down a bit 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.549
 to get broader so it is here 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.500
 star shaped pattern is so if I 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.019
 Now compartments which new up here quite 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.030
 narrow and still have down below 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.739
 a neat streak in hand the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.739
 I now declare to a plait 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.970
 so now comes the next complicated one 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.880
 location 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.890
 we are up here now 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.080
 height of the crest arrived now 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.849
 I start exhausting from the front 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.940
 and I always take it that way 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.860
 purely that I share here the next 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.930
 part I here and the next parts then 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.930
 here until I arrived at the front 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.340
 Now all hair is stowed and you 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.410
 I 've just got my head 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.570
 always guided where I want to have him 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.700
 I arrived directly under moore 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.550
 and here I bad them now 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.710
 just continue as normal 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.300
 braiding with three aspirations is possible 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.590
 her also in my very first video 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.770
 see, even if you know again 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.770
 I would like to see how basic the break is 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.220
 then there is also the right one 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.220
 Video 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.290
