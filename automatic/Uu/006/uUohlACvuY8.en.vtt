question<00:00:06.180> YouTube<00:00:06.890> I<00:00:07.890> think<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.790> make<00:00:08.940> them<00:00:09.179> for

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809

question YouTube I think I make them for
myself<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.519> think<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.580> makes<00:00:11.700> me<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> better

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
myself I think it makes me a better

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.810 
myself I think it makes me a better
musician<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.599> keeps<00:00:12.750> me<00:00:12.929> motivated<00:00:13.610> but<00:00:14.610> I

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
musician it keeps me motivated but I

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.039 
musician it keeps me motivated but I
think<00:00:15.059> that's<00:00:15.210> only<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.509> partial<00:00:15.780> truth

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
think that's only a partial truth

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.920 
think that's only a partial truth
because<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.640> if<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.060> look<00:00:18.240> back<00:00:18.630> at<00:00:18.690> this

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
because if you if you look back at this

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.390 
because if you if you look back at this
from<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> distance<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.770> think<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.220> kind<00:00:20.369> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
from a distance I think this is kind of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.279 
from a distance I think this is kind of
a<00:00:20.490> strange<00:00:20.670> thing<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.090> do<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.420> sit<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.109> my<00:00:22.140> room

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
a strange thing to do I sit in my room

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.580 
a strange thing to do I sit in my room
and<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.650> play<00:00:22.830> guitar<00:00:23.750> and<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.900> sing<00:00:25.320> into<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
and I play guitar and I sing into a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.080 
and I play guitar and I sing into a
camera<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.609> put<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
camera and then I put that on the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.480 
camera and then I put that on the
internet<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.720> strange<00:00:28.650> people<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.189> over<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
internet for strange people all over the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.659 
internet for strange people all over the
world<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.849> find<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.449> hopefully<00:00:30.900> enjoy<00:00:31.669> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
world to find and hopefully enjoy and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.740 
world to find and hopefully enjoy and
that's<00:00:32.790> kind<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.300> kind<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> bizarre

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that's kind of that's kind of a bizarre

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.250 
that's kind of that's kind of a bizarre
thing<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.540> also<00:00:36.750> call<00:00:36.870> myself<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
thing but I like to also call myself a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.220 
thing but I like to also call myself a
folk<00:00:37.440> musician<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.719> being<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
folk musician so I think with being a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.500 
folk musician so I think with being a
folk<00:00:40.410> musician<00:00:40.440> comes<00:00:41.280> an<00:00:41.610> obligation<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
folk musician comes an obligation to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.310 
folk musician comes an obligation to
share<00:00:42.780> music<00:00:43.579> because<00:00:44.579> folk<00:00:44.879> music<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.420> an

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
share music because folk music is an

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.650 
share music because folk music is an
oral<00:00:46.770> tradition<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.370> needs<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.180> passed<00:00:48.390> on

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
oral tradition and needs to be passed on

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.729 
oral tradition and needs to be passed on
and<00:00:49.020> needs<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.440> spread<00:00:50.039> around<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.399> world

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
and needs to be spread around the world

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.200 
and needs to be spread around the world
so<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> large<00:00:53.489> goal<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> why<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
so I think that's a large goal and why I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.330 
so I think that's a large goal and why I
make<00:00:54.449> these<00:00:54.600> videos<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.129> just

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
make these videos is to is to just

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.930 
make these videos is to is to just
spread<00:00:56.670> music<00:00:57.120> around<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.680> share<00:00:59.399> share

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
spread music around and just share share

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.750 
spread music around and just share share
the<00:01:00.180> joy<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.170> playing<00:01:01.410> music

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
the joy that I get out of playing music

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.359 
the joy that I get out of playing music
so<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.110> think<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.350> keeping<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.949> I'm

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so I think in keeping with that I'm

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.850 
so I think in keeping with that I'm
going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> traditional<00:01:05.970> song<00:01:06.450> today

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
going to do a traditional song today

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.719 
going to do a traditional song today
