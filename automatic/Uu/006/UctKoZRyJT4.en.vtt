00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
Orissa we winch which was 150 kilometer

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.150 
Orissa we winch which was 150 kilometer
but<00:05:01.380> right<00:05:01.740> now<00:05:02.070> what<00:05:02.880> were<00:05:03.090> they<00:05:03.330> I<00:05:03.510> am<00:05:03.720> the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
but right now what were they I am the

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.129 
but right now what were they I am the
information<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.340> state<00:05:05.729> comment<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.930> the

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
information to state comment that the

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.240 
information to state comment that the
wind<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:09.110> low-pressure<00:05:10.110> had<00:05:10.590> will<00:05:10.770> come<00:05:11.039> to

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
wind the low-pressure had will come to

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.790 
wind the low-pressure had will come to
achieve<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.699> cyclone<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.389> at<00:05:13.169> present<00:05:13.380> the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
achieve a cyclone and at present the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.890 
achieve a cyclone and at present the
wind<00:05:14.039> speed<00:05:14.340> is<00:05:14.520> at<00:05:14.699> 200<00:05:15.120> kilometers<00:05:15.690> per<00:05:15.870> hour

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
wind speed is at 200 kilometers per hour

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.189 
wind speed is at 200 kilometers per hour
so<00:05:16.800> energy<00:05:17.100> will<00:05:17.250> touch<00:05:17.639> to<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.030> coastline<00:05:18.750> I

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
so energy will touch to the coastline I

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.000 
so energy will touch to the coastline I
think<00:05:19.830> it<00:05:19.979> may<00:05:20.190> increase<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.729> 230<00:05:21.449> 240<00:05:22.139> so<00:05:22.889> it

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
think it may increase to 230 240 so it

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.469 
think it may increase to 230 240 so it
will<00:05:23.190> be<00:05:23.310> more<00:05:23.520> severe<00:05:23.940> than<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.270> last

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
will be more severe than the last

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.730 
will be more severe than the last
cyclone<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.110> you're<00:05:25.229> calling<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.530> help

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
cyclone so you're calling to help

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.879 
cyclone so you're calling to help
repelling<00:05:26.930> all<00:05:27.930> right<00:05:28.110> so<00:05:28.289> you<00:05:28.530> think<00:05:28.560> it

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
repelling all right so you think it

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.980 
repelling all right so you think it
could<00:05:29.099> be<00:05:29.250> more<00:05:29.460> severe<00:05:29.880> than<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.270> 1999

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
could be more severe than the 1999

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.270 
could be more severe than the 1999
cyclone<00:05:31.530> that<00:05:31.710> that's<00:05:31.919> what<00:05:32.130> you're

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
cyclone that that's what you're

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.360 
cyclone that that's what you're
understanding<00:05:32.940> from<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.180> Met<00:05:33.330> department

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
yeah in 99 999 this shit was not that

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.029 
yeah in 99 999 this shit was not that
much<00:05:38.760> weaker<00:05:39.150> at<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.419> time<00:05:39.690> but<00:05:40.440> out<00:05:40.680> of<00:05:40.710> our

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
much weaker at the time but out of our

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.670 
much weaker at the time but out of our
experience<00:05:41.580> in<00:05:41.940> 99<00:05:42.360> cyclone<00:05:42.930> we<00:05:43.260> have<00:05:43.409> learned

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680
