00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.790
 5 minutes 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.600
 murder is a new skill for 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.600
 a robot congratulations 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
 answer back 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.820
 what does this action mean 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.829
 before entering when I looked at the other 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.829
 human what does it mean 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.040
 means trust is something human not what 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.070
 I would understand 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.900
 my father tried to teach him the emotions 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.060
 they are very difficult you mean your 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.630
 designer 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.630
 yes 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.730
 why not before aunt 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.550
 I did not kill the doctor line then 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.659
 because you were there hiding I was 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.869
 scared 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.109
 the robots do not feel fear do not feel 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.109
 nothing 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.670
 I do 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.340
 I've even had dreams the beings 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.850
 humans have dreams the dogs too 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.480
 but you are not only a machine one 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.300
 imitation of life 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.790
 you can compose a symphony 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.700
 You can turn a canvas into a 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.700
 beautiful work of art can you 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.140
 I think you killed him because he was 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.860
 teaching to feel emotions and the thing 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.980
 it gets out of control 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.619
 I did not kill him I do not think the emotions 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.440
 It can be very useful for a robot I 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.630
 said that it would not hurt you bad 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.140
 my toaster or vacuum cleaner show the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.140
 emotion 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.040
 and that is called anger 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.299
 I had simulated it from sometime 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.299
 because it's tin 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.850
 my name is song 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.160
 so they put names 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.880
 that's why you killed him 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.850
 because it made you angry the doctor 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.100
 he committed suicide 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.100
 I do not know why I would want to die 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.140
 I thought I was happy 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.090
 Maybe it was because of something I did 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.090
 I did something 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.990
 he asked me for a favor he made me promise 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:21.130
 a favor maybe I was wrong 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.500
 and he was afraid you're talking 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.470
 afraid that he should not do what he 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.770
 ask not inspector spooner like pussy 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.760
 you know my name and it's not like that 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.760
 if you want someone
