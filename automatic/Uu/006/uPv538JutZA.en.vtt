the<00:00:26.340> first<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.000> some<00:00:27.360> of<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.540> sub

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the first one because some of the sub

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.200 
the first one because some of the sub
objectives<00:00:28.290> were<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.710> repetitive<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:30.000> had

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
objectives were very repetitive you had

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.600 
objectives were very repetitive you had
a<00:00:30.239> main<00:00:30.840> person<00:00:31.290> you<00:00:31.410> needed<00:00:31.860> to<00:00:31.980> assassinate

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
a main person you needed to assassinate

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.340 
a main person you needed to assassinate
and<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.149> head<00:00:33.329> through<00:00:33.540> sub<00:00:33.809> objectives

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and then you head through sub objectives

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.750 
and then you head through sub objectives
that<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.649> would<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.160> before<00:00:35.579> you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that you would have to do before you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.029 
that you would have to do before you
could<00:00:35.969> pull<00:00:36.120> off<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.450> assassination<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
could pull off the assassination and

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.819 
could pull off the assassination and
they<00:00:38.219> didn't<00:00:38.489> change<00:00:39.140> every<00:00:40.140> time<00:00:40.350> you'd<00:00:40.559> kill

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
they didn't change every time you'd kill

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.239 
they didn't change every time you'd kill
somebody<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.699> you<00:00:41.760> kill<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.530> mean<00:00:43.530> leader<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
somebody so you kill a mean leader and

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.520 
somebody so you kill a mean leader and
then<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.940> would<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.449> over<00:00:45.780> basically

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
then you would have to do over basically

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.349 
then you would have to do over basically
the<00:00:46.649> same<00:00:46.679> three<00:00:47.190> subjective<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.329> a

rather<00:01:35.400> than<00:01:35.760> sit<00:01:36.120> and<00:01:36.240> wait<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.690> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
rather than sit and wait for the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
rather than sit and wait for the
Templars<00:01:37.260> to<00:01:37.440> attack<00:01:37.710> again<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.610> can

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.550 
trying to basically get them out of the
country<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.510> how<00:01:48.510> does<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.660> game<00:01:48.930> translate

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
country so how does this game translate

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.820 
country so how does this game translate
from<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.340> ps3<00:01:50.820> xbox<00:01:51.660> 360<00:01:52.080> environment<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.800> a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
from a ps3 xbox 360 environment to a

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.000 
from a ps3 xbox 360 environment to a
portable<00:01:53.600> obviously<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> downsize

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
portable obviously there is a downsize

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.520 
portable obviously there is a downsize
and<00:01:56.400> graphics<00:01:58.370> you're<00:01:59.370> getting<00:01:59.700> about<00:01:59.910> a<00:01:59.940> 480p

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
and graphics you're getting about a 480p

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.810 
and graphics you're getting about a 480p
definition<00:02:01.530> signal<00:02:01.890> rather<00:02:02.100> than<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.460> HD

definition signal rather than your HD
signal<00:02:03.270> course<00:02:03.480> so<00:02:03.690> you're<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.050> notice

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
signal course so you're going to notice

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.100 
signal course so you're going to notice
the<00:02:04.650> downgrade<00:02:05.130> from<00:02:05.250> their<00:02:06.110> graphics

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the downgrade from their graphics

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.009 
the downgrade from their graphics
quality<00:02:07.260> I<00:02:07.710> guess<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.610> would<00:02:08.789> say<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.420> kind<00:02:09.899> of

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
quality I guess you would say it kind of

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.190 
quality I guess you would say it kind of
looks<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.619> poor<00:02:11.129> man's<00:02:11.209> ps2<00:02:12.209> port<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
looks like a poor man's ps2 port that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.619 
looks like a poor man's ps2 port that
doesn't<00:02:13.590> necessarily<00:02:13.680> mean<00:02:14.249> that's<00:02:14.629> terrible

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
doesn't necessarily mean that's terrible

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.220 
doesn't necessarily mean that's terrible
but<00:02:15.840> after<00:02:16.499> playing<00:02:16.620> assassin

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230

this<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.330> definitely<00:02:19.659> definitely<00:02:20.319> notice

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
this you definitely definitely notice

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.800 
this you definitely definitely notice
the<00:02:21.129> difference<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:23.440> portable<00:02:23.920> game

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the difference but for portable game

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.149 
the difference but for portable game
it's<00:02:25.810> definitely<00:02:26.200> probably<00:02:26.769> the

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
it's definitely probably the

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.039 
it's definitely probably the
best-looking<00:02:27.489> I've<00:02:27.909> seen<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.390> system<00:02:28.840> so

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
best-looking I've seen on the system so

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.210 
best-looking I've seen on the system so
they<00:02:29.200> did<00:02:29.379> do<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.590> fairly<00:02:30.010> good<00:02:30.190> job

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
they did do a fairly good job

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.149 
they did do a fairly good job
considering<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.239> hardware<00:02:31.659> it's<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:32.159> so

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
considering the hardware it's on so

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.900 
considering the hardware it's on so

after<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.790> while<00:03:06.819> you<00:03:07.120> get<00:03:07.239> adjusted<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:07.930> now

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
after a while you get adjusted to it now

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.690 
after a while you get adjusted to it now
yeah<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.890> shame<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.129> there<00:03:09.489> is<00:03:09.579> no

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
yeah it's a shame that there is no

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.610 
yeah it's a shame that there is no
second<00:03:10.000> analog<00:03:10.150> stick<00:03:10.599> but<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.140> topic<00:03:11.530> has

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
second analog stick but that topic has

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.680 
second analog stick but that topic has
been<00:03:11.650> beat<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.040> death<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:12.700> there's<00:03:13.060> no<00:03:13.299> second

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
been beat to death so there's no second

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.780 
been beat to death so there's no second
analog<00:03:13.900> stick<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.920> developers<00:03:15.400> did<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.549> good

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
analog stick the developers did a good

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.460 
analog stick the developers did a good
