so for I've decided that the 750 mark

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.179 
so for I've decided that the 750 mark
would<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> good<00:01:02.129> way<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:03.180> reach<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> milestone

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
would be a good way to reach a milestone

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.359 
would be a good way to reach a milestone
if<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> reach<00:01:06.330> 750<00:01:07.110> subscribers<00:01:07.770> it'll

if I when I reach 750 subscribers it'll

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.289 
if I when I reach 750 subscribers it'll
be<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> good<00:01:09.799> three<00:01:10.799> quarter<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> weigh<00:01:11.490> 2,000

here I'm going to go ahead and give you
guys<00:02:10.369> an<00:02:11.230> LED<00:02:12.230> system<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.930> not<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.440> really<00:02:15.740> big

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.400 

picture<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> think<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> great

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
picture but I think this is a great

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.970 
picture but I think this is a great
great<00:02:22.480> addition<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.720> refugium<00:02:24.440> if<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:24.830> have

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
great addition to a refugium if you have

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.930 
great addition to a refugium if you have
a<00:02:25.010> bigger<00:02:25.280> tank<00:02:25.580> or<00:02:26.560> if<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:28.370> any<00:02:28.580> smaller

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
a bigger tank or if you have any smaller

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.470 
a bigger tank or if you have any smaller
tank<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.390> you've<00:02:29.510> been<00:02:29.720> wanting<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.170> start

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
tank that you've been wanting to start

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.310 
tank that you've been wanting to start
now<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.750> LED<00:02:33.440> system<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:34.900> it's<00:02:35.900> pretty<00:02:36.080> good

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
now this LED system is it's pretty good

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.650 
now this LED system is it's pretty good
I<00:02:36.590> love<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.130> like<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.610> way<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.880> works<00:02:38.480> and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
I love I like the way it works and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.660 
I love I like the way it works and
everything<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:41.380> what<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.500> has<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.770> think<00:02:43.100> it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
everything and what it has I think it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.880 
everything and what it has I think it
has<00:02:43.990> like<00:02:45.340> 78<00:02:46.340> LEDs<00:02:47.030> which<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.570> insane<00:02:48.110> for

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
has like 78 LEDs which is insane for

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.070 
has like 78 LEDs which is insane for
this<00:02:49.100> little<00:02:49.550> type<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:49.970> fixture<00:02:50.180> there<00:02:50.690> one

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
this little type of fixture there one

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.650 
this little type of fixture there one
watt<00:02:51.290> LEDs<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:51.770> believe<00:02:52.250> but<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.300> pretty

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
watt LEDs I believe but it's pretty

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.450 
watt LEDs I believe but it's pretty
bright<00:02:53.900> if<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.170> have<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.320> smaller<00:02:54.710> system<00:02:55.100> or

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
bright if you have a smaller system or

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
bright if you have a smaller system or
if<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.670> want<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.880> grow<00:02:56.030> plants<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.420> your

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
it's going to be a bit harder to achieve

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.640 
it's going to be a bit harder to achieve
than<00:03:09.020> what<00:03:09.500> I've<00:03:09.650> been<00:03:09.800> doing<00:03:09.950> in<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.280> past<00:03:10.600> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
than what I've been doing in the past so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.710 
than what I've been doing in the past so

yeah just to keep you guys excited this
is<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:15.160> 24<00:03:16.160> in<00:03:17.060> 24<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.959> 30<00:03:18.170> inch<00:03:18.670> fixture<00:03:19.810> it's

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
is a 24 in 24 to 30 inch fixture it's

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.449 
is a 24 in 24 to 30 inch fixture it's
made<00:03:21.110> by<00:03:21.140> beans<00:03:21.590> work<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:23.680> it's<00:03:24.680> an<00:03:24.950> LED

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
made by beans work and it's an LED

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.910 
made by beans work and it's an LED
fixture<00:03:25.880> right<00:03:26.000> here<00:03:26.239> as<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.570> can<00:03:26.630> see<00:03:26.920> it's

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
fixture right here as you can see it's

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.110 
fixture right here as you can see it's
just<00:03:28.400> as<00:03:28.610> big<00:03:28.940> as<00:03:29.560> my<00:03:30.560> interactive<00:03:30.980> tank<00:03:31.340> so

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
just as big as my interactive tank so

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.910 
just as big as my interactive tank so
I'm<00:03:32.209> guessing<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.810> would<00:03:33.050> run<00:03:33.290> great<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:33.769> the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
I'm guessing this would run great on the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.100 
I'm guessing this would run great on the
stank<00:03:34.190> if<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.489> did<00:03:34.670> place<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.120> here<00:03:35.330> but<00:03:35.900> right

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
stank if I did place it here but right

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.110 
stank if I did place it here but right
now<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.260> have<00:03:36.500> t5's<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.519> if<00:03:37.610> you<00:03:37.700> have<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.850> similar

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
now I have t5's so if you have a similar

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.380 
now I have t5's so if you have a similar
tank<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.720> this<00:03:38.959> one<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:40.580> would<00:03:40.820> work<00:03:41.030> great<00:03:41.360> for

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
tank to this one it would work great for

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.780 
tank to this one it would work great for
