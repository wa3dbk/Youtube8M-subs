00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
package one of our ad campaigns we

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.040 
package one of our ad campaigns we
mentioned<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.670> fact<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:46.000> more<00:01:46.330> car<00:01:46.899> and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
mentioned the fact that more car and

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.230 
mentioned the fact that more car and
driver<00:01:47.289> employees<00:01:47.950> actually<00:01:48.310> spend<00:01:49.119> their

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
own money on BMW 3 Series than any other

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.450 
own money on BMW 3 Series than any other
car<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.929> I<00:01:52.960> think<00:01:53.289> when<00:01:53.860> they<00:01:53.950> get<00:01:54.069> a<00:01:54.100> chance<00:01:54.340> to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
car so I think when they get a chance to

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.190 
car so I think when they get a chance to
drive<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.759> new<00:01:54.880> x3<00:01:55.270> they'll<00:01:55.479> find<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.899> it

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
drive the new x3 they'll find that it

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.740 
drive the new x3 they'll find that it
has<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.710> same<00:01:56.979> sort<00:01:57.550> of<00:01:57.640> magic<00:01:58.030> mix<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.539> ride

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
has the same sort of magic mix of ride

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.380 
has the same sort of magic mix of ride
