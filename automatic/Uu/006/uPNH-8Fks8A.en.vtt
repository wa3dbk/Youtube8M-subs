00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
it just to make a point but she's not

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
going to be pushed around but it's at a

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.829 
going to be pushed around but it's at a
9ct<00:00:56.710> is<00:00:57.039> not<00:00:57.339> a<00:00:57.370> gray<00:00:57.789> hair<00:00:58.030> is<00:00:58.269> a<00:00:58.300> good<00:00:58.539> drawing

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
9ct is not a gray hair is a good drawing

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.930 
9ct is not a gray hair is a good drawing
hair<00:00:59.170> but<00:00:59.799> the<00:00:59.890> likelihood<00:01:00.159> is<00:01:00.610> she's<00:01:00.820> going

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
hair but the likelihood is she's going

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.469 
hair but the likelihood is she's going
to<00:01:01.059> miss<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.479> flop<00:01:02.940> trouble<00:01:03.940> I<00:01:04.089> think<00:01:04.390> a

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
to miss the flop trouble I think a

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.029 
to miss the flop trouble I think a
danger<00:01:04.809> for<00:01:04.839> her<00:01:05.110> Gators<00:01:05.530> if<00:01:05.680> she<00:01:05.770> gets<00:01:05.950> a

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
danger for her Gators if she gets a

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:12.920 
danger for her Gators if she gets a
little<00:01:06.159> piece<00:01:06.430> of<00:01:06.610> this<00:01:06.729> flop<00:01:07.030> like<00:01:07.600> one<00:01:07.869> pair
