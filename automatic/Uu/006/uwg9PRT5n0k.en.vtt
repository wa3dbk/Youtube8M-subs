00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
was a bargain hunting they did have a

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.640 
was a bargain hunting they did have a
return<00:05:15.390> policy<00:05:15.600> that<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.020> didn't<00:05:16.230> realize<00:05:16.500> it

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
return policy that I didn't realize it

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.190 
return policy that I didn't realize it
at<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.800> time<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.310> thought<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.580> could<00:05:17.820> fix<00:05:18.060> it<00:05:18.300> but

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
at the time I thought I could fix it but

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.140 
at the time I thought I could fix it but
this<00:05:19.410> this<00:05:19.740> is<00:05:20.430> puzzling<00:05:20.970> because<00:05:22.940> I've<00:05:23.940> got

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
this this is puzzling because I've got

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.380 
this this is puzzling because I've got
to<00:05:24.360> now<00:05:24.540> they<00:05:24.600> don't<00:05:24.900> work<00:05:26.090> sound<00:05:27.090> like<00:05:27.270> the

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
to now they don't work sound like the

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.890 
to now they don't work sound like the
engines<00:05:27.720> coming<00:05:28.080> on<00:05:29.060> but<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.330> light<00:05:30.570> you're

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
engines coming on but the light you're

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.120 
engines coming on but the light you're
supposed<00:05:31.140> to<00:05:31.200> be<00:05:31.320> a<00:05:31.350> light<00:05:31.530> coming<00:05:31.860> on<00:05:31.950> there

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
supposed to be a light coming on there

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.700 
supposed to be a light coming on there
so<00:05:32.460> my<00:05:33.180> recommendation<00:05:34.020> is<00:05:34.140> don't<00:05:34.380> buy<00:05:34.650> the

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
so my recommendation is don't buy the

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.070 
so my recommendation is don't buy the
stuff<00:05:35.100> at<00:05:35.280> Tuesday<00:05:35.670> morning<00:05:36.030> I'm<00:05:36.750> going<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:36.990> go
