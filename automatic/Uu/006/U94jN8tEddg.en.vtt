as you can see he's pulling himself
forward<00:02:24.140> eventually<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.739> will<00:02:25.860> be<00:02:25.890> all<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
forward eventually you will be all the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.130 
forward eventually you will be all the
way<00:02:26.700> forward<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.299> where<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:27.870> go<00:02:27.989> behind

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
way forward is where you can go behind

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.479 
way forward is where you can go behind
him<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:30.290> it'll<00:02:31.290> make<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.650> lot<00:02:31.799> easier<00:02:32.099> to

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
him and it'll make it a lot easier to

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:45.559 
him and it'll make it a lot easier to
kill<00:02:32.640> him<00:02:34.760> or<00:02:35.760> her<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.450> really<00:02:36.989> don't<00:02:37.170> know

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:03:00.229 

and<00:02:46.049> I<00:02:46.680> cannot<00:02:47.040> shoot<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.670> time<00:02:58.939> in<00:02:59.939> this

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
and I cannot shoot this time in this

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.990 
and I cannot shoot this time in this
flowering<00:03:00.900> right<00:03:01.140> here<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.769> not<00:03:02.040> exactly

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
flowering right here it's not exactly

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.099 
flowering right here it's not exactly
the<00:03:03.090> chief<00:03:03.420> part<00:03:03.689> yet<00:03:04.049> but<00:03:06.079> we're<00:03:07.079> definitely

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
the chief part yet but we're definitely

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.140 
the chief part yet but we're definitely
taking<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.980> lot<00:03:08.220> less<00:03:08.430> damage<00:03:08.670> than<00:03:08.909> we

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
taking a lot less damage than we

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:23.300 
taking a lot less damage than we
normally<00:03:09.299> would<00:03:09.780> be<00:03:21.829> also<00:03:22.829> you've<00:03:23.040> got<00:03:23.069> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
normally would be also you've got the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.429 
normally would be also you've got the
rocks<00:03:23.519> behind<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.480> can't<00:03:24.780> get<00:03:25.019> blown

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
rocks behind you so you can't get blown

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.619 
rocks behind you so you can't get blown
off<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.799> edge<00:03:25.950> over<00:03:26.519> there<00:03:26.819> which<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.299> one<00:03:27.569> of

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
off the edge over there which is one of

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.550 
off the edge over there which is one of
the<00:03:27.689> main<00:03:27.810> problems<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:29.549> as<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.659> can<00:03:30.750> see<00:03:30.989> he's

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
the main problems so as you can see he's

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.699 
the main problems so as you can see he's
pulling<00:03:31.889> himself<00:03:32.010> out<00:03:32.370> even<00:03:32.669> more<00:03:32.879> now<00:03:33.720> here's

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
pulling himself out even more now here's

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.379 
pulling himself out even more now here's
where<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.609> becomes<00:03:35.849> cheap<00:03:37.250> as<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.549> can<00:03:38.730> see<00:03:38.970> he

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
where it becomes cheap as you can see he

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.270 
where it becomes cheap as you can see he
can't<00:03:39.629> hit<00:03:39.780> us<00:03:39.840> anymore<00:03:40.139> and<00:03:40.590> you've<00:03:41.069> got<00:03:41.250> a

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
can't hit us anymore and you've got a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.580 
can't hit us anymore and you've got a
tentacle<00:03:42.060> photos<00:03:42.720> right<00:03:42.900> here<00:03:43.109> that<00:03:43.379> you<00:03:43.439> can

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
tentacle photos right here that you can

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.830 
tentacle photos right here that you can
just<00:03:43.620> wail<00:03:44.129> long<00:03:45.109> so<00:03:46.760> infinite<00:03:47.760> weapons<00:03:48.150> like

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
just wail long so infinite weapons like
