00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.100
 hello how about I am jose luis wheel and 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.070
 Welcome to the downtown circus channel 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.070
 of research cosmic wheel 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.070
 we start 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.059
 Y 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.620
 well today we are going to a UFO 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.620
 reddish color that we capture the first day 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.730
 January 2013 here we have the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.440
 start recording in infrared but 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.570
 we are changing it to the modality 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.290
 normal if we consider the colors 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.110
 what we have out there and is that the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.860
 object if they realize it is progressing and 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.600
 they are objects of reddish color is an object 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.280
 very real 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.000
 it looks like it's a little bit more of his 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.790
 little bit big and has a tonality 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.820
 reddish so I had to change the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.909
 normal mode the recording so that 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.720
 you see the tonality that I had 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.820
 this object there you see how they are going 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.470
 the stars in the background 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.150
 because the object is moving towards the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.870
 northeast 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.350
 it has a certain intense luminosity 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.440
 and it's an object with a reddish hue 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.630
 and important 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.580
 if you realize here the object like that 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.550
 we are almost losing it 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.980
 here practically we almost do not see it 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.710
 we made an approach and no longer what 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.190
 we can see change now in this 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.860
 moment to infrared and if they realize 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.710
 now the object looks like on a train 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.750
 red when changing here to this mode 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.750
 of the object now we continue to see it 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.049
 and continues to move exactly towards the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.450
 northeast 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.850
 there is passing some cables by the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.630
 part d 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.630
 above 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.750
 and the object advances very slowly and 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.000
 in a way a little too fast if you 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.140
 find here there are some objects that we 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.140
 they serve as reference 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.450
 to the roof 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.599
 and well here we already lost total and 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.430
 completely the object let's see it again 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.769
 the recording here we have it in 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.909
 infrared but because it was an object 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:03.560
 reddish changes the normal mode to 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.870
 being able to see the hue of the object was 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.209
 important to read that tonality see 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.650
 you are a total object and 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.650
 completely reddish 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.489
 good you 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:24.599
 and this object happened to bother the 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.599
 1st of January 2013 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.590
 they realize that it is that it is an object 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.750
 completely reddish with intense 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.990
 luminosity and is progressing rapidly 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.020
 the stars are staying 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.950
 very well back you as advancing from 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.950
 very fast way 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.880
 Its an object 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.690
 important impressive 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.300
 and in addition to a reddish hue 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.780
 here we lose it we change now to the 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.790
 infrared morality to be able 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.080
 capture the object and there we follow it 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.150
 appreciating here already in while red 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.060
 we see that the object is moving forward 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.579
 way 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.370
 fast to the northeast 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.239
 and that object we get it the first day 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.870
 January 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.540
 from 2013 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.100
 this is the first object that we capture 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.900
 really that day we get 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.120
 several but that's what they make us very 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.889
 important or the most important of those of 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.389
 we sing 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.340
 let's see let's also put 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.319
 some of the ones we saw also in this 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.560
 video but this one makes us very 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:50.999
 important good I am said solÃ­s wheel 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.999
 And until next time
