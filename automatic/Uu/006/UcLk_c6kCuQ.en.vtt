experience you've analog whenever hold
it<00:01:28.219> down<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.520> Holy<00:01:28.700> down<00:01:28.939> quite<00:01:29.179> a<00:01:29.209> lot<00:01:29.420> but<00:01:30.200> it

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
it down the Holy down quite a lot but it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.349 
it down the Holy down quite a lot but it
doesn't<00:01:30.560> go<00:01:30.709> wide<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.520> just<00:01:31.729> weird<00:01:31.939> it<00:01:32.179> adds

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
doesn't go wide it's just weird it adds

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.419 
doesn't go wide it's just weird it adds
more<00:01:32.569> power<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.109> that<00:01:33.229> shoot<00:01:33.590> which<00:01:34.279> is

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
more power and that shoot which is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:35.620 
more power and that shoot which is
strange<00:01:34.700> because<00:01:34.819> you<00:01:35.119> know<00:01:35.209> I'm<00:01:35.299> used<00:01:35.479> to<00:01:35.539> it

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
strange because you know I'm used to it
