00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.380 
laner and I think that's office because
I<00:00:16.859> don't<00:00:17.220> know<00:00:17.250> where<00:00:17.609> else<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.940> could<00:00:18.210> play

items<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:21.590> almost<00:00:22.590> always<00:00:22.980> start<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:23.820> just

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
items I almost always start with just

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.540 
items I almost always start with just
boots<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.869> three<00:00:25.019> hell<00:00:25.199> pots<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:26.220> some

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
boots and three hell pots in some

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.070 
boots and three hell pots in some
occasions<00:00:26.789> I'd<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.570> start<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
occasions I'd like to start with the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.810 
occasions I'd like to start with the
amplifying<00:00:28.590> tome<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> one<00:00:29.160> health<00:00:29.369> pot<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:29.789> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
amplifying tome and one health pot but I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.490 
amplifying tome and one health pot but I
don't<00:00:30.119> really<00:00:30.300> suggest<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.810> guys<00:00:30.990> doing<00:00:31.349> that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
don't really suggest you guys doing that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.220 
don't really suggest you guys doing that
because<00:00:32.510> actually<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:33.630> not<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:34.079> good

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
because actually it's not a really good

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.799 
because actually it's not a really good
idea<00:00:34.350> because<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.610> only<00:00:36.180> bite<00:00:36.420> when<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.690> know

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
idea because I only bite when I know

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.209 
idea because I only bite when I know
that<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.290> countering<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> enemy

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that I'm really countering the enemy

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.040 
that I'm really countering the enemy
champion<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:39.420> play<00:00:39.600> aggressive

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
champion so I can really play aggressive

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.110 
champion so I can really play aggressive
but<00:00:40.410> most<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.710> our<00:00:40.829> times<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.700> better<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
but most of our times it's better to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.580 
but most of our times it's better to
just<00:00:42.300> start<00:00:42.540> off<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:42.960> boots<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> three

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
