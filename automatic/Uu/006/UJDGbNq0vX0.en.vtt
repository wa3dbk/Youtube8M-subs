00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.970 
to again make sure that this is perfect
or<00:02:34.870> anything<00:02:35.050> because<00:02:35.350> we're<00:02:35.620> going<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.830> mix

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
mixture and then you could use a wooden

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.910 
mixture and then you could use a wooden
spoon<00:02:48.340> or<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:49.090> spatula<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:49.990> I<00:02:50.110> am<00:02:50.290> I'm<00:02:50.800> going
