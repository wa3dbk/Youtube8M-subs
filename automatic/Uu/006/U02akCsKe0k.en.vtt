00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
have a go of it on a quick go on crisis

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.850 
have a go of it on a quick go on crisis
before<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.530> didn't<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.830> very

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
before this one and I didn't do very

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.640 
before this one and I didn't do very
well<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> switched<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:25.290> ended<00:01:25.560> up

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
well so I switched and I ended up

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.670 
well so I switched and I ended up
getting<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.920> black<00:01:26.100> bear<00:01:26.280> doubt<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:27.650> but<00:01:28.650> i

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
getting a black bear doubt of it but i

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.230 
getting a black bear doubt of it but i
thought<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.250> map<00:01:29.700> may<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.000> bit<00:01:30.119> better

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
thought this map may be a bit better

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.590 
thought this map may be a bit better
than<00:01:30.420> crisis<00:01:31.759> there's<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.939> lot<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.360> long

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
than crisis there's a lot of long

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.060 
than crisis there's a lot of long
vantage<00:01:33.990> points<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:35.549> yeah<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.540> I

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
vantage points so yeah I got it on I

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.350
