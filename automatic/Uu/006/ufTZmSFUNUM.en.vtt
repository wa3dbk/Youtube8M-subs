00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.330

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.670

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.830
 as svt auditioned 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.780

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.950

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.500

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.950
 has decent weather to train 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.350
 Everything was done well before the end 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.240
 Torschusstraining The keyword has to be 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.039
 as much as possible or everything went 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.360
 next to it or a few times behind 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.470
 I have the hope to grab that 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.780
 many live because I do not have it 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.190
 only in receipt did not know page 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.560
 Torschusstraining is always fun 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.880
 Wanderbus so neat group of 15 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.610
 9 today was in the wool 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.440
 individual training on the plan has something 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.080
 Okay, it was okay last Sunday 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.640
 There are 7500 spectators in the stadium so many 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.590
 will not be on sunday 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.060
 but how does the preparation work how can 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.110
 you flip the switch before the for 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.090
 next compulsory game 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.470
 There is no switch to sed 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.250
 each to play is always the same, it 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.900
 goes by three points 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.060
 we have a big goal as 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.530
 Team and there were these three 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.840
 catch up points no matter if now for 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.390
 7800 or in front of 20 people 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.160
 always by three points with us in the league 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.590
 behavior of his player what to see what 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.750
 the environment concerns with a good one 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.840
 scenery derby unfortunately not won but 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.340
 how can you go back as a team that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.620
 was the most important thing for the moral 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.970
 the point was also damn important me 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.430
 believe that the game is five to ten 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.150
 For a few minutes , I claim now 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.530
 Just let's have a gate 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.180
 but that would have been so good 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.620
 in Football 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.030
 As I said the scenery is us 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.049
 actually is always nice of the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.430
 great scenery to play but im 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.329
 end, it does not matter what the end of 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.690
 day goes by three points 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.549
 thanks to lukas pesek 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.660
 our head coach thomas richter thomas 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.060
 There was just the individual training 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.700
 be hydrogen today on Friday evening 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.470
 impression now of the guys just the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.760
 guys are thinking the whole week already 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.790
 I once with great enthusiasm at the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.790
 Thing 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.340
 I just hope that 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.049
 catching up from last sunday against 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.230
 velbert us again tailwind are for 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.239
 the next games and 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.640
 what the workouts went on what 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.260
 the training achievements and the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.060
 Training attitude I am 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.250
 so far under satisfied said that 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.989
 race to catch up, it was who after 123 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.159
 many spectators at least thought that 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.670
 nothing will be the team anymore 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.049
 came back 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.370
 maybe that has done what in 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.390
 sonsbeck did not succeed 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.980
 to achieve compensation 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.489
 How did you work the game up ? 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.470
 for weeks now anyway, as always, are the 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.040
 on monday in the first training after 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.769
 talked about the game and then 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.030
 it is also handled for us and then 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.360
 Let's look forward to the next 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.340
 game 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.470
 that's sunday at chapel-erftag 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.959
 why is there the first dutiful victory? 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.980
 in 2015 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.810
 we will do everything in any case it 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.540
 put the three points with 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.430
 to take wuppertal that's clear 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.280
 we go in every game and want 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.840
 First of all, an extremely good one 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.750
 deliver performance that every player 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.950
 also somewhere at its limit are 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.280
 only people do not succeed 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.859
 always 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.510
 but we start from the attitude of 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.700
 As a matter of fact, we go every game like this 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.530
 that we then as the winner 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.780
 want to leave place I sat like that 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.880
 Coach when you notice the team 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.870
 comes back from the 1 3 a 3 3 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.380
 to achieve 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.669
 what does a pulse have at the moment i do 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.630
 I have to differentiate a bit like that 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.419
 I have to be on one side of me 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.639
 of course emotionally extremely extreme 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.080
 players also in there on the other side 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.660
 of course I have to be clear-headed too 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.430
 Keep me thinking about it 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.990
 playing situation what else do we have for 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.340
 possibilities what else can we do 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.650
 how can you possibly change 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.130
 still change 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.710
 the decisive factor was that the team 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.110
 has proven an absolutely great moral 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.310
 that they never left even after the 1 3 residue 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.110
 she has always given up 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.940
 believed that something is still possible and that 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.750
 then worked out that is of course all the more 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.560
 happier and I think everyone knows 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.970
 that's nothing new 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.979
 football games were when the referee 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.360
 whistle and decisive is easy 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.240
 that the overpass in the square 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.820
 do everything to do it then 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.320
 optimal still out to three points on 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.320
 Sunday are thanks thomas please like
