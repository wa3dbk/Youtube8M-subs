00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
what would things be like without that

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.160 
what would things be like without that
when<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.090> left<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.390> show<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:13.780> mean<00:02:13.900> did<00:02:14.140> you

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
when you left the show I mean did you

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.380 
when you left the show I mean did you
want<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.560> filter<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.250> Star<00:02:15.430> Trek<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.940> try

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
want to filter out the Star Trek and try

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.710 
want to filter out the Star Trek and try
to<00:02:16.450> move<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:16.900> from<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.110> well

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
to move on from that well

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.140

when<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:17.900> left<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.350> show<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.950> figured<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.940> my

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
when I left the show I figured that my

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.850 
when I left the show I figured that my
role<00:02:20.420> would<00:02:20.570> be<00:02:20.630> reduced<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> recurring

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
role would be reduced to a recurring

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.120 
role would be reduced to a recurring
role<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.150> would<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:23.750> be<00:02:23.990> able<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.440> go

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
role and that I would then be able to go

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.710 
role and that I would then be able to go
do<00:02:25.340> some<00:02:25.580> movies<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.150> would<00:02:26.300> be<00:02:26.390> able<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.600> go

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
do some movies and I would be able to go

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.880 
do some movies and I would be able to go
to<00:02:26.810> school<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.260> I'd<00:02:27.350> be<00:02:27.440> able<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.590> do<00:02:27.710> some

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
to school and I'd be able to do some

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.770 
to school and I'd be able to do some
other<00:02:27.950> things<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.430> myself<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.240> was<00:02:29.360> 18

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
other things with myself and I was 18

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.230 
other things with myself and I was 18
