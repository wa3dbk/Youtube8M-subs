trunk which will become this chest piece
there<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> head<00:00:54.949> hole<00:00:55.949> now

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
there there we have the head hole now

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
there there we have the head hole now
before<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.440> fall<00:00:58.649> down<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.039> arms<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.969> need

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
before we fall down the arms we need

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.640 
before we fall down the arms we need
separate<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.820> part<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.409> hood<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
separate here this part up the hood of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.310 
separate here this part up the hood of
the<00:01:05.010> car<00:01:05.720> pull<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:09.200> like<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:11.360> then<00:01:12.360> pull<00:01:13.290> down

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the car pull up like so then pull down

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.240 
the car pull up like so then pull down
and<00:01:13.920> rotate<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.909> side<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.830> there

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and rotate to the side so you have there

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.350 
and rotate to the side so you have there
both<00:01:18.240> legs<00:01:18.920> also<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
both legs also we have here and this

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.789 
both legs also we have here and this
little<00:01:21.689> panel<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.439> trying<00:01:22.710> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
little panel which we are trying to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.830 
little panel which we are trying to
become<00:01:23.100> his<00:01:23.310> he'll<00:01:23.580> talking<00:01:24.000> chicken<00:01:24.390> stand

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
become his he'll talking chicken stand

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.280 
become his he'll talking chicken stand
up<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:26.100> pull<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> arms<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:27.540> place<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
up and pull the arms into place and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.090 
up and pull the arms into place and
there<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:29.570> sides<00:01:30.570> weight<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.439> robot<00:01:32.070> mode

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
there we have sides weight in robot mode

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.870 
there we have sides weight in robot mode
now<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.340> color<00:01:35.549> scheme<00:01:35.759> is

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
now you can see the color scheme is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.719 
now you can see the color scheme is
basically<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.329> same<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.340> see<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.400> have

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
basically the same you can see we have

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.560 
basically the same you can see we have
here<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.600> arm<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:41.549> product<00:01:41.970> blade<00:01:42.299> of

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
here the arm and the product blade of

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.020 
here the arm and the product blade of
size<00:01:42.899> way<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.509> see<00:01:45.659> some<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.860> fake<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
size way you can see some and fake it I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.020 
size way you can see some and fake it I
just<00:01:48.090> move<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.600> right<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.950> gray<00:01:50.250> let's

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
just move it right there in gray let's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.560 
just move it right there in gray let's
represent<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.689> tires<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.939> on<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> original

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
represent the tires that on the original

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.480 
represent the tires that on the original
looks<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:55.049> he's<00:01:55.610> feet<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:58.040> so<00:01:59.040> there

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
looks are he's feet actually so there

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.760 
looks are he's feet actually so there
you<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.030> transformer<00:02:01.020> very<00:02:01.200> to-the-point

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you have a transformer very to-the-point

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.060 
you have a transformer very to-the-point
