thing you can do is after you press left
to<00:03:19.900> right<00:03:20.110> actually<00:03:20.800> just<00:03:20.950> drive<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.640> left

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
to right actually just drive the left

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.990 
to right actually just drive the left
hand<00:03:22.180> debates<00:03:22.690> as<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.050> base<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.400> base<00:03:24.700> and

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
hand debates as the base so base and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.660 
hand debates as the base so base and
right<00:03:25.150> hand<00:03:25.450> one<00:03:25.780> then<00:03:26.650> after<00:03:26.980> my<00:03:27.100> head<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.430> up

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.290 
song keep repeating the same course
several<00:04:13.690> times<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.670> then<00:04:15.670> after<00:04:15.940> that<00:04:15.970> we

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
several times and then after that we

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.180 
several times and then after that we
have<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.480> course<00:04:16.870> where<00:04:17.170> we<00:04:17.230> have<00:04:17.620> exactly<00:04:18.100> the

a<00:04:20.230> little<00:04:20.320> bit<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:20.650> way<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.739> playing<00:04:21.100> you<00:04:21.730> can

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
a little bit of way of playing you can

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.540 
a little bit of way of playing you can
maybe<00:04:22.180> try<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.720> way<00:04:23.230> we<00:04:23.530> did<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:24.010> verse<00:04:24.220> or

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
maybe try the way we did the verse or

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:40.929 
maybe try the way we did the verse or
try<00:04:24.910> these

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.339 

also<00:04:41.939> I<00:04:42.000> place<00:04:42.270> my<00:04:42.419> left<00:04:42.629> hand<00:04:42.780> alone<00:04:43.080> on<00:04:43.259> the
