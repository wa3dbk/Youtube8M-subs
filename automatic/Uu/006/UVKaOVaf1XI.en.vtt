00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
red but I'm also gonna be doing

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.350 
red but I'm also gonna be doing
something<00:00:10.800> else<00:00:10.920> along<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.610> showing<00:00:12.179> you

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
something else along with it showing you

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.320 
something else along with it showing you
exactly<00:00:12.750> how<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> around<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.559> correct<00:00:13.830> way

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
exactly how to around the correct way

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.790 
exactly how to around the correct way
because<00:00:15.330> when<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.780> try<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.929> round<00:00:16.109> open<00:00:16.289> areas

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
because when you try to round open areas

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529 
because when you try to round open areas
you<00:00:17.220> usually<00:00:17.310> don't<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> good<00:00:18.150> look<00:00:18.300> at<00:00:18.449> his

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
you usually don't get a good look at his

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.970 
you usually don't get a good look at his
face<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.140> your<00:00:19.289> characters<00:00:19.650> blocking

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
face because your characters blocking

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.410 
face because your characters blocking
them<00:00:20.070> off<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.090> look<00:00:21.210> like<00:00:21.240> when

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
them off this is what you look like when

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.370 
them off this is what you look like when
you<00:00:21.510> run<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:22.289> most<00:00:22.859> characters<00:00:24.140> yeah<00:00:25.140> you're

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
you run with most characters yeah you're

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.259 
you run with most characters yeah you're
Michael<00:00:25.650> Jack's<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.220> then<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.390> moonwalk

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
now the game sees news on a bike okay

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.450 
now the game sees news on a bike okay
technically<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> bike<00:01:26.160> but<00:01:26.340> you're

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
technically you're on a bike but you're

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.609 
technically you're on a bike but you're
running<00:01:26.550> super<00:01:26.790> fast<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> thing<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
running super fast but the thing is

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.560 
running super fast but the thing is
still<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.830> is<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.130> ideal<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:30.240> here's<00:01:30.479> what

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
still this is not ideal so here's what

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350 
still this is not ideal so here's what
you<00:01:30.660> do<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.229> make<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.470> even<00:01:31.590> more<00:01:31.740> realistic<00:01:32.360> go

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you do to make it even more realistic go

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.520 
you do to make it even more realistic go
into<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.660> of<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:33.810> little<00:01:33.960> houses<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.500> see

now<00:01:40.410> watch<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.740> I'm<00:01:40.890> gonna<00:01:40.979> experiment

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
now watch this I'm gonna experiment

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.090 
now watch this I'm gonna experiment
through<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.580> around<00:01:42.380> this<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.440> like<00:01:43.770> super

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
through go around this is like super

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:59.780 
through go around this is like super
fastness<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:47.330> super<00:01:48.330> speed<00:01:58.400> it's<00:01:59.400> not<00:01:59.460> much

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
fastness and super speed it's not much

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.730 
fastness and super speed it's not much
but<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.120> know<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.780> better<00:02:00.960> than<00:02:01.140> gliding

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
but you know it's better than gliding

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:12.620
