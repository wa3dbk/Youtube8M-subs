00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.150
 and what happens friends of youtube a video 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.520
 where I will explain how 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.070
 install the mods apocalypse pack 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.980
 craft where he is participating and 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.140
 vegeta 777 and very direct in this new 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.480
 series that ending if you want 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.939
 the mods should only follow these steps 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.949
 The first thing I must remember is that in 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.630
 Minecraft must be 100% virgin without 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.819
 no kind of mode this means that 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.829
 you if you have some mobile 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:30.890
 installed on your sleeve should 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.989
 eliminate it to be effective 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.519
 this in these mods in your minecraft 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.170
 remember that this is for the version 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.480
 1.6 point 2 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.300
 ok after ensuring that your minecraft 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.359
 to 100% without any mode what they have to 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.649
 to do is open the apocalypse folder 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.300
 minecraft pack of amounts that I'm going to 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.370
 leave in the description open it and they 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.519
 will come two folders in this flesh in 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.800
 this folder even if it opens in the folder 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.710
 mods are going to double click on minecraft 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.409
 force installer and they will give it in 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.839
 install in this the customer giving in 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.110
 accept is going to tell you that it is complete 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.850
 the installation will open the minecraft 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.850
 this is in order to create the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.670
 folders 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.510
 this little picture is going to appear 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.640
 put your passwords only 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.220
 and come in play 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.520
 after doing this they give it again in 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.170
 play and it will open them in minecraft now 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.850

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.850
 modes loaded in error

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.849

 how it is solved do not worry 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.349
 you're out of this video those who record 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.290
 although this conflict list we're going 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.060
 to close this we are going to close the one that 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.599
 all complete we are going to open a 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.599
 take in kraft 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.660
 for running percent app data by 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.580
 we opened the point minecraft we're going 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.550
 to the folder that says confine 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.780
 let's open the one that says do not create your the 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:19.180
 folder do not create your again we open the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.180
 am11 global but we will do it with him 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.959
 then all these things will appear 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.550
 for example this so you can see them 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.400
 your 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:33.470
 and here where it says 200 will change 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:37.130
 for 800 ok 201 they will change it for 800 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.160
 1 and finally 202 they will change it for 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.530
 800 2 ok after doing this we are going to 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.370
 give in save after it is saved 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.290
 let's reopen the minecraft and 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.290
 You will see that this error has been fixed 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.800
 let's see what I was going to say 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.680
 is that this video harassing with the 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:05.470
 microphone flowed and I'm editing with 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.970
 audio to audio audio cs6 from adobe to 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.580
 see you will tell me how is it heard 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.650
 according to God he listens crystal clear perfect for 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.970
 me just a little background noise that 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.410
 does my computer but I do not know if 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.050
 they listen to the truth now because I'm going to 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.940
 put background music that after 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.580
 this active is going to tell you 20 loves 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.380
 loaded 20 activated modes you 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.380
 you know the minecraft 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.910
 is loading the world is loading 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.670
 so everything will go perfectly as 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.810
 they see he did not tell them there was a 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.610
 error of ides already 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.860
 without further repairing it 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.569
 and supposedly everything should go to the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.240
 perfection 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:55.419
 how they see program 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.620
 to ask for mouth not healthy monsters here 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.620
 are all the mods 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.180
 because I'm recording with Asian charm and 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.340
 it's not a good program to record in 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.900
 minecraft and ccm 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.180
 but it was for recording do not worry 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.939
 you and check all the new ones that 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.919
 have and all they have to do 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.840
 next to install the pack of 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.240
 textures and you know if you want you can 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.070
 go just leave your like 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.510
 that was film they killed 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.490
 worry 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.500
 only this is in case you do not know how 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.500
 install the texture pack that you use 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.120
 because in the folder that I left them 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.610
 that will download will not open it and go 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.639
 to measure the one that says pac text and it's going to 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.820
 come an axiom space word time of 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:53.870
 kraft 512 m 016 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.630
 in main that we are going to give him options 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.920
 pax paper group folders and has it in 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:04.550
 Spanish to open music pack but 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.240
 since then they pass the textures pack here 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:12.460
 they close us select them and with this 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.460
 our installation is ready 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.120
 to see if it does not pete either 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:21.849
 all crowd 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.530
 like for 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.000

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.450
 leave your lex and they liked this video 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.460

 download it and be easier ok 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.460
 I believe that 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.630
 they select the one from this and although we 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.750
 we see in the next see you
