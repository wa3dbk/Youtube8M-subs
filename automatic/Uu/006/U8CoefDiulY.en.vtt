beautiful
and<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.760> that's<00:03:00.970> what<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.150> think<00:03:01.300> they're

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
and that that's what I think they're

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.090 
and that that's what I think they're
gonna<00:03:01.510> do<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.900> guard<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.350> basically<00:03:02.950> what

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
gonna do is I guard and basically what

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.050 
gonna do is I guard and basically what
you're<00:03:03.280> supposed<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.550> do<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.790> supposed<00:03:03.970> to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you're supposed to do is supposed to

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.460 
you're supposed to do is supposed to
stop<00:03:04.270> them<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:05.620> think<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:06.390> possibly

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
stop them and I think that possibly

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.690 
stop them and I think that possibly
possibly<00:03:08.470> don't<00:03:09.010> call<00:03:09.130> me<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.460> with<00:03:09.640> the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
possibly don't call me on this with the

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.040 
possibly don't call me on this with the
next<00:03:09.970> game<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.500> person<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.760> were<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.210> x

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
next game the person that you were and x

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.170 
next game the person that you were and x
and<00:03:14.260> y<00:03:14.440> is<00:03:14.500> going<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.980> come<00:03:15.220> back<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.640> stop

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
and y is going to come back and stop

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.760 
and y is going to come back and stop
them<00:03:16.420> with<00:03:16.810> their<00:03:17.020> legendary<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.650> they

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
them with their legendary that they

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.450 
them with their legendary that they
captured<00:03:18.190> probably<00:03:19.800> probably<00:03:20.800> xerneas<00:03:21.250> or

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
captured probably probably xerneas or

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.370 
captured probably probably xerneas or
probably<00:03:21.670> that's<00:03:21.910> all<00:03:22.120> now<00:03:22.660> when<00:03:22.960> I<00:03:22.990> think

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
probably that's all now when I think

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.810 
probably that's all now when I think
this<00:03:23.560> I'm<00:03:23.770> also<00:03:23.920> thinking<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.400> home<00:03:24.640> if

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
this I'm also thinking that home if

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.950 
this I'm also thinking that home if
that's<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.120> case<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.480> I'm<00:03:25.570> pretty<00:03:25.810> much

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
that's the case and I'm pretty much

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.420 
that's the case and I'm pretty much
saying<00:03:26.110> it's<00:03:26.230> gonna<00:03:26.320> be<00:03:26.500> like<00:03:26.680> black<00:03:27.400> and

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
saying it's gonna be like black and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.370 
saying it's gonna be like black and
white<00:03:27.580> too<00:03:27.820> so<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.150> going<00:03:28.240> to<00:03:28.300> be<00:03:28.360> like<00:03:28.630> x<00:03:29.110> and

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
white too so it's going to be like x and

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.550 
white too so it's going to be like x and
y<00:03:29.470> 2<00:03:29.530> but<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.430> kind<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:30.970> wanted<00:03:31.210> to<00:03:31.300> be<00:03:31.450> Pokemon<00:03:32.260> Z

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
y 2 but I kind of wanted to be Pokemon Z

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.830 
y 2 but I kind of wanted to be Pokemon Z
and<00:03:32.830> not<00:03:33.220> pokemon<00:03:33.760> x<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.090> y<00:03:34.180> 2<00:03:34.240> because<00:03:34.690> I

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
and not pokemon x and y 2 because I

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.970 
and not pokemon x and y 2 because I
don't<00:03:35.020> know<00:03:35.080> it's<00:03:35.500> supposed<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.740> be<00:03:35.860> all<00:03:35.950> about
