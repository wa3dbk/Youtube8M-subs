essence of Hong Kong their blue LEDs
there<00:05:27.570> we<00:05:28.470> love<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.800> old<00:05:28.980> one<00:05:29.190> because<00:05:29.370> for

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
there we love the old one because for

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.860 
there we love the old one because for
money<00:05:30.419> you<00:05:31.110> can<00:05:31.320> beat<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.980> image<00:05:32.190> quality

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
money you can beat the image quality

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.020 
money you can beat the image quality
most<00:05:33.870> amateurs<00:05:34.350> even<00:05:34.650> wide<00:05:34.860> open<00:05:35.220> it's<00:05:35.700> pretty

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
most amateurs even wide open it's pretty

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.010 
most amateurs even wide open it's pretty
good<00:05:36.270> bulky<00:05:37.110> not<00:05:37.380> bad<00:05:38.340> too<00:05:38.700> but<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.810> thing<00:05:39.990> is

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
good bulky not bad too but the thing is

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.930 
good bulky not bad too but the thing is
with<00:05:40.260> this<00:05:40.350> lens<00:05:40.590> you're<00:05:41.070> now<00:05:41.220> paying<00:05:41.550> more

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
with this lens you're now paying more

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.310 
with this lens you're now paying more
for<00:05:42.330> essentially<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.320> same<00:05:43.410> thing<00:05:45.020> so<00:05:46.020> even

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
for essentially the same thing so even

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.730 
for essentially the same thing so even
though<00:05:46.440> optically<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.120> same<00:05:48.650> so<00:05:49.650> in

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
though optically it is the same so in

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.920 
though optically it is the same so in
terms<00:05:49.979> of<00:05:50.070> images<00:05:50.700> you<00:05:51.090> get<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.360> same<00:05:51.600> stuff

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
terms of images you get the same stuff

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.840 
terms of images you get the same stuff
the<00:05:52.470> old<00:05:52.590> lens<00:05:52.830> but<00:05:53.820> you<00:05:53.940> pay<00:05:54.150> more<00:05:54.389> just<00:05:55.080> for<00:05:55.350> a

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
the old lens but you pay more just for a

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.659 
the old lens but you pay more just for a
different<00:05:56.850> autofocus<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:58.650> also<00:05:59.010> a<00:05:59.280> better

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
different autofocus and also a better

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:00.110 
different autofocus and also a better
body

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
body

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.360 
body
seeing<00:06:00.810> as<00:06:01.020> it's<00:06:01.200> essentially<00:06:01.919> about<00:06:02.070> a<00:06:02.130> new

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
seeing as it's essentially about a new

seeing as it's essentially about a new
focusing<00:06:03.000> within<00:06:03.360> is<00:06:03.660> there<00:06:04.290> any<00:06:04.590> actual

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
focusing within is there any actual

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.950 
focusing within is there any actual
improvement<00:06:05.940> actually<00:06:07.160> focus<00:06:08.160> and<00:06:08.400> printing

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.210 

focus<00:06:11.650> on<00:06:11.740> the<00:06:11.830> Bell<00:06:13.680> hmm<00:06:14.770> slight<00:06:15.190> difference

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
focus on the Bell hmm slight difference

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.879 
focus on the Bell hmm slight difference
new<00:06:16.180> one<00:06:16.330> seems<00:06:16.630> a<00:06:16.750> tad<00:06:16.960> quicker<00:06:17.199> the<00:06:17.620> old<00:06:17.740> one

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
new one seems a tad quicker the old one

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.560 
new one seems a tad quicker the old one
has<00:06:18.040> a<00:06:18.070> bit<00:06:18.370> of<00:06:18.400> last<00:06:18.729> split-second

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
has a bit of last split-second

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.350 
has a bit of last split-second
indecisiveness<00:06:20.350> in<00:06:20.830> practice<00:06:21.490> not<00:06:21.880> hugely

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
indecisiveness in practice not hugely

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.580 
indecisiveness in practice not hugely
significant<00:06:23.729> so<00:06:24.729> yeah<00:06:25.180> it<00:06:25.930> is<00:06:25.990> the<00:06:26.380> more

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
significant so yeah it is the more

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.640 
significant so yeah it is the more
expensive<00:06:26.620> lens<00:06:27.370> that's<00:06:28.210> the<00:06:28.419> old<00:06:28.600> one<00:06:28.810> but

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
expensive lens that's the old one but

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.560 
expensive lens that's the old one but
it's<00:06:29.860> not<00:06:30.039> going<00:06:30.220> to<00:06:30.280> give<00:06:30.430> better<00:06:30.729> shots

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
it's not going to give better shots

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.900 
it's not going to give better shots
it<00:06:32.229> does<00:06:32.440> feel<00:06:32.710> better<00:06:32.919> it<00:06:33.430> feels<00:06:33.699> like<00:06:33.880> a

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
it does feel better it feels like a

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.240 
it does feel better it feels like a
better<00:06:34.150> built<00:06:34.479> lens<00:06:34.660> feels<00:06:35.530> like<00:06:35.770> it's<00:06:36.009> made

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
better built lens feels like it's made

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.330 
better built lens feels like it's made
for<00:06:36.550> body<00:06:36.820> like<00:06:37.120> this<00:06:37.770> but<00:06:38.770> when<00:06:38.919> you<00:06:39.009> spend<00:06:39.220> a

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
for body like this but when you spend a

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.270 
for body like this but when you spend a
bit<00:06:39.460> more<00:06:39.490> you<00:06:40.060> expect<00:06:40.509> more<00:06:40.949> let's<00:06:41.949> be<00:06:42.070> honest

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
bit more you expect more let's be honest

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.170 
bit more you expect more let's be honest
you<00:06:42.910> don't<00:06:43.030> really<00:06:43.389> get<00:06:43.690> more<00:06:43.900> of<00:06:44.020> this<00:06:45.180> why

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
you don't really get more of this why

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.600 
you don't really get more of this why
not<00:06:46.210> just<00:06:46.360> go<00:06:46.600> the<00:06:46.750> old<00:06:46.870> one<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.889> old<00:06:48.039> one<00:06:48.190> is<00:06:48.550> a

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
not just go the old one the old one is a

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.029 
not just go the old one the old one is a
classic<00:06:49.300> and<00:06:49.539> in<00:06:49.900> some<00:06:50.080> ways<00:06:50.260> has<00:06:50.650> a<00:06:50.680> tacky

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 
classic and in some ways has a tacky

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.060 
classic and in some ways has a tacky
cheap<00:06:51.639> charm<00:06:52.180> it's<00:06:52.960> great<00:06:53.260> because<00:06:53.620> it<00:06:53.740> looked

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
cheap charm it's great because it looked

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.390 
cheap charm it's great because it looked
crap<00:06:54.400> but<00:06:54.699> performed<00:06:55.240> amazingly<00:06:55.889> thus<00:06:56.889> there

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
crap but performed amazingly thus there

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.969 
crap but performed amazingly thus there
are<00:06:57.520> high<00:06:57.820> expectations<00:06:58.780> with<00:06:58.900> a<00:06:58.960> new<00:06:59.229> one<00:06:59.410> it

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
are high expectations with a new one it

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.490 
are high expectations with a new one it
costs<00:07:00.220> more<00:07:00.669> looks<00:07:01.330> better<00:07:01.570> so<00:07:01.900> should<00:07:02.470> be

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
costs more looks better so should be

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.770 
costs more looks better so should be
better<00:07:02.919> but<00:07:03.729> it's<00:07:03.940> the<00:07:04.090> same

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
better but it's the same

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.439 
better but it's the same
the<00:07:05.320> focus<00:07:05.710> is<00:07:05.830> nice<00:07:06.220> but<00:07:06.849> for<00:07:07.060> manual

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.449 
the focus is nice but for manual
