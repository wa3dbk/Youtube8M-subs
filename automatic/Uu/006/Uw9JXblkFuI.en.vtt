00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
kind of like a diagonal from where I'm

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.320 
kind of like a diagonal from where I'm
starting<00:01:53.009> because<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.460> want<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.670> end<00:01:53.820> up<00:01:53.940> at<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
starting because I want to end up at the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.770 
starting because I want to end up at the
back<00:01:54.660> of<00:01:54.690> my<00:01:55.140> head<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.380> pretty<00:01:56.040> low<00:01:56.369> almost<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
back of my head and pretty low almost to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:07.719 
back of my head and pretty low almost to
my<00:01:57.930> neck<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.550> keep<00:01:59.790> grabbing

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.400 

and<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.420> also<00:02:08.780> does<00:02:08.959> not<00:02:09.080> have<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.319> be

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
and this also does not have to be

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:19.920 
and this also does not have to be
perfect<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.190> more<00:02:10.640> at<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:11.060> Messier<00:02:11.900> look

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.530 

so<00:02:20.560> once<00:02:20.799> I<00:02:21.040> get<00:02:21.099> to<00:02:21.400> about<00:02:21.489> right<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.299> I'm

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
so once I get to about right there I'm

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.990 
so once I get to about right there I'm
just<00:02:22.689> going<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.049> tie<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.040> off<00:02:24.220> with<00:02:24.400> one<00:02:24.909> of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
just going to tie it off with one of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.330

those<00:02:25.090> clear<00:02:25.540> elastics

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.699 

and<00:02:33.520> then<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.209> pull<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.660> small<00:02:35.260> piece<00:02:35.530> out

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
and then just pull a small piece out

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.250 
and then just pull a small piece out
about<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.910> big<00:02:37.240> just<00:02:37.540> by<00:02:37.660> my<00:02:37.810> ear<00:02:38.020> just
