00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
does not like the audience Shh he does

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.660 
does not like the audience Shh he does
not<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.470> hold<00:02:25.680> hands<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.160> that's<00:02:26.490> not

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
not like to hold hands so that's not

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.790 
not like to hold hands so that's not
possible<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.510> leash<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.140> only<00:02:28.380> other

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
possible so the leash is the only other

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.150 
possible so the leash is the only other
alternative<00:02:28.970> alternative<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:31.230> letting<00:02:31.860> him

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
alternative alternative to letting him

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.970 
alternative alternative to letting him
have<00:02:32.340> his<00:02:32.490> own<00:02:32.520> freedom<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.420> walk<00:02:33.570> around<00:02:33.990> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
have his own freedom to walk around the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.530 
have his own freedom to walk around the
only<00:02:35.160> other<00:02:35.280> options<00:02:35.730> would<00:02:35.850> be<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.240> bring<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
only other options would be to bring the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.660 
only other options would be to bring the
pack<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.900> play<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.290> stick<00:02:37.620> him<00:02:37.740> in<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.310> play

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
pack and play and stick him in a play

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.310 
pack and play and stick him in a play
pin<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:38.970> whole<00:02:39.570> hour<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.900> half<00:02:40.020> were<00:02:40.140> there

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
pin the whole hour and half were there

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.010 
pin the whole hour and half were there
and<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.740> think<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.640> worse<00:02:42.360> than<00:02:42.630> anything

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
and I think that is worse than anything

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.960 
and I think that is worse than anything
else<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.530> mean<00:02:43.770> it's<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.220> Packer<00:02:44.730> plays

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
else I mean it's not like Packer plays

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.030 
else I mean it's not like Packer plays
bad<00:02:45.210> but<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.810> think<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.560> even<00:02:46.770> better<00:02:46.860> than

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
bad but I think this is even better than

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.070 
bad but I think this is even better than
a<00:02:47.160> pack<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.520> play<00:02:47.580> for<00:02:48.210> one<00:02:48.420> we're<00:02:48.870> giving

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
a pack and play for one we're giving

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.420 
a pack and play for one we're giving
them<00:02:49.140> freedom<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.500> walk<00:02:49.620> around<00:02:49.800> in<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.070> score

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
them freedom to walk around in the score

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.880 
them freedom to walk around in the score
while<00:02:51.420> knowing<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.050> he's<00:02:52.230> safe<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.710> within

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
while knowing that he's safe and within

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.200 
while knowing that he's safe and within
a<00:02:53.150> three-foot<00:02:54.150> radius<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.750> me<00:02:55.550> um-hmm<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:57.180> I

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
a three-foot radius of me um-hmm so I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.380 
a three-foot radius of me um-hmm so I
don't<00:02:57.450> understand<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.380> why<00:02:59.040> people<00:02:59.730> feel<00:03:00.180> so

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
don't understand all why people feel so

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.810 
don't understand all why people feel so
strongly<00:03:00.750> against<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.710> I<00:03:02.010> think<00:03:02.550> it's<00:03:02.640> such<00:03:02.790> a

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
strongly against it I think it's such a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.660 
strongly against it I think it's such a
great<00:03:03.060> product<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.720> think<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.050> such<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:05.070> great

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
great product I think it's such a great

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.640 
great product I think it's such a great

it<00:03:20.520> excessively<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.330> think<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:21.690> wrong<00:03:21.870> to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
it excessively and I think it's wrong to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.810 
it excessively and I think it's wrong to
probably<00:03:22.440> use<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.770> excessively<00:03:23.070> but<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.610> think

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
probably use it excessively but I think

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.400 
probably use it excessively but I think
in<00:03:23.940> certain<00:03:24.120> situations<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.900> my<00:03:25.140> daughter's

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
in certain situations like my daughter's

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.930 
in certain situations like my daughter's
soccer<00:03:25.590> game<00:03:25.740> I<00:03:26.130> don't<00:03:26.520> think<00:03:26.550> there's<00:03:26.790> any

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
soccer game I don't think there's any

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.550 
soccer game I don't think there's any
other<00:03:26.970> options<00:03:27.570> for<00:03:27.780> us<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:28.050> can't<00:03:28.260> carry<00:03:28.440> him

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
other options for us we can't carry him

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.230 
other options for us we can't carry him
around<00:03:28.740> all<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.130> time<00:03:29.160> we<00:03:29.760> can't<00:03:29.970> keep<00:03:30.120> them

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
around all the time we can't keep them

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.460 
around all the time we can't keep them
in<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.420> stroller<00:03:30.630> because<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.230> field

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
in a stroller because it's in the field

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.280 
in a stroller because it's in the field
we<00:03:32.160> can't<00:03:32.460> um<00:03:32.910> put<00:03:33.660> them<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.840> pack<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.080> play

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
we can't um put them in a pack and play

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.660 
we can't um put them in a pack and play
because<00:03:34.620> that's<00:03:34.770> just<00:03:34.860> wrong<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.460> stick<00:03:35.610> him

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
because that's just wrong just stick him

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.250 
because that's just wrong just stick him
in<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.850> pack<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.030> play<00:03:36.210> let<00:03:36.450> him<00:03:36.540> scream<00:03:36.900> and

in a pack and play let him scream and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.470 
in a pack and play let him scream and
cry<00:03:37.380> we<00:03:38.070> can't<00:03:38.280> hold<00:03:38.460> his<00:03:38.580> hand<00:03:38.820> so<00:03:39.300> this<00:03:39.450> is

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
cry we can't hold his hand so this is

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
to know why it's really that necessary

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.970 
to know why it's really that necessary
and<00:04:55.390> or<00:04:55.600> three<00:04:55.990> maybe<00:04:56.200> you<00:04:56.530> have<00:04:56.710> better

behaved<00:04:57.430> kids<00:04:57.610> in<00:04:57.820> my<00:04:57.940> maybe<00:04:58.150> your<00:04:58.330> kids<00:04:58.540> will

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
behaved kids in my maybe your kids will

behaved kids in my maybe your kids will
stand<00:04:59.740> there<00:04:59.830> and<00:04:59.890> hold<00:05:00.040> your<00:05:00.280> hand<00:05:00.520> and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
stand there and hold your hand and

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.940 
stand there and hold your hand and
therefore<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:02.050> don't<00:05:02.170> understand<00:05:02.680> why<00:05:02.920> I

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
therefore you don't understand why I

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.280 
therefore you don't understand why I
need<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.550> personally<00:05:04.090> or<00:05:04.570> what<00:05:04.780> other<00:05:04.960> people

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
need it personally or what other people

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.750 
need it personally or what other people
might<00:05:05.410> personally<00:05:05.800> need<00:05:06.040> it<00:05:06.190> but<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.340> do<00:05:06.460> think

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
might personally need it but I do think

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.370 
might personally need it but I do think
it's<00:05:06.940> wrong<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.150> accessibly<00:05:07.780> use<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:08.140> we've

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
it's wrong to accessibly use it we've

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.950 
it's wrong to accessibly use it we've
only<00:05:08.530> used<00:05:08.620> it<00:05:08.830> twice<00:05:08.860> two<00:05:09.640> times<00:05:09.670> for<00:05:10.150> him<00:05:10.300> so

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
only used it twice two times for him so

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.170 
only used it twice two times for him so
I<00:05:11.230> think<00:05:12.160> they're<00:05:12.280> adorable<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.880> their<00:05:12.970> cute

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
I think they're adorable and their cute

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.580 
I think they're adorable and their cute
