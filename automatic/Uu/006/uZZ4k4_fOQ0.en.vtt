00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Speak there guys, the project was gone. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.410
 of the new simulator also half missing 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.870
 here from the channel but today I come through 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.280
 this video and bring some images that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.280
 the developer sent me 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.530
 the video will only understand if not 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.840
 with that energy company of always 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.510
 because the developer had some problems 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.360
 some time ago I remember when the plaque 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.550
 tcd mother burnt was old is still 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.530
 organizing a lot in programming 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.720
 too much for a 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.950
 playable version so we can record 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.720
 a game player 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.700
 You can see that they are 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.250
 working part of the scenario was 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.620
 created the garages of different models 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.379
 and not only the garages but also the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.690
 modeling some bus type this 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.460
 cool interior but what's being 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.860
 worked even in the programming of 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.780
 some features of the simulator does not 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.380
 much that is remarkable in a game 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.450
 player 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.720
 that's why they're programming us 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.370
 they only uploaded images a few weeks 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.850
 the developer posted on the fan page 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.400
 officer who needed a donation to 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.340
 pay a programmer for the process 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.040
 walking faster but only 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.830
 two people donated and it was not possible 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.870
 then pay the developer the galerinha 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.780
 project is there if you want to collaborate 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.610
 with 10 dilma will already be an incentive and 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.070
 also an extra step on this journey 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.950
 so that the simulator comes to you 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.250
 the project goes without a defined name until 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.390
 had some but let's think of something else 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.549
 cool huh 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.530
 to always stay inside the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.140
 page of the project on the link here 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.899
 description and in case you want to make a 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.899
 donation just get in touch with them 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.070
 in the fanpage that they provide support 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.990
 there for you 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.539
 so to stay within each 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.520
 detail and enjoy the project page and 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.370
 to stay on top of other news 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.770
 and audiovisual productions you
