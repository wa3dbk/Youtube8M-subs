00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.580 
improve and how Tony Parker would see in
four<00:03:25.140> years

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
four years

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.370 
four years
I<00:03:25.620> think<00:03:26.310> I'm<00:03:26.460> improving<00:03:26.910> every<00:03:27.690> year<00:03:27.960> I<00:03:28.080> think

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
I think I'm improving every year I think

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.870 
I think I'm improving every year I think
I'm<00:03:28.470> improving<00:03:28.860> every<00:03:29.160> year<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.460> try<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.640> be<00:03:29.850> a

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
I'm improving every year to try to be a

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.030 
I'm improving every year to try to be a
point<00:03:30.180> guard<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.630> try<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.380> find<00:03:31.650> our<00:03:31.830> balance

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
point guard and try to find our balance

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.610 
point guard and try to find our balance
you<00:03:32.370> know<00:03:32.490> between<00:03:32.670> scoring<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.420> passing

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
you know between scoring and passing

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.870 
you know between scoring and passing
it's<00:03:34.620> always<00:03:34.950> kind<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.280> hard<00:03:35.490> when<00:03:35.730> you

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's always kind of hard when you

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.490 
it's always kind of hard when you
playing<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.300> good<00:03:36.480> team<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:37.050> when<00:03:37.320> to

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
playing a good team you know when to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.740 
playing a good team you know when to
shoot<00:03:37.709> they<00:03:37.920> went<00:03:38.160> too<00:03:38.310> fast<00:03:38.550> but<00:03:39.240> I<00:03:39.270> think<00:03:39.600> I'm

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
shoot they went too fast but I think I'm

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.540 
shoot they went too fast but I think I'm
getting<00:03:40.020> better<00:03:40.050> at<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.500> every<00:03:40.650> year<00:03:40.950> like

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
getting better at it every year like

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.220 
getting better at it every year like
chess<00:03:41.820> people<00:03:42.090> were<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.480> be<00:03:42.660> or<00:03:42.780> not<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.959> be

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
chess people were to be or not to be

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.990 
chess people were to be or not to be
when<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.620> shooting<00:03:43.980> when<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.250> pass<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:44.790> it's

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
when to shooting when to pass it so it's

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.040 
when to shooting when to pass it so it's
hard<00:03:45.180> when<00:03:45.360> you're<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.510> point<00:03:45.750> guard

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
hard when you're a point guard

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.750 
hard when you're a point guard
because<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.500> can<00:03:46.680> definitely<00:03:47.100> score<00:03:47.400> but<00:03:47.730> at

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
because I can definitely score but at

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.490 
because I can definitely score but at
the<00:03:47.910> same<00:03:48.090> time<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.420> got<00:03:48.690> great<00:03:48.900> teammates<00:03:49.350> like

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
the same time I got great teammates like

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.860 
the same time I got great teammates like
Manu<00:03:49.770> and<00:03:50.190> Timmy<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.300> to<00:03:51.450> choose<00:03:51.810> my

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
Manu and Timmy so I have to choose my

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.720 
Manu and Timmy so I have to choose my
