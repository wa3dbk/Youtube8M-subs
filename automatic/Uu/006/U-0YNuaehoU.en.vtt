City<00:00:12.030> with<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> bunch<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.630> glass<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.170> ground

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
City with a bunch of glass on the ground

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.020 
City with a bunch of glass on the ground
just<00:00:13.620> kind<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.860> lying<00:00:14.099> there<00:00:14.370> because<00:00:14.820> God

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
just kind of lying there because God

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.970 
just kind of lying there because God
knows<00:00:15.059> every<00:00:15.660> city<00:00:15.900> has<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> bunch<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.770> glass

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
knows every city has a bunch of glass

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.000 
knows every city has a bunch of glass
lying<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> ground<00:00:17.940> right<00:00:18.470> okay<00:00:19.470> hey<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.710> got

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
lying on the ground right okay hey I got

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.650 
lying on the ground right okay hey I got
it<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.279> time<00:00:20.310> before<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.910> didn't<00:00:21.480> get<00:00:21.600> that

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
it that time before I didn't get that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.630 
it that time before I didn't get that
because<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.289> was<00:00:22.439> retarded<00:00:22.740> i<00:00:23.039> guess<00:00:23.250> i<00:00:23.460> don't

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
because I was retarded i guess i don't

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.060 
because I was retarded i guess i don't
know<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:25.199> pretty<00:00:25.560> straightforward

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
know but the it's pretty straightforward

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.250 
know but the it's pretty straightforward
for<00:00:26.670> now<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.240> gets<00:00:27.300> kind<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.810> confusing

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
for now but it gets kind of confusing

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.990 
for now but it gets kind of confusing
later<00:00:28.410> now<00:00:28.619> these<00:00:28.769> these<00:00:29.220> are<00:00:29.279> bouncing<00:00:29.760> balls

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
later now these these are bouncing balls

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
later now these these are bouncing balls
you<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.660> jump<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.080> them<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.349> then<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.650> jump

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you can jump on them and then just jump

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.830 
you can jump on them and then just jump
like<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.610> there's<00:00:33.149> an<00:00:33.270> easier<00:00:33.660> way<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
like that but there's an easier way to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.110 
like that but there's an easier way to
do<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> jump<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.969> just

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
do it if you jump on it and you just

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.970 
do it if you jump on it and you just
stay<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> starts<00:00:37.230> bouncing<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:37.800> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
stay on it it starts bouncing like that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.889 
stay on it it starts bouncing like that
and<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> lot<00:00:38.640> easier<00:00:38.820> now<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and it's just a lot easier now this I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.600 
and it's just a lot easier now this I
obviously<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.500> can't<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.950> anything<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.489> in

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
obviously I can't do anything to get in

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
obviously I can't do anything to get in
there<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.940> guess<00:00:42.210> I'm<00:00:42.360> screwed<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
there right I guess I'm screwed it's a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
there right I guess I'm screwed it's a
dead<00:00:43.469> end<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.730> don't<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.270> what

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
dead end I don't know I don't know what

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.990 
dead end I don't know I don't know what
to<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> guess<00:00:46.079> killing<00:00:46.579> killing<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.760> bird

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to do I guess killing killing a bird

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
to do I guess killing killing a bird
will<00:00:48.270> offset<00:00:48.600> some<00:00:49.230> sort<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.739> chemical

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
will offset some sort of chemical

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.549 
will offset some sort of chemical
imbalance<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:50.969> history<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.539> forever<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
imbalance in the history of forever and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
imbalance in the history of forever and
create<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> balloon<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.850> nowhere<00:00:54.000> even

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
create a balloon out of nowhere even

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.750 
create a balloon out of nowhere even
though<00:00:54.480> i<00:00:54.510> think<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.840> was<00:00:54.899> getting<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.230> token

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
though i think it was getting that token

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.819 
though i think it was getting that token
whatever<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.809> such<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.260> life<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
whatever you know like such as life is

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.610 
whatever you know like such as life is
getting<00:00:59.280> tokens<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> making<00:01:00.840> balloons<00:01:01.230> out

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
getting tokens and making balloons out

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.930 
getting tokens and making balloons out
of<00:01:01.739> nowhere<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.280> then<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> watch<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
of nowhere and then you watch it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.509 
of nowhere and then you watch it
floating<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.539> sky<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.799> helium<00:01:05.189> now<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
floating to the sky like helium now that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.250 
floating to the sky like helium now that
i'm<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.760> crazy<00:01:05.970> i<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.450> ground<00:01:06.630> pound<00:01:06.930> here

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
i'm going crazy i can ground pound here

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.710 
i'm going crazy i can ground pound here
and<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:08.100> figure<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.119> creepy<00:01:09.540> thing

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
balloon that goes up and down you know

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
balloon that goes up and down you know
there's<00:01:15.900> nothing<00:01:16.020> yellow<00:01:16.920> balloons<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.490> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
there's nothing yellow balloons in this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
there's nothing yellow balloons in this
game<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:17.970> go<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.299> down<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> platform

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
game they go up and down like a platform

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.899 
game they go up and down like a platform
would<00:01:19.409> red<00:01:19.650> balloon<00:01:19.890> stay<00:01:20.189> absolutely<00:01:20.520> still

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
would red balloon stay absolutely still

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.420 
would red balloon stay absolutely still
so<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.200> they're<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.500> platforms<00:01:22.770> but

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
so you know they're all platforms but

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.370 
so you know they're all platforms but
you<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.759> some<00:01:24.030> stay<00:01:24.180> still<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.630> move<00:01:24.869> oh<00:01:25.170> my

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you know some stay still so move oh my

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
you know some stay still so move oh my
god<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:25.890> complicated<00:01:26.250> i<00:01:26.700> don't<00:01:27.090> know<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.210> my

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
god is so complicated i don't know if my

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.569 
god is so complicated i don't know if my
mind<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:28.110> comprehend<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> complicated

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
mind can comprehend with the complicated

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.210 
mind can comprehend with the complicated
pneus<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.390> complicated<00:01:31.040> anyway<00:01:32.040> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
pneus of the complicated anyway that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
pneus of the complicated anyway that
that<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> jackhammer<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.570> thing<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that is a jackhammer that thing you
