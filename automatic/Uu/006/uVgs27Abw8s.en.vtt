00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.160 
there now the one thing to keep in mind
is<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.579> once<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.269> trigger<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.660> helicopter

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
is that once you trigger the helicopter

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.780 
is that once you trigger the helicopter
to<00:02:52.290> come<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.680> need<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.160> clear<00:02:53.370> everyone<00:02:53.760> out

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
to come you need to clear everyone out

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.090 
to come you need to clear everyone out
and<00:02:54.150> get<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.959> yellow<00:02:55.049> Corona<00:02:55.530> before<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and get to the yellow Corona before the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.090 
and get to the yellow Corona before the
helicopter<00:02:56.670> goes<00:02:56.819> if<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.019> don't<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.709> mission

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
helicopter goes if you don't the mission

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:10.290 
helicopter goes if you don't the mission
will<00:02:59.280> fail

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.550 

once<00:03:11.300> we're<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.690> helicopter<00:03:11.780> we're<00:03:12.440> gonna

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
once we're in the helicopter we're gonna

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.890 
once we're in the helicopter we're gonna
drop<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.160> hook<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.550> spend<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.330> helicopter

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
drop the hook and spend the helicopter

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.660 
drop the hook and spend the helicopter
around<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.560> we're<00:03:15.680> already<00:03:16.190> pointed<00:03:16.580> in

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
around so that we're already pointed in

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.160 
around so that we're already pointed in
the<00:03:16.760> right<00:03:16.940> direction<00:03:17.000> when<00:03:17.569> we<00:03:17.720> grab<00:03:17.959> the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
the right direction when we grab the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.559 
the right direction when we grab the
container<00:03:18.670> slow<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.849> steady<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.269> key

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
container slow and steady is the key

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.630 
container slow and steady is the key
here<00:03:20.840> there's<00:03:21.080> nobody<00:03:21.650> shooting<00:03:22.040> at<00:03:22.129> us<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.489> we

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
here there's nobody shooting at us so we

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.670 
here there's nobody shooting at us so we
can<00:03:22.790> take<00:03:22.910> all<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.510> time<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.959> world<00:03:24.080> they

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
can take all the time in the world they

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.860 
can take all the time in the world they
don't<00:03:24.920> send<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.310> helicopter<00:03:25.910> after<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.330> until

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
don't send a helicopter after you until

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.920 
don't send a helicopter after you until
after<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.500> hook<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.800> container<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.930> once

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
after you hook the container and once

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.449 
after you hook the container and once
you<00:03:30.110> do<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.500> want<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.800> get<00:03:30.950> just<00:03:31.310> enough

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
you do you want to get just enough

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.820 
you do you want to get just enough
altitude<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.269> clear<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.720> hill<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.200> then<00:03:33.470> keep

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
altitude to clear the hill and then keep

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:43.780 
altitude to clear the hill and then keep
pushing<00:03:34.220> forward<00:03:34.459> on<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.849> stick<00:03:42.640> when<00:03:43.640> you

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
pushing forward on that stick when you

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.940 
pushing forward on that stick when you
get<00:03:44.000> here<00:03:44.330> again<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:44.870> get<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.530> altitude

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
get here again just get the altitude

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.650 
get here again just get the altitude
that<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.250> need<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.670> follow<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.299> highway

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
that you need and follow the highway

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.309 
that you need and follow the highway
towards<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.170> drop-off<00:03:48.610> at<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.870> point<00:03:51.170> your

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
towards the drop-off at this point your

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.140 
towards the drop-off at this point your
helicopter<00:03:51.860> is<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.040> great<00:03:52.250> shape<00:03:52.489> so<00:03:52.549> even<00:03:53.060> if

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
helicopter is in great shape so even if

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.819 
helicopter is in great shape so even if
they<00:03:53.269> did<00:03:53.510> catch<00:03:53.750> up<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.200> they<00:03:54.410> would<00:03:54.560> only

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
they did catch up to you they would only

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.530 
they did catch up to you they would only
be<00:03:55.069> a<00:03:55.190> nuisance<00:03:55.549> because<00:03:55.760> they<00:03:56.120> wouldn't<00:03:56.450> be

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
be a nuisance because they wouldn't be

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.970 
be a nuisance because they wouldn't be
able<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.780> put<00:03:56.959> enough<00:03:57.170> bullets<00:03:57.410> into<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:57.829> to

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
able to put enough bullets into you to

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:08.650 
able to put enough bullets into you to
take<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:58.370> down<00:04:05.349> and<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.849> drop-off<00:04:08.269> works<00:04:08.540> the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
take you down and the drop-off works the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.509 
take you down and the drop-off works the
same<00:04:08.870> as<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.079> always<00:04:09.170> did<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:09.829> don't<00:04:10.160> have<00:04:10.340> to

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
same as it always did you don't have to

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.160 
same as it always did you don't have to
release<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.940> container<00:04:11.269> you<00:04:11.450> just<00:04:11.840> have<00:04:12.019> to

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
release the container you just have to

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.199 
release the container you just have to
fly<00:04:12.350> over<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.709> drop-off<00:04:13.130> point<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.639> the<00:04:13.970> game

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
fly over the drop-off point and the game

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.259 
fly over the drop-off point and the game
does<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.569> rest<00:04:14.780> for<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:16.489> that's<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.120> for
