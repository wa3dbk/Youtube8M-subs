 that appear what are the most 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.910
 simple so to speak and that even 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.950

 exact Olympic film and the most father 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.680
 of everything that is what I like 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.190
 we have a camouflaged rafael is 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.190
 this side has his glasses his cap his 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.319
 gabardine everything and we obviously have 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.420
 our star turtles that are the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.630
 of 11 inches as you can see the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.900
 detail is amazing has each of 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.970
 the characters their tools and then 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.700
 these are the best 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.470
 also ajÃ¡ without pardon forgiveness isidro 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.590
 right now for example I want I want to 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.989
 stop a jiffy the basic figures 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.600
 not because they are basic figures they stop 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.000
 be wonderfully detailed and very 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.920
 well molded have a level of truth 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.620
 has an incredible level of detail the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.540
 figures that come in individual packaging 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.990
 that we already handle it like the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.730
 action figure 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.170
 in your own blister, well, yes, 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.000
 you could see here the detail that 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.890
 has a reader 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.900
 precisely the detail not of rafael with 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.550
 the raincoat and everything is wonderful and 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.490
 obviously not even to say of these 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.020
 11 inches that are beautiful this this 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.460
 material is more it's more like vinyl 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.830
 hard is a plastic a bit harder 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.210
 but it 's still light figures or 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.160
 be the children can play very well with 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.440
 them and if you are a collector 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.200
 obviously they will look very much in your 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.580
 bookshelf you will not talk to me about 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.380
 figures that we have luxury these 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.850
 figures what difference does the 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.190
 comparison of what we have seen up to 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.010
 Now figures have movement every 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.640
 one of the characters in the movie and 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.690
 of turtles along with their weapons make 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.920
 movements for example having hair with 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.230
 your ball and when you press your legs 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.860
 you turn this 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.900
 luxury luxury those are luxury we have 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.700
 to the four characters with each of 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.370
 your tools and all by pressing 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.750
 the legs do the movement that 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.489
 then it's also a lot of what you're looking for 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.099
 people do not figure to do more 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.549
 that just being a possible figure or that 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.410
 just be a figure that is 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.900
 practically static not in this case 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.549
 all the figures are going to be thrown together 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.950
 with the movie or in the 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.209
 deferred launches or under people 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.530
 already when the film is in cinema 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.560
 he will surely be able to find everything 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.510
 this in fact most of the toys 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.739
 you can already find them in self-services 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.470
 and departmental and obviously for the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.169
 premiere of the movie we're going to have in 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.060
 many more places the toys so that 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.919
 they can acquire them because they already know 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.020
 come a ninja turtle movie 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.430
 that the truth is causing a lot 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.260
 stir is generating a lot 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.340
 expectation and then we can not miss 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.720
 in this case and here you see nothing more and 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.960
 Now he is Miguel Angel 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.569
 you are these masks 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.069
 they are going to leave also they are already 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.440
 available or leave until the moment of 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:55.169
 the movie these come out at the moment of 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.509
 the movie and how can you see the detail 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.360
 especially for the little ones in the house 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:02.370
 is different from the other masks of 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.160
 turtles that we already have these are with 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.259
 the gestures and the details of the film 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.180
 so they can recreate their character 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.060
 favorite and especially the scenes of the 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.620
 film because we do have quite a few things 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.110
 the good truth and finally here 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.300
 below we also see the whole kit 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.310
 combat where you have to use 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.979
 our tools you have even 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.169
 up your exact same turtle mask 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.599
 I have two ministers that you know exactly 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.320
 I already have my six to be rafael 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.849
 together with my mask and this is also going to 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.680
 be available at the launch of the 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.270
 movie not so excellent the truth is 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.250
 that there are many things that spin master 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.169

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.180

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.530
