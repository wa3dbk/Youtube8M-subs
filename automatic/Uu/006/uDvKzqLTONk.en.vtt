of the Year Chiellini again solid center

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120 
of the Year Chiellini again solid center
back<00:01:27.360> I've<00:01:27.720> used<00:01:27.780> him<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.290> bit<00:01:28.470> more<00:01:28.620> I<00:01:28.830> said<00:01:29.100> I

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
back I've used him a bit more I said I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.610 
back I've used him a bit more I said I
think<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.580> said<00:01:29.790> last<00:01:30.000> video<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.780> wasn't

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
think I said last video that I wasn't

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.260

quite<00:01:31.770> sure<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.370> him<00:01:32.640> because<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.940> think<00:01:33.120> his

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
quite sure about him because I think his

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
quite sure about him because I think his
work-rate<00:01:33.510> was<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> little<00:01:34.350> bit<00:01:34.440> attacking<00:01:34.860> or

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
work-rate was a little bit attacking or

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.310 
work-rate was a little bit attacking or
something<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:36.060> definitely<00:01:36.630> liking<00:01:37.049> him

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.039 
defensive midfielders de Rossi as you
saw<00:01:45.240> last<00:01:45.270> video<00:01:45.840> again<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:47.540> think<00:01:48.540> he's<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
saw last video again and I think he's a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.320 
saw last video again and I think he's a
great<00:01:49.350> central<00:01:49.770> defensive<00:01:50.310> midfielder<00:01:50.940> he

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
great central defensive midfielder he

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.910 
great central defensive midfielder he
could<00:01:51.510> also<00:01:51.630> play<00:01:51.900> center<00:01:52.320> mid<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.740> don't

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
could also play center mid but I don't

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.140 
could also play center mid but I don't
think<00:01:53.100> he'd<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.400> of<00:01:53.520> great<00:01:53.790> sent<00:01:54.060> her

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
think he'd be of great sent her

think he'd be of great sent her
attacking<00:01:54.420> mid<00:01:55.430> he<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.790> great<00:01:57.720> stats<00:01:58.049> across

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
asked me in the comments do I prefer my

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.850 
asked me in the comments do I prefer my
team<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.150> benzema<00:03:18.750> or<00:03:18.930> D<00:03:19.080> natale<00:03:19.650> and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
team of the benzema or D natale and

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.949 
team of the benzema or D natale and
that's<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> most<00:03:21.090> horrible<00:03:21.420> question<00:03:21.870> I

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
that's the most horrible question I

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.060 
that's the most horrible question I
think<00:03:21.989> I've<00:03:22.320> ever<00:03:22.350> been<00:03:22.530> asked<00:03:22.920> because

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
think I've ever been asked because

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.670 
think I've ever been asked because
they're<00:03:23.310> both<00:03:23.550> incredible<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:25.200> think

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
they're both incredible and I think

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.280 
they're both incredible and I think
probably<00:03:26.370> Benzema<00:03:27.150> edges<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:27.930> because

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
probably Benzema edges it just because

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.050 
probably Benzema edges it just because
he's<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> bit<00:03:28.890> taller<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.610> actually<00:03:29.730> head

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
he's a bit taller and can actually head

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.140 
he's a bit taller and can actually head
