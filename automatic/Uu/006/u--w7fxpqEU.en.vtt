00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
weight everything decreased I have

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.740 
weight everything decreased I have
downforce<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.860> my<00:00:56.039> car<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.730> course<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
downforce on my car but of course you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.330 
downforce on my car but of course you
don't<00:00:58.260> need<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.890> probably<00:00:59.070> works

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
don't need it it it probably works

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.990 
don't need it it it probably works
better<00:00:59.520> without<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> downforce<00:01:00.660> anyways<00:01:02.000> now

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
better without the downforce anyways now

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.670 
better without the downforce anyways now
the<00:01:03.059> transmission<00:01:03.510> which<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> guys<00:01:04.320> missed

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the transmission which you guys missed

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:14.660 
the transmission which you guys missed
out<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.129> apologize<00:01:08.299> ok<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> make<00:01:14.010> sure<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
out on I apologize ok so make sure the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:25.670 
out on I apologize ok so make sure the
max<00:01:14.850> speed<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.390> set<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.750> 137<00:01:24.290> then<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.409> believe

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
max speed is set to 137 then I believe

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260 
max speed is set to 137 then I believe
you<00:01:25.830> could<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> final<00:01:26.340> gear<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.000> not<00:01:27.240> i

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you could do the final gear it's not i

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.270 
you could do the final gear it's not i
don't<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.170> Gran<00:01:28.680> Turismo<00:01:28.890> 5

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
don't think it's not like Gran Turismo 5

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.160 
don't think it's not like Gran Turismo 5
where<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.000> final<00:01:30.299> gear<00:01:30.420> affects<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> rest<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
where the final gear affects the rest of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.240 
where the final gear affects the rest of
the<00:01:31.229> train<00:01:31.640> set<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:34.560> make<00:01:34.950> sure<00:01:34.979> your

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the train set up but make sure your

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
the train set up but make sure your
final<00:01:35.549> gear<00:01:35.700> set<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.650> 2.500<00:01:41.990> first<00:01:42.990> gear<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
final gear set the 2.500 first gear is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.460 
final gear set the 2.500 first gear is
all<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.700> way<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.149> left<00:01:45.360> I'm<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.170> sure<00:01:46.229> if

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
all the way to the left I'm not sure if

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.880 
all the way to the left I'm not sure if
you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.619> see<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.070> nozzle<00:01:47.729> right

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
you can see the little nozzle right

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.789 
you can see the little nozzle right
there<00:01:49.909> going<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.180> two<00:01:51.240> left<00:01:51.509> Emil<00:01:51.799> I'm

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
there going on with two left Emil I'm

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.319 
there going on with two left Emil I'm
trying<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.220> trying<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.549> try<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> make

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
trying I'm trying to try just to make

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.880 
trying I'm trying to try just to make
this<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.930> better<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.409> make<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
this a little better you know make it a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
this a little better you know make it a
little<00:01:56.159> more<00:01:56.399> modifiable<00:01:56.969> more<00:01:57.390> upgradable

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
little more modifiable more upgradable

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.430 
little more modifiable more upgradable
more<00:01:58.590> understandable<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.369> guess

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
more understandable I guess

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.040 
more understandable I guess
but<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.370> did<00:02:01.730> I<00:02:01.940> did<00:02:02.180> change<00:02:02.660> some<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:02.960> the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
but I did I did change some of the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.380 
but I did I did change some of the
numbers<00:02:03.200> they<00:02:03.590> weren't<00:02:03.800> tested<00:02:04.580> yet<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:04.940> kind

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
numbers they weren't tested yet I kind

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.090 
numbers they weren't tested yet I kind
of<00:02:05.480> changed<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.230> a<00:02:06.290> little<00:02:06.410> bit<00:02:06.650> made<00:02:06.920> the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
of changed it a little bit made the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.850 
of changed it a little bit made the
giving<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.670> bit<00:02:08.030> more<00:02:08.810> balanced<00:02:09.380> i<00:02:09.470> guess<00:02:09.680> i

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
giving a bit more balanced i guess i

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.670 
giving a bit more balanced i guess i
don't<00:02:10.040> know<00:02:10.100> i<00:02:10.280> haven't<00:02:10.550> tested<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:11.560> it's<00:02:12.560> not

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
don't know i haven't tested it it's not

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.830 
don't know i haven't tested it it's not
a<00:02:12.740> drastic<00:02:13.370> change<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.970> just<00:02:14.150> changed<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.690> few

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
a drastic change I just changed a few

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.690 
a drastic change I just changed a few
numbers<00:02:15.260> only<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.800> few<00:02:16.010> spots<00:02:17.020> first<00:02:18.020> gear<00:02:18.290> is

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
numbers only a few spots first gear is

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.690 
numbers only a few spots first gear is
4.5<00:02:19.700> 65<00:02:20.740> again<00:02:21.740> it's<00:02:21.890> all<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.310> way<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.490> the

4.5 65 again it's all the way to the
left<00:02:24.790> second<00:02:25.790> gear<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:28.090> 3.5<00:02:29.090> 29<00:02:32.200> um<00:02:33.460> guessing

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
left second gear is 3.5 29 um guessing

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.180 
left second gear is 3.5 29 um guessing
kind<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.820> like<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.240> don't<00:02:35.840> know<00:02:35.990> really<00:02:36.200> how<00:02:36.620> far

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
you know comes up or whatever you don't

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.130 
you know comes up or whatever you don't
get<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.200> same<00:03:21.350> numbers<00:03:21.739> or<00:03:21.920> whatever<00:03:22.190> as<00:03:22.370> me

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
get the same numbers or whatever as me

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.780 
get the same numbers or whatever as me
that's<00:03:24.140> because<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:25.100> might<00:03:25.340> not<00:03:25.370> have<00:03:25.760> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
that's because you might not have the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.330 
that's because you might not have the
same<00:03:26.150> car<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:26.660> know<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:27.130> don't<00:03:28.130> know<00:03:28.190> if<00:03:28.250> you

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
same car you know I don't know if you

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.590 
same car you know I don't know if you
noticed<00:03:28.580> but<00:03:28.610> you<00:03:28.790> don't<00:03:28.940> get<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.150> same<00:03:29.330> car

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
noticed but you don't get the same car

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.410 
noticed but you don't get the same car
twice<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.380> what<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.530> mean<00:03:31.120> every<00:03:32.120> car<00:03:32.330> is

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
twice so what I mean every car is

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.460 
twice so what I mean every car is
different<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.180> numbers<00:03:35.510> might<00:03:35.810> be<00:03:35.989> off<00:03:36.170> by

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
different so the numbers might be off by

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.290 
different so the numbers might be off by
a<00:03:36.500> little<00:03:36.620> bit<00:03:37.130> they<00:03:37.280> might<00:03:37.430> be<00:03:37.550> off<00:03:37.670> by<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:37.910> lot

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
a little bit they might be off by a lot

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.710 
a little bit they might be off by a lot
from<00:03:38.510> what<00:03:38.750> i<00:03:38.870> have<00:03:39.200> but<00:03:39.890> if<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:41.180> follow<00:03:41.480> where

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
from what i have but if you follow where

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.330 
from what i have but if you follow where
the<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.890> big<00:03:43.100> circle<00:03:43.550> is<00:03:43.700> there<00:03:45.910> there<00:03:48.340> right

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
the the big circle is there there right

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.240 
the the big circle is there there right
there<00:03:49.640> pretty<00:03:50.120> much<00:03:50.330> almost<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.870> middle

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
there pretty much almost in the middle

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.820 
there pretty much almost in the middle
right<00:03:52.250> there<00:03:53.709> there<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.130> then<00:03:56.090> there<00:03:56.830> it's

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
right there there and then there it's

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.470 
right there there and then there it's
basically<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.310> general<00:03:58.730> spots<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.239> want<00:03:59.390> to
