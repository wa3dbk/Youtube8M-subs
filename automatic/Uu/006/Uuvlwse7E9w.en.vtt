going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.890> use<00:00:29.099> my<00:00:30.259> science<00:00:31.259> biology<00:00:31.529> review

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
going to use my science biology review

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.270 
going to use my science biology review
questions<00:00:33.120> since<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> provincials<00:00:34.680> are<00:00:34.860> over

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
questions since the provincials are over

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.010 
questions since the provincials are over
and<00:00:36.320> you<00:00:37.320> also<00:00:37.470> need<00:00:37.860> scissors<00:00:38.400> to<00:00:38.910> cut<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and you also need scissors to cut the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.780 
and you also need scissors to cut the
paper<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.040> good<00:00:41.310> at<00:00:41.400> ripping

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
paper but if you really good at ripping

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.700 
paper but if you really good at ripping
straight<00:00:42.270> lines<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.170> won't<00:00:43.350> need<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
straight lines then you won't need the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.520 
straight lines then you won't need the
scissors<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.490> just<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.540> utilize<00:00:46.080> your

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
scissors you just need to utilize your

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.200 
scissors you just need to utilize your
great<00:00:47.070> fantastic<00:00:48.440> ripping<00:00:49.440> skill<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.940> first

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
great fantastic ripping skill the first

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.080 
great fantastic ripping skill the first
step<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.260> take<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:53.400> paper<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
step is that you take your paper and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.320 
step is that you take your paper and
fold<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.050> lengthwise<00:00:58.130> down<00:00:59.130> the<00:00:59.430> center<00:01:00.860> and

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
fold it lengthwise down the center and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.980 
fold it lengthwise down the center and
then<00:01:03.330> cut<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:05.369> line<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.000> folded<00:01:06.450> with

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
then cut the line that you folded with

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.950 
then cut the line that you folded with
your<00:01:07.200> scissors<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:09.000> um<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.810> know

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
your scissors or you can um you know

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.859 
your scissors or you can um you know
Rick<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:11.630> after<00:01:12.630> you're<00:01:12.780> done<00:01:13.020> take<00:01:14.119> your<00:01:15.119> one

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
Rick it after you're done take your one

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.069 
Rick it after you're done take your one
of<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:16.200> half<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.890> paper<00:01:17.159> um<00:01:17.780> take<00:01:18.780> one

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
of the half of the paper um take one

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.310 
of the half of the paper um take one
corner<00:01:19.469> and<00:01:19.619> line<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.039> up<00:01:20.359> along<00:01:21.359> the<00:01:21.630> side<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
corner and line it up along the side of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.800 
corner and line it up along the side of
the<00:01:23.299> paper<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.289> that<00:01:25.319> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.810> triangle

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the paper so that you can get a triangle

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.410 
the paper so that you can get a triangle
like<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.549> if<00:01:29.549> you'll<00:01:29.789> see<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:31.759> then<00:01:32.759> take

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
like this if you'll see and then take

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.069 
like this if you'll see and then take
the<00:01:33.600> other<00:01:33.749> side<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.109> the<00:01:34.289> paper<00:01:34.499> and<00:01:35.630> fold<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the other side of the paper and fold the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.719 
the other side of the paper and fold the
edge<00:01:37.700> along<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:40.259> edge<00:01:40.499> of<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.979> triangle<00:01:41.579> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
edge along the edge of the triangle that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.859 
edge along the edge of the triangle that
you<00:01:41.939> created<00:01:42.810> earlier<00:01:43.999> and<00:01:44.999> make<00:01:45.299> sure<00:01:45.329> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you created earlier and make sure that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
you created earlier and make sure that
it's<00:01:46.469> even<00:01:46.939> or<00:01:47.939> else<00:01:49.069> so<00:01:50.069> now<00:01:50.310> you'll<00:01:50.700> have

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it's even or else so now you'll have

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.230 
it's even or else so now you'll have
something<00:01:51.179> that<00:01:51.509> looks<00:01:51.539> like<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.999> with<00:01:53.999> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
something that looks like this with the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.059 
something that looks like this with the
edge<00:01:54.569> poking<00:01:55.139> out<00:01:55.319> that<00:01:56.009> edge<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.709> here

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
edge poking out that edge you see here

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.969 
edge poking out that edge you see here
this<00:01:59.609> edge<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:01.079> don't<00:02:01.289> want<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.679> don't

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
this edge you don't want it you don't

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.349 
this edge you don't want it you don't
need<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.119> rid<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.389> it<00:02:04.729> by<00:02:05.729> cutting<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
need it so get rid of it by cutting it

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:11.470 
need it so get rid of it by cutting it
off<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.869> once<00:02:07.409> again<00:02:07.740> using<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:09.080> superior

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
off or once again using your superior

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.239 
off or once again using your superior
ripping

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:18.249 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:25.059 

like<00:02:19.249> this<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.849> then<00:02:20.239> fold<00:02:20.629> it<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.469> half<00:02:24.069> fold

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
like this and then fold it in half fold

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.239 
like this and then fold it in half fold
this<00:02:25.579> piece<00:02:25.879> of<00:02:26.090> paper<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:26.599> half<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.799> this<00:02:28.040> way

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:28.249 
this piece of paper in half so this way

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:32.589 
this piece of paper in half so this way
you<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:28.549> two<00:02:29.209> squares<00:02:30.579> now<00:02:31.579> previously<00:02:32.090> we

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
you have two squares now previously we

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.809 
you have two squares now previously we
already<00:02:32.930> made<00:02:33.139> two<00:02:33.530> diagonal<00:02:34.250> lines<00:02:34.549> like

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
already made two diagonal lines like

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.449 
already made two diagonal lines like
this<00:02:35.090> now<00:02:35.540> we<00:02:35.599> fold<00:02:36.109> the<00:02:36.530> opposite<00:02:36.920> corner<00:02:37.069> so

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
this now we fold the opposite corner so

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.819 
this now we fold the opposite corner so
that<00:02:37.489> we<00:02:37.730> can<00:02:37.879> get<00:02:38.030> an<00:02:38.180> X<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.750> both<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:39.500> the

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
that we can get an X on both of the

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.399 
that we can get an X on both of the
squares<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.469> now<00:02:42.739> have<00:02:42.769> two<00:02:43.340> x's<00:02:43.909> right

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
squares so you now have two x's right

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:51.330 
squares so you now have two x's right
the<00:02:45.409> last<00:02:45.650> step<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.939> just<00:02:48.370> fold<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:50.540> edges

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the last step is to just fold the edges

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.030 
the last step is to just fold the edges
towards<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.549> center<00:02:53.030> like<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:53.530> for<00:02:54.530> both<00:02:54.769> of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
towards the center like this for both of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.670 
towards the center like this for both of
the<00:02:55.219> squares<00:02:55.959> washing<00:02:56.959> this<00:02:57.079> isn't<00:02:57.439> the<00:02:57.530> last

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
the squares washing this isn't the last

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:08.229 
the squares washing this isn't the last
steps<00:02:58.010> or<00:03:00.909> I'm<00:03:01.909> a<00:03:01.969> liar<00:03:02.389> I<00:03:05.650> mean<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.939> once<00:03:07.939> told

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
steps or I'm a liar I mean I once told

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.050 
steps or I'm a liar I mean I once told
someone<00:03:08.599> that<00:03:08.750> my<00:03:09.109> name<00:03:09.349> was<00:03:09.560> Deanna<00:03:10.069> after

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
someone that my name was Deanna after

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.059 
someone that my name was Deanna after
you<00:03:11.269> folded<00:03:11.930> all<00:03:12.769> those<00:03:13.510> hold<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:15.139> is<00:03:15.439> one<00:03:15.919> of

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
you folded all those hold this is one of

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.429 
you folded all those hold this is one of
my<00:03:16.219> squares<00:03:16.699> right<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.900> see<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.079> X

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
my squares right and you can see the X

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.129 
my squares right and you can see the X
and<00:03:19.569> line<00:03:20.569> down<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.079> center<00:03:21.199> just<00:03:22.000> push<00:03:23.139> the

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
and line down the center just push the

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.099 
and line down the center just push the
line<00:03:24.409> in<00:03:24.709> word<00:03:25.069> like<00:03:26.030> lift<00:03:26.389> pinch<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.989> together

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
line in word like lift pinch it together

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.740 
line in word like lift pinch it together
and<00:03:27.650> then<00:03:29.079> fold<00:03:30.079> down<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.709> diagonal<00:03:31.099> lines<00:03:31.759> so

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
and then fold down the diagonal lines so

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.569 
and then fold down the diagonal lines so
this<00:03:32.989> way<00:03:33.259> you<00:03:33.290> can<00:03:33.590> achieve<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:34.159> triangle

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
this way you can achieve the triangle

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.999 
this way you can achieve the triangle
like<00:03:37.579> that<00:03:38.379> now<00:03:39.379> I'm<00:03:39.470> going<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.709> do<00:03:39.799> it<00:03:39.949> again

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:40.009 
like that now I'm going to do it again

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:42.670 
like that now I'm going to do it again
to<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.400> other<00:03:40.549> side<00:03:40.849> and<00:03:41.180> then<00:03:41.900> you'll<00:03:42.439> have

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
to the other side and then you'll have

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.030 
to the other side and then you'll have
these<00:03:42.919> triangles<00:03:43.459> like<00:03:43.849> this<00:03:44.209> here<00:03:44.889> what<00:03:45.889> you

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
these triangles like this here what you

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.670 
these triangles like this here what you
do<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:46.729> for<00:03:47.030> each<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.359> the<00:03:48.229> size<00:03:48.500> of

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
do is that for each of the size of

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.969 
do is that for each of the size of
triangle<00:03:49.250> fold<00:03:49.519> it<00:03:49.790> towards<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.359> center<00:03:51.019> for

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:51.979 
triangle fold it towards the center for

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:57.580 
triangle fold it towards the center for
all<00:03:52.280> four<00:03:54.609> corner<00:03:55.609> thingies<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.569> then<00:03:57.109> after

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
all four corner thingies and then after

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.670 
all four corner thingies and then after
you<00:03:57.739> folded<00:03:58.310> all<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.750> corners<00:03:59.750> four<00:04:00.229> corners

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
you folded all the corners four corners

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.319 
you folded all the corners four corners
in<00:04:00.949> you'll<00:04:01.219> have<00:04:01.459> something<00:04:01.849> that<00:04:02.000> looks<00:04:02.030> like

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
in you'll have something that looks like

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.690 
in you'll have something that looks like
this

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.640 

you<00:04:05.790> used<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.120> be<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.450> that's<00:04:06.690> right<00:04:07.050> now<00:04:07.530> it

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
you used to be like that's right now it

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.150 
you used to be like that's right now it
looks<00:04:07.770> like<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:09.810> what<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.050> do<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.500> like

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
looks like this so what you do is like

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.150 
looks like this so what you do is like
this<00:04:11.340> right<00:04:11.670> open<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.150> up<00:04:12.300> push<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.470> down<00:04:13.739> so

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
this right open it up push it down so

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.849 
this right open it up push it down so
that<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.489> forms<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:15.030> square<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:16.139> you<00:04:16.440> do<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.709> to

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
that it forms a square and you do it to

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.270 
that it forms a square and you do it to
all<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.220> them<00:04:17.630> off<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:20.329> triangle<00:04:21.329> corners<00:04:21.870> and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
all of them off for triangle corners and

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.760 
all of them off for triangle corners and
then<00:04:23.280> you'll<00:04:23.460> get<00:04:23.639> something<00:04:23.880> like<00:04:24.210> this

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
then you'll get something like this

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.969 
then you'll get something like this
inside<00:04:25.770> your<00:04:25.950> square<00:04:26.310> you'll<00:04:26.520> have<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:27.979> square

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
inside your square you'll have a square

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.230 
inside your square you'll have a square
with<00:04:29.190> like<00:04:29.460> four<00:04:29.790> squares<00:04:30.410> like<00:04:31.410> this<00:04:32.240> and

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
with like four squares like this and

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.659 
with like four squares like this and
then<00:04:33.479> what<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:33.750> do<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.200> you<00:04:34.380> fold<00:04:34.830> the

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
then what you do is that you fold the

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.520 
then what you do is that you fold the
corners<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:37.650> square<00:04:37.950> towards<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.790> center

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
corners of the square towards the center

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.420 
corners of the square towards the center
like<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.520> do<00:04:41.639> it<00:04:41.790> to<00:04:41.970> all<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:42.240> them

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
like this and you do it to all of them

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:57.569 
like this and you do it to all of them
all<00:04:44.430> of<00:04:44.490> them<00:04:45.030> don't<00:04:45.870> be<00:04:46.050> lazy

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:57.579 

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:01.359 

and<00:04:58.579> then<00:04:59.259> after<00:05:00.259> you've<00:05:00.469> done<00:05:00.679> that<00:05:00.739> you'll

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:01.369 
and then after you've done that you'll

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:03.850 
and then after you've done that you'll
get<00:05:01.610> something<00:05:01.999> that<00:05:02.119> looks<00:05:02.179> like<00:05:02.449> this<00:05:02.860> all

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
get something that looks like this all

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.429 
get something that looks like this all
right<00:05:04.089> what<00:05:05.089> you<00:05:05.209> do<00:05:05.389> is<00:05:05.599> that<00:05:05.629> you<00:05:05.839> open<00:05:06.319> up

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:06.439 
right what you do is that you open up

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.600 
right what you do is that you open up
the<00:05:06.649> folds<00:05:07.159> again<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:08.289> you<00:05:09.289> line<00:05:09.529> up<00:05:09.559> the<00:05:10.339> top

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
the folds again and you line up the top

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.679 
the folds again and you line up the top
part<00:05:11.059> the<00:05:11.899> center<00:05:12.349> line<00:05:12.739> fold<00:05:13.159> thingy<00:05:13.689> against

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:14.689 
part the center line fold thingy against

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.419 
part the center line fold thingy against
the<00:05:14.899> line<00:05:15.169> at<00:05:15.439> the<00:05:15.589> bottom<00:05:17.319> this<00:05:18.319> this<00:05:19.039> line

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:19.429 
the line at the bottom this this line

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:23.409 
the line at the bottom this this line
here<00:05:20.059> if<00:05:20.360> you'll<00:05:20.569> please<00:05:21.079> just<00:05:21.139> see<00:05:22.389> so<00:05:23.389> that

here if you'll please just see so that
you<00:05:23.659> can<00:05:23.779> get<00:05:23.899> something<00:05:24.139> that<00:05:24.319> looks<00:05:24.379> like

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:24.649 
you can get something that looks like

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:28.689 
you can get something that looks like
this<00:05:25.089> and<00:05:26.089> you<00:05:26.269> do<00:05:26.389> it<00:05:26.509> for<00:05:26.629> all<00:05:26.809> of<00:05:26.959> them<00:05:27.699> once

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
this and you do it for all of them once

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.219 
this and you do it for all of them once
you're<00:05:28.909> done<00:05:29.089> that<00:05:29.419> it<00:05:29.689> look<00:05:29.959> like<00:05:30.169> this<00:05:32.229> and

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
you're done that it look like this and

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.149 
you're done that it look like this and
once<00:05:33.769> it<00:05:33.979> looks<00:05:34.159> like<00:05:34.399> this<00:05:35.619> you'll<00:05:36.619> realize

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
once it looks like this you'll realize

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.249 
once it looks like this you'll realize
if<00:05:37.399> you<00:05:37.489> look<00:05:37.669> at<00:05:37.819> from<00:05:38.029> a<00:05:38.419> slide<00:05:38.839> point<00:05:39.169> of

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
if you look at from a slide point of

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:40.839 
if you look at from a slide point of
view<00:05:39.439> this<00:05:39.559> thing<00:05:39.829> looks<00:05:40.069> like<00:05:40.219> this<00:05:40.459> right

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
view this thing looks like this right

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.899 
view this thing looks like this right
well<00:05:41.779> with<00:05:42.049> one<00:05:42.319> of<00:05:42.499> this<00:05:42.919> sort<00:05:43.309> of<00:05:43.429> slide<00:05:43.729> you

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
well with one of this sort of slide you

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.489 
well with one of this sort of slide you
can<00:05:44.059> fold<00:05:44.299> it<00:05:44.539> in<00:05:45.229> half<00:05:46.360> or<00:05:47.360> over<00:05:48.019> towards<00:05:48.439> the

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:48.499 
can fold it in half or over towards the

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:51.279 
can fold it in half or over towards the
other<00:05:48.739> side<00:05:49.099> rather<00:05:49.669> if<00:05:50.479> that<00:05:50.809> makes<00:05:51.079> any

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
other side rather if that makes any

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.089 
other side rather if that makes any
sense<00:05:51.589> at<00:05:52.249> all<00:05:52.839> and<00:05:53.839> the<00:05:53.929> last<00:05:54.259> step<00:05:54.439> this<00:05:54.889> time

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
sense at all and the last step this time

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.249 
sense at all and the last step this time
it's<00:05:55.309> actually<00:05:55.699> true<00:05:55.969> the<00:05:56.300> last<00:05:56.539> step<00:05:56.839> is<00:05:57.079> that

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
it's actually true the last step is that

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.799 
it's actually true the last step is that
you<00:05:57.349> just<00:05:57.499> take<00:05:57.709> the<00:05:57.860> side<00:05:58.269> corners<00:05:59.269> and<00:05:59.509> fold

00:05:59.799 --> 00:05:59.809 
you just take the side corners and fold

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.279 
you just take the side corners and fold
it<00:06:00.050> back<00:06:00.289> and<00:06:01.129> do<00:06:01.969> it<00:06:02.089> for<00:06:02.239> the<00:06:02.360> both<00:06:02.509> sides<00:06:02.929> and

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
it back and do it for the both sides and

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:11.300 
it back and do it for the both sides and
make<00:06:03.409> sure<00:06:03.649> that<00:06:04.059> they're<00:06:05.059> even

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.270 

and<00:06:11.400> then<00:06:12.360> you<00:06:13.230> will<00:06:13.380> get<00:06:13.590> something<00:06:13.950> that

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
and then you will get something that

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.230 
and then you will get something that
looks<00:06:14.340> like<00:06:14.760> this<00:06:16.070> okay<00:06:17.070> i<00:06:17.100> am<00:06:17.340> so<00:06:17.670> mentally

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
looks like this okay i am so mentally

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.740 
looks like this okay i am so mentally
exhausted<00:06:18.900> with<00:06:19.080> my<00:06:19.260> awful<00:06:19.770> explanation<00:06:20.550> of

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
exhausted with my awful explanation of

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.350 
exhausted with my awful explanation of
how<00:06:21.750> to<00:06:21.810> make<00:06:22.110> this<00:06:22.320> so<00:06:22.680> i<00:06:23.090> am<00:06:24.090> going<00:06:24.630> to<00:06:24.900> go
