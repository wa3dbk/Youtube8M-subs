demons you can go ahead and see over
here<00:00:24.450> we<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.289> have<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.680> stairs<00:00:25.980> over<00:00:26.190> there

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
here we do have some stairs over there

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.920 
here we do have some stairs over there
that<00:00:26.610> will<00:00:26.730> go<00:00:26.880> ahead<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.210> mimic<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> home

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
that will go ahead and mimic the home

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900 
that will go ahead and mimic the home
training<00:00:28.260> conditions<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.460> even<00:00:29.700> if<00:00:29.789> you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
training conditions and even if you

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.250 
training conditions and even if you
don't<00:00:30.060> have<00:00:30.210> stairs<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.869> go<00:00:31.020> ahead<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
don't have stairs you can go ahead and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.610 
don't have stairs you can go ahead and
do<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.619> routine<00:00:32.690> just<00:00:33.690> simply<00:00:34.170> using<00:00:34.379> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
do this routine just simply using a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.060 
do this routine just simply using a
block<00:00:34.890> or<00:00:35.280> some<00:00:35.550> sort<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> great<00:00:36.030> surface<00:00:37.070> it's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
block or some sort of great surface it's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.250 
block or some sort of great surface it's
basically<00:00:38.640> very<00:00:38.970> simple<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:39.900> it<00:00:40.050> it's

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
basically very simple to do it it's

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.050 
basically very simple to do it it's
going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.560> go<00:00:40.710> ahead<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.100> take<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.550> no<00:00:42.030> more

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
than six minutes to go ahead and get the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
than six minutes to go ahead and get the
caps<00:00:44.250> blaster<00:00:44.820> let's<00:00:45.300> go<00:00:45.480> ahead<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:45.930> some

we're now here

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.100 
we're now here
to<00:00:52.300> erase<00:00:52.600> surface

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.810 

but<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> could<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.530> any<00:00:55.740> great<00:00:55.980> surface<00:00:56.550> then

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
but it could be any great surface then

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.790 
but it could be any great surface then
you<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:57.150> a<00:00:57.180> hole

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.710 

I'll<00:00:59.980> turn<00:01:00.309> it<00:01:00.430> back<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.700> forth

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
I'll turn it back and forth

we're not even going to go ahead and cut

00:01:15.060 --> 00:03:41.890 
we're not even going to go ahead and cut
revenues<00:01:15.540> okay

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.589 

it<00:03:42.470> burns<00:03:42.799> when<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.939> fourth<00:03:44.180> set

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
it burns when the fourth set

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.449

they<00:03:45.870> failed<00:03:46.170> at<00:03:46.319> 10<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.799> last<00:03:46.920> one<00:03:47.220> just

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
they failed at 10 the last one just

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.399 
they failed at 10 the last one just
because<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.239> peak<00:03:48.420> contraction<00:03:48.780> sometimes

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
because of a peak contraction sometimes

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.830 
because of a peak contraction sometimes
you<00:03:49.530> don't<00:03:49.650> need<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.890> lot<00:03:50.099> of<00:03:50.129> weight<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.840> get

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you don't need a lot of weight to get

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.980 
you don't need a lot of weight to get
things<00:03:52.079> done

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
things done

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.230 
things done
talk<00:03:54.440> about<00:03:54.500> muscle<00:03:54.950> tension

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:43.860 

I<00:03:58.270> guess<00:03:58.930> I'm<00:03:59.050> pretty<00:03:59.080> heavy<00:03:59.440> any<00:03:59.590> fish

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.250 

that's<00:04:44.230> pretty<00:04:44.410> much<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:45.360> six<00:04:46.360> sets<00:04:46.600> in<00:04:47.050> this

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
that's pretty much it six sets in this

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.560 
that's pretty much it six sets in this
case<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.710> did<00:04:47.980> eight<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.550> eight<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.210> 15

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
case I did eight to the eight to 15

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.230 
case I did eight to the eight to 15
repetitions<00:04:49.780> started<00:04:50.530> with<00:04:50.650> 15<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:51.490> then<00:04:52.120> at

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
repetitions started with 15 and then at

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.650 
repetitions started with 15 and then at
the<00:04:52.360> end<00:04:52.389> we<00:04:52.780> ended<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.169> failing<00:04:53.680> at<00:04:53.949> 8<00:04:54.660> my

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
the end we ended up failing at 8 my

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.330 
the end we ended up failing at 8 my
calves<00:04:55.930> are<00:04:56.080> pretty<00:04:56.320> toasted<00:04:56.770> at<00:04:56.919> this<00:04:57.070> point

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
calves are pretty toasted at this point

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.580 
calves are pretty toasted at this point
in<00:04:57.520> time<00:04:57.780> believe<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.870> or<00:04:58.960> not<00:04:59.110> you<00:04:59.320> don't<00:04:59.410> go

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
in time believe it or not you don't go

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.839 
in time believe it or not you don't go
ahead

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
ahead

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.119 
ahead
a<00:05:01.939> lot<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.360> weight<00:05:02.689> go<00:05:03.619> ahead<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:03.919> cause<00:05:04.099> a

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129 
a lot of weight go ahead and cause a

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.719 
a lot of weight go ahead and cause a
gross<00:05:04.459> stimulus<00:05:05.770> it's<00:05:06.770> just<00:05:07.129> about<00:05:07.399> how<00:05:07.699> you

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
gross stimulus it's just about how you

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.480 
gross stimulus it's just about how you
go<00:05:07.999> ahead<00:05:08.149> and<00:05:08.559> contract<00:05:09.559> the<00:05:09.709> muscle<00:05:10.099> and<00:05:10.279> how

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
go ahead and contract the muscle and how

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.600 
go ahead and contract the muscle and how
you<00:05:10.809> go<00:05:11.809> ahead<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.139> put<00:05:12.259> the<00:05:12.379> stress<00:05:12.649> on<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:13.039> so

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
you go ahead and put the stress on it so

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.489
