so<00:00:03.659> here's<00:00:03.870> our<00:00:03.990> thermometer<00:00:04.500> well<00:00:04.710> actually

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
so here's our thermometer well actually

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.170 
so here's our thermometer well actually
that's<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.460> carry<00:00:05.700> case<00:00:05.910> for<00:00:06.120> the

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
that's the carry case for the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.660 
that's the carry case for the
thermometer<00:00:06.390> if<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.810> open<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.230> up<00:00:07.350> here<00:00:07.670> you'll

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
thermometer if I open it up here you'll

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.629 
thermometer if I open it up here you'll
see<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.230> thermometer<00:00:10.519> you<00:00:11.519> see

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
see that this is the thermometer you see

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.830 
see that this is the thermometer you see
there's<00:00:11.820> only<00:00:11.880> three<00:00:12.179> buttons

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
there's only three buttons

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.509 
there's only three buttons
the<00:00:13.049> big<00:00:13.230> button<00:00:13.410> turns<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.340> also

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
the big button turns it on and is also

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
the big button turns it on and is also
the<00:00:14.670> button<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.540> use<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.870> take<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
the button that we use to take the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.560 
the button that we use to take the
temperature<00:00:16.670> very<00:00:17.670> straightforward<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> use

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
temperature very straightforward to use

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.990 
temperature very straightforward to use
it<00:00:18.960> goes<00:00:19.230> straight<00:00:19.350> into<00:00:19.680> room<00:00:20.010> mode<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
it goes straight into room mode and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660 
it goes straight into room mode and
here's<00:00:21.630> our<00:00:21.810> R<00:00:22.230> stand<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.279> stand<00:00:23.310> just

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
here's our R stand and the stand just

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.170 
here's our R stand and the stand just
flips<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:25.070> like<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.279> you'll<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> screen

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
flips on like this you'll see the screen

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
flips on like this you'll see the screen
is<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> wrong<00:00:27.660> way<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:27.990> because<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.710> put<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
is the wrong way up because I put it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.820 
is the wrong way up because I put it
that<00:00:29.130> way<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.510> fact<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that way and in fact if I do that and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
that way and in fact if I do that and
you<00:00:32.009> activate<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.940> tilt<00:00:33.180> switch<00:00:33.420> you'll

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
you activate the tilt switch you'll

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.299 
you activate the tilt switch you'll
actually<00:00:33.989> see<00:00:34.230> what<00:00:34.350> happens<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.980> screen

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
actually see what happens in the screen

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.729 
actually see what happens in the screen
will<00:00:35.850> flip<00:00:36.090> over<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.630> always<00:00:36.750> knows<00:00:37.140> which

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
will flip over so it always knows which

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.220 
will flip over so it always knows which
way<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.300> it's<00:00:39.300> got<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> little<00:00:39.690> 3m<00:00:40.110> sticky

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
way it's out it's got a little 3m sticky

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.380 
way it's out it's got a little 3m sticky
pad<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.160> peel<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.610> off<00:00:41.670> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
pad here so if I peel that off that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.060 
pad here so if I peel that off that
allows<00:00:42.660> me<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> actually<00:00:43.200> put<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> wall

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
allows me to actually put it on the wall

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
allows me to actually put it on the wall
and<00:00:44.280> you'll<00:00:44.430> see<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> screens<00:00:44.969> flipped<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.420> or

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and you'll see the screens flipped up or

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.869 
and you'll see the screens flipped up or
I<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.230> put<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.440> under<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> shelf<00:00:47.039> or<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.670> course

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
I can put it under a shelf or of course

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
I can put it under a shelf or of course
I<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.840> stand<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> shelf

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
I can just you know stand it on a shelf

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.130 
I can just you know stand it on a shelf
in<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.129> nursery<00:00:50.489> wherever<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:50.969> may<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:52.020> in

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
in a nursery wherever it may be and in

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
in a nursery wherever it may be and in
fact<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.649> stand<00:00:52.949> now<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.280> sitting<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.670> our<00:00:53.820> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
fact this stand now is sitting in our in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.939 
fact this stand now is sitting in our in
our<00:00:54.390> kitchen<00:00:54.840> because<00:00:54.989> obviously<00:00:55.079> our<00:00:55.379> kids

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
our kitchen because obviously our kids

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.020 
our kitchen because obviously our kids
are<00:00:56.070> older<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.610> still<00:00:56.789> want<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> know

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
are older but we still want to know

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.639 
are older but we still want to know
where<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> thermometer<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> take<00:00:58.530> it

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
where the thermometer is so I take it

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.279 
where the thermometer is so I take it
off<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.770> stand<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.480> flip<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.660> probe<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
off the stand I flip up the probe and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
off the stand I flip up the probe and
now<00:01:01.370> automatically<00:01:02.370> goes<00:01:02.579> into<00:01:02.760> ear<00:01:03.030> or

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
now automatically goes into ear or

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
now automatically goes into ear or
forehead<00:01:03.570> depending<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> last<00:01:04.559> mode

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
forehead depending on what the last mode

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
forehead depending on what the last mode
was<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.990> simple<00:01:07.260> easy<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> use

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
was and it's really simple easy to use

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.100 
was and it's really simple easy to use
it's<00:01:08.610> digital<00:01:09.119> infrared<00:01:09.510> which<00:01:09.780> means<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's digital infrared which means it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
it's digital infrared which means it
takes<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> temperature<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> second<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.520> just

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
takes the temperature in a second I just

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
takes the temperature in a second I just
stick<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.570> ear<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.049> press<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> button

and again if I want to know what that is
in<00:01:48.869> centigrade<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.369> flip<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.729> back<00:01:51.649> that's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
in centigrade I just flip it back that's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.190 
in centigrade I just flip it back that's
it's<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.310> simple<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.909> use<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.540> every

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
it's as simple as that to use and every

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.899 
it's as simple as that to use and every

itself off the backlight after 10

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.910 
itself off the backlight after 10
seconds<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.899> say<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> carry<00:02:10.470> case<00:02:10.679> and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.460 
not obviously going to take it off the
wall<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.970> lid<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.629> carry<00:02:17.930> case<00:02:18.110> itself

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
wall so the lid of the carry case itself

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.740 
wall so the lid of the carry case itself
also<00:02:19.189> then<00:02:19.340> doubles<00:02:19.670> up<00:02:19.819> as<00:02:20.090> another<00:02:20.420> stand

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
also then doubles up as another stand

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.720 
also then doubles up as another stand
which<00:02:21.319> one<00:02:21.560> I'm<00:02:21.680> holding<00:02:21.829> is<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> little<00:02:22.610> bit

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
which one I'm holding is a little bit

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.050 
which one I'm holding is a little bit
trickier<00:02:23.120> they<00:02:23.900> can<00:02:24.079> get<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.220> table<00:02:25.400> so

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
trickier they can get on the table so

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.850 
trickier they can get on the table so
that's<00:02:26.329> the<00:02:26.540> thermometer<00:02:26.989> very<00:02:27.260> easy<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.680> use

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
that's the thermometer very easy to use

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.619 
that's the thermometer very easy to use
and<00:02:28.040> great<00:02:28.730> value<00:02:29.000> for<00:02:29.090> money<00:02:29.150> because<00:02:29.390> you

and great value for money because you

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.990 
and great value for money because you
get<00:02:29.780> three<00:02:29.959> for<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.290> price<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:30.650> one
