 tighten more dough and their advocates 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.240
 decided to take pizza 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.640
 so we drove into the kitchen and see what 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.070
 happened 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.399
 for our pizza will need dough already 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.739

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.879
 Bryansk cuisine

 sausage leek green pickled 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.200

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.539
 oiled 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.010
 let's start cooking first thing we 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.010
 roll our dough 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.600
 made the correct form that is on 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.789
 these pizzas are of the round kind it means she will 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.359
 the right round pizza dough in general 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.299
 super car ready mom is already there 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.810
 I myself do not really like making dough that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.510
 long and generally with him so here to the hands 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.340
 all flies need to mess around when mom 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.960
 make the dough can, in principle, roll out 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.960
 and make pizza 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.960
 put the test stories on a huge 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.909
 we take a plate with a sharp knife sharper 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.909
 or cut a circle 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.840
 remove the test 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:49.670
 swim form tea 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.530
 further we shift it to the fry sheet 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.150
 with pergamum 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.460
 coast min barely smear sunflower 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:01.660
 oiled up so that he does not pester the flag 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:05.800
 spikelet spread and roll out 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:09.770
 yes of course pizza is not quite round 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.660
 not at all round on the border want 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.640
 the most tender was such more 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.160
 oval is okay this is not the main 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.730
 Panov's lie is delicious well what am I doing for 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.530
 myself 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.270
 for some reason, therefore, we will do 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:30.770
 the ease to make fillings for us 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:36.050
 you will need a grater board and such 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:42.580
 porsche we grate three cucumbers 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.630
 pickled glasses we add ketchup 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.020
 bat 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:57.140
 3 tablespoons 2 tablespoons 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:03:00.260
 mayonnaise Italian herbs do not regret 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.750
 Italian fucking is not always awesome 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.750
 aroma of red hot pepper 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:17.260
 the whole thing we mix turns out 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.469
 such sauce for pizza base 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.569
 this will lie at the bottom of this 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:26.540
 this is our record 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.120
 oval ugly pizza is not to blame 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.439
 see what I'm doing round throwing away 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.230
 on our our nachinochku 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:39.349
 that is, the sauce is smearing I do not like the edges 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.659
 on pizza to all the edges I need 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.129
 cover up the fillings but these are empty 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.989
 the edges terribly don't like throwing them away and 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.269
 in general, I consider them just before sunrise 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.709
 dough well of course you can hold on to them 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:04:03.680
 but I prefer eating pizza with a savory spoon 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:06.470
 knife so no blank edges then 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.870
 we will need to cut the grouse so 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:15.040
 how do i find him more so gentle 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.040
 onion you made with the first layer of pizza 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:30.460
 the next layer is of course tomatoes 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.460
 slice the tomatoes 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:43.090
 and here you are lucky and go on the bow 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.800
 for the first time a layer of pizza will be vegetable because 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.050
 that the dough is getting so soft 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.020
 gentle do not like that 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.940
 strongly crunchy somewhere on the pizza love 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.340
 Vodka site there to vegetables such 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.530
 delicate here is some water straight super super 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.700
 there will be a combination so that's it 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.140
 do and sausage of course all pass 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:08.560
 we also cut it classically 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:12.130
 oval slice sausage love very 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.550
 finely cut the white house so that she 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:19.200
 just felt nice to them 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.200
 such a kind of smoked buy 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.380
 plentifully sprinkled with cheese pizza 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.000
 send it to the oven at temperature 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.280
 180 degrees for 20 minutes but if you 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.250
 so very strong oven then 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.970
 peeping and somewhere in 15 minutes 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.570

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:51.960
 she turned out so 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:55.340
 below a little bit empty inside the dough I 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.050
 I touched a match that it is such a place. 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.560
 Pavel in the dough and the dough did not stick books 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.940
 she is gentle enough therefore everything 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.970
