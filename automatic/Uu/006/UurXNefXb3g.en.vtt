00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.030 
but I thought I amuse you all by saying
that<00:02:41.209> but<00:02:41.659> it's<00:02:41.840> really<00:02:42.049> simple<00:02:42.409> to<00:02:42.650> do<00:02:42.799> he

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040

just unscrewed the one and screwed this
back<00:02:45.049> on<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:45.470> I'm<00:02:45.560> sure<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:45.799> would<00:02:46.069> have<00:02:46.160> been

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280
