00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.660
 scallops with bacon and duck breast 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.850
 Thai style duck with vegetables at 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.080
 group 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.030
 we will start with the skewer 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.100
 scallops with bacon so take some 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.260
 thin slices of bacon cut therefore at 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.690
 the butcher while surrounds the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.660
 scallop shelled with slice 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.660

 put down your brochettes de saint-jacques 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.270

 fat contained in the art will suffice for 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.390
 to cook we seasoned rats once the 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.990
 first phase of the Saint Jacques will be

 cooked so as not to let the juice out 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.370
 the scallops by the effect of salt 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.420
 we will try as much as possible not too much 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.550
 cooked in Saint Jacques 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:39.080
 if we can too much Saint Jacques she 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.640
 becomes rubbery and tasteless one 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.900
 cook the skewer on all phases 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.400

 despite it must be slightly apparent 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.790
 that is, removing the excess of 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.920
 fat and slightly incised it for the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.990
 squared to be able to melt 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.780
 maximum of greece 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:15.080
 the marinade we take honey sauce 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.610
 soy and some drops of oils from his 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.489
 men after mixing 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:24.290
 so we're going to brush the duck with the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.780
 marinade and the duck is placed on a 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.610
 hot art board 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.650
 we start there skin side for 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.650
 evacuate the maximum of greece 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:39.139
 fifteen thousand of cooking 15 minutes of 

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:42.110
 rest like that the blood that has taken refuge 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.089
 in the center of the meat can be re 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.199
 diffused in the in the flesh and 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:47.199
 tenderize meat m 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.980
 halfway through cooking so we can start to 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.570
 season by cooking each time 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.270

 while while the duck cooked side 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.990
 left of the plancha 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.360
 here we can start cooking 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.590
 vegetables so vegetables cut into 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.970
 fat julienne without fat 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.130
 so let's start with the carrots 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.740
 because the carrot is slightly firmer 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.180
 that other vegetables very good must 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.340
