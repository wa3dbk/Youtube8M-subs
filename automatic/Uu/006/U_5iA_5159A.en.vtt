the strong power but we stopped it and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.680 
the strong power but we stopped it and
then<00:01:41.490> he<00:01:41.580> goes<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.910> quick<00:01:42.209> screen<00:01:42.509> which

then he goes to the quick screen which
actually<00:01:42.959> worked<00:01:43.319> out<00:01:43.410> pretty<00:01:43.590> well<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:43.890> my

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
actually worked out pretty well for my

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.100 
actually worked out pretty well for my
read<00:01:44.459> it<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.819> he<00:01:45.330> did<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.539> good<00:01:45.660> job<00:01:45.720> than<00:01:46.050> i

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
read it but he did a good job than i

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.449 
read it but he did a good job than i
thought<00:01:46.349> we<00:01:46.470> stopped<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:46.950> there<00:01:47.099> on<00:01:47.190> fourth

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
thought we stopped them there on fourth

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.249 
thought we stopped them there on fourth
down<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.849> they<00:01:47.940> reviewed<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.450> overturned<00:01:49.110> it

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
down but they reviewed it overturned it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.620 
down but they reviewed it overturned it
so<00:01:49.470> he<00:01:49.979> keeps<00:01:50.160> going<00:01:50.459> on<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:50.880> less<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.390> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
so he keeps going on the less here and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.440 
so he keeps going on the less here and
now<00:01:52.530> he<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:53.489> you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.789> plenty<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.149> time<00:01:54.300> left

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
now he with you know plenty of time left

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
now he with you know plenty of time left
in<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.720> game<00:01:54.780> i<00:01:54.989> mean<00:01:55.319> he<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:56.399> could<00:01:56.580> have

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
in this game i mean he that could have

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it here but he keeps kind of going back

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319

i mean that's the point of that some

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.150 
i mean that's the point of that some
people<00:02:13.020> can't<00:02:13.200> handle<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.739> some<00:02:13.890> people<00:02:13.980> got

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
but this is a quick game you know I

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.610 
but this is a quick game you know I
figured<00:02:22.270> like<00:02:22.600> if<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.840> games<00:02:23.080> are<00:02:23.200> over<00:02:23.320> four

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
figured like if the games are over four

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.620 
figured like if the games are over four
minutes<00:02:23.800> we'll<00:02:24.550> post<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.910> as<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.060> separate<00:02:25.480> one

and then you know if I got enough time
to<00:02:27.070> get<00:02:27.160> three<00:02:27.430> games<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.090> there's<00:02:28.240> two

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420

try to get a library stocked up and at

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.290 
try to get a library stocked up and at
that<00:02:41.380> point<00:02:41.620> we'll<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.460> some<00:02:42.670> selection<00:02:43.180> on

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
that point we'll have some selection on

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.730 
that point we'll have some selection on
how<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.570> group<00:02:43.870> them<00:02:43.960> together<00:02:44.080> at<00:02:44.530> this

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
how I can group them together at this

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.230 
how I can group them together at this
point<00:02:45.010> I'm<00:02:45.160> ranked<00:02:45.400> somewhere<00:02:45.580> like<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
point I'm ranked somewhere like in the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.780 
point I'm ranked somewhere like in the
low<00:02:46.360> 300s<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.830> I'm<00:02:47.980> still<00:02:48.220> hoping<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.700> you

gotta check the overall leader board to
see<00:02:59.800> how<00:02:59.920> many<00:03:00.040> points<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.460> need<00:03:00.670> but<00:03:01.050> anyway

with that amount of time left because I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.930 
with that amount of time left because I
can't<00:03:14.590> let<00:03:14.740> that<00:03:14.770> type<00:03:15.070> of<00:03:15.100> stuff<00:03:15.340> happen<00:03:15.760> man

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.480 
can't let that type of stuff happen man
especially<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:17.410> know<00:03:17.530> when<00:03:17.920> he<00:03:18.010> goes<00:03:18.190> into

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
especially you know when he goes into

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.220 
especially you know when he goes into
halftime<00:03:18.850> he's<00:03:19.270> getting<00:03:19.540> up<00:03:19.600> or<00:03:19.780> actually<00:03:20.080> I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
halftime he's getting up or actually I

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.540 
halftime he's getting up or actually I
get<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.500> ball<00:03:20.650> coming<00:03:20.950> out<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.190> know<00:03:21.340> he<00:03:21.460> gets

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
get the ball coming out I know he gets

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.730 
get the ball coming out I know he gets
the<00:03:21.700> ball<00:03:21.730> coming<00:03:22.030> out<00:03:22.120> after<00:03:22.270> half<00:03:22.540> but<00:03:22.810> you

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
the ball coming out after half but you

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.290 
the ball coming out after half but you
know<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:24.010> that's<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.370> 14-point<00:03:25.060> swing

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
know that that's like a 14-point swing

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.180 
know that that's like a 14-point swing
right<00:03:25.510> there<00:03:25.540> technically<00:03:26.200> he<00:03:26.800> threw<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.100> the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
right there technically he threw in the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.060 
right there technically he threw in the
coverage<00:03:27.490> was<00:03:27.550> still<00:03:27.850> above<00:03:28.030> completed<00:03:28.510> so

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
coverage was still above completed so

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.770 
coverage was still above completed so
anyway<00:03:30.070> some<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:30.490> got<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.700> deal<00:03:30.820> with<00:03:30.850> but<00:03:31.750> I

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
anyway some we got to deal with but I

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.600 
anyway some we got to deal with but I
got<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.050> stop<00:03:32.290> with<00:03:32.320> maybe<00:03:32.980> Blitzen<00:03:33.400> towards

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
got to stop with maybe Blitzen towards

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.400 
got to stop with maybe Blitzen towards
the<00:03:33.760> end<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.910> half<00:03:34.060> right<00:03:34.300> there<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.720> always<00:03:35.170> hope

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
the end a half right there I always hope

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.690 
the end a half right there I always hope
that<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.560> can<00:03:35.620> get<00:03:35.800> a<00:03:35.830> turnover<00:03:36.100> make<00:03:36.490> them<00:03:36.610> make

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
that I can get a turnover make them make

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.250 
that I can get a turnover make them make
another<00:03:36.940> mistake<00:03:37.090> but<00:03:37.600> sometimes<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.110> just

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
another mistake but sometimes it just

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.840 
another mistake but sometimes it just
doesn't<00:03:38.380> pay<00:03:38.680> off<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:39.160> that's<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:39.700> great

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
doesn't pay off and that's a great

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.470 
doesn't pay off and that's a great
example<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:40.870> up<00:03:41.620> 21-14<00:03:42.070> here<00:03:42.910> he's

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
example of it so up 21-14 here he's

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.960 
example of it so up 21-14 here he's
driving<00:03:43.990> down<00:03:44.140> field<00:03:44.410> ever<00:03:44.650> slow<00:03:44.920> slowly<00:03:45.459> here

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
driving down field ever slow slowly here

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.970
