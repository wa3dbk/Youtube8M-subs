00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.980
 well frame hello today I want to talk about 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.639
 the reproduction of the tracks and the tn cycle 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.830
 ze 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 we will see more about tennis in the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.670
 parasitology classes 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.060
 Today I want to focus on the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.720
 reproduction of these worms beginning our 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.100
 I have already represented here the man 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.610
 have endoparasites and means that 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.239
 they live inside a host and the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.690
 of teniasis is a man 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.519
 the man has presented in the adult state 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.739
 who lives here inside the intestine 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:50.819
 remembering the body of the tile can be 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.100
 divided into head or choose c's that 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:55.949
 presents the suction cups that will be 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.329
 important for fixing the worm in the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.109
 intestine 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.440
 also has the neck region or 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.670
 neck that is that very fine region that 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.939
 is followed by the estrogen 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.000
 we found the 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.880
 productivities that are these segments 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.880
 of the body of the rock and I said that in each 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.969
 problem we found the system 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.210
 male and female reproductive organs 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.530
 This means that the error is 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.710
 aphrodisiacs 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.890
 but with what happens the good fertilization 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.990
 in case you have fertilization happens 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.640
 by self-fertilization usually the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.539
 spermatozoa that are produced in 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.299
 a problem of fertilizing the ova of 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.460
 another pro blog here does not exist 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.399
 cross-recommendation 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.249
 you will also remember that sneakers 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.939
 they are solitary they release substances 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:02.490
 which prevent the development of other 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.369
 so there is no other animal they 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.569
 conduct cross-fertilization the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.930
 process here is by high fertilization after 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.260
 fecundation of the uterus that is 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.230
 problem is filled with eggs 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.120
 one has 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.930
 is capable of producing about 30 to 80 thousand 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.319
 eggs in each tite problem and this high 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.260
 egg production is very important for 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.040
 the continuity of the cycle then has 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.170
 here I represented a prognosis of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.920
 which is full of diamonds 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.290
 these problems can then be 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.549
 give it away and they will be 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.400
 eliminated 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.370
 along with feces these problems says 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.390
 may fall into the environment and free 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.560
 theft or are ingested 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.730
 directly by hosts 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.569
 intermediary in this case there are two 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.590
 types of intermediate hosts 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:14.170
 the first is the ox the ox is the host 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.200
 the intermediary has sage cream these 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:23.819
 animals may then become infected and 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.819
 ingesting the eggs of the sage cream 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:31.870
 the second possibility of the host 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.739
 intermediate is the pig and in this case 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.590
 have the same soleole 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:42.459
 the pig can eat food 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.769
 contaminated with eggs from oil tiles and 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.319
 Here's a tip for you to remember the 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.650
 intermediate host is looking pro at 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.609
 tn name sage nata has the word 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:58.510
 cream that comes from milk and that reminds of cow 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:02.620
 then the cattle are hosts 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.379
 intermediates in the cream and the 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.209
 swine are from soleile tile then here 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:13.329
 are the two intermediate hosts 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.299
 of this disease in the intestines of these animals 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:19.180
 the egg will break free releasing a larva 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.660
 which is called one with the beasts that 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.090
 larva pierces the intestinal wall and falls 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.400
 in the bloodstream it will stay 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.639
 lodged in the muscles and will 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.479
 develop in the lava siege watch 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.789
 the sistems are located in the 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.729
 musculature of these animals 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.370
 they are a miniature already 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:46.090
 the ex choice and a short 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.659
 speech and around the siege there is 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.389
 a visit to the protector and cisticercos 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:56.039
 are in the musculature of the hosts 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:59.319
 intermediates and the meat of such animals 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:02.710
 contaminated products have an aspect of 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:05.789
 and when the man manages this 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.099
 meat full of cysticerci 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:12.430
 the contaminated these errors will fall here 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:15.490
 in the system of management that is 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.330
 intestine until they develop in sneakers 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.520
 adults 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.990
 so the staff here is the cycle of 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.909
 of the tile by remembering that the reproduction 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:30.520
 Sexual these worms happens high 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:34.180
 circulation and how there are 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:40.050
 larvae that cysticercosis 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.050
 development is the type and indirect 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:46.089
 we finish here with the reproduction of the 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.430
 traits and the characteristics of teniasis 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:50.229
 You can see in class 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.599
 parasitology 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:57.750
 Next class we will talk about the 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.750
 Do not miss the screen
