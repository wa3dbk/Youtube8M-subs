00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.000
 fats have for most 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.590
 we a negative connotation but 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.680
 some like the fatty acids 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.720
 polyunsaturates should not acids 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.760
 fatty acids are divided into saturated 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.560
 they provide energy to the organism and 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.420
 unsaturated are responsible for the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.240
 hormone production and in genesis 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.369
 of inflammatory processes within 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.130
 the latter we find the so-called 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.470
 essential fatty acids that can not 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.830
 be produced by man and should be 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.739
 incorporated into the diet are the omega 3 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.070
 and omega 6 that are in the oil of 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.040
 fish and chia oil precursors 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.409
 of the so-called 5 sanz today decomposed 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.049
 that affect various biological processes 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.629
 such as platelet aggregation and 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.519
 contraction of the vessels the disease 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.260
 cardiovascular is the first cause of 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.930
 disease and mortality in the world 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.119
 developed one of the main 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.909
 dietary measures to reduce its 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.729
 risk is the reduction of consumption of 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.070
 Acid- saturated fatty acids 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.690
 omega 3 fatty acids began to be studied 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.240
 in 1970 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.400
 where it was discovered that in certain groups 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.440
 population as the Eskimos of 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.170
 Greenland had low incidence 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.990
 cardiovascular disease and that if these 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.780
 migrated to another place presented the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.000
 same disease incidence where 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.450
 he lived this ruled out the hypothesis 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.610
 genetics and focused on the care of 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.220
 the diet of the Eskimos with high 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.020
 omega 3 content over the years 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.400
 plus the aggregate of the factors of 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.240
 risk like high blood pressure 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.670
 obesity diabetes sedentary lifestyle that a 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.250
 bad feed generate the process 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.320
 atherosclerotic within the interior of 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.320
 the glasses are forming the call 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.540
 atherosclerotic plaque various processes 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.910
 can break it with the consequent 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.150
 obstruction of the vessel with aggregation 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.220
 platelet and vasoconstriction the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.950
 Oxidation of omega-6 have 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.180
 healthy thrombi that produce 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.790
 vasoconstriction and stimulates 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.700
 platelet aggregation and oxidation of 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.400
 the omega-3 generates prostaglandins that 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.730
 they produce vasodilation and inhibit 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.069
 aggregation 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.000
 therefore an increase in his diet 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.799
 of omega 3 has a protective effect 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.290
 this analysis was evidenced in 11,000 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.750
 patients with myocardial infarctions in 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.780
 the gipsy study that showed that those 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.230
 who consumed omega 3 influenced a 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.120
 rabbit 5% the probability of having a 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.860
 sudden death 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.400
 besides the omega-3 have an effect 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.470
 about blood pressure triglycerides 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.810
 cholesterol and an antiarrhythmic effect 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.820
 the chia is a seed that they used 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.190
 mothers and aztecs for their 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.770
 feeding and to prepare certain 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.750
 medicines was fought by the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.030
 conquest for being considered a 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.120
 sacrilege since it was part of 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.900
 religious ceremonies today we know that the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.690
 Chia with almost 65% of its composition 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.630
 in omega 3 is the most important source 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.540
 of this type of fats does not contain 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.110
 cholesterol presents calcium iron and 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.110
 Dietary fiber
