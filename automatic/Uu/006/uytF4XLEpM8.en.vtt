my opponents down with him and to be

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.530 
my opponents down with him and to be
perfectly<00:02:58.320> honest<00:02:58.920> he<00:02:59.100> wasn't<00:02:59.760> as<00:02:59.910> enjoyable

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
perfectly honest he wasn't as enjoyable

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.690 
perfectly honest he wasn't as enjoyable
as<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.930> had<00:03:01.050> hoped<00:03:01.080> for<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:01.650> never<00:03:01.860> less<00:03:02.100> with<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
as I had hoped for but never less with a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.490 
as I had hoped for but never less with a
shot<00:03:03.000> pal<00:03:03.239> with<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> strength<00:03:03.840> he<00:03:03.989> kind<00:03:04.470> of

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
shot pal with the strength he kind of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.080 
shot pal with the strength he kind of
feels<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.800> little<00:03:04.950> bit<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:05.280> Ibrahimovic<00:03:05.880> of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
feels a little bit like Ibrahimovic of

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.360 
feels a little bit like Ibrahimovic of
course<00:03:06.390> not<00:03:06.720> nearly<00:03:07.080> as<00:03:07.200> good<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:08.100> course

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
course not nearly as good and of course

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.770 
course not nearly as good and of course
even<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.910> little<00:03:09.090> bit<00:03:09.209> slower<00:03:09.570> than

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
even a little bit slower than

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.870 
even a little bit slower than
Ibrahimovic<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.680> he<00:03:10.890> was<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.489> of<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.670> letdown

actually i was a little bit surprised

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.410 
actually i was a little bit surprised
when<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.430> looked<00:03:44.640> at<00:03:44.700> his<00:03:44.850> name's<00:03:45.180> dance

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
when I looked at his name's dance

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.060 
when I looked at his name's dance
because<00:03:45.780> before<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.200> played<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.680> him<00:03:46.739> I

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
because before I played with him I

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.300 
because before I played with him I
didn't<00:03:47.370> on<00:03:48.299> purpose<00:03:48.360> actually<00:03:49.110> check<00:03:49.890> out<00:03:50.100> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
didn't on purpose actually check out the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.100 
didn't on purpose actually check out the
in<00:03:50.459> games<00:03:50.700> deaths<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.120> these<00:03:51.239> players<00:03:51.540> just<00:03:51.900> to

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
in games deaths of these players just to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.650 
in games deaths of these players just to
find<00:03:52.380> out<00:03:52.590> how<00:03:52.860> they<00:03:53.070> are<00:03:53.250> without<00:03:53.760> really<00:03:54.150> yet

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
find out how they are without really yet

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.030 
find out how they are without really yet
knowing<00:03:54.840> about<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.260> in<00:03:55.380> game<00:03:55.560> stats<00:03:55.830> before

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
knowing about the in game stats before

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.820 
knowing about the in game stats before
so<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.519> wouldn't<00:03:56.850> have<00:03:56.940> any<00:03:57.180> influence<00:03:57.830> yes

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
so I wouldn't have any influence yes

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.920 
so I wouldn't have any influence yes
subconsciously<00:03:59.489> in<00:03:59.640> my<00:03:59.790> mind<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.269> actually

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
subconsciously in my mind and actually

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.539 
subconsciously in my mind and actually
thought<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.350> his<00:04:01.440> acceleration<00:04:02.070> was<00:04:02.220> pretty

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
thought that his acceleration was pretty

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.310 
thought that his acceleration was pretty
decent<00:04:02.700> by<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.030> top<00:04:03.330> end<00:04:03.570> speed<00:04:03.600> was<00:04:04.019> very

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
decent by the top end speed was very

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.560 
decent by the top end speed was very
very<00:04:04.410> poor<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.040> then<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.519> found<00:04:05.820> out<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.120> his

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
very poor and then I found out that his

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.840 
very poor and then I found out that his
acceleration<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.530> actually<00:04:07.860> 67<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.760> his

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
acceleration is actually 67 and his

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.000 
acceleration is actually 67 and his
prints<00:04:09.150> be<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.360> 72<00:04:09.870> which<00:04:10.079> surprised<00:04:10.769> me<00:04:10.980> a

that's<00:04:47.330> maybe<00:04:48.050> due<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.680> fact<00:04:48.860> that<00:04:49.039> I

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
that's maybe due to the fact that I

up<00:06:29.330> later<00:06:29.750> on<00:06:30.110> in<00:06:30.470> fifa<00:06:30.919> 13<00:06:30.949> maybe<00:06:31.490> combine<00:06:32.180> him

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
up later on in fifa 13 maybe combine him

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.899 
up later on in fifa 13 maybe combine him
with<00:06:32.479> another<00:06:33.050> faster<00:06:33.680> striker<00:06:33.949> because<00:06:34.729> this

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
with another faster striker because this

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:36.279 
with another faster striker because this
is<00:06:35.000> kind<00:06:35.210> of<00:06:35.240> my<00:06:35.419> conclusion<00:06:35.990> on<00:06:36.110> this

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
is kind of my conclusion on this

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.680 
is kind of my conclusion on this
partnership<00:06:36.740> it<00:06:36.979> was<00:06:37.130> okay<00:06:37.550> to<00:06:37.580> play<00:06:37.880> with<00:06:38.150> it

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
partnership it was okay to play with it

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.810 
partnership it was okay to play with it
was<00:06:38.840> very<00:06:39.020> difficult<00:06:39.289> to<00:06:39.650> have<00:06:39.889> to<00:06:40.310> place<00:06:40.610> with

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
was very difficult to have to place with

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.380 
was very difficult to have to place with
under

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.390 
under

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.110 
under
he<00:06:41.660> pays<00:06:41.930> I<00:06:42.200> know<00:06:42.410> this<00:06:42.680> may<00:06:43.280> be<00:06:43.310> sounding<00:06:43.820> kind

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
he pays I know this may be sounding kind

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.780 
he pays I know this may be sounding kind
of<00:06:44.180> like<00:06:44.300> a<00:06:44.330> piss<00:06:44.690> whore<00:06:45.020> but<00:06:45.320> I<00:06:45.560> actually<00:06:46.370> am

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
of like a piss whore but I actually am

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.790 
of like a piss whore but I actually am
not<00:06:47.090> like<00:06:47.360> that<00:06:47.390> if<00:06:47.690> you<00:06:47.780> know<00:06:47.930> my<00:06:48.110> videos<00:06:48.470> then

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
not like that if you know my videos then

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.640 
not like that if you know my videos then
I<00:06:48.980> am<00:06:49.370> NOT<00:06:50.000> always<00:06:50.240> going<00:06:50.780> for<00:06:51.020> the<00:06:51.170> fastest

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
I am NOT always going for the fastest

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.590 
I am NOT always going for the fastest
players<00:06:51.950> but<00:06:52.580> especially<00:06:52.790> after<00:06:53.210> not<00:06:53.450> having

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
players but especially after not having

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.420 
players but especially after not having
played<00:06:53.960> fifa<00:06:54.200> for<00:06:54.470> a<00:06:54.500> couple<00:06:54.830> of<00:06:54.920> weeks<00:06:54.980> and

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
played fifa for a couple of weeks and

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.580

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
then when you have two very slow players

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.740 
then when you have two very slow players
up<00:06:57.830> front<00:06:58.250> it's<00:06:58.490> just<00:06:58.580> sometimes<00:06:59.240> gets<00:06:59.570> very

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
up front it's just sometimes gets very

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.330 
up front it's just sometimes gets very
very<00:06:59.960> difficult<00:07:00.110> to<00:07:00.380> break<00:07:00.620> down<00:07:00.800> five<00:07:01.130> at<00:07:01.310> the

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
very difficult to break down five at the

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.490 
very difficult to break down five at the
back<00:07:01.430> team's<00:07:01.850> full<00:07:02.450> Brazilian<00:07:02.930> teams<00:07:03.230> or
