00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.279
 another technique 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.279
 gets complicated 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.430
 is that the trio is really the coach 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.819

 and some by the artist 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.719
 and I also think the side that needs the most 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.719
 the mix you make does not change the code 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.490

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.879
 in another more loose act 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.960
 written above 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.789

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.129
 avoid 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.139
 and this is what shows the critical process in the interval 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.710
 the stage of the video cinema irs 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.740

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.069
 year to date 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.629
