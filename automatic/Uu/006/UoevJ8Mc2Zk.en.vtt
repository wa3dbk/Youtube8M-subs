00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
macro view kind of silly but a macro few

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.549 
macro view kind of silly but a macro few
of<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.759> KNN<00:00:06.240> 85<00:00:06.720> millimeter<00:00:08.420> 1.2<00:00:09.420> L<00:00:09.630> version<00:00:10.260> 2

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559

of the KNN 85 millimeter 1.2 L version 2
lens<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.610> do<00:00:11.670> have<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> lens<00:00:12.330> filter<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:12.960> there

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
lens I do have a lens filter on there

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.550 
lens I do have a lens filter on there
not<00:00:14.940> about<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.360> videos<00:00:15.750> not<00:00:15.780> about<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.320> but

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
not about this videos not about it but

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.349 
not about this videos not about it but
just<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.369> know<00:00:17.460> there's<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.060> bit<00:00:18.180> of

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
just so you know there's a little bit of

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.210 
just so you know there's a little bit of
an<00:00:18.449> extra<00:00:18.800> extension<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:22.220> it's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
an extra extension I have going on it's

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.999 
an extra extension I have going on it's
a<00:00:23.900> 72<00:00:25.099> millimeter<00:00:27.619> lens<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.970> big<00:00:31.009> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
a 72 millimeter lens so it is big and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.020 
a 72 millimeter lens so it is big and
it's<00:00:32.640> heavy

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it's heavy

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.670 
it's heavy
you<00:00:33.360> barely<00:00:33.660> fit<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.050> thing<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.350> frame<00:00:34.649> here

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
you barely fit this thing in frame here

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.260 
you barely fit this thing in frame here
but<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:41.000> kind<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> back

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
but you can see the kind of the back

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.139 
but you can see the kind of the back
side<00:00:42.629> over<00:00:42.660> there<00:00:42.960> 85<00:00:43.379> millimeter<00:00:44.030> got<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
side over there 85 millimeter got the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
side over there 85 millimeter got the
distance<00:00:45.600> information<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:49.079> got<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.620> auto

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
distance information you got the auto

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.430 
distance information you got the auto
focus<00:00:50.550> manual<00:00:51.180> focus<00:00:52.520> you've<00:00:53.520> got<00:00:53.699> this

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
focus manual focus you've got this

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.709 
focus manual focus you've got this
curved<00:00:55.440> or<00:00:56.160> indentation<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> actual<00:00:57.539> lens

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
curved or indentation on the actual lens

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.569 
curved or indentation on the actual lens
so<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.140> entirely<00:00:58.500> circular<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> way

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
so it's not entirely circular on the way

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.360 
so it's not entirely circular on the way
on<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> back<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.590> still<00:01:01.590> very<00:01:01.620> smooth<00:01:02.129> but

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
on the back of it still very smooth but

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450 
on the back of it still very smooth but
not<00:01:02.579> completely<00:01:03.890> circular<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.159> think<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
not completely circular and I think that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.460 
not completely circular and I think that
just<00:01:05.489> makes<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> easier<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.299> hold<00:01:09.200> mount<00:01:10.200> what

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
just makes it easier to hold mount what

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.399 
just makes it easier to hold mount what
I<00:01:10.500> could<00:01:10.650> spend<00:01:10.799> whatever<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.290> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
I could spend whatever and that's it you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.640 
I could spend whatever and that's it you
have<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.220> focusing<00:01:14.760> ring<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.119> course<00:01:15.650> if

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
have the the focusing ring of course if

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.390 
have the the focusing ring of course if
you<00:01:16.830> need<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:19.049> lens<00:01:19.350> itself<00:01:19.740> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you need to do that the lens itself you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
you need to do that the lens itself you
can<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.140> extended

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
can see it's it's kind of it's extended

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.130 
can see it's it's kind of it's extended
here<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.280> when<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> focuses<00:01:24.420> it'll<00:01:24.720> come<00:01:24.930> out

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
here so when it focuses it'll come out

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.280 
here so when it focuses it'll come out
and<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.490> kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.060> how<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> left

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and this is just kind of how I left

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.789 
and this is just kind of how I left
lasted<00:01:28.950> used<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.780> extended<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.650> will

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
lasted used it so it is extended it will

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.090 
lasted used it so it is extended it will
roll<00:01:32.009> back<00:01:32.040> based<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> focus<00:01:34.100> its

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
roll back based on the focus its

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.660 
roll back based on the focus its
electronically<00:01:35.970> controlled<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.490> it's<00:01:38.490> not

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
electronically controlled so it's not

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.060 
electronically controlled so it's not
plugged<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.210> obviously<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.020> don't<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:40.979> to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
plugged in now obviously I don't want to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
plugged in now obviously I don't want to
I<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.150> will<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.899> won't<00:01:43.110> roll<00:01:43.380> back

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
I don't think it will we won't roll back

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.139 
I don't think it will we won't roll back
anyways<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.970> focusing<00:01:45.509> has<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.490> done<00:01:47.490> when

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
anyways the focusing has to be done when

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.139 
anyways the focusing has to be done when
plugged<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.500> your<00:01:49.710> camera<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
plugged in to your camera with the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.050 
plugged in to your camera with the
camera<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.950> that's<00:01:52.950> actually<00:01:53.369> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.729> drag

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
camera on that's actually kind of a drag

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.050 
camera on that's actually kind of a drag
I<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.140> much<00:01:55.700> I'm<00:01:56.700> sure<00:01:56.939> they

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I don't like that as much I'm sure they

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.810 
I don't like that as much I'm sure they
had<00:01:57.180> their<00:01:57.299> reasons<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.810> doing<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.820> but

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
had their reasons for doing that but

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.670 
had their reasons for doing that but
obviously<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.420> can't<00:02:00.689> really<00:02:00.869> roll<00:02:01.200> back<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
obviously I can't really roll back the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.459 
obviously I can't really roll back the
lens<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.430> wanted<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.259> not

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
lens here if I wanted to now is this not

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.700 
lens here if I wanted to now is this not
plugged<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.909> other<00:02:06.090> thing<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.439> seem<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.469> be

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
plugged in the other thing I seem to be

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.969 
plugged in the other thing I seem to be
finding<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.759> shoot<00:02:08.970> video<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.780> this

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
finding is if I shoot video with this

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.070 
finding is if I shoot video with this
lenz<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:12.150> my<00:02:12.360> Canon<00:02:12.810> 5d<00:02:13.800> Mark<00:02:13.980> -<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:15.330> seems<00:02:15.900> as

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
lenz with my Canon 5d Mark - it seems as

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.920 
lenz with my Canon 5d Mark - it seems as
though<00:02:16.200> because<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.680> computer-controlled

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
though because it's computer-controlled

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.500 
though because it's computer-controlled
the<00:02:18.930> focusing<00:02:19.530> there's<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.129> slight<00:02:20.519> delay<00:02:20.849> so

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the focusing there's a slight delay so

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.970 
the focusing there's a slight delay so
when<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.690> turn<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> focus<00:02:22.680> ring<00:02:24.739> it's<00:02:25.739> not

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
when I turn the focus ring it's not

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.800 
when I turn the focus ring it's not
immediate<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.580> seems<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:26.909> computer<00:02:27.480> has<00:02:27.599> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
immediate it seems like computer has to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.550 
immediate it seems like computer has to
process<00:02:28.790> what's<00:02:29.790> being<00:02:30.090> focused<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.200> it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
process what's being focused so that it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.949 
process what's being focused so that it
seems<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.280> maybe<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.940> particular<00:02:33.390> lens<00:02:33.750> is

you'll<00:03:26.910> have<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.239> judge<00:03:27.799> judge<00:03:28.799> from<00:03:29.069> that

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
you'll have to judge judge from that

you'll have to judge judge from that
I'll<00:03:31.829> do<00:03:32.040> another<00:03:32.220> video<00:03:32.459> comparing<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.299> to

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
I'll do another video comparing this to

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.690 
I'll do another video comparing this to
the<00:03:33.540> 50<00:03:33.959> millimeter<00:03:34.169> and<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.919> guess<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.370> buying

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
the 50 millimeter and I guess the buying

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.229 
the 50 millimeter and I guess the buying
decision<00:03:36.739> because<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.859> did<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.310> also<00:03:38.669> have<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
decision because I did I also have the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.520 
decision because I did I also have the
50<00:03:39.540> millimeter<00:03:40.099> and<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.609> bought<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:41.970> first

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
50 millimeter and I bought that first

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.830 
50 millimeter and I bought that first
thinking<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:45.060> may<00:03:45.269> have<00:03:45.389> been<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.660> way<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
thinking that may have been the way to

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.580 
thinking that may have been the way to
go<00:03:47.120> but<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.630> know<00:03:48.660> for<00:03:48.900> whatever<00:03:49.079> reason<00:03:49.500> I

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
go but I you know for whatever reason I

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.920 
go but I you know for whatever reason I
broke<00:03:49.829> down<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.280> got<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.639> 85<00:03:51.030> millimeter<00:03:51.599> a

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
broke down and got the 85 millimeter a

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.420 
broke down and got the 85 millimeter a
long<00:03:52.739> time<00:03:53.010> later<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:55.010> this<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.190> just

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
long time later and this is just

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.159 
long time later and this is just
different<00:03:56.700> this<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.389> completely<00:03:57.900> different

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169

death

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.140 
death
to<00:04:51.169> focus<00:04:51.440> this<00:04:51.770> thing<00:04:52.720> but<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.900> lens<00:04:55.150> mount

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
that and it's big expose so you have to

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.640 
that and it's big expose so you have to
be<00:05:05.600> highly<00:05:05.930> careful<00:05:06.590> putting<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:08.630> lens<00:05:09.199> onto
