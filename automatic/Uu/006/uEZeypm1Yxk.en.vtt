00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.450
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.940
 It is the end of the world rubber market 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.500
 This time 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.860
 I would like to do to say I practice way to become stronger in schools and club leaders must not have 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.860
 I'm sorry 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:31.090
 In a school where there are not many table tennis experts who do not have a leader, it is the first issue 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.090
 I think it is a practice menu 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.340
 Of course I also need the technology 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.060
 At first it is by putting together a menu firmly and practicing 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.390
 In practice a little bit 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:53.200
 Even if you get into it, you can use it for the game to reduce that mistake 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:01:01.380
 It will be easier to win the game by practicing 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:05.070
 So I think that I would like to explain how to live the practice this time 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:10.960
 Then it will be the first point 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:15.659
 The first point is to make a menu 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.659
 First of all how should I make a menu? 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.310
 First of all 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.800
 It can be divided into four major items 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.170
 One is basic practice 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.440
 Well long forehand 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.360
 Backhand 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.570
 It's like continuing 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.560
 It has become the basic practice of Tteyuu 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.220
 The second item is footwork and switching 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.280
 One by one in the foreground 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.750
 It is the practice of switching the background or combining it 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.750
 Please do 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.650
 Third 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.180
 Items 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.560
 It will be practice for the game 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.799
 It's a bit wary here and it's a treat 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.789
 3rd ball from serve from there 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.789
 Please practice the 4th ball from receive well 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.290
 The last fourth item is the fourth floor 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.290
 It becomes like a game practice 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:32.859
 Here Toka or try to go to the practical that you have practice firm is 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:32.859
 I think it is better to say that you try to practice in the club while also practicing the development of the game . 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.799
 This will be the big four items for making the practice menu 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.680
 Its basic practice and footwork 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.920
 About one item of practice for the game 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.920
 I say I think when so separated by 5 to 10 minutes 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:01.390
 Second point 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.390
 This will create goals and count numbers 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.490
 At first Forelong For example , if it has only lasted about 10 times until now, the first is 30 times 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.920
 I will continue 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.890
 In saying 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.330
 As it continues , it only makes you realize that it is reflected in a place easy to hit the other party rhythmically 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.710
 It will be 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:25.460
 By counting firmly 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:29.390
 It is a form that water will decrease by continuing it 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:34.890
 First of all it's a basic practice If this comes to stick 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:38.040
 Please to challenge by counting the number also that footwork is difficult, such as switching 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:43.440
 For example if it is the third ball elsewhere 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:49.740
 Goal of hitting 10 times and putting 15 times of them 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:52.170
 It goes as it is possible to raise the probability as much as possible how much it can be practically used in the game 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.910
 Please try 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.250
 Next is the third point 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:02.970
 The third point of the 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.970
 I will be trying to renew my goal every time 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:16.150
 Of course there is a goal to continue for example 30 times, and if it lasts 30 times , try the next 50 times 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:22.990
 Please go to more and more evolved more and more goals to Fu that try to continue 100 times 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.740
 For one is improvement of the basic technology, such as footwork and switching but that I goal of how to make 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.270
 is not it 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:34.020
 Well as many times as I said now 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:38.419
 A little more spread out and try Toka target because until now was wearing at the footwork the distance in this about 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.419
 Please always do new and try 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.280
 Another 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.170
 Looking back at the tournament etc. 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.249
 Make a goal to develop a good place where the game was good 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:58.129
 Please give me 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:05:00.300
 For example, Tsutuki usually continues in practice, but because it does not go out firmly when it becomes a match 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.840
 In struck a third pitch attack 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.500
 If you say 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:10.450
 For example, let's make it go off before the next tournament 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.450
 Please be able to firmly 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.940
 If you are not good at attacking the third ball elsewhere 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:24.150
 Send me a tough tsutuki 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:29.120
 And the third pitch attack it by that go what this put whether to little by little target evolution 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.120
 It will have been helpful be sure to match, 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:37.240
 This way it is better for you to win the game yourself, even without the current car teacher or leader 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.620
 What to do in order to 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:47.320
 Be sure to think about the menu like 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:49.580
 Rather than giving up just because there is no leader who can level up, I myself 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.240
 Should become stronger how can I make sure that in our 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.110
 Please think about it and try 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.110
 Please do your best
