really<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> instructions<00:00:23.580> when<00:00:23.760> they

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
really is in the instructions when they

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.359 
really is in the instructions when they

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
picked up some small gauge wire I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.650 
picked up some small gauge wire I
secured<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.559> loop<00:00:40.829> around<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.460> pen<00:00:41.670> or<00:00:42.480> some

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660

you know if you have any sort of small
circular<00:00:44.910> object<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.480> wrapped<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> around<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
circular object I wrapped it around a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.880 
circular object I wrapped it around a
few<00:00:46.530> times<00:00:46.789> slipped<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.200> I've<00:00:49.200> looped<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
few times slipped it off I've looped the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
few times slipped it off I've looped the
loose<00:00:50.219> wire<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:51.030> around<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
loose wire there around all of them a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260 
loose wire there around all of them a
couple<00:00:52.230> times<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.860> created<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.370> stem<00:00:53.760> by

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
couple times I created a little stem by

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.700 
couple times I created a little stem by
twisting<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:54.989> wires<00:00:55.199> together

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
twisting the two wires together

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.029 
twisting the two wires together
I<00:00:55.890> got<00:00:56.430> fancy<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> made<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> leaf<00:00:57.590> then<00:00:58.590> pulled

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
I got fancy I made a leaf then pulled

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.610 
I got fancy I made a leaf then pulled
down<00:00:59.250> each<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.760> my<00:00:59.879> loops<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.469> twisted<00:01:01.469> them

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
down each of my loops and twisted them

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.850 
down each of my loops and twisted them
individually<00:01:02.550> into<00:01:02.820> petal<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
individually into petal now I'm not the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.789 
individually into petal now I'm not the
master<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.580> wire<00:01:05.970> craps<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.290> man<00:01:07.470> vs.

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
master of wire craps and this man vs.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
master of wire craps and this man vs.
pin<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:09.119> perfecting<00:01:09.659> pedals<00:01:10.020> in

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
pin is not about perfecting pedals in

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.710 
pin is not about perfecting pedals in
the<00:01:10.650> end<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.100> got<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.520> thing<00:01:11.790> which<00:01:12.240> looks

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the end I got this thing which looks

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.340 
the end I got this thing which looks
more<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> four-leaf<00:01:14.250> clover<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.900> it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
more like a four-leaf clover do it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.260 
more like a four-leaf clover do it
so<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> busted<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.460> nail<00:01:17.640> polish<00:01:17.970> just

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
so I busted out the nail polish just

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
so I busted out the nail polish just
your<00:01:18.479> regular<00:01:19.049> run-of-the-mill<00:01:19.590> bottle<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
your regular run-of-the-mill bottle and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.270 
your regular run-of-the-mill bottle and
began<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.600> paint<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.650> leaves

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
began to paint on the leaves

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.859 
began to paint on the leaves
alright<00:01:23.939> I'm<00:01:24.030> painting<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> edges<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
alright I'm painting the edges and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.560 
alright I'm painting the edges and
hoping<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.680> maybe<00:01:25.909> build<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
hoping that I can maybe build up the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.240 
hoping that I can maybe build up the
Polish<00:01:28.850> somehow<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.390> spread<00:01:30.900> it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
Polish somehow there and then spread it

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.880 
Polish somehow there and then spread it
across<00:01:32.360> kind<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> making<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.229> this

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
across kind of making this like this

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.660 
across kind of making this like this
thin<00:01:35.700> film<00:01:35.729> run<00:01:36.659> across<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.439> not

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
thin film run across it that's not

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.510 
thin film run across it that's not
that's<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.820> working

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
that's not working

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.830 
that's not working
every<00:01:41.520> reason<00:01:41.850> why<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> thought<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.600> pin

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
every reason why you thought this pin

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.039 
every reason why you thought this pin
was<00:01:43.020> BS<00:01:43.320> when<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.829> saw<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.509> exactly<00:01:45.509> true

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
was BS when you saw it is exactly true

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.450 
was BS when you saw it is exactly true
I<00:01:46.079> even<00:01:46.500> tried<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.770> different<00:01:46.950> brand<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.399> little

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
I even tried a different brand a little

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
I even tried a different brand a little
bit<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.759> expensive<00:01:48.000> same<00:01:48.420> thing<00:01:48.630> nothing

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
bit more expensive same thing nothing

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
bit more expensive same thing nothing
that's<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> good<00:01:50.759> thing<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.939> did<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> little

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that's a good thing I did a little

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.030 
that's a good thing I did a little
digging<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.750> found<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.170> video<00:01:52.470> over<00:01:52.829> on

easy myWorld she does it absolutely no
problem<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.939> here's<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.869> secret<00:01:58.549> glue<00:01:59.549> with

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
problem but here's the secret glue with

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.760 
problem but here's the secret glue with
a<00:02:00.149> bottle<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.390> Eileen's<00:02:00.780> glue<00:02:01.020> which<00:02:01.320> she<00:02:01.560> said

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
a bottle of Eileen's glue which she said

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.219 
a bottle of Eileen's glue which she said
was<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> best<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.399> slowly<00:02:03.149> was<00:02:03.420> able<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.780> build

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
was the best I slowly was able to build

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.530 
was the best I slowly was able to build
up<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> glue<00:02:04.740> spread<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.820> over<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.210> pedals

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
up the glue spread it on over the pedals

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.199 
up the glue spread it on over the pedals
with<00:02:06.719> these<00:02:06.979> no<00:02:07.979> problem<00:02:08.399> created<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.090> little

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
with these no problem created a little

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.450 
with these no problem created a little
film<00:02:09.539> that's<00:02:09.750> stretched<00:02:10.050> across<00:02:10.200> it

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
film that's stretched across it

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.640 
film that's stretched across it
so<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:12.270> doesn't<00:02:12.510> take<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> lot<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.930> glue<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.350> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
so it doesn't take a lot of glue and you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.990 
so it doesn't take a lot of glue and you
got<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.950> give<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.250> minute<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.520> get<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> hang

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
got to give it a minute to get the hang

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.720 
got to give it a minute to get the hang
of<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:16.440> slowly<00:02:16.800> carry<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.520> glue

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
of it you just slowly carry the glue

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.450 
of it you just slowly carry the glue
over<00:02:18.180> from<00:02:18.480> one<00:02:18.750> side<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.980> pedal<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
over from one side of the pedal to the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.250 
over from one side of the pedal to the
other<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.390> after<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.690> first<00:02:21.810> couple

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
other you get it after the first couple

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.680 
other you get it after the first couple
and<00:02:22.410> then<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.620> gets<00:02:22.770> really<00:02:22.950> easy<00:02:23.190> then<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.450> let

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
and then it gets really easy then I let

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.210 
and then it gets really easy then I let
him<00:02:24.780> drive<00:02:24.990> for<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> few<00:02:25.380> hours<00:02:25.500> until<00:02:25.860> they

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
him drive for a few hours until they

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.270 
him drive for a few hours until they
turned<00:02:26.430> clear<00:02:26.850> pretty<00:02:27.600> awesome

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
turned clear pretty awesome

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.560 
turned clear pretty awesome
then<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.490> easily<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.120> paint<00:02:30.300> down<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
then you easily just paint down the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.300 
then you easily just paint down the
color<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.870> want<00:02:31.020> covering<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.830> front<00:02:31.980> and
