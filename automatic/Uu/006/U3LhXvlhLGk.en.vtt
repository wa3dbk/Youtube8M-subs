but not too much so here I have five
products<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.840> would<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.350> perfect<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.370> gym

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
products that would be perfect for a gym

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.450 
products that would be perfect for a gym
look<00:00:39.200> it's<00:00:40.200> kind<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> no-makeup<00:00:41.250> look

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
look it's kind of like a no-makeup look

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
look it's kind of like a no-makeup look
actually<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.050> start<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.649> foundation

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
actually so we start with a foundation

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760 
actually so we start with a foundation
primer<00:00:44.760> good<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:45.750> about<00:00:45.840> primers<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.680> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
primer good thing about primers if you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
primer good thing about primers if you
look<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:48.950> like<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:51.239> goes<00:00:51.570> on

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
look at it like that and it goes on

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.170 
look at it like that and it goes on
colorless<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.980> reason<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
colorless and the reason for this is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.720 
colorless and the reason for this is
that<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.559> mattify<00:00:55.980> uses<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that it's just there to mattify uses it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.360 
that it's just there to mattify uses it
basically<00:00:57.239> preps<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.780> face<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.379> foundation

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
basically preps your face for foundation

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.760 
basically preps your face for foundation
later<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.690> case<00:01:00.960> we're<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.590> really

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
later on in this case we're not really

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.349 
later on in this case we're not really
going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> use<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> thick<00:01:02.489> foundation<00:01:02.699> but
