00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 Hello everyone today I want to talk about 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.110
 your gifts from the company oriflame 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.049
 cosmetics pallets are powered so 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.960
 so lachik which are made of some kind 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.050
 leatherette so quilted 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 has a handle for easy carrying and two 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.510
 zippered compartments 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:33.120
 I already undid for convenience so 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:37.340
 let's start now i will install the camera like so 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.350
 we will look then go to this 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.989
 branch with us but on the bush I like 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.600
 here you see the card compartment 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.579
 by itself this compartment c is pretty 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.280
 I do n't know if it's narrow here. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.500
 will put mascara too let's say 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.750
 there was a complete set of cosmetics on 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.559
 most likely there is nothing there will not fit 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.320
 more mean and here and here mirror 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.379
 she is not in full lid it is closed yet 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.100
 film will not dwell on the mirror 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.729
 zerta it says how much and what is there 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.750
 there is such a protective protective 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.500
 plenochka so let's see 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:27.580
 then there are 15 shades of shadows in the shadows 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:30.040
 we are on 05 grams written here and I 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.260
 looked now not visible at day time 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.960
 light and watched 3 skilful lighting 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.790
 almost all of them are brilliant 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.160
 mother-of-pearl such shadows are only 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.619
 the shadows are almost matte but not quite 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.190
 matte then blue 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.580
 In general, I can say look at 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.580
 shade 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.840
 their pigmentation is normal 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.810
 but I can already see this 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.679
 purple will crumble and dust 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.789
 also this green and black is possible 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.090
 what it will be possible 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.369
 and enjoy quite successfully but 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.870
 and I will say from previous experience I had 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.540
 the palette with he somehow so subsided my 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.730
 called liselotte watkins in my 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.410
 white such folding places on it 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.090
 separate here so the shadows there 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.730
 almost well here are the same 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.280
 quality there are some dust 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.319
 from some showered by me which 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.640
 can be used but very small 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.849
 a small amount further here are two more 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.500
 Rouge but again, brighter than a little color than 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:47.459
 should camera blush and powder blush and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.650
 powder has such sateen sateen 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.940
 such a texture 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.930
 practically cameras they catch this 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.239
 here is some pink color 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.180
 it's more like a peach so pink 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.889
 but the powder beautifully of course made it 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.459
 stamping well I can not imagine how you can 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:07.079
 let's say that's powder use that 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.079
 there is some need to take sponzhik 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:14.160
 small and perverted him already sorry 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:20.250
 but to others this word cannot be called further 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.410
 here in kit whale tassels tassel 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.230
 for lips 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:30.150
 Edna applicator and gloss and lipstick 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.880
 so I want to say yes you are here 2 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:42.269
 grams 2 grams of powder and 2 bed 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:46.500
 blush shine here we have 10 pieces of 0 3 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.859
 gram means as with network days well 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:54.599
 can be seen at evening I have considered 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:57.030
 these four shades of lipstick or gloss 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.630
 they don't have all the world in the same 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.859
 the rest here and 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.380
 can be disassembled with the naked eye 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.820
 sparkles 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.009
 so I think the texture wise will not 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.109
 Especially this but you can try sister 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.590
 titles 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:16.280
 he is pretty normal 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.280
 fatty easily taken 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.570
 finger and think so here it is here four 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.400
 These are all such lipsticks and these are sparkles but 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.120
 it we must be hurt then we all 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.100
 tried 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.070
 and then I will tell you as so soon 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.930
 Immediately I can not say let's say this 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.120
 love this cool thing of course not 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.180
 I am very glad of course I wanted this 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.580
 some investor to have i dream to go 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.100
 somewhere abroad and in duty free 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.310
 buy someone there dior vyatka 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.580
 us couture colex it is also such 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.860
 dior depositor 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.930
 black buttoning of course chic 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.030
 new until you can order oriflame 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.860
 confine until no money and no 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.229
 opportunities to go and take air is 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.160
 I buy myself so of course 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.990
 paletochku will test them well, I will tell 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.610
 I think that she certainly has flaws 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.370
 and not everyone here I will use 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.870
 but of course they want the colors of the shadows and 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.880
 that's not everything except this one 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.740
 blue 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.050
 blue gamma but the rest i 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:27.030
 I'm sure there will be some shades 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:30.150
 and glasses to the shadows I will not touch the general coma 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.490
 Interesting ask questions myself 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.800
