00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.319
 so welcome to the for the first 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.730
 tutor to lend me your george's eyes 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.269
 chelon who was asked 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.219
 so here it is then what are we 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.410
 will see we will see the work with the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.500
 setting up agreements on the couple 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.029
 and is the rub version so here is the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.050
 version 1 pg we'll see it later because 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.640
 that she is interesting 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.189
 it is absolutely necessary to make it bites itself 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.260
 win a lot to be arpeggiated and but 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.939
 how much bass so we'll do it 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.480
 after and then in another turn 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.210
 we will work the chorus with the final 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.960
 then the original pieces and in if 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.469
 flat major 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.469
 so that 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.410
 not like that involves a lot of bars 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.690
 and the solution we use a rollover 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.329
 will be the third box we go into 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.370
 ground position and one is always in 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.809
 actually does it up to siebel 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.820
 major so we will work pieces in 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.190
 ground position if you want in 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.390
 moments sung with the original of 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 george chelon must you put 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.049
 capo third position 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.070
 and if you do not have a capo and 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.829
 well for now we're going 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.030
 work it in position 0 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.270
 so here are the chords we need 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.520
 for the for the couple and the introduction 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.060
 we go directly coupled so 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.060
 G major 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.390
 E minor 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.200
 the minor 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.189
 17 that is, and that's yann on 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.750
 so I remember that for theirs and 7th 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.640
 the D major the D minor 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.619
 we never touch the core 2 duo because 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.420
 that we are not part of the agreement is 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.610
 here the position for the rest and y mc 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.610
 the cases these 2 1 and 2 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.130
 then we need a major rate 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.090
 and that's it for the couple and that's it 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.180
 then there is also the g plus alone 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.500
 increase and I will talk about 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.790
 will do the psg arts succeed for now 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.400
 you do instead are insolent 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.200
 on the usual major then setting 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.030
 place of words is first what we 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.580
 will do whenever the agreement is 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.200
 noted traveling umg it's a measure that 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.840
 made 4 beats so four shots to the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.000
 down and every time she fires him and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.110
 this is where we make changes 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.730
 agreements you see for the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.920
 first post hand glass on my shoulder 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.209
 the little shot is before the first 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.420
 syllable so we will hit but the agreement 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.790
 before for your hand on my shoulder and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.920
 let's go a long way and at the end of the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.209
 couple and you will notice that the 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.739
 chords they have a little slash so 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.090
 it's not at all a notation a 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.950
 official convention 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.080
 it's just me who wrote this down 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.760
 it means that there the agreements they do not 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.500
 do that time a half measure so at 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.170
 the end where that they all have a little slash 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.489
 so of time and when he noticed I 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.280
 more when I tell you you do it at the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.830
 place to a single then replaced speech 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.700
 jan aps the beginning 1 2 3 4 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.700
 posada hand on my shoulder 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.069
 and go a little way 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.360
 we go 1 I advise you to hit 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.370
 just these agreements down without 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.959
 sing like that memorize you 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.510
 easily the good rhythmic of the 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:08.769
 lyrics 1 2 3 4 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.769
 put your hand is my shoulder 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.290
 and do one or two paths 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:19.300
 the reverse will be funny 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:23.680
 to do the one who sees it well 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.670
 you mean to near your ear when 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.140
 he will have to lift his foot 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.870
 so people will cross me without 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.150
 take a look tutoyer 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.150
 without taking pitying air 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.950
 so here you can come back in 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.120
 back if you want but we will go 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.900
 repeat because now I 'm going 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.040
 show you how to rub them so I 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.629
 really think this piece have 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.400
 then have to make the effort of the day 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.959
 in arpeggios because that really suited 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.180
 to rub it I think it's not very 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.739
 awesome but I calm down by showing a 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.510
 rub to their first solutions in 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.980
 simply double the costs down 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.420
 so we will do instead of doing 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.420
 four have to do 8 that will do 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.180
 by doing a lot like a battery 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.370
 any case everything so we'll hit rather 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.110
 to the bass for the first shot and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.290
 towards the swords for the third pass 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.810
 etc. 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.170
 acute 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.140
 ti cats 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.120
 all I show you the beginning three 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.120
 four poles your hand on my shoulder 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.650
 let's go a long way 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.050
 together the same you hit the chords 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:38.210
 without singing 1 2 3 4 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.500
 for this soul at this rank of beautiful 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.500
 and go a little way 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:48.620
 the surfers it will be funny 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.620
 to do one who does not see well 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.470
 I mean close to the ear when 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.470
 he will have to lift his foot 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.880
 so people will cross me his 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.880
 take pitying air 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.450
 take the air a skunk eu 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.460
 second solution instead of doubling in 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.720
 quadruple but not four strokes 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.610
 down we always do that our 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.020
 two covered bacon do me but we 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.490
 touch the strings going back what's going 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.039
 give 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.830
 these shots made debate at the baous so 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:26.550
 for each initial hit we were doing 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.169
 one two three four we will do 1 2 3 4 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.639
 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 go 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:37.710
 bao bao bao bao etc no i showed you 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.550
 the beginning 3 4% to 20 only crowds 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.840
 he 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.840
 and make a vault 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:51.760
 we go together 1 2 3 4 % abatement 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.110
 bare 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.110
 and let's do a little bit of a walk 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.550
 the overflows it would be funny 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:05.200
 to do the one who sees 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:09.190
 you will tell me near the ear 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.140
 when he will have to lift his foot so 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.370
 people will meet me without taking the air 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.540
 sorry 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.540
 without taking air 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.280
 and that's it, we'll just do that 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.500
 they did in the first tutorial on 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.150
 second verse or entities that's 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.690
 exactly the same thing same placement 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.970
 lyrics about the same rhythmic 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.080
 and we will not do the couple is number 3 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.030
 but the couple is number 3 he is 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.570
 identical to the cir so in fact 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.560
 directly the couple is number 2 1 2 3 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.660
 4 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.660
 for this cluster often deposit 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:50.210
 the hot bars like two friends 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:53.400
