00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.950
 hey people today i show you like you 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.600
 Play three games on your blanks without 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.910
 can play flash the whole thing 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.670
 So a so-called peloton works 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.949
 has also been released by the guy 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.000
 the company did what it did 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.279
 needs is first just an isofix 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.860
 360 the Bernese market pool and one 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.140
 compatible burner which burner 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.629
 Compatible are on this page 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.690
 left behind description you can a 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.559
 to take from these plans 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.510
 Of course they work so far 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.989
 on the burner so far 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.989
 So it worked just 124 to 624 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.719
 and the cross flash models in even 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.670
 further audits bcd for example the 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.149
 Now you only get more you get 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.969
 anyway not so then we start 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:05.740
 ever so so take it 6 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:09.490
 360, and the iso chasing times thereby 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.100
 whole with country the explanation to work 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.330
 160 sees another video that will 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.680
 I do not explain you now but 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.650
 Let's do it this way then 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.460
 pr-tour unpacked times and the whole 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.370
 works that way 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.850
 it could also look at it in the readme 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.030
 it is a so-called temporary flash 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 All this will be in the burner user in 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.570
 gate and thereby commands on 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.720
 channel as long as this program yes 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.390
 is open and we do that the isos 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.600
 burn and 87 gigabyte big on 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.100
 eur 80 5 gb blanks you have to do that every 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.770
 do times if he creates a blank dvd 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.770
 and there are a few settings now 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.320
 which are important for cybertron, for example 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.170
 be fog online mister training disabled 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.440
 smartphone enabled supreme peter fogo 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.150
 pc did not need to clarify 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.789
 and very important is verbatim 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.770
 rohlinger wanted to use others 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.980
 use blanks so cheaper looks 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.569
 give him another tutorial 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.280
 he brought weinbrenner the flash 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.440
 baisweil then the whole could be in the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.190
 shape change but work here 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.260
 really just verbatim blanks so but 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.470
 I'm done 160 too 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.310
 then we go to the right one now 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.319
 burn 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.799
 In addition he started the evening meal as the 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.590
 Bernese max 6a chooses right here 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.440
 Runner gas is produced here berner max is 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.319
 not enabled we see the whole thing too 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.069
 if we go down to the dvd case with here 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.739
 unlock it open what is here now 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.370
 stands 8 5 gigawatt 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.519
 and here it is often 87 are against 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.810
 hate does not work now 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.099
 have to go here berner max otherwise 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.500
 the communes would pay that live 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.890
 sent and patched berner max is 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.769
 enabled that means 8gb should be on it 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.359
 we can match the whole example 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.920
 Let's look again now 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:19.510
 open up so you see free space 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.389
 and 8.7 g of bath is perfect 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.720
 speed every hole in the port 24 am 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.849
 best always as said the werber 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.530
 Blanks then use here to the 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.829
 settings and the drive we can 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.440
 go with ladders or what ever 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.060
 for a race have resulted then you can 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.430
 choose what to change for example 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.889
 Before cyber tuning should be adjusted to fog 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.989
 online half tuning the saber fits 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.530
 if you want to change something then you can 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.930
 here 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.280
 then enter fog or disabled here 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.760
 for change supreme beat should be fog 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.040
 smartphone as well as cleo pc needs 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.250
 you do not do well if everything fits 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.430

 wright and best thrower yet 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.669
 Activate it all the way 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.230
