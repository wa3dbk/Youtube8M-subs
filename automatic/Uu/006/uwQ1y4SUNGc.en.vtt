thought actually no because we might

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.950 
thought actually no because we might
gain<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.070> another<00:01:11.280> hundred<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.760> 200<00:01:11.909> from<00:01:12.510> RJ

easy but it's like you know it's easy to

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.680 
easy but it's like you know it's easy to
coordinate<00:02:18.610> one<00:02:18.760> person<00:02:19.180> because<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.630> just

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
coordinate one person because it's just

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.320 
coordinate one person because it's just
Union<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.260> do<00:02:20.350> whatever<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.620> want<00:02:20.770> anyone

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.300 
Union just do whatever you want anyone
but<00:02:22.330> when<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.570> have<00:02:22.600> like<00:02:22.870> nine<00:02:23.170> people<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:24.250> a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
but when you have like nine people to a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.090 
but when you have like nine people to a
coordinate<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.540> group<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.770> want<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.010> do

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
coordinate in a group if you want to do

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.650 
coordinate in a group if you want to do
something<00:02:27.340> special<00:02:27.550> with<00:02:27.850> everyone<00:02:28.360> involved

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
something special with everyone involved

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.010 
something special with everyone involved
you<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.680> coordinate<00:02:30.100> nine<00:02:30.340> people<00:02:31.020> and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
you have to coordinate nine people and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.660 
you have to coordinate nine people and
that's<00:02:32.290> much<00:02:32.650> more<00:02:32.890> difficult<00:02:33.070> than<00:02:33.430> if<00:02:33.580> you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
that's much more difficult than if you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.810 
that's much more difficult than if you
just<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:33.970> your<00:02:34.090> own<00:02:35.100> much<00:02:36.100> more<00:02:36.310> difficult<00:02:36.460> and

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
just on your own much more difficult and

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.870 
just on your own much more difficult and
we<00:02:37.330> couldn't<00:02:37.600> get<00:02:38.020> time<00:02:38.440> free<00:02:39.160> when<00:02:39.490> everyone

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
we couldn't get time free when everyone

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.880 
we couldn't get time free when everyone
was<00:02:40.030> free<00:02:40.210> so<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:41.020> been<00:02:41.230> difficult<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.680> make

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
was free so it's been difficult to make

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.710 
was free so it's been difficult to make
that<00:02:42.040> sort<00:02:42.190> video<00:02:42.280> but<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.910> other<00:02:43.360> thing<00:02:43.660> that

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
that sort video but the other thing that

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.970 
that sort video but the other thing that
made<00:02:43.960> it<00:02:44.080> difficult<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.470> make<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.590> thousand

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
made it difficult to make a thousand

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.350 
made it difficult to make a thousand
