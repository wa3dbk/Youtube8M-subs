 Hello and welcome to my 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.670
 dear spectators here at gaming tv yours 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.550
 favorite went gies at the start and I 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.890
 Show yourself today a very small short 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.149
 but fine unboxing and a review too 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.899
 the lg trend ii before gm seventy seven 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:29.779
 my b monitor so the 24 gm 77th 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.540
 This is one on the lg 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.809
 gamescom 2014 only presented gaming 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.280
 monitor with 144 hertz technology and 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.809
 what does it all bring? 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.380
 We will be in this video too 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.670
 look at 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.070
 I will compare here a little 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.700
 just like the 75 heart in 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.980
 is about heart and above 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.960
 also unpack the screen and 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.300
 many many more settings yet 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.040
 let's present it for a short time 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.570
 go whole but short and crisp 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.630
 we now as the first time in the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.460
 unboxing both monitor is located at 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.410
 Hessens is the creed unity 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.840
 in the form of a download code that you 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.610
 here on the spot once briefly look there 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.200
 I had just left them there 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.020
 there you can assassin's creed 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.270
 Download unity for pc for free 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.250
 small feature to monitor it is 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.400
 a 24 inch screen with one 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.130
 screen diagonals of 60 96 cm at 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.830
 contrast ratio of 5,000,000 to 1 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.659
 Incidentally, here you see the stand 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.979
 nothing special you see the same 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.000
 again when the screen is set up 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.370
 the maximum resolution is 1080p so 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.900
 1920 x 1080 pixels at a brightness 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.760
 maximum of 350 cd per square meter of 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.729
 Viewing angle is horizontal at 170 degrees 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.970
 and 160 degrees vertically a very good one 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.680
 I find value here and you just see 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.330
 a few things in relation to 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.460
 cable with just a cold device 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.770
 plug line had this is one 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.409
 quite nice feature and although the monitor 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.659
 has a usb 3.0 you have two 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.350
 connect usb 3.0 connections 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.549
 but the cable was the connection piece 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.619
 Here we come to the next one 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.810
 Cable nothing special stinknormales 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.010
 vga cable or the sub or as well 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.190
 always one wants to designate this cable 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.020
 the next cable is 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.460
 more important for you that is the dvi cable 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.880
 that allows you to do it at all 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.650
 Can use 120 or 144 s and at the end 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.180
 now comes again very briefly a 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.770
 small cable bracket so that 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.910
 monitor behind a little tidy 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.980
 the monitor is the following inputs 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.410
 has displayport dvi input 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.660
 has hdmi inputs the hdcp 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.720
 Can he has in this entrance and 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.040
 a usb 3.0 connection you like me 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.710
 just meant just 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.640
 connects to the pc by a double 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.010
 usb hub has gotten beyond that 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.900
 this monitor a tn display is in 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.000
 compare to an ips display 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.100
 a bit faster a little bit much 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.470
 faster beyond that but unfortunately from 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.840
 the colored too good but myself 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.880
 also come from a lcd display of 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.830
 so that's no problem at all 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.750
 In addition, the monitor has a 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.640
 Response time thus a reaction time 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.500
 that's one millisecond 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.690
 really good value and he also has in 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.840
 many tests really well 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.670
 he weighs 534 kilos with his stand 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.440
 and that my dear friends were there 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.750
 even at this point already from my 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.600
 small but fine unboxing we go 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.220
 Now continue in the setting of the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.720
 subsequent and also the previous one 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.550
 video are with the mobile phone camera 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.590
 Therefore I have asked you to film 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.670
 forgive it if all this here 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.650
 looks a little strange 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.030
 We are now here in the area of 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.920
 attitude here you can as all 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.420
 first time on the bottom three buttons 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.940
 select the different modes 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.290
 the monitor is not black 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.180
 bildstabilisators quasi a hardware 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.410
 pulls the ensures that dark scenes 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.780
 be brightened 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.140
 he also has different yes 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.150
 profile option and a so-called ds 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.810
 mode of the input was again to one 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.560
 should reduce many times so the whole 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.480
 have you seen 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.220
 with this button the man underneath 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.989
 you can find yourself at the start button 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.580
 here in different modes umswitchen the 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.170
 I have shown here once 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.120
 here is the picture mode in cinema 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.980
 mode and so on and so on 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.410
 many different preset modes 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.670
 over the menu you can get yourself 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.590
 always indicate which 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.970
 resolution you can find yourself right now 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.070
 the inputs change and also the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.720
 See your heart rate when you're over 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.940
 You can also be connected to hdmi 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.030
 the sound on monitor but what 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.050
 Most people do not usually do that 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.230
 here you will find different 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.000
 Settings such as brightness volume 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.070
 entrance and so on and so forth 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.780
 different functions that could 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.150
 probably read everything yourself 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.889
 If you can not read it because 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.810
 Now a few things will be here now 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.310
 the super resolution option shown and 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.200
 Please look at this once 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.210
 Wallpaper the higher this 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.860
 option is set the sharper 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.480
 the picture will be if you do it again 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.020
 right now you have it again 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.540
 seen 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.770
 there you can see the texture still 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.480
 everything is a bit sharper 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.780
 make it is likely for games 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.280
 again better but you should do it 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.500
 Do not overdo it at some point 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.360
 You are in a machine where you are 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.810
 then I just did not know anymore 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.460
 Come on 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.110
 and now we come to that 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.720
 final and all-important 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.060
 conclusion with this monitor offers lg 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.280
 really a very high quality and 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.290
 current monitor at the really on 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.020
 all the wishes of a gamers can enter 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.630
 The input of the input lag is really up 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.600
 a minimum reduces the reaction time 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.419
 is really very low and the 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.050
 screens refresh red is very very 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:36.290
 good with 144 heart in the special mode 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.620
 even to 240 can be raised 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.210
 this monitor really makes sure that 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.700
 in the game but also in the field 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.050
 Windows clearly feels better then 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.840
 people are still a bit skeptical 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.390
 are because of the difference between 60 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.669
 100 44 heart which is simply put 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.500
 Tried out is really out if we are like that 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.850
 one if you know a person who 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.590
 This monitor should own you 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.930
 really let's see and these people 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.580
 ask how the whole then at the 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.080
 person has been like this or just you 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.120
 make a picture of it yourself 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.039
 however, I warn against it when you are 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.210
 once such a monitor at home 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.070
 stands and has once the difference 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.380
 you want to have recognized monitor 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.760
 no longer give it out of your hand 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.039
 everything is amazing 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.750
 much smoother much smura before you can 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.580
 Do not really describe it like that 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.990
 this difference really is when 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.190
 want to see their little difference 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.910
 I watch you as I said again to 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.500
 cutout 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.300
 look at the corners but really 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.560
 if you really want to see it right 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.180
 I can unfortunately in this video 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.720
 Do not show then you just have to 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.789
 experience 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.490
 Of course, this price is close 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:36.200
 over 300 euro this monitor costs 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.590
 really very high, but if 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.510
 a gamer he really is 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.950
 worth emphasizing that someday 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.110
 better is that you in the pro area 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.060
 plays and the one or the other 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.990
 worth it that the whole liquid 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.690
 and looks nice 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.640
 That should be this monitor or one 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.200
 I personally can only buy similar 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.870
 give a big thumb up for it 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.790
 really a super cool piece and to 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.700
 conclude a very important one 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.530
 Information for people who get one 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.300
 buy a newer monitor 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.610
 It is very important that your pc 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.310
 performant enough is because you have one 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.960
 Monitor operates on 144 heart then needs 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:14.670
 the game what it looks like on or 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.920
 the application at least 144 ps so 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.020
 provide frames per second with it 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.730
 here has a reasonable picture and with it 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.980
 you also noticed the difference 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.590
 because if you are still a maximum of 40 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.170
 or get 60 fps out of her box 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.110
 then your monitor with 144 heart 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.610
 do not do much because he of course
