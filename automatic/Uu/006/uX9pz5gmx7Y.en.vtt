i think they were kind of confused and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.680 
i think they were kind of confused and
more<00:03:50.220> thing<00:03:50.430> got<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.670> mixed<00:03:50.880> up<00:03:51.060> or<00:03:51.270> maybe<00:03:51.510> they

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
more thing got it mixed up or maybe they

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.690 
more thing got it mixed up or maybe they
just<00:03:51.720> have<00:03:52.080> any<00:03:52.260> crystal<00:03:52.950> ones<00:03:53.100> for<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.400> ipod

just have any crystal ones for the ipod

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.729 
just have any crystal ones for the ipod
touch<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:54.120> stock<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:54.930> they<00:03:55.080> included<00:03:55.500> one<00:03:55.650> of

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739

these with the ipod touch ones but i

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.680

expect that that won't happen when you
actually<00:04:00.840> do<00:04:01.110> order<00:04:01.380> them<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.739> we<00:04:02.160> also<00:04:02.310> get
