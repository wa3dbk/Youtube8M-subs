00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.919
 a real debacle 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.630
 that boy is right our not 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.340
 I can not even score a goal 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.759
 they'd better stop raising 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.759
 white flag never ever 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:31.330
 no I don't give up it's not over yet 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.330
 I'm just starting to warm myself up 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.670
 Giulia I hope you can forgive the 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.059
 your brother neither but I have to help but car 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.059
 Hello 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.640
 goal and with this letter the oil is brought 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.220
 on 20 to 0 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.420
 it no longer makes sense to follow the game a 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.490
 this point at the rai moana 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.720
 it is definitely what it is 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.720
 I don't think I've ever seen it 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.240
 attention I know that guy in the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.710
 last year's tournament despite being 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.630
 a new player immediately became 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.970
 a legend thanks to the power of his 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.650
 shooting you know if place has worn the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.780
 shirt of the abandoned rai mon douglas 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.150
 and entered the field it seems 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.860
 intending to play now i understand i 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.119
 roja players were waiting 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.600
 he stopped at the show you are part of 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:37.460
 our team does not get upset professor 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.770
 for us it can play well if that's ok with you 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.140
 given the consensus of the roja the game 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:48.300
 can resume approved replacement 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.020
 I knew you'd said arrival time well 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.580
 that you are there I feel much better 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.110
 the number ten of the raymond class 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.570
 been replaced enter 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.700
 axel blaze now you will see what it can do 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.320
 that boy with the ball then it's him 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.320
 you've been waiting for since the beginning 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.580
 well now ready for the deadly area 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.320
 will be final 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.760
 it's amazing place has avoided the area 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.410
 deadly but instead of trying 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.060
 intercept the ball runs like 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.490
 intent on the royal door 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.460
 marchetta we hope you don't run away like 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.980
 big I understand is running like this 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.140
 because he trusts me, he knows that I can parry 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.330
 that team and after I did it 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.330
 unfortunately keep the ball down there 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.950
 no 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.540
 I don't believe the famous light hand 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:06.290
 yes I did I went out to do the 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.260
 wine there is no doubt it is her hand 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.670
 lights were 40 years that a porter did not 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.159
 he used this legendary technique not 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.880
 word is good that boy is stronger 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:25.640
 than I thought go axel it's up to you 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.640
 and the passage is precise for place 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.230
 back nights ago castro 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.360
 Goals of miracles can really happen 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.740
 the raymond has finally managed to 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.700
 score a goal against the royal 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.140
 successful kiss kiss themes 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.140
 it seems true 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.190
 our work is over we have the 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.110
 information we wanted 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.030
 the axel throw has not lost at all 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.640
 power on the contrary I would say it is 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.620
 even stronger than before 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.360
 the royal has just communicated me will have 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.209
 intention to abandon the game 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.959
 therefore ladies and gentlemen the challenge 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.850
 ends here you have heard friends and 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.769
 resounding opponents have decided to 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.690
 leaving the field means that 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.580
 the game is all a table from 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:30.320
 raymond for now I salute you mark but there 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.320
 we'll see again much sooner than you think 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.300
 if he assigns them everything he is 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.040
 success in the arctic works contacts 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.960
 the arrival of axel has changed 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.770
 radically the course of the game does not 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.480
 there is no doubt 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.980
 I would rather say that it was what 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.970
 pushed him to play change the 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.620
 course of the game 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.140
 if the victory is taken home 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.000
 it was thanks to our neighborhood ha 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.550
 demonstrated resistance and tenacity 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.530
 incredible i 'm glad you're here 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.290
 because today the new one is officially born 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.820
 raimon team feel axel why 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:04.880
 not staying with us would be great 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:06.130

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.360

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.360
 compete do not try a catch no no 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.340
 need we rather concentrate on 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.690
 this goal is the only one we have 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.430
 made and true but has a big one 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.350
 importance because it marks the beginning of 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.610
 our rebirth 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.610
 who will be the first in a long series 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.250
 Yes, yes 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:43.490
 the team can reach large 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:45.020
 results in the next episode there 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.670

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.220
 left 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.750
 it seems that those who face it come 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.430
 struck by a curse 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.230
 the mysterious axela a little sister in 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.850
 coma and promised not to play until 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.350
 she won't wake up but eventually 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.080
 nelli will convince him to join the 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.130
