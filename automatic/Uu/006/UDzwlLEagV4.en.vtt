00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
all right sir we're quite a ways into

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.650 
all right sir we're quite a ways into
our<00:00:10.540> ocean<00:00:11.500> solution<00:00:12.070> experiment<00:00:12.670> in<00:00:13.330> fact

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
our ocean solution experiment in fact

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.170 
our ocean solution experiment in fact
we're<00:00:13.840> at<00:00:13.900> the<00:00:14.049> end<00:00:14.430> these<00:00:15.430> veggies<00:00:15.850> should<00:00:16.030> be

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
we're at the end these veggies should be

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.070 
we're at the end these veggies should be
harvested

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
harvested

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.040 
harvested
I<00:00:17.699> started<00:00:18.699> this<00:00:18.789> experiment<00:00:19.449> the<00:00:19.570> 9th<00:00:19.840> of

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
I started this experiment the 9th of

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.790 
I started this experiment the 9th of
March<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.850> it's<00:00:22.240> now<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:22.510> 21st<00:00:23.080> of<00:00:23.290> April

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
March and it's now the 21st of April

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.610 
March and it's now the 21st of April
which<00:00:24.670> is<00:00:24.700> quite<00:00:25.090> a<00:00:25.120> long<00:00:25.330> way<00:00:25.540> in<00:00:25.750> 40

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.620 
which is quite a long way in 40

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.520 
which is quite a long way in 40
something<00:00:26.860> days<00:00:27.330> 40<00:00:28.330> to<00:00:28.480> 44<00:00:28.990> something<00:00:29.380> like

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
something days 40 to 44 something like

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.920 
something days 40 to 44 something like
that<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:31.000> I<00:00:32.129> was<00:00:33.129> gonna<00:00:33.250> film<00:00:33.489> this<00:00:33.700> thing<00:00:33.940> more

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
that so I was gonna film this thing more

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.139 
that so I was gonna film this thing more
often<00:00:35.379> but<00:00:35.620> I<00:00:35.649> was<00:00:36.250> quite<00:00:36.550> busy<00:00:36.760> with<00:00:36.910> some

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
often but I was quite busy with some

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.270 
often but I was quite busy with some
other<00:00:37.210> projects<00:00:37.840> so<00:00:38.020> I'm<00:00:38.710> basically<00:00:38.920> come

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
other projects so I'm basically come

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.210 
other projects so I'm basically come
already<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.760> end<00:00:39.940> of<00:00:40.090> it<00:00:40.210> and<00:00:41.100> while<00:00:42.100> the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
already to the end of it and while the

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.880 
already to the end of it and while the
results<00:00:42.310> are<00:00:42.790> surprising<00:00:43.230> remember<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:45.489> was

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
results are surprising remember this was

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.389 
results are surprising remember this was
the<00:00:48.060> hydroponic<00:00:49.060> krotkiy<00:00:49.450> style<00:00:50.399> hydroponic

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
system and in this bucket over here

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.100 
system and in this bucket over here
which<00:00:55.989> is<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.200> 30<00:00:56.530> gallon<00:00:56.739> growing<00:00:57.430> system<00:00:57.820> I

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
which is a 30 gallon growing system I

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.260 
which is a 30 gallon growing system I
had<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.890> same<00:01:00.100> plant<00:01:00.430> sizer<00:01:00.760> than<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.120> other

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
had the same plant sizer than the other

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.600 
had the same plant sizer than the other
one<00:01:01.420> but<00:01:02.290> I<00:01:02.350> only<00:01:02.530> had<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.860> master<00:01:03.190> blend<00:01:03.399> at

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
one but I only had the master blend at

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.690 
one but I only had the master blend at
1,400<00:01:04.600> parts<00:01:04.899> per<00:01:05.110> million<00:01:05.350> which<00:01:05.740> is

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
1,400 parts per million which is

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.319 
1,400 parts per million which is
rainwater<00:01:06.969> plus<00:01:07.689> the<00:01:08.350> master<00:01:08.680> blend<00:01:09.130> at<00:01:09.340> 1450

rainwater plus the master blend at 1450
p.m.<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.979> they're<00:01:12.189> doing<00:01:12.310> really<00:01:12.399> well<00:01:12.759> we've

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659

got<00:01:13.810> some<00:01:13.990> really<00:01:14.139> nice<00:01:15.130> choice<00:01:16.109> over

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
got some really nice choice over

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:21.120 
got some really nice choice over
here<00:01:17.819> it's<00:01:18.819> a<00:01:18.969> year<00:01:19.209> a<00:01:19.420> nice<00:01:20.380> sized<00:01:20.619> bucket<00:01:20.889> oh

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
here it's a year a nice sized bucket oh

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.830 
here it's a year a nice sized bucket oh
don't<00:01:21.459> mind<00:01:21.639> the<00:01:21.789> dust<00:01:22.090> there's<00:01:22.479> a<00:01:22.569> lot<00:01:22.719> of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
don't mind the dust there's a lot of

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.399 
don't mind the dust there's a lot of
dust<00:01:23.049> here<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.319> lot<00:01:23.469> of<00:01:23.560> wind<00:01:23.709> and<00:01:25.079> we<00:01:26.079> got<00:01:26.200> some

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
dust here a lot of wind and we got some

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.069 
dust here a lot of wind and we got some
really<00:01:26.740> nice<00:01:26.920> em<00:01:27.850> soy<00:01:28.920> red<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.159> soy<00:01:30.990> then<00:01:31.990> we

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
really nice em soy red and soy then we

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.459 
really nice em soy red and soy then we
have<00:01:32.259> some<00:01:33.329> decent-sized<00:01:34.329> mazuma<00:01:35.319> they're

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
have some decent-sized mazuma they're

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.849 
have some decent-sized mazuma they're
not<00:01:35.619> as<00:01:36.490> big<00:01:36.700> as<00:01:36.849> I<00:01:36.969> usually<00:01:37.389> have<00:01:37.599> them<00:01:37.659> but

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
not as big as I usually have them but

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.580 
not as big as I usually have them but
they're<00:01:38.859> quite<00:01:39.069> a<00:01:40.149> good<00:01:40.270> dope<00:01:40.590> and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
they're quite a good dope and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.639 
they're quite a good dope and
then<00:01:41.709> on<00:01:41.799> this<00:01:41.950> side<00:01:42.009> over<00:01:42.399> here<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.959> had<00:01:43.959> the

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
then on this side over here I had the

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.289 
then on this side over here I had the
same<00:01:44.889> thing<00:01:45.159> but<00:01:45.520> it's<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.759> thousand

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
same thing but it's a thousand

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.779 
same thing but it's a thousand
parts-per-million<00:01:46.869> master<00:01:47.409> blend<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.920> then

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
parts-per-million master blend and then

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.839 
parts-per-million master blend and then
400<00:01:49.509> parts<00:01:50.169> per<00:01:50.229> million<00:01:50.469> ocean<00:01:50.919> solution<00:01:51.310> and

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849 
400 parts per million ocean solution and

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.879 
400 parts per million ocean solution and
I<00:01:51.969> was<00:01:52.119> expecting<00:01:52.659> better<00:01:52.990> results<00:01:53.590> on<00:01:53.740> this

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:53.889 
I was expecting better results on this

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:56.429 
I was expecting better results on this
so<00:01:54.549> these<00:01:54.669> guys<00:01:54.909> were<00:01:55.209> going<00:01:55.419> at<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.200> same

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
so these guys were going at the same

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.510 
so these guys were going at the same
time<00:01:56.799> they<00:01:57.069> were<00:01:57.389> basically<00:01:58.389> going<00:01:59.139> up<00:01:59.520> pretty

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
time they were basically going up pretty

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.730 
time they were basically going up pretty
damn<00:02:00.819> equal<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.689> then<00:02:01.959> at<00:02:02.079> some<00:02:02.319> point<00:02:02.349> about

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
damn equal and then at some point about

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.010 
damn equal and then at some point about
three<00:02:03.219> weeks<00:02:03.459> into<00:02:03.669> it<00:02:03.909> they<00:02:04.539> started<00:02:04.869> turning

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
three weeks into it they started turning

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.979 
three weeks into it they started turning
the<00:02:05.319> yellowish<00:02:06.090> now<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.239> parts<00:02:07.569> per<00:02:07.749> million

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
the yellowish now the parts per million

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:14.699 
the yellowish now the parts per million
and<00:02:08.610> stayed<00:02:09.610> quite<00:02:10.539> balanced<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.709> pH

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
and stayed quite balanced but the pH

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.560 
and stayed quite balanced but the pH
went<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.190> little<00:02:15.370> bit<00:02:15.490> up<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.940> one<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.240> now<00:02:16.360> at

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
went a little bit up this one is now at

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.380 
went a little bit up this one is now at
around<00:02:16.720> 7<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.830> touching<00:02:18.460> 7

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
around 7 just touching 7

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.770 
around 7 just touching 7
the<00:02:21.140> one<00:02:21.350> with<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.000> master<00:02:23.420> blend<00:02:23.600> this

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the one with just the master blend this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.670 
the one with just the master blend this
one<00:02:23.990> here<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:25.540> going<00:02:26.540> at<00:02:26.900> about<00:02:27.140> six<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.590> a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
one here is going at about six and a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
one here is going at about six and a
half<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.780> pH<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.320> one<00:02:30.620> went<00:02:31.340> up<00:02:31.430> but

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.470 
half so the pH of that one went up but
you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.150> really<00:02:32.630> see<00:02:33.070> for<00:02:34.070> some<00:02:34.340> reason<00:02:34.790> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
you can really see for some reason the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.480 
you can really see for some reason the
yellowing<00:02:35.930> now<00:02:36.770> I<00:02:36.800> don't<00:02:36.950> know<00:02:37.100> if<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.340> has<00:02:37.460> to

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
yellowing now I don't know if it has to

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.110 
yellowing now I don't know if it has to
do<00:02:37.790> with<00:02:37.940> an<00:02:38.240> lack<00:02:38.990> of<00:02:39.490> uptake<00:02:40.490> in<00:02:40.790> certain

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
do with an lack of uptake in certain

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.840 
do with an lack of uptake in certain
minerals<00:02:41.680> or<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.890> has<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.070> do<00:02:43.340> only<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:43.730> the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
minerals or it has to do only with the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.910 
minerals or it has to do only with the
pH<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.360> doubt<00:02:44.600> it's<00:02:44.810> just<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.170> pH<00:02:45.470> but<00:02:45.740> there's

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
pH I doubt it's just a pH but there's

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.670 
pH I doubt it's just a pH but there's
definitely<00:02:46.130> something<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.240> turned<00:02:48.230> out<00:02:48.440> not

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
definitely something that turned out not

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.500 
definitely something that turned out not
so<00:02:48.740> good<00:02:49.250> now<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.610> doesn't<00:02:49.760> say<00:02:50.120> anything

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
so good now it doesn't say anything

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.570 
so good now it doesn't say anything
about<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.930> ocean<00:02:51.410> solution<00:02:51.560> because<00:02:52.430> these

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
about the ocean solution because these

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.130 
about the ocean solution because these
veggies<00:02:53.000> despite<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.570> fact<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.870> they're

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
veggies despite the fact that they're

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.380 
veggies despite the fact that they're
yellow<00:02:54.580> might<00:02:55.580> actually<00:02:55.760> contain<00:02:56.180> more

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
yellow might actually contain more

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.500 
yellow might actually contain more
minerals<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.860> looks<00:02:58.220> are<00:02:58.880> not<00:02:58.940> appealing

minerals but the looks are not appealing

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.150

to<00:02:59.630> most<00:02:59.750> people<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.320> bet<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.770> there's<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.010> lot

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
to most people I bet you there's a lot

to most people I bet you there's a lot
of<00:03:01.280> people<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:01.670> would<00:03:01.790> say<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:03.050> know<00:03:03.170> that's

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
of people that would say you know that's

of people that would say you know that's
not<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.850> thing<00:03:04.850> they<00:03:04.970> would<00:03:05.120> like<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.660> eat<00:03:05.959> and

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
not a thing they would like to eat and

definitely not as green and they're not
as<00:03:46.700> thick<00:03:47.030> either<00:03:47.239> if<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:47.570> look<00:03:47.720> at<00:03:47.870> these

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
as thick either if you look at these

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.440 
as thick either if you look at these
stems<00:03:48.350> over<00:03:48.709> here<00:03:49.750> nice<00:03:50.750> thick<00:03:51.400> succulent

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
stems over here nice thick succulent

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.050 
stems over here nice thick succulent
stems<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:54.410> then<00:03:54.530> these<00:03:54.650> guys<00:03:54.890> here<00:03:55.250> much

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
stems and then these guys here much

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.979 
stems and then these guys here much
thinner<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:57.890> know<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:58.850> don't<00:03:59.630> know<00:03:59.810> what

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
thinner you know so I don't know what

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.830 
thinner you know so I don't know what
went<00:04:00.170> wrong<00:04:00.350> why<00:04:00.980> but<00:04:01.670> somehow<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.150> ocean

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
went wrong why but somehow the ocean

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.729 
went wrong why but somehow the ocean
solution<00:04:03.350> two<00:04:04.010> or<00:04:04.160> three<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.810> in<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:06.170> setup

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
solution two or three and in this setup

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.479 
solution two or three and in this setup
did<00:04:07.670> not<00:04:07.880> work<00:04:08.120> favorable<00:04:08.830> so<00:04:09.830> I'm<00:04:10.040> thinking

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
did not work favorable so I'm thinking

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.990 
did not work favorable so I'm thinking
about<00:04:11.500> doing<00:04:12.500> one<00:04:12.709> with<00:04:12.890> 1400<00:04:13.580> parts<00:04:13.850> per

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
about doing one with 1400 parts per

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.199 
about doing one with 1400 parts per
million<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:15.400> 1400<00:04:16.400> five<00:04:16.519> million<00:04:16.910> in<00:04:17.060> both

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
million and 1400 five million in both

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.330 
million and 1400 five million in both
boxes<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.870> then<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.650> adding<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:19.070> ocean

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
boxes and then just adding the ocean

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.219 
boxes and then just adding the ocean
solution<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.880> seeing<00:04:20.120> if<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.600> will<00:04:21.080> get

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
solution and seeing if that will get

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.360 
solution and seeing if that will get
better<00:04:21.410> yourself<00:04:21.709> because<00:04:21.890> these<00:04:21.979> guys<00:04:22.160> have

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
better yourself because these guys have

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.950 
better yourself because these guys have
to<00:04:22.490> be<00:04:22.580> now<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.919> I'm<00:04:24.919> gonna<00:04:25.040> have<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.750> go<00:04:26.750> ahead

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
to be now and I'm gonna have to go ahead

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.050 
to be now and I'm gonna have to go ahead
and<00:04:27.110> harvest<00:04:27.800> these<00:04:28.070> quick<00:04:28.400> because<00:04:28.850> they're

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
and harvest these quick because they're

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.460 
and harvest these quick because they're
about<00:04:29.150> 40<00:04:29.570> something<00:04:29.750> days<00:04:29.930> old<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.320> they're

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
about 40 something days old and they're

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.010 
about 40 something days old and they're
gonna<00:04:30.560> start<00:04:30.890> turning<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:32.240> that's<00:04:32.419> our<00:04:32.600> tasty

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
gonna start turning and that's our tasty

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.890 
gonna start turning and that's our tasty
soon

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
soon

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.290 
soon
anyway<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:37.070> doesn't<00:04:37.430> say<00:04:37.550> anything<00:04:37.940> about<00:04:38.030> the

anyway it doesn't say anything about the

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.379 
anyway it doesn't say anything about the
ocean<00:04:38.570> solution<00:04:38.860> necessarily<00:04:40.030> but<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:41.180> does

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
ocean solution necessarily but it does

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.409 
ocean solution necessarily but it does
require<00:04:41.630> some<00:04:41.870> more<00:04:42.700> research<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.120> some<00:04:44.300> more

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
require some more research and some more

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.990 
require some more research and some more
experimenting<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.830> see<00:04:46.130> if<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.400> can<00:04:46.550> find<00:04:46.850> a

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
experimenting and see if I can find a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.650 
experimenting and see if I can find a
module<00:04:47.480> where<00:04:48.320> I'm<00:04:48.919> actually<00:04:49.250> using<00:04:49.669> the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
module where I'm actually using the

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.710 
module where I'm actually using the
ocean<00:04:51.590> solution<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.639> the<00:04:52.790> master<00:04:53.150> blend<00:04:53.389> and

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
ocean solution and the master blend and

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.070 
ocean solution and the master blend and
getting<00:04:54.500> good<00:04:54.980> results<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.700> then<00:04:56.450> also<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
getting good results and then also the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.960 
getting good results and then also the
extra<00:04:57.530> nutritional<00:04:58.190> value<00:04:58.550> through<00:04:58.760> all<00:04:58.850> the

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
extra nutritional value through all the

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.270 
extra nutritional value through all the
minerals<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.419> are<00:04:59.540> in<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.020> ocean<00:05:00.280> because

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
minerals that are in the ocean because

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.440 
minerals that are in the ocean because
that's<00:05:01.460> what<00:05:01.610> I'm<00:05:01.700> aiming<00:05:01.790> for<00:05:01.940> I<00:05:02.060> really

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
that's what I'm aiming for I really

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.200 
that's what I'm aiming for I really
believe<00:05:02.720> in<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:02.990> ocean<00:05:03.290> solution<00:05:04.060> because<00:05:05.060> I

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
believe in the ocean solution because I

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.150 
believe in the ocean solution because I
know<00:05:05.360> how<00:05:05.720> important<00:05:06.320> minerals<00:05:06.680> are<00:05:06.800> in<00:05:07.010> our

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
know how important minerals are in our

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.090 
know how important minerals are in our
fully<00:05:07.970> functioning<00:05:08.780> bodies<00:05:09.200> if<00:05:09.560> we<00:05:09.770> want<00:05:10.010> it

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
fully functioning bodies if we want it

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.400 
fully functioning bodies if we want it
for<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.340> functioning<00:05:10.820> body<00:05:11.139> and<00:05:12.139> so<00:05:12.290> I'm

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
for the functioning body and so I'm

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.900 
for the functioning body and so I'm
gonna<00:05:12.590> keep<00:05:12.770> putting<00:05:13.070> them<00:05:13.160> in<00:05:13.310> because<00:05:13.760> I

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
gonna keep putting them in because I

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.740 
gonna keep putting them in because I
know<00:05:14.350> that<00:05:15.350> minerals<00:05:15.860> are<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.729> very<00:05:17.210> vital<00:05:17.540> part

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
know that minerals are a very vital part

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.400 
know that minerals are a very vital part
of<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.830> functioning<00:05:19.340> of<00:05:19.460> our<00:05:19.580> system

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
of the functioning of our system

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.700 
of the functioning of our system
physical<00:05:21.410> system<00:05:21.880> but<00:05:22.880> um<00:05:23.120> this<00:05:23.960> result<00:05:24.470> is

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
physical system but um this result is

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.610 
physical system but um this result is
not<00:05:24.889> not<00:05:25.669> splendid<00:05:26.210> there's<00:05:26.690> some<00:05:26.870> real<00:05:27.229> odd

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
not not splendid there's some real odd

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.420 
not not splendid there's some real odd
stuff<00:05:28.250> these<00:05:29.210> leaves<00:05:29.510> actually<00:05:29.780> look<00:05:30.430> like

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
stuff these leaves actually look like

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.670 
stuff these leaves actually look like
they're<00:05:31.669> almost<00:05:31.820> dying<00:05:33.460> this<00:05:34.460> is<00:05:34.669> like

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
they're almost dying this is like

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.110 
they're almost dying this is like
lacking<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:39.280> when<00:05:40.280> you<00:05:40.370> follow<00:05:40.580> chlorophyll

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
lacking the when you follow chlorophyll

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.390 
lacking the when you follow chlorophyll
or<00:05:41.150> something<00:05:41.539> I<00:05:41.600> don't<00:05:41.720> know<00:05:44.770> land<00:05:45.770> doctor

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
or something I don't know land doctor

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.240 
or something I don't know land doctor
but<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:47.530> wonder<00:05:48.530> what<00:05:48.620> is<00:05:48.770> this<00:05:48.890> and<00:05:49.130> hope

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
but I wonder what is this and hope

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.270 
but I wonder what is this and hope
