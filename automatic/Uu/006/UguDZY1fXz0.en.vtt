00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
limit so half of spongebob will be cut

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.080 
limit so half of spongebob will be cut
off<00:02:07.780> unless<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.289> do<00:02:08.500> horizontal<00:02:09.129> on<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.969> is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
off unless you do horizontal on this is

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.550 
off unless you do horizontal on this is
going<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.299> be<00:02:10.419> massive<00:02:10.810> though<00:02:11.169> so<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.409> can

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
going to be massive though so you can

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.339 
going to be massive though so you can
resize<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.249> to<00:02:12.279> your<00:02:12.489> liking<00:02:12.879> let's<00:02:13.359> do<00:02:13.510> 250<00:02:14.200> I

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
I'll do this Zelda mask I think this is

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.080 
I'll do this Zelda mask I think this is
a<00:03:44.590> Zelda<00:03:44.950> mask<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.370> looks<00:03:45.580> pretty<00:03:45.790> cool<00:03:45.940> it's

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
a Zelda mask it looks pretty cool it's

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.759 
a Zelda mask it looks pretty cool it's
already<00:03:46.450> sort<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.780> in<00:03:46.900> pixel<00:03:47.290> form<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.680> it's

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
already sort of in pixel form so it's

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.550 
already sort of in pixel form so it's
going<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:47.950> be<00:03:48.010> pretty<00:03:48.160> easy<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.519> make<00:03:49.560> let's

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
going to be pretty easy to make let's

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.050 
going to be pretty easy to make let's
make<00:03:50.830> this<00:03:51.010> 300<00:03:52.170> 300<00:03:53.170> with<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.590> 289<00:03:54.549> in<00:03:54.760> length

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
make this 300 300 with and 289 in length

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.940 
make this 300 300 with and 289 in length
use<00:03:55.660> all<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.140> blocks<00:03:56.380> if<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.590> wanted<00:03:56.799> to<00:03:56.890> be

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
use all the blocks if you wanted to be

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.620 
use all the blocks if you wanted to be
the<00:03:57.040> most<00:03:57.160> accurate<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.790> then<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.330> going

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
the most accurate and then this is going

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.240 
the most accurate and then this is going
to<00:03:58.810> be<00:03:59.019> that's<00:03:59.320> just<00:03:59.590> interface<00:03:59.980> from<00:04:00.160> the

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
to be that's just interface from the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.550 
to be that's just interface from the
previous<00:04:00.730> build<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.299> let's<00:04:01.900> go<00:04:02.080> ahead<00:04:02.230> and

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
previous build so let's go ahead and

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.430 
previous build so let's go ahead and
paste<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.280> creation<00:04:03.790> now<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.900> simple

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
paste the creation now that simple

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.060 
paste the creation now that simple
pasting<00:04:06.010> automatically<00:04:06.959> instantaneously

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
pasting automatically instantaneously

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.430 
pasting automatically instantaneously
100%<00:04:09.070> hands-free<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:10.959> much<00:04:10.989> fun

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
100% hands-free and it is so much fun

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.759 
100% hands-free and it is so much fun
I've<00:04:11.680> used<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.220> on<00:04:12.780> Twitter<00:04:13.780> I've<00:04:14.049> taken

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
I've used this on Twitter I've taken

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.039 
I've used this on Twitter I've taken
pictures<00:04:15.310> from<00:04:15.430> other<00:04:15.610> MCPE<00:04:16.180> youtubers<00:04:16.900> and

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
pictures from other MCPE youtubers and

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.740 
pictures from other MCPE youtubers and
and<00:04:17.859> put<00:04:18.100> their<00:04:18.280> faces<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:18.970> minecraft<00:04:19.510> it's

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
and put their faces on minecraft it's

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.420 
and put their faces on minecraft it's
all<00:04:19.900> fun<00:04:20.200> it's<00:04:20.410> really<00:04:20.500> really<00:04:21.040> fun<00:04:21.220> I

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.370 
all fun it's really really fun I
definitely<00:04:21.910> am<00:04:22.060> having<00:04:22.450> a<00:04:22.630> blast<00:04:22.870> with<00:04:23.080> this

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
definitely am having a blast with this

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.680 
definitely am having a blast with this
so<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:23.710> thought<00:04:24.099> you<00:04:24.340> guys<00:04:24.370> may<00:04:24.940> maybe<00:04:25.360> would

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
so I thought you guys may maybe would

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.150 
so I thought you guys may maybe would
like<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:26.020> learn<00:04:26.140> how<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.349> do<00:04:26.530> this<00:04:26.620> yourself<00:04:26.979> so

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
like to learn how to do this yourself so

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.930 
like to learn how to do this yourself so
this

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
this

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.910 
this
how<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.300> do<00:04:28.600> it<00:04:28.780> it's<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.290> simple<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.800> can

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
how to do it it's that simple you can

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.460 
how to do it it's that simple you can
also<00:04:30.100> do<00:04:30.340> vertical<00:04:30.840> pixel<00:04:31.840> art<00:04:31.960> like<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.230> said

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
also do vertical pixel art like I said

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.070 
also do vertical pixel art like I said
but<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.950> will<00:04:33.190> require<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:34.000> little<00:04:34.870> bit<00:04:34.960> of

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
but it will require a little bit of

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.690 
but it will require a little bit of
fixing<00:04:35.320> because<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.950> height<00:04:36.130> limit<00:04:36.460> is<00:04:36.580> only

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
fixing because the height limit is only

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.700 
fixing because the height limit is only
something<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.180> 126<00:04:38.110> once<00:04:38.320> something<00:04:38.590> like

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
something like 126 once something like

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.780 
something like 126 once something like
there's<00:04:38.950> something<00:04:39.160> like<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.580> one

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
there's something like that one

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.610 
there's something like that one
something<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:40.780> you're<00:04:41.080> definitely<00:04:41.200> going<00:04:41.560> to

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
something so you're definitely going to

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.410 
something so you're definitely going to
run<00:04:41.770> out<00:04:41.890> of<00:04:41.920> room<00:04:42.130> if<00:04:42.340> you're<00:04:42.490> making<00:04:42.850> bigger

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
run out of room if you're making bigger

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.530 
run out of room if you're making bigger
pixel<00:04:43.900> arts<00:04:44.110> but<00:04:44.380> yeah<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.520> is<00:04:45.550> all<00:04:46.210> as

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
pixel arts but yeah so that is all as

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.270 
pixel arts but yeah so that is all as
you<00:04:46.720> guys<00:04:46.870> can<00:04:47.080> see<00:04:47.140> this<00:04:47.500> works<00:04:47.770> with<00:04:48.010> any

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
you guys can see this works with any

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.340 
you guys can see this works with any
type<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.670> picture<00:04:48.970> real<00:04:49.210> pictures<00:04:49.690> like<00:04:50.200> the

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
type of picture real pictures like the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.260
