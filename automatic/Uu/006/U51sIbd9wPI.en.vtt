00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Well, about the euro right now let's talk to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.970
 gleb zadoy is us directly 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.500
 connection but before asking 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.809
 secondary question ask 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.210
 paramount gleb I greet you on 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.570
 how long have we become patriots and mind 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.170
 strengthening of the ruble against good dollars 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.880
 Andrei morning 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.699
 I think that patriotism in general 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.740
 not very long 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.420
 that patriotism will persist until 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.430
 Thursday when will performance 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.650
 Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin because 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.840
 as with a higher Russian course 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.030
 currencies act a little more nice 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.200
 but in my opinion at the current price level 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.450
 for oil after all 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.020
 objective dollar exchange rate 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.450
 it's somewhere at 53 55 and I don't think that in 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.920
 this year in the area of ​​these prices, we probably 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.809
 in December we will be late 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.480
 but next year we should not exclude 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.730
 rise of the us dollar and up to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.739
 60 rubles and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.449
 the main factors that will be this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.280
 contribute to this high inflation 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.960
 which is already guaranteed next 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.230
 10 in the first quarter 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.180
 percent even exceed this figure 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.979
 budget deficit well, again, we will 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.350
 look carefully at oil quotes 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.380
 if it does n't cost 60 then a dollar 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.820
 guaranteed to cost 60 too 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.740
 factor what the government considered 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.540
 what they need to get next year 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 somewhere 4 thousand rubles for a barrel of oil 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.080
 brent marks he is his 10 percent ruble 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.450
 turn off don't think honestly that much 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.460
 there is something diminishing in my opinion if 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.560
 suddenly even the american dollar 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.110
 cheaper to 45 rubles it will be 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.799
 Wonderful opportunity for 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.829
 currency purchases what with now we will return 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.619
 to euro dollar on here how do you count 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.729
 what will be done on thursday and not done 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.439
 can be said by meanness give you 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.060
 You know, Andrew, in fact, what will happen 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.030
 said meeting yet talk about it 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.310
 hard enough I think all the same 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.120
 Europeans behind the curtain, all the same though 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.550
 what is not positive before will say and besides 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.560
 sitting and cbf thursday still the market is very 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.050
 strongly expects the publication of data on 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.240
 employment united states of america on 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.369
 my opinion is purely subjective here 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.869
 here these two events may not 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.640
 bad for euro quotes 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.990
 dollars because in my opinion up 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.520
 end of this year 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.710
 Euro dollar but subjectively can 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.960
 harden up to even mark 130 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.670
 then as we can no longer 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.610
 overcome the mark 1 23 years 5124 and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.950
 in my opinion this week’s event 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.090
 can significantly affect the euro 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.610
 bucks who can really 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.310
 fixed until the end of this year, personal 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.320
 statistics also promise to be very important 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.290
 this year unemployment what do you think 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.000
 what will happen in the states you know 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.830
 really publishing data on 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.450
 employment in the states of america it is always 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.730
 a very big intrigue especially 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.590
 Last year's publication is more 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.090
 there will be no such publications 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.880
 this first friday of the current month 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.120
 december and always that huge intrigue on 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.470
 my opinion data may be enough 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.110
 not bad for america 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.580
 but we're talking about the euro 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.260
 bucks there is potential for growth not 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.130
 so much because of some statistics 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.140
 good or bad 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.120
 but simply because the eurodollar is already 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.120
 for a long time does not fall and in my opinion 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.440
 just a correction upwards thanks 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.880
 was gleb zadoy 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.660
 on the dollar ruble on the message to 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.410
 investors on kickbacks 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.410
 to remove
