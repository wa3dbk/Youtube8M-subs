 network circulate many guys like this one 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.559
 where nothing else the only thing we need 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.390
 is to make a simple braid equal and 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.489
 all thanks to do in this video you 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.700
 I'm going to teach how it was going to be 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.850
 super super easy ok ok well I'll leave you 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.000
 with the tutorial I hope you see me if you 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.400
 I liked it because you like it and you recommend me 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.110
 ok I send you a dance kiss 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.020
 good first thing we're going to need 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.630
 is a league or a clamp to have 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.170
 our hair right away two lists 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.170
 little ones like the ones shown here 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.060
 next we are going to divide our 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.990
 hair in two as if we were 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.490
 making a tail we try to leave what 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.490
 same up as down 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.420
 and what we have all with our league or 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.420
 with our clamp 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.570
 doing in I have like this right away 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.440
 we are going to throw all the hair that we 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.680
 left over and we're going to divide a 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.290
 bit down to bottom in that 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.290
 we split it into three parts 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.650
 Now the first thing we are going to do is 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.430
 pass some end of those on the shore 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.020
 in this case the one on the right bank 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.200
 towards the center and then that of the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.630
 left towards the center crossing the and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.610
 the one in the middle one more time towards the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.660
 center 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.600
 right away the little bit of shore we're going 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.640
 to take a little bit of hair 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.880
 we have loose we cross it again 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.959
 and we take the other end more hair 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.959
 then we cross 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.820
 and the poplars 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.510
 again we take the most hair then 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.510
 we cross 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.569
 and the poplars and so let's do it up 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.909
 finish this braid is called braid 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.639
 French is very easy remember nothing 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.709
 more we take from one end more hair what 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.019
 which we use of the other as more hair and 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.950
 we cross it and so on until 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.950
 finish 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.160
 hair that is overrunning us down 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.590
 because maybe we will not have 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.410
 the extremes also the good continue 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.209
 increasing towards the extremes that have 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.160
 and the left and right will 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.160
 cross now let's take a little friend 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.890
 and we are going to hold all this hair 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.349
 remember your head should be towards 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.239
 down because the braid is down to 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.569
 up and it's only with half of 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.470
 we did not collect hair that you see so 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.470
 how is the braid 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.939
 Now we have two parts of hair the 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.939
 from below that is our braid 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.010
 where we already have a tail made 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.970
 and above where we made our changuito 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.400
 half ridiculous 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.130
 Now what we have to do is join 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.020
 those two parts we're going to take in this 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.090
 case I have a brush then for 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.680
 align all the horses properly but 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.170
 if you our style do not do anything 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.000
 more you join it if in a tail with those of 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.090
 above and below and with a little friend 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.970
 you are going to join the two parties in one 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.640
 pigtail 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.490
 Now you are going to twist a little 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.790
 a girlfriend it will hold only 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.120
 me the little girl for all the changuito and 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.120
 ready 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.310
 you can get some hair so that 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.499
 you look even cooler to accommodate those 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.439
 hair that you have over the ends 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:53.539
 wherever you want around and like this and now 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:58.060
 you see how the braid and your chongo are 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.060
 and that's super super fashion
