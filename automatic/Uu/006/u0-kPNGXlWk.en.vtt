could see what it looks like from a
different<00:05:29.460> perspective<00:05:29.820> where<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.330> can't

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
different perspective where I can't

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.600 
different perspective where I can't
really<00:05:31.380> see<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.650> back<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.010> right<00:05:32.100> here<00:05:32.310> so

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
really see the back and right here so

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.400 
really see the back and right here so
and<00:05:33.030> it's<00:05:33.390> not<00:05:33.479> like<00:05:33.630> I<00:05:33.690> got<00:05:33.840> one<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.290> know

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
and it's not like I got one you know

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.040 
and it's not like I got one you know
there's<00:05:34.890> infinity<00:05:35.880> mirror<00:05:36.150> things<00:05:36.510> going<00:05:36.930> on

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
there's infinity mirror things going on

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.750 
there's infinity mirror things going on
where<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:37.440> can<00:05:37.740> see<00:05:37.950> what<00:05:38.100> I'm<00:05:38.190> doing<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:38.669> the

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
where I can see what I'm doing so the

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.240 
where I can see what I'm doing so the
back<00:05:38.970> sometimes<00:05:39.510> isn't<00:05:39.780> success<00:05:40.260> sometimes

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
back sometimes isn't success sometimes

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.380 
back sometimes isn't success sometimes
I'd<00:05:41.640> let<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.450> back<00:05:43.700> it<00:05:44.700> looks<00:05:44.940> so<00:05:45.150> much<00:05:45.210> like
