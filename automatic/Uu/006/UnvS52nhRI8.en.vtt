athletic<00:00:43.649> bilbao<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.730> season<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.660> i've

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
athletic bilbao this season but i've

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.720 
athletic bilbao this season but i've
been<00:00:46.590> looking<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.980> his<00:00:47.100> tackling<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
been looking at his tackling and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.369 
been looking at his tackling and
everything<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.120> compared<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.719> Iniesta<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
everything and compared with Iniesta and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.319 
everything and compared with Iniesta and
Fabregas<00:00:49.860> who<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.129> obviously<00:00:50.520> slightly<00:00:51.180> more

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
Fabregas who are obviously slightly more

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.270 
Fabregas who are obviously slightly more
attacking<00:00:51.629> he's<00:00:52.170> had<00:00:52.379> three<00:00:52.710> times<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
attacking he's had three times the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580 
attacking he's had three times the
amount<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.550> tackles<00:00:54.000> per<00:00:54.239> game<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.199> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
amount of tackles per game so I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.560 
amount of tackles per game so I
originally<00:00:56.219> thought<00:00:56.489> he<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> calm<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.480> it

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
originally thought he was a calm but it

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.020 
originally thought he was a calm but it
looks<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:57.930> though<00:00:57.960> he<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.379> fill<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> CM<00:00:59.160> /<00:00:59.489> CD

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
looks as though he can fill a CM / CD

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
looks as though he can fill a CM / CD

kind of be one of the driving forces or
spins<00:01:50.220> new<00:01:50.640> tactics<00:01:51.299> when<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.869> drop<00:01:52.140> their

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
spins new tactics when they drop their

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.039 
spins new tactics when they drop their
ticket<00:01:52.649> at<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> football<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.850> next<00:01:54.149> euros<00:01:54.659> they

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
ticket at a football for next euros they

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
ticket at a football for next euros they
think<00:01:55.350> he<00:01:55.470> may<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:56.009> replacement<00:01:56.189> but

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
think he may be a good replacement but

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.760 
think he may be a good replacement but
in<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> air<00:01:57.030> stays<00:01:57.210> quite<00:01:57.509> tall<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.020> well<00:01:58.200> so

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
in the air stays quite tall as well so

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
in the air stays quite tall as well so
you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.729> probably<00:02:00.030> win<00:02:00.210> headers

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
