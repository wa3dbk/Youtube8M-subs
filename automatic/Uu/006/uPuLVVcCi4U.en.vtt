00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
story across all the platforms is pretty

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340

much<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:35.730> same<00:00:35.910> thing<00:00:35.970> but<00:00:36.480> when<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.080> came<00:00:37.230> to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
much the same thing but when it came to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.720 
much the same thing but when it came to
the<00:00:37.440> gameplay<00:00:37.650> experience<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.460> wanted<00:00:38.699> to

of its star killer hid some with
lightning<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:02.170> get<00:04:02.260> two<00:04:02.380> other<00:04:02.500> players

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
lightning and you get two other players

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.710 
lightning and you get two other players
jumping<00:04:03.069> in<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.610> using<00:04:03.849> their<00:04:04.060> powers<00:04:04.420> so<00:04:04.630> it

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
jumping in and using their powers so it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.420 
jumping in and using their powers so it
gets<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:05.079> be<00:04:05.110> pretty<00:04:05.590> crazy<00:04:05.890> but<00:04:06.040> in<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.310> really

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
gets to be pretty crazy but in a really

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.009 
gets to be pretty crazy but in a really
fun<00:04:06.610> way<00:04:09.120> force<00:04:10.120> rage<00:04:10.360> is<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.569> little<00:04:10.750> different

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
fun way force rage is a little different

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.839 
fun way force rage is a little different
on<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.200> we<00:04:11.319> basically<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.220> way<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.400> works<00:04:12.579> is

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
on the we basically the way it works is

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.940 
on the we basically the way it works is
you<00:04:12.880> build<00:04:13.480> up<00:04:13.569> a<00:04:13.750> force<00:04:14.079> rage<00:04:14.290> meter<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.860> then

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
you build up a force rage meter and then

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.469 
you build up a force rage meter and then
you<00:04:15.040> go<00:04:15.130> into<00:04:15.310> rage<00:04:15.489> mode<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:16.030> what<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:16.359> does

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
you go into rage mode and what that does

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.879 
you go into rage mode and what that does
is<00:04:16.540> it<00:04:16.720> puts<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.139> a<00:04:17.200> kind<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.410> bullet<00:04:17.709> time

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
is it puts you in a kind of bullet time

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.430 
is it puts you in a kind of bullet time
slows<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.549> game<00:04:18.669> down<00:04:18.729> and<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.810> allows<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.260> to

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
slows the game down and it allows you to

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.230 
slows the game down and it allows you to
use<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.130> Wii<00:04:21.220> Remote<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.669> paint<00:04:21.940> different

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.840 
use the Wii Remote to paint different
enemies<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.810> then<00:04:23.020> before<00:04:23.650> rage<00:04:24.250> wears<00:04:24.610> off

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
enemies and then before rage wears off

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.340 
enemies and then before rage wears off
you<00:04:25.060> can<00:04:25.210> one-shot<00:04:25.450> all<00:04:25.780> those<00:04:25.930> enemies<00:04:26.229> so

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
you can one-shot all those enemies so

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.700 
you can one-shot all those enemies so
