00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.390

 neighborhood of the cema neither in that cafe or a 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.580
 rhyme is rhyming some verses because 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.610
 some reach to have dimension of 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.710
 kind of poems 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.710
 the proclamation can not be vulgar 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.330
 mischievous bridge 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.950
 and they handle two-way levels but 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.350
 in a subtle way in a way 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.230
 nice I met for example a 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.730
 fruit seller who sold little 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.240

 occurrences are wit the wit what 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.980
 I was saying is wit as 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.820
 ability to invent and to become 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.150
 nice is a business option of 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.470
 people who are usually 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.560
 unemployed 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.700
 and that his 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.450
 your school does not extend beyond 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.090
 maybe from the primary and we found in 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.920
 Cartagena that more than one mature 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.620
 palenquera that sells fruits in the street 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.260
 has a professional son since he has 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.780
 professional fact selling fruit in the 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.490
 street with this from the new 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.689
 all generations are embarrassed that 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.449
 stay in the world differently 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:38.319
 already the new generations do not want 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:41.019
 they do not want to trumpet then we are 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:44.229
 as in the struggle to show them what is 

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:47.129
 the importance of the proclamation in Cartagena 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.129
 specifically
