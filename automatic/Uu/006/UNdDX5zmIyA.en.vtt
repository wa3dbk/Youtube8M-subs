 find a system but it doesn't make sense 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.140
 because there are between 20 behind you must 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.690

 59 city tarafino clicked up about 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.740
 from the end 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:50.530

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.539

 not even starting to fuck but there is more 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.429

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.930
 run away but when I am yesterday 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.790
 the meeting did not even say that they are not there 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.130
 collisions 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.980

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.760

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:38.370

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.810
 but I wish it would explode sincerely 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.850
 in fact the first thing he does is me 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.560
 I would expect that teams do not 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.600
 no joke should be about to explode 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.700
