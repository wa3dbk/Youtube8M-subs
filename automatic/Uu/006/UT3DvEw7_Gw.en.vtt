kind<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.600> surreal<00:02:08.310> breathtaking<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.429> guess<00:02:09.640> is

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
kind of surreal breathtaking I guess is

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.190 
kind of surreal breathtaking I guess is
probably<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.179> good<00:02:10.390> way<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.600> say<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:10.869> we've<00:02:11.080> been

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
probably a good way to say it we've been

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.500 
probably a good way to say it we've been
waiting<00:02:11.470> for<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> long<00:02:11.830> time<00:02:12.330> Julia<00:02:13.330> what's

yeah<00:02:16.810> words<00:02:17.260> don't<00:02:17.440> do<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.650> justice<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.340> think

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
yeah words don't do it justice I think

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.830 
yeah words don't do it justice I think
it's<00:02:18.700> gonna<00:02:18.790> catch<00:02:19.030> some<00:02:19.209> attention<00:02:19.540> that's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
it's gonna catch some attention that's

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.630 
it's gonna catch some attention that's
just<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.110> fly<00:02:20.319> all<00:02:20.980> right<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.220> let's<00:02:21.400> feature

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
just a fly all right so let's feature

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.309 
just a fly all right so let's feature
some<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.000> those<00:02:22.150> some<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> pieces<00:02:22.930> on<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
some of those some of the pieces on the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.530 
some of those some of the pieces on the
side<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.709> think<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.400> would<00:02:24.640> think<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.300> brain

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
side I think I would think the brain

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.920 
side I think I would think the brain
knows<00:02:25.720> every<00:02:25.959> option<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.530> car<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.930> we

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
knows every option on this car and we

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.479 
knows every option on this car and we
just<00:02:29.140> eat<00:02:29.380> sounds<00:02:29.650> ordered<00:02:29.860> for<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.040> long<00:02:30.190> time

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
just eat sounds ordered for a long time

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.030 
just eat sounds ordered for a long time
I<00:02:30.520> think<00:02:30.819> we<00:02:30.940> ordered<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.300> back<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.780> maybe<00:02:32.110> July

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
I think we ordered it back in maybe July

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.309 
I think we ordered it back in maybe July
to<00:02:33.250> August<00:02:34.800> July<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:37.480> put<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.840> order<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
to August July we put the order in the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:49.170 
to August July we put the order in the
