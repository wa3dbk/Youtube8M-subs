00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.020
 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.240
 today's video we want 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.509
 tell about the products for the format and a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.299
 exactly a quarter turn of the shutter 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.220
 electrically controlled aroma 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.039
 fps with built-in function 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:27.930
 positioning the composition of the drive 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:31.250
 torque motor is included 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.500
 switches limit switches 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.160
 besides , unlike traditional 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.200
 the structure of the electric drive is included 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.200
 built-in positioner function 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.660
 built - in start-up of contact equipment and 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.660
 direct charge positioning 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.680
 motorized with positioning function 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.610
 unlike the traditional system 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.040
 signal positioning more less 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.770
 the actuator is controlled ryksa 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.050
 directly on the final loop 4 20 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.750
 milliampere te four milliampere 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.710
 position closed 20 milliamps 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.200
 the position is open at the moment on 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.640
 Oppositionist's fee is submitted 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.470
 signal 12 milliampere shutter disk costs 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.400
 in the middle position which corresponds to 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.030
 This signal will be sent to 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:35.800
 positioner board signal 4 milliampere 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.790
 translate the disc in the closed position to 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.479
 positioner board 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:47.830
 we gave a signal of 4 milliamps and here 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:50.380
 goes position closed drive reached 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.890
 end position which corresponds to 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.980
 giving a signal four miles amps and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:02.740
 let's give a setting signal of 20 milliamps 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.930
 the disc goes to the position open to the board 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.800
 positioner 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.370
 we gave a signal giving 20 milliamps 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.460
 drive go position open 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.980
 feedback signal grows 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.140
 that the disk moves from position 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.140
 closed to open 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.989
 the disk has reached the target position 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.989
 corresponding to 20 milliamps 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.709
 now we simulate an emergency 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.930
 on the pipeline we will transfer the disk 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.900
 shutter position closed and simultaneously 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.489
 create a mechanical obstacle not 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.230
 allowing the disk to reach extreme 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:57.290
 provisions we filed for the positioner board 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.410
 control signal 4 milliampere disc 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.850
 a closed position must come 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.519
 at the same time on the mechanical 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.290
 impede the achievement of the final disc 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:11.500
 provisions as we see the disk is not occupied 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.780
 its final position 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.660
 4 milliampere setting signal 7 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.519
 milliampere actual disc position 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.549
 but electric drive 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.799
 stopped with clutch restriction works 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.930
 moment limit 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:32.450
 thereby preventing the shutter from 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:36.049
 damage to the drive from communication damage 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.799
 with excess moment at the ball 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.799
 for to drive 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.530
 now about security mode 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.400
 the actuator in contact with the dealer 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.760
 such a signal 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.390
 the drive moves in advance at the same time and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.930
 position 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.930
 in our case we set the position openly 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.130
 in the absence of such a signal 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.260
 electric drive moved in advance 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.010
 given position here with him 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.750
 position 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.750
 open on this all thank you for your attention
