request I was kind of excited to figure

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.349 
request I was kind of excited to figure
out<00:00:17.100> how<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:17.730> at<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> same<00:00:17.940> time<00:00:18.300> I

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
out how to do it but at the same time I

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.660 
out how to do it but at the same time I
was<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> little<00:00:18.869> bit<00:00:19.020> scared<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.220> because<00:00:20.430> I

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
was a little bit scared just because I

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.080 
was a little bit scared just because I
have<00:00:21.090> absolutely<00:00:21.300> no<00:00:21.750> idea<00:00:21.779> how<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> make<00:00:22.650> one

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
have absolutely no idea how to make one

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.609 
have absolutely no idea how to make one
but<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.119> came<00:00:24.210> up<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.660> few<00:00:24.840> ideas<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.260> I

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
but I came up with a few ideas that I

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.660 
but I came up with a few ideas that I
think<00:00:25.680> um<00:00:26.480> will<00:00:27.480> work<00:00:27.920> relatively<00:00:28.920> well<00:00:29.070> I

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
think um will work relatively well I

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.490 
think um will work relatively well I
personally<00:00:29.789> am<00:00:30.510> NOT<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> people<00:00:31.380> who

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
personally am NOT one of the people who

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.860 
personally am NOT one of the people who
go<00:00:31.650> around<00:00:31.910> sanitizing<00:00:32.910> my<00:00:33.000> hands<00:00:33.390> everywhere

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
go around sanitizing my hands everywhere

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.510 
go around sanitizing my hands everywhere
I<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.200> whenever<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.710> open<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.100> door

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
I go whenever I open the door

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
I go whenever I open the door
and<00:00:35.610> touch<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> doorknob<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and touch a doorknob it's just not the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.869 
and touch a doorknob it's just not the
kind<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.620> person<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.040> am<00:00:38.190> I'm<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
kind of person I am I'm not really a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
kind of person I am I'm not really a
germaphobe<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.590> understand<00:00:41.190> there<00:00:41.370> are

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
germaphobe but I understand there are

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.459 
germaphobe but I understand there are
loads<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> people<00:00:42.120> who<00:00:42.239> are<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.140> wanted<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
loads of people who are and I wanted to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.040 
loads of people who are and I wanted to
give<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.680> guys<00:00:43.829> some<00:00:44.250> natural<00:00:45.120> options<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
give you guys some natural options and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.619 
give you guys some natural options and
I'm<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:46.739> sure<00:00:47.270> how<00:00:48.270> much<00:00:48.450> more

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
I'm not really sure how much more

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.700 
I'm not really sure how much more
effective<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:50.100> option<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.789> versus<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
effective this option is versus the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.660 
effective this option is versus the
commercialized<00:00:52.710> ones<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.250> I'm<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.460> very

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
commercialized ones because I'm not very

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
commercialized ones because I'm not very
educated<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.809> commercialized<00:00:55.379> once<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
educated on the commercialized once the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.880 
educated on the commercialized once the
commercialized<00:00:56.520> ones<00:00:56.789> seem<00:00:57.710> from<00:00:58.710> my

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
commercialized ones seem from my

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.490 
commercialized ones seem from my
knowledge<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.760> they're<00:00:59.879> basically

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
knowledge I think that they're basically

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.380 
knowledge I think that they're basically
synthetic<00:01:01.500> alcohol<00:01:02.010> artificial<00:01:03.000> fragrance

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
synthetic alcohol artificial fragrance

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.119 
synthetic alcohol artificial fragrance
and<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.719> whole<00:01:03.989> lot<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.290> other<00:01:04.439> chemicals<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and a whole lot of other chemicals that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
and a whole lot of other chemicals that
I<00:01:05.880> don't<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.659> know<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.049> they<00:01:07.200> are

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
I don't really know what they are

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.359 
I don't really know what they are
because<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:07.979> into<00:01:08.189> hand

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
because I'm not really into hand

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.940 
because I'm not really into hand
sanitizing<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> show<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
sanitizing but I'm going to show you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.880 
sanitizing but I'm going to show you
guys<00:01:11.159> kind<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.880> natural<00:01:12.720> safer<00:01:13.170> version<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.399 
guys kind of a natural safer version and
I'm<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.610> using<00:01:14.729> essential<00:01:15.509> oils<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
I'm going to be using essential oils and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.690 
I'm going to be using essential oils and
it's<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.340> easy<00:01:17.430> recipe

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it's going to be a really easy recipe

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
it's going to be a really easy recipe
like<00:01:18.360> hardly<00:01:18.869> any<00:01:19.200> ingredients<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
like hardly any ingredients so when I

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.740 
like hardly any ingredients so when I
was<00:01:20.400> thinking<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.820> what<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> face<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.630> was

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
was thinking of what the face of it was

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.510 
was thinking of what the face of it was
going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:22.770> I've<00:01:22.920> seen<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.340> hand

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
going to be from what I've seen the hand

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.249 
going to be from what I've seen the hand
sanitizers<00:01:24.119> tend<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.900> gel

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
sanitizers tend to be kind of like a gel

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.170 
sanitizers tend to be kind of like a gel
consistency<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> watery

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
consistency and are just kind of watery

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.719 
consistency and are just kind of watery
so<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:28.020> feel<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:29.610> know

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
so you know you don't feel like you know

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
so you know you don't feel like you know
your<00:01:29.850> hands<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.210> too<00:01:30.329> greasy<00:01:30.570> after<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> use

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
your hands are too greasy after you use

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.140 
your hands are too greasy after you use
them<00:01:31.650> they're<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.670> don't<00:01:33.060> really

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
them they're just kind of I don't really

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.060 
them they're just kind of I don't really
some<00:01:33.420> kind<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> gel<00:01:33.840> water-based<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.740> I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
some kind of gel water-based so I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.399 
some kind of gel water-based so I
thought<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> good<00:01:35.670> option<00:01:35.880> would<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.450> aloe<00:01:37.140> vera

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
thought a good option would be aloe vera

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.330 
thought a good option would be aloe vera
gel<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> natural<00:01:38.610> option<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.710> this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
gel as a natural option and I have this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.660 
gel as a natural option and I have this
by<00:01:41.670> Jason<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.930> 98%<00:01:43.619> aloe<00:01:44.070> vera<00:01:44.280> gel

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
by Jason this is the 98% aloe vera gel

hand sanitizer okay so I have this book
called<00:02:25.480> advanced<00:02:26.560> aromatherapy<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.800> it's<00:02:28.069> by

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
called advanced aromatherapy and it's by

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.360 
called advanced aromatherapy and it's by
Kurtz<00:02:28.640> now<00:02:28.970> belt<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.569> it's<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.530> science<00:02:31.190> of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
Kurtz now belt and it's the science of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.030 
Kurtz now belt and it's the science of
essential<00:02:31.880> oil<00:02:32.060> therapy<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.870> in<00:02:33.739> here

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
essential oil therapy and in here

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.770 
essential oil therapy and in here
there's<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.280> little<00:02:34.430> diagram<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:36.040> um<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:38.750> a

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
there's a little diagram of um like a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.660 
there's a little diagram of um like a
petri<00:02:39.230> dish<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.190> middle<00:02:40.430> there<00:02:40.580> are

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
petri dish and in the middle there are

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.580 
petri dish and in the middle there are
different<00:02:41.030> essential<00:02:41.330> oils<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.410> how

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
different essential oils and this is how

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.009 
different essential oils and this is how
bacteria<00:02:43.160> reacts<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.030> essential<00:02:44.450> oil<00:02:44.660> so

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
bacteria reacts to the essential oil so

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.650 
bacteria reacts to the essential oil so
this<00:02:45.170> here<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.440> ginger<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:47.209> ginger<00:02:47.480> oil

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
this here is ginger and the ginger oil

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.180 
this here is ginger and the ginger oil
is<00:02:47.900> in<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.110> middle<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.590> as<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.800> can<00:02:48.920> see<00:02:49.069> the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
is in the middle and as you can see the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.910 
is in the middle and as you can see the
bacteria<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:49.970> basically<00:02:50.480> everywhere<00:02:51.140> but

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
bacteria is basically everywhere but

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.210 
bacteria is basically everywhere but
where<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.250> essential<00:02:52.640> oil<00:02:52.850> was<00:02:53.180> placed<00:02:54.220> this

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
where the essential oil was placed this

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.309 
where the essential oil was placed this
here<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.640> geranium<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.600> as<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.870> can<00:02:56.989> see<00:02:57.049> the

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
here is geranium and as you can see the

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.710 
here is geranium and as you can see the
bacteria<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:58.040> definitely<00:02:58.940> running<00:02:59.180> away<00:02:59.510> and

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
bacteria is definitely running away and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.759 
bacteria is definitely running away and
being<00:02:59.989> killed<00:03:00.640> pretty<00:03:01.640> well<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.299> then<00:03:03.230> here

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
being killed pretty well and then here

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.650 
being killed pretty well and then here
oregano<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:04.640> see<00:03:04.880> like<00:03:05.120> how<00:03:05.269> big<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.540> a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
oregano can you see like how big of a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.059 
oregano can you see like how big of a
difference<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.440> oregano<00:03:06.890> is

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
difference it is so oregano is

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
immune system which actually there are a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.490 
immune system which actually there are a
lot<00:03:38.299> of<00:03:38.329> studies<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.750> are<00:03:38.989> coming<00:03:39.230> out<00:03:39.350> to

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
and hand sanitizing freaks are actually

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.880 
and hand sanitizing freaks are actually
at<00:03:44.269> higher<00:03:44.480> risk<00:03:44.780> for<00:03:44.900> getting<00:03:45.260> colds<00:03:45.650> because

their<00:03:46.040> immune<00:03:46.310> system<00:03:46.820> is<00:03:46.910> getting<00:03:47.180> really

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
their immune system is getting really

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.800 
their immune system is getting really
weakened<00:03:47.840> by<00:03:48.440> being<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.190> crazy<00:03:49.510> neat<00:03:50.510> freak

weakened by being so crazy neat freak
about<00:03:51.079> everything<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:52.040> it's<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.340> good<00:03:52.459> idea<00:03:52.609> to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
about everything so it's a good idea to

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.080 
about everything so it's a good idea to
kind<00:03:53.269> of<00:03:53.329> um<00:03:53.590> get<00:03:54.590> something<00:03:54.950> that's<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.970> know

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
kind of um get something that's you know

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.360 
kind of um get something that's you know
a<00:03:56.420> little<00:03:56.480> bit<00:03:56.780> good<00:03:57.140> for<00:03:57.350> your<00:03:57.470> immune<00:03:57.590> system

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
a little bit good for your immune system

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.699 
a little bit good for your immune system
but<00:03:58.760> also<00:03:58.940> kills<00:03:59.359> the<00:03:59.569> germs<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.440> don't

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
but also kills the germs but I don't

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.410 
but also kills the germs but I don't
think<00:04:00.859> that<00:04:01.069> it's<00:04:01.220> really<00:04:01.459> necessary<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.209> kill

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
think that it's really necessary to kill

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.170 
think that it's really necessary to kill
99.9%<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.130> germs<00:04:04.160> I<00:04:04.640> really<00:04:04.880> don't<00:04:05.090> think

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
99.9% of the germs I really don't think

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.180 
99.9% of the germs I really don't think
that<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.079> really<00:04:06.260> need<00:04:06.380> that<00:04:06.680> because<00:04:06.890> you're

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
that you really need that because you're

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.309 
that you really need that because you're
gonna<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.639> got<00:04:07.850> it<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.510> got<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.780> experience

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
gonna you got it you got to experience

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.289 
gonna you got it you got to experience
d'oeuvres<00:04:09.859> in<00:04:10.220> your<00:04:10.370> life<00:04:10.519> in<00:04:10.730> order<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:11.030> build

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
d'oeuvres in your life in order to build

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.620 
d'oeuvres in your life in order to build
any<00:04:11.600> immune<00:04:12.019> block<00:04:12.319> to<00:04:12.560> them<00:04:12.709> so<00:04:13.130> I<00:04:13.370> think<00:04:14.209> that

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
any immune block to them so I think that

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.420 
any immune block to them so I think that
this<00:04:14.750> is<00:04:14.900> definitely<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.440> better<00:04:15.650> option<00:04:16.160> if<00:04:16.310> I

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
this is definitely a better option if I

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.490 
this is definitely a better option if I
were<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.639> hand<00:04:16.940> sanitizing<00:04:17.419> person<00:04:17.930> this<00:04:18.440> is

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
were a hand sanitizing person this is

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.830 
were a hand sanitizing person this is
the<00:04:18.650> option<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.130> would<00:04:19.280> go<00:04:19.400> for<00:04:19.640> so<00:04:20.209> okay<00:04:20.810> so

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
the option I would go for so okay so

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.120 
the option I would go for so okay so
what<00:04:21.109> you're<00:04:21.229> going<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.380> do<00:04:21.680> is<00:04:21.919> you're<00:04:22.099> going

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.750 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:04:22.280> take

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
to take

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.850 
to take
your<00:04:22.880> aloe<00:04:23.090> vera<00:04:23.300> gel<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.140> usually<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.650> comes

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
your aloe vera gel and usually it comes

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.290 
your aloe vera gel and usually it comes
already<00:04:25.070> packaged<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:25.910> you're<00:04:26.030> just<00:04:26.150> going

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
already packaged and you're just going

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.180 
already packaged and you're just going
to<00:04:26.360> add<00:04:26.510> some<00:04:26.540> essential<00:04:26.900> oils<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:27.800> would

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
to add some essential oils to it I would

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.220 
to add some essential oils to it I would
say<00:04:28.430> put<00:04:28.700> about<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.180> ratio<00:04:29.450> of<00:04:30.760> 30%<00:04:31.760> to<00:04:32.180> 70%<00:04:32.360> so

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
say put about a ratio of 30% to 70% so

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.650 
say put about a ratio of 30% to 70% so
30%<00:04:33.620> essential<00:04:34.490> oil<00:04:34.640> whichever<00:04:35.090> one<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.390> is<00:04:35.420> of

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
30% essential oil whichever one it is of

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.800 
30% essential oil whichever one it is of
your<00:04:35.780> choice<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.590> 70%<00:04:37.010> aloe<00:04:37.550> vera<00:04:37.760> gel<00:04:38.060> now<00:04:38.750> you

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
your choice to 70% aloe vera gel now you

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.750 
your choice to 70% aloe vera gel now you
could<00:04:39.140> do<00:04:39.320> more<00:04:39.560> than<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:39.920> if<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:40.250> wanted<00:04:40.610> to

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
could do more than that if you wanted to

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.240 
could do more than that if you wanted to
I<00:04:40.790> would<00:04:41.030> say<00:04:41.210> probably<00:04:41.720> a<00:04:41.990> maximum<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:43.040> about

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
I would say probably a maximum of about

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.940 
I would say probably a maximum of about
sixty<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.450> forty<00:04:44.480> so<00:04:45.200> 60%<00:04:45.680> essential<00:04:46.400> oils<00:04:46.930> to

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
sixty to forty so 60% essential oils to

sixty to forty so 60% essential oils to
40%<00:04:48.950> aloe<00:04:49.100> vera<00:04:49.310> gel<00:04:49.610> now<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:49.910> don't<00:04:50.060> know<00:04:50.600> the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
40% aloe vera gel now I don't know the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.200 
40% aloe vera gel now I don't know the
exact<00:04:51.170> number<00:04:51.530> of<00:04:51.560> how<00:04:51.710> much<00:04:52.250> percentage<00:04:52.880> this

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
exact number of how much percentage this

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.300 
exact number of how much percentage this
hand<00:04:53.900> sanitizer<00:04:54.410> is<00:04:54.620> going<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.980> kill<00:04:55.160> the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
hand sanitizer is going to kill the

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.310 
hand sanitizer is going to kill the
germs<00:04:55.550> but<00:04:56.150> it<00:04:56.360> will<00:04:56.480> do<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.690> pretty<00:04:56.960> good<00:04:57.110> job

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
germs but it will do a pretty good job

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.020 
germs but it will do a pretty good job
and<00:04:57.530> if<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.740> don't<00:04:58.130> have<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.340> place<00:04:58.610> go<00:04:58.820> wash
