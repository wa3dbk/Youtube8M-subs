in<00:00:03.160> this<00:00:03.670> tutorial<00:00:03.880> we'll<00:00:04.300> have<00:00:04.510> a<00:00:04.540> look<00:00:04.900> at<00:00:05.080> a

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.140 
in this tutorial we'll have a look at a

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.430 
in this tutorial we'll have a look at a
very<00:00:05.890> simple<00:00:06.490> yet<00:00:06.700> very<00:00:07.120> helpful<00:00:07.660> setup<00:00:08.260> that

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
very simple yet very helpful setup that

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.350 
very simple yet very helpful setup that
I<00:00:08.469> like<00:00:08.710> calling<00:00:08.950> the<00:00:09.130> matte<00:00:09.280> paint<00:00:09.520> hub<00:00:09.700> the

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
I like calling the matte paint hub the

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.140 
I like calling the matte paint hub the
matte<00:00:10.510> paint<00:00:10.780> hub<00:00:11.019> crops<00:00:11.559> a<00:00:11.769> certain<00:00:12.610> area<00:00:12.820> of

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
matte paint hub crops a certain area of

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.360 
matte paint hub crops a certain area of
a<00:00:13.540> high<00:00:13.870> resolution<00:00:14.050> image<00:00:14.500> in<00:00:14.740> order<00:00:15.130> for

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
a high resolution image in order for

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.950 
a high resolution image in order for
that<00:00:15.460> patch<00:00:15.730> to<00:00:15.969> be<00:00:16.119> processed<00:00:16.660> more

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
that patch to be processed more

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.080 
that patch to be processed more
efficiently<00:00:17.439> and<00:00:17.740> then<00:00:17.980> ensures<00:00:18.430> that<00:00:18.460> the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
efficiently and then ensures that the

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.749 
efficiently and then ensures that the
processed<00:00:19.540> patch<00:00:19.779> drops<00:00:20.770> right<00:00:21.160> back<00:00:21.460> into

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
processed patch drops right back into

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.409 
processed patch drops right back into
the<00:00:22.300> original<00:00:22.509> canvas<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:24.070> let's<00:00:24.669> assume<00:00:25.000> this

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
the original canvas so let's assume this

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.560 
the original canvas so let's assume this
map<00:00:25.630> here<00:00:25.930> is<00:00:26.140> way<00:00:26.800> too<00:00:26.860> big<00:00:27.820> to<00:00:28.029> actually<00:00:28.390> pull

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
map here is way too big to actually pull

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.479 
map here is way too big to actually pull
into<00:00:28.750> Photoshop<00:00:29.320> or<00:00:29.529> anything<00:00:29.800> like<00:00:30.040> that<00:00:30.099> in

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
into Photoshop or anything like that in

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.600 
into Photoshop or anything like that in
my<00:00:31.000> case<00:00:31.540> it's<00:00:31.750> really<00:00:31.989> just<00:00:32.140> 4k<00:00:32.619> wide<00:00:33.010> but<00:00:33.399> in

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
my case it's really just 4k wide but in

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.790 
my case it's really just 4k wide but in
reality<00:00:34.059> this<00:00:34.270> might<00:00:34.899> as<00:00:35.050> well<00:00:35.079> be<00:00:35.199> something

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
reality this might as well be something

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.770 
reality this might as well be something
like<00:00:35.949> 20<00:00:36.070> K<00:00:36.399> so<00:00:37.000> you<00:00:37.030> don't<00:00:37.269> want<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.449> pull<00:00:37.629> this

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
like 20 K so you don't want to pull this

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.509 
like 20 K so you don't want to pull this
whole<00:00:37.960> thing<00:00:38.170> into<00:00:38.379> Photoshop<00:00:38.920> just<00:00:38.980> because

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
whole thing into Photoshop just because

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.610 
whole thing into Photoshop just because
the<00:00:39.609> client<00:00:39.940> decided<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:40.600> hey<00:00:40.960> we<00:00:41.320> want<00:00:41.559> some

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
the client decided that hey we want some

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.099 
the client decided that hey we want some
graffiti<00:00:41.920> on<00:00:42.190> those<00:00:42.489> walls<00:00:43.030> so<00:00:43.600> obviously<00:00:43.960> the

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
graffiti on those walls so obviously the

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.139 
graffiti on those walls so obviously the
first<00:00:44.140> thing<00:00:44.410> you<00:00:44.589> want<00:00:44.739> to<00:00:44.769> do<00:00:44.920> is<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.969> want

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
first thing you want to do is you want

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.650 
first thing you want to do is you want
to<00:00:46.210> crop<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.629> area<00:00:47.019> of<00:00:47.230> interest<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:49.210> that

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
to crop the area of interest like that

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.750 
to crop the area of interest like that
and<00:00:49.980> while<00:00:50.980> we're<00:00:51.129> here<00:00:51.280> let's<00:00:51.339> actually

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
and while we're here let's actually

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.060 
and while we're here let's actually
examine<00:00:52.480> how<00:00:52.719> that<00:00:52.989> crop<00:00:53.320> node<00:00:53.530> really<00:00:53.829> works

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
examine how that crop node really works

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.479 
examine how that crop node really works
so<00:00:54.789> the<00:00:54.969> X<00:00:55.179> field<00:00:56.019> simply<00:00:56.679> determines<00:00:57.339> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
so the X field simply determines the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.389 
so the X field simply determines the
distance<00:00:57.909> from<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.629> left<00:00:58.809> side<00:00:59.079> over<00:00:59.530> here<00:00:59.800> to

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
distance from the left side over here to

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.919 
distance from the left side over here to
the<00:01:00.640> beginning<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.210> bounding<00:01:01.539> box<00:01:01.569> and

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
the beginning of the bounding box and

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.850 
the beginning of the bounding box and
the<00:01:02.469> corresponding<00:01:03.129> R<00:01:03.280> value<00:01:04.269> for<00:01:04.659> right<00:01:04.989> does

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
the corresponding R value for right does

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.160 
the corresponding R value for right does
the<00:01:06.010> same<00:01:06.220> thing<00:01:06.400> for<00:01:06.430> that<00:01:06.790> right<00:01:07.000> side<00:01:07.210> so

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
the same thing for that right side so

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.510 
the same thing for that right side so
that's<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.470> distance<00:01:08.770> from<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.130> left<00:01:09.310> side

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
that's the distance from the left side

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.609 
that's the distance from the left side
of<00:01:09.670> frame<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.930> right<00:01:11.140> side<00:01:11.350> of<00:01:11.470> the

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
of frame to the right side of the

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.310 
of frame to the right side of the
aircraft<00:01:11.799> box<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.720> same<00:01:13.899> thing<00:01:14.049> is<00:01:14.170> true

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
aircraft box and the same thing is true

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.240 
aircraft box and the same thing is true
for<00:01:14.380> Y<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.070> T<00:01:15.399> so<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.479> Y<00:01:16.920> value<00:01:17.920> is<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.219> value

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
for Y and T so the Y value is the value

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.399 
for Y and T so the Y value is the value
from<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.850> bottom<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:19.450> frame<00:01:19.689> to<00:01:20.229> the

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
from the bottom of the frame to the

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.280 
from the bottom of the frame to the
bottom<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.460> bounding<00:01:21.729> box<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:23.020> T

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
bottom of the bounding box and the T

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.980 
bottom of the bounding box and the T
field<00:01:24.009> is<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.850> distance<00:01:25.240> from<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.570> bottom<00:01:25.899> of

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
field is the distance from the bottom of

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.450 
field is the distance from the bottom of
the<00:01:26.110> frame<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.710> top<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.159> bounding<00:01:27.430> box

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
the frame to the top of the bounding box

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.569 
the frame to the top of the bounding box
so<00:01:28.240> if<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.509> subtract<00:01:29.170> X<00:01:29.950> from<00:01:30.930> R<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:33.250> get<00:01:33.430> the

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
so if I subtract X from R we get the

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.520 
so if I subtract X from R we get the
actual<00:01:33.729> width<00:01:34.270> of<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.780> field<00:01:35.049> or<00:01:35.320> if<00:01:35.439> I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
actual width of the field or if I

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.130 
actual width of the field or if I
subtract<00:01:36.009> Y<00:01:36.310> from<00:01:36.340> T<00:01:37.090> we<00:01:37.390> get<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.810> actual

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
subtract Y from T we get the actual

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.170 
subtract Y from T we get the actual
height<00:01:38.469> of<00:01:38.500> our<00:01:39.219> crop<00:01:39.520> area<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.119> that's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
height of our crop area and that's

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.209 
height of our crop area and that's
exactly<00:01:40.689> what<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:40.930> get<00:01:41.110> when<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:41.740> click<00:01:42.100> on

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
exactly what you get when you click on

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.359 
exactly what you get when you click on
the<00:01:42.759> WH<00:01:43.570> button<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.229> this<00:01:44.439> now<00:01:44.619> shows<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.219> the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
the WH button so this now shows you the

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.330 
the WH button so this now shows you the
width<00:01:45.579> and<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.329> height<00:01:46.590> along<00:01:47.590> with<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.859> X<00:01:48.070> Y

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
width and the height along with the X Y

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.719 
width and the height along with the X Y
coordinates<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:49.630> here<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.549> uncheck

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
coordinates down here and if you uncheck

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.940 
coordinates down here and if you uncheck
it<00:01:52.149> it<00:01:52.299> shows<00:01:52.630> you<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.930> XY<00:01:53.350> coordinates

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
it it shows you the XY coordinates

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.770 
it it shows you the XY coordinates
beginning<00:01:54.670> at<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.000> lower<00:01:55.149> left<00:01:55.359> corner<00:01:55.600> of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780

beginning at the lower left corner of
the<00:01:55.899> frame<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:56.380> your<00:01:57.219> crop<00:01:57.430> box<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.909> also<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
the frame of your crop box and also the

the frame of your crop box and also the
upper<00:01:58.960> right<00:01:59.200> coordinates<00:02:00.039> which<00:02:00.250> are<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.640> R

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
and the T values with that in mind let's

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.139 
and the T values with that in mind let's
go<00:02:05.229> ahead<00:02:05.289> and<00:02:05.469> reformat<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.850> actually

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
go ahead and reformat that to actually

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.139 
go ahead and reformat that to actually
reduce<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.600> amount<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.960> pixels<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:09.149> render

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
reduce the amount of pixels and render

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.630 
reduce the amount of pixels and render
that<00:02:10.179> out<00:02:10.420> for<00:02:10.780> our<00:02:11.050> met<00:02:11.290> painters

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
that out for our met painters

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.690 
that out for our met painters
and<00:02:13.680> once<00:02:14.680> they're<00:02:14.860> done<00:02:14.950> painting<00:02:15.250> we'll

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
and once they're done painting we'll

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.190 
and once they're done painting we'll
have<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> look<00:02:16.120> at<00:02:16.240> how<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.480> drop<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:16.960> back

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
have a look at how to drop this back

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.400 
have a look at how to drop this back
into<00:02:17.500> our<00:02:18.010> original<00:02:18.730> map<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:20.050> here's<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
into our original map so here's the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.950 
into our original map so here's the
first<00:02:20.560> iteration<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.160> our<00:02:21.280> map<00:02:21.430> painting

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
first iteration of our map painting

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.620 
first iteration of our map painting
let's<00:02:22.960> cut<00:02:23.680> our<00:02:23.980> graffiti<00:02:24.520> slept<00:02:25.180> onto<00:02:25.540> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
let's cut our graffiti slept onto the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.770 
let's cut our graffiti slept onto the
walls<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:27.280> also<00:02:27.460> comes<00:02:27.850> with<00:02:28.150> an<00:02:28.540> alpha

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
walls and it also comes with an alpha

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.230 
walls and it also comes with an alpha
channel<00:02:29.080> in<00:02:29.170> here<00:02:29.320> now<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.580> let's<00:02:31.030> go<00:02:31.180> ahead

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
channel in here now so let's go ahead

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.500 
channel in here now so let's go ahead
and<00:02:31.330> promote<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.790> slip<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.940> straight<00:02:34.270> on

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
and promote that and slip it straight on

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.980 
and promote that and slip it straight on
to<00:02:34.750> our<00:02:35.020> background<00:02:36.180> obviously<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.960> not

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
to our background obviously this is not

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.199 
to our background obviously this is not
going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.709> position<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.220> anywhere<00:02:39.400> near<00:02:39.970> where

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
going to position it anywhere near where

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.960 
going to position it anywhere near where
it<00:02:40.360> needs<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:40.959> but<00:02:41.890> we<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.490> looked<00:02:42.700> at<00:02:42.850> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
it needs to be but we just looked at the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.330 
it needs to be but we just looked at the
crop<00:02:43.209> node<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:43.870> now<00:02:44.020> know<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.770> x<00:02:45.010> and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
crop node and we now know that the x and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.240 
crop node and we now know that the x and
y<00:02:45.610> values<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:47.110> we<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.440> uncheck<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:48.010> to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
y values and we just uncheck this to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.670 
y values and we just uncheck this to
student<00:02:48.580> context<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> frame<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.230> x<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.560> y

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
student context of the frame the x and y

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.500 
student context of the frame the x and y
values<00:02:50.730> represent<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.850> lower<00:02:52.030> left<00:02:52.270> corner

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
values represent the lower left corner

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.860 
values represent the lower left corner
of<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:53.110> box<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:54.450> relation<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.720> lower

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
of this box in relation to the lower

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.479 
of this box in relation to the lower
left<00:02:56.110> corner<00:02:56.320> of<00:02:56.500> our<00:02:56.620> frame<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.160> means

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
left corner of our frame so that means

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.970 
left corner of our frame so that means
we<00:02:57.640> can<00:02:57.790> just<00:02:57.970> use<00:02:58.180> those<00:02:58.390> X<00:02:58.690> Y<00:02:58.959> values<00:02:59.530> to

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
we can just use those X Y values to

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.190 
we can just use those X Y values to
offset<00:03:00.430> our<00:03:00.700> patch<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.660> make<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.989> match

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
offset our patch to make it match

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.920 
offset our patch to make it match
exactly<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.640> area<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.180> we<00:03:04.330> cropped<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.840> the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
exactly the area that we cropped in the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.110 
exactly the area that we cropped in the
beginning<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.250> obvious<00:03:06.520> choice<00:03:06.760> for<00:03:06.790> this

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
beginning so the obvious choice for this

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.930 
beginning so the obvious choice for this
might<00:03:07.870> be<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.170> transform<00:03:08.680> node<00:03:08.770> but<00:03:09.670> we<00:03:09.790> only

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
might be the transform node but we only

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.510 
might be the transform node but we only
need<00:03:10.209> X<00:03:10.480> Y<00:03:10.660> translation<00:03:11.410> really<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
need X Y translation really and the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.729 
need X Y translation really and the
translate<00:03:13.030> node<00:03:13.300> actually<00:03:13.870> filters

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
translate node actually filters

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.160 
translate node actually filters
subpixels<00:03:15.520> according<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.450> your<00:03:16.630> filter<00:03:16.840> list

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
subpixels according to your filter list

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.900 
subpixels according to your filter list
so<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:17.830> accidentally<00:03:18.400> punch<00:03:18.700> in

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
so if you accidentally punch in

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.240 
so if you accidentally punch in
floating-point<00:03:19.720> numbers<00:03:20.290> or<00:03:20.470> comma<00:03:20.799> values

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
floating-point numbers or comma values

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.490 
floating-point numbers or comma values
then<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.390> introduce<00:03:22.600> filtering<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.350> your

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
then you introduce filtering to your

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.170 
then you introduce filtering to your
image<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:24.070> we<00:03:24.220> don't<00:03:24.549> really<00:03:24.700> want<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:25.000> do

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
image and we don't really want to do

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.150 
image and we don't really want to do
that<00:03:25.420> because<00:03:25.959> we<00:03:26.200> really<00:03:26.530> just<00:03:26.769> want<00:03:27.040> to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
that because we really just want to

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.580 
that because we really just want to
position<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.790> patch<00:03:28.060> by<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.959> same<00:03:29.200> amount

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
position that patch by the same amount

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.850 
position that patch by the same amount
that<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.459> crop<00:03:30.790> used<00:03:31.299> when<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:31.930> extracted<00:03:32.739> the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
that the crop used when it extracted the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.830 
that the crop used when it extracted the
patch<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.340> instead<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.030> using<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.330> transform

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
patch so instead of using the transform

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.750 
patch so instead of using the transform
node<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.440> using<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.920> position<00:03:36.190> node<00:03:36.610> in

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
node I like using the position node in

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.430 
node I like using the position node in
this<00:03:36.850> case<00:03:37.120> which<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.480> also<00:03:37.840> in<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.959> transform

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
this case which is also in the transform

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.650 
this case which is also in the transform
menu<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.549> very<00:03:39.790> simple<00:03:40.090> X<00:03:40.450> Y

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
menu and that is a very simple X Y

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.020 
menu and that is a very simple X Y
offset<00:03:40.900> control<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.920> any<00:03:42.519> floating-point

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
offset control and any floating-point

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.699 
offset control and any floating-point
numbers<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:43.690> here<00:03:43.870> will<00:03:44.049> be<00:03:44.080> rounded<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.680> the

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
numbers in here will be rounded to the

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.530 
numbers in here will be rounded to the
next<00:03:45.070> integer<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:45.940> node<00:03:46.150> ensures<00:03:46.510> that

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
next integer so this node ensures that

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
patch just by positioning it and because

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.500 
patch just by positioning it and because
we<00:03:55.239> know<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.900> box<00:03:56.260> x<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.400> y<00:03:57.670> values<00:03:57.940> in

we know that the box x and y values in

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.610 
translate and do the same with Y control
drag<00:04:07.120> over<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:08.170> creates<00:04:08.500> our

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
drag over and that creates our

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.030 
drag over and that creates our
expression<00:04:09.100> links<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:10.090> if<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.269> switch<00:04:10.540> on<00:04:11.040> the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.699 
expression links so if I switch on the
expression<00:04:12.519> arrows<00:04:12.820> we<00:04:13.600> can<00:04:13.780> now<00:04:13.930> see<00:04:14.200> that

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
expression arrows we can now see that

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.880 
expression arrows we can now see that
the<00:04:14.860> crop<00:04:15.130> node<00:04:15.450> drives<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:17.169> positioning<00:04:17.739> of

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
the crop node drives the positioning of

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.580 
the crop node drives the positioning of
the<00:04:18.250> returning<00:04:18.820> map<00:04:19.000> paint<00:04:19.239> patch

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
the returning map paint patch

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.909 
the returning map paint patch
and<00:04:21.330> as<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.419> can<00:04:22.540> see<00:04:22.600> that<00:04:22.990> drops<00:04:23.260> right<00:04:23.560> into

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
and as you can see that drops right into

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.670 
and as you can see that drops right into
the<00:04:24.130> spot<00:04:24.490> where<00:04:24.790> it<00:04:24.820> should<00:04:25.090> be<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:26.590> that's

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the spot where it should be so that's

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.100 
the spot where it should be so that's
cool<00:04:26.950> but<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.730> problem<00:04:27.760> now<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.419> that<00:04:28.450> if<00:04:28.870> I

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
cool but the problem now is that if I

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.110 
cool but the problem now is that if I
actually<00:04:29.260> want<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.590> work<00:04:29.800> on<00:04:30.040> this<00:04:30.220> setup<00:04:30.820> here

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
actually want to work on this setup here

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.080 
actually want to work on this setup here
before<00:04:31.510> merging<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:31.990> onto<00:04:32.440> my<00:04:32.620> background

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
before merging it onto my background

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.520 
before merging it onto my background
it's<00:04:34.090> kind<00:04:34.389> of<00:04:34.419> impossible<00:04:34.720> because<00:04:35.380> we've

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
it's kind of impossible because we've

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.580 
it's kind of impossible because we've
just<00:04:35.560> moved<00:04:36.280> our<00:04:36.669> pixels<00:04:37.630> away<00:04:37.810> from<00:04:38.440> our

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
just moved our pixels away from our

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.830 
just moved our pixels away from our
format<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.730> bounding<00:04:40.060> box<00:04:40.090> still<00:04:40.540> keeps

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
format so the bounding box still keeps

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.510 
format so the bounding box still keeps
track<00:04:41.080> of<00:04:41.110> those<00:04:41.290> pixels<00:04:41.740> but<00:04:41.860> we<00:04:42.010> can't<00:04:42.250> see

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
track of those pixels but we can't see

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.760 
track of those pixels but we can't see
them<00:04:42.639> in<00:04:42.790> context<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.360> our<00:04:43.480> company<00:04:43.840> more<00:04:44.050> so

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
them in context of our company more so

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.860 
them in context of our company more so
you<00:04:45.160> could<00:04:45.400> use<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.580> reformat<00:04:46.180> or<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.360> crop<00:04:46.630> node

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
you could use a reformat or a crop node

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.710 
you could use a reformat or a crop node
to<00:04:47.110> increase<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:48.070> canvas<00:04:48.520> size<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:49.120> match<00:04:49.330> our

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
to increase the canvas size to match our

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.590 
to increase the canvas size to match our
original<00:04:50.410> image<00:04:50.800> here<00:04:51.370> but<00:04:52.210> what<00:04:52.450> I<00:04:52.480> usually

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
original image here but what I usually

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.620 
original image here but what I usually
do<00:04:53.080> because<00:04:53.290> I'm<00:04:53.530> lazy<00:04:53.740> is<00:04:54.040> I<00:04:54.910> just<00:04:55.210> slap<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:55.450> on

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
do because I'm lazy is I just slap it on

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.390 
do because I'm lazy is I just slap it on
top<00:04:55.840> of<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.110> image<00:04:56.200> make<00:04:57.070> sure<00:04:57.100> your

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
top of the image make sure your

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.920 
top of the image make sure your
background<00:04:57.760> is<00:04:57.880> connected<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.540> B<00:04:58.660> pipe

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
background is connected to the B pipe

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.750 
background is connected to the B pipe
which<00:04:59.169> automatically<00:04:59.860> gives<00:05:00.070> us<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.340> canvas

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
which automatically gives us the canvas

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.490 
which automatically gives us the canvas
size<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.240> then<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.050> use<00:05:02.260> a<00:05:02.290> shuffle<00:05:02.770> node<00:05:04.500> to

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
size and then I use a shuffle node to

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.580 
size and then I use a shuffle node to
black<00:05:05.770> out<00:05:05.919> all<00:05:06.639> the<00:05:07.570> channels<00:05:07.930> of<00:05:08.080> my

black out all the channels of my

black out all the channels of my
background<00:05:08.979> and<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.970> puts<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.690> matte<00:05:10.870> paint

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
background and that puts the matte paint

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.460 
background and that puts the matte paint
patch<00:05:11.320> into<00:05:12.190> context<00:05:12.700> of<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:12.910> format<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.570> we

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
patch into context of a format and we

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.850 
patch into context of a format and we
can<00:05:14.650> now<00:05:14.800> see<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:16.260> compare<00:05:17.260> it<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.740> our

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
can now see it and compare it to our

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.460 
can now see it and compare it to our
background<00:05:18.070> like<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:19.330> or<00:05:19.630> even<00:05:19.660> wipe<00:05:20.200> and

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470

it'll<00:05:21.400> actually<00:05:21.520> be<00:05:21.790> in<00:05:21.910> this<00:05:22.060> in<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.479> correct
