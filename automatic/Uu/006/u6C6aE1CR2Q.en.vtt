00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
recipe in this sauce and also realize

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.710 
recipe in this sauce and also realize
when<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> cook<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> shrink<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
when you cook it it's going to shrink a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.510 
when you cook it it's going to shrink a
little<00:01:45.840> bit<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.170> overcome<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.250> very

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
little bit and overcome you know very

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.210 
little bit and overcome you know very
flexible<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.299> that's<00:01:49.200> much<00:01:49.649> less<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.009> an<00:01:50.100> issue

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
flexible so that's much less of an issue

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.600 
flexible so that's much less of an issue
at<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.549> point<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> there's<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:55.340> same<00:01:56.340> rules

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
at that point so there's that same rules

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.859 
at that point so there's that same rules
apply<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> other<00:01:57.240> half<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> engine

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
apply for the other half of the engine

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.800 
apply for the other half of the engine
here<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:59.430> series<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.030> vertical<00:02:00.630> cuts<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.570> see

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
here the series of vertical cuts and see

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.030 
here the series of vertical cuts and see
that<00:02:03.990> what's<00:02:04.170> happening<00:02:04.469> here<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.829> route

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that what's happening here is this route

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.130 
that what's happening here is this route
ends<00:02:05.250> holding<00:02:05.579> holding<00:02:05.700> together<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
ends holding holding together so it's a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.050 
ends holding holding together so it's a
very<00:02:07.970> neat<00:02:08.970> o<00:02:09.349> for<00:02:10.349> lack<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.619> better<00:02:10.649> word

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.550 

so<00:02:16.060> we'll<00:02:16.330> do<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.600> we'll<00:02:16.690> take<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.020> end<00:02:17.260> here
