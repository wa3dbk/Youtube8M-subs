 poisons sometimes faint and here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 agro preparations are also set on fire we see 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.350
 that it was specifically this warehouse 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.060
 let's say it in one place 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.790
 specially made to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.630

 nothing more than tomato dyes 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.640
 Many pesticides fire did not harm them 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 so preserved foil 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.549
 they all met earlier so you can 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.030
 say where are the active substance 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.670
 what are their translations for 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.530
 us on this drug we are formed 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.580
 remove everything because it can not 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.960
 leave or sit and 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:51.760
 and hotels near live up to animal passport 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.730
 on a plot of land bordered by 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.770
