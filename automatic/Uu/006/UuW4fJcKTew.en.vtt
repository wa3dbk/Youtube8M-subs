on another expedition back in the early
spring<00:00:21.380> do<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:22.560> hiking<00:00:22.740> around

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
be a great time to find some footprints

be a great time to find some footprints
I<00:02:21.880> don't<00:02:22.880> know<00:02:22.970> if<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.150> guys<00:02:23.299> have<00:02:23.510> noticed

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
I don't know if you guys have noticed

00:02:23.660 --> 00:03:47.180 
I don't know if you guys have noticed
bit<00:02:24.110> more

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.680 

I'm<00:03:48.190> following<00:03:48.700> them<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:48.970> that's<00:03:49.090> unnatural

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.470 

did<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.810> hope<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.109> tell<00:03:53.290> what<00:03:53.470> they<00:03:53.650> are<00:03:57.480> but

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
did you hope to tell what they are but

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.789 
did you hope to tell what they are but
it<00:03:58.569> doesn't<00:03:58.840> seem<00:03:59.019> like<00:03:59.169> the<00:03:59.260> four-legged

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
it doesn't seem like the four-legged

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.830 
it doesn't seem like the four-legged
animal<00:04:00.250> it's<00:04:00.819> one<00:04:01.060> right<00:04:01.269> in<00:04:01.389> front<00:04:01.599> of<00:04:01.720> the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
animal it's one right in front of the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:13.800 
animal it's one right in front of the
other

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:05:32.620 

and<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:15.020> old<00:04:15.170> ones<00:04:15.440> they've<00:04:15.620> melted<00:04:15.950> out<00:05:31.630> it's

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
and the old ones they've melted out it's

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.310 
and the old ones they've melted out it's
95<00:05:33.080> percent<00:05:33.410> oxygen<00:05:33.590> we're<00:05:34.400> about<00:05:34.910> seven<00:05:35.320> to

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
95 percent oxygen we're about seven to

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.740 
95 percent oxygen we're about seven to
eight<00:05:36.350> thousand<00:05:36.950> feet<00:05:37.130> right<00:05:37.370> now<00:05:37.430> so<00:05:37.880> the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
eight thousand feet right now so the

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.720 
eight thousand feet right now so the
oxygen<00:05:39.290> levels<00:05:39.620> less<00:05:39.860> than<00:05:40.070> ten<00:05:40.280> percent

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
oxygen levels less than ten percent

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.810 
oxygen levels less than ten percent
um<00:05:42.420> oxygen<00:05:43.290> levels<00:05:43.980> are<00:05:44.130> 21%<00:05:45.000> of<00:05:45.150> sea<00:05:45.330> level

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
um oxygen levels are 21% of sea level

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.930 
um oxygen levels are 21% of sea level
when<00:05:47.820> we<00:05:47.880> hit<00:05:48.030> about<00:05:49.430> 10,000<00:05:50.430> feet<00:05:50.460> they<00:05:50.730> get

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
when we hit about 10,000 feet they get

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.070 
when we hit about 10,000 feet they get
under<00:05:51.270> 8%<00:05:51.570> so<00:05:53.570> you<00:05:54.570> can<00:05:54.750> get<00:05:54.900> altitude

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
under 8% so you can get altitude

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:21.590 
under 8% so you can get altitude
sickness<00:05:56.120> as<00:05:57.120> low<00:05:57.480> as<00:05:57.660> 7,000<00:05:58.650> feet<00:06:20.420> pick<00:06:21.420> out

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
sickness as low as 7,000 feet pick out

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.510 
sickness as low as 7,000 feet pick out
the<00:06:21.810> little<00:06:22.140> nuts<00:06:22.380> better<00:06:22.740> in<00:06:22.920> the<00:06:23.040> pine<00:06:23.250> cones

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
the little nuts better in the pine cones

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.390 
the little nuts better in the pine cones
they<00:06:24.240> kind<00:06:24.450> of<00:06:24.480> look<00:06:24.690> like<00:06:25.070> they're<00:06:26.070> gray

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
they kind of look like they're gray

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.010 
they kind of look like they're gray
white<00:06:27.330> wings<00:06:29.420> they're<00:06:30.420> the<00:06:30.540> ones<00:06:30.690> that<00:06:30.810> like

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
white wings they're the ones that like

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:51.680 
white wings they're the ones that like
the<00:06:31.140> pine<00:06:31.350> cones<00:06:49.700> I<00:06:50.700> see<00:06:50.760> them<00:06:51.090> into<00:06:51.390> the<00:06:51.480> pine

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
the pine cones I see them into the pine

00:06:51.690 --> 00:07:20.730 
the pine cones I see them into the pine
cones<00:06:51.990> all<00:06:52.170> the<00:06:52.290> time<00:06:52.500> up<00:06:52.650> on<00:06:52.770> Cedar<00:06:53.100> mouth

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.469 

I<00:07:21.180> also<00:07:22.180> do<00:07:22.449> it<00:07:22.509> as<00:07:22.659> no<00:07:22.809> harm<00:07:23.020> call<00:07:24.389> that's<00:07:25.389> the

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 
I also do it as no harm call that's the

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:26.700 
I also do it as no harm call that's the
direction<00:07:25.659> we<00:07:25.960> heard<00:07:26.110> that<00:07:26.259> vocalization

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710 
direction we heard that vocalization

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.430 
direction we heard that vocalization
