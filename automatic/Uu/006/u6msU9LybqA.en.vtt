00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
way I understand it the way YouTube

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.950 
way I understand it the way YouTube
works<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.720> pay<00:01:16.259> royalties<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
works is that they pay royalties to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.620 
works is that they pay royalties to
ASCAP<00:01:18.960> BMI<00:01:19.100> whoever<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.369> pay<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.450> like

ASCAP BMI whoever they pay it it's like

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.580 
ASCAP BMI whoever they pay it it's like
a<00:01:21.659> blanket<00:01:22.229> deal<00:01:22.790> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.970> only<00:01:24.270> time<00:01:24.590> videos

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
a blanket deal in the only time videos

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.510 
a blanket deal in the only time videos
are<00:01:25.799> taken<00:01:26.189> down<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:28.799> artists

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
are taken down is if the artists

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.460 
are taken down is if the artists
themselves<00:01:29.750> object<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:33.420> music<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.960> that

themselves object to the music in that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.870 
themselves object to the music in that
video<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:36.030> guess<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.680> were<00:01:37.890> Tom<00:01:38.460> Jones

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
video so I guess if you were Tom Jones

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.120 
video so I guess if you were Tom Jones
and<00:01:39.360> all<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> sudden<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.380> Sun<00:01:40.560> unusual

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and all of a sudden if Sun unusual

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460 
and all of a sudden if Sun unusual
became<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> theme<00:01:41.790> song<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.479> neo-nazis<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
became the theme song for neo-nazis and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.840 
became the theme song for neo-nazis and
they<00:01:43.860> were<00:01:43.979> doing<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> bunch<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.520> YouTube

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
they were doing a bunch of YouTube

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.639 
they were doing a bunch of YouTube
videos<00:01:45.180> Tom<00:01:45.420> Jones<00:01:45.689> could<00:01:45.899> say<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> don't<00:01:46.470> want

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
videos Tom Jones could say I don't want

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
videos Tom Jones could say I don't want
to<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.770> associated<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.540> know

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
to be associated with that and you know

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.770 
to be associated with that and you know
rightly<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> guess<00:01:50.570> so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
rightly so I guess so

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.719 
rightly so I guess so
like<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:52.829> videos<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.460> did<00:01:53.610> one

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
like in some of my videos like I did one

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.039 
like in some of my videos like I did one
on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> Bemis<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> while<00:01:54.630> back<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.960> this

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
on the Bemis for a while back and this

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.450 
on the Bemis for a while back and this
has<00:01:55.200> happened<00:01:55.320> several<00:01:55.680> times<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> look

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
has happened several times if you look

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.100 
has happened several times if you look
at<00:01:56.579> some<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> my<00:01:56.850> videos<00:01:57.750> where<00:01:57.869> i<00:01:57.930> dealing

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
at some of my videos where i dealing

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.910 
at some of my videos where i dealing
with<00:01:58.170> mixing<00:01:58.619> i<00:02:00.049> had<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.290> track<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.710> there

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.709 
with mixing i had the track in there
seeds<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.820> music<00:02:03.060> factor<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.420> got<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> make

seeds to music factor you got to make

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.200 
seeds to music factor you got to make
you<00:02:03.840> sweat<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.250> guess<00:02:05.430> Werner<00:02:05.790> found<00:02:06.030> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you sweat and I guess Werner found it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.650 
you sweat and I guess Werner found it
and<00:02:06.960> instead<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.469> flagging<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.129> or<00:02:08.509> instead<00:02:09.509> of

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
and instead of flagging it or instead of

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.949 
and instead of flagging it or instead of
requesting<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:10.979> remove<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.120> or

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
requesting that I remove it or

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.780 
requesting that I remove it or
getting<00:02:13.680> me<00:02:13.799> in<00:02:13.920> trouble<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.370> guess<00:02:14.579> are

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
getting me in trouble I guess are

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.160 
getting me in trouble I guess are
getting<00:02:15.000> some<00:02:15.180> kind<00:02:15.269> of<00:02:15.359> penalty<00:02:15.629> against<00:02:15.989> me

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170

suggest another site or not but it's a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.339 
suggest another site or not but it's a
like<00:02:26.129> little<00:02:26.400> ad<00:02:26.579> that<00:02:26.790> pops<00:02:27.000> up<00:02:27.209> for<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.109> song

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
itself I don't have a problem with that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.589 
itself I don't have a problem with that
that<00:02:30.810> song<00:02:31.079> does<00:02:31.409> belong<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:32.269> whoever<00:02:33.269> belongs

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
that song does belong to whoever belongs

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.740 
that song does belong to whoever belongs
to<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.590> they<00:02:35.310> have<00:02:35.430> every<00:02:35.639> right<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.879> cash<00:02:36.450> in

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
to and they have every right to cash in

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.509 
to and they have every right to cash in
though<00:02:37.439> I<00:02:37.469> wasn't<00:02:37.859> trying<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.040> cash<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
though I wasn't trying to cash in I

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.119 
though I wasn't trying to cash in I
guess<00:02:38.700> was<00:02:38.849> kind<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.150> point<00:02:40.069> there's<00:02:41.069> a

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
guess was kind of the point there's a

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.780 
guess was kind of the point there's a
thing<00:02:41.340> called<00:02:41.370> fair<00:02:41.760> usage<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:46.709> think<00:02:47.579> that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
thing called fair usage and I think that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.520 
thing called fair usage and I think that
we<00:02:48.120> should<00:02:48.359> fall<00:02:48.569> under<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.750> category<00:02:49.049> as

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
we should fall under that category as

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.190 
we should fall under that category as
DJs<00:02:50.480> since<00:02:51.480> we're<00:02:51.599> not<00:02:51.689> really<00:02:51.750> selling

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
DJs since we're not really selling

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.789 
DJs since we're not really selling
anything<00:02:52.560> here<00:02:53.010> we're<00:02:53.549> just<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.799> showing

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
anything here we're just kind of showing

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.979 
anything here we're just kind of showing
what<00:02:55.919> we<00:02:55.950> do<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.549> how<00:02:56.639> we<00:02:56.669> do<00:02:56.939> it<00:02:57.120> we<00:02:57.840> need

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
what we do and how we do it we need

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.110 
what we do and how we do it we need

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
music to do it usually Mauro did a video

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.110 
music to do it usually Mauro did a video
about<00:03:00.239> this<00:03:01.219> how<00:03:02.219> are<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:02.489> supposed<00:03:02.879> to<00:03:02.969> do

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
about this how are we supposed to do

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.119 
about this how are we supposed to do
