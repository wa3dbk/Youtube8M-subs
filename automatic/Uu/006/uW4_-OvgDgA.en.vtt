00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
okay now I want to cover one more thing

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.380 
okay now I want to cover one more thing
you<00:00:10.160> have<00:00:10.190> a<00:00:10.340> lot<00:00:10.550> of<00:00:10.580> transportation

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.390 
you have a lot of transportation

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.000 
you have a lot of transportation
so<00:00:12.690> you've<00:00:12.809> got<00:00:12.960> all<00:00:13.170> these<00:00:13.320> tubes<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
so you've got all these tubes and

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.580 
so you've got all these tubes and
vessels<00:00:14.550> that<00:00:14.670> are<00:00:15.020> carrying<00:00:16.020> things<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.440> and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
vessels that are carrying things to and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.010 
vessels that are carrying things to and
from<00:00:16.740> different<00:00:16.920> organs<00:00:17.570> you<00:00:18.570> first<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.960> all

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
from different organs you first of all

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.630 
from different organs you first of all
you<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.320> your<00:00:19.350> arteries<00:00:19.950> in<00:00:20.220> your<00:00:20.250> veins

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
you have your arteries in your veins

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.050 
you have your arteries in your veins
most<00:00:21.599> of<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> time<00:00:22.200> your<00:00:22.920> arteries<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.670> going

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
most of the time your arteries are going

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.030 
most of the time your arteries are going
to<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.300> red<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.050> your<00:00:25.349> veins<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.860> to<00:00:25.920> be

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
to be red and your veins are going to be

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.400 
to be red and your veins are going to be
blue<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:26.939> memorize<00:00:27.390> your<00:00:27.990> vessels

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
blue but do not memorize your vessels

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.500 
blue but do not memorize your vessels
based<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.859> those<00:00:29.039> colors<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
based on those colors because the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.390 
based on those colors because the
definition<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.230> an<00:00:31.350> artery<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.010> that<00:00:32.279> it

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
definition of an artery is that it

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.090 
definition of an artery is that it
carries<00:00:32.760> blood<00:00:33.120> away<00:00:33.390> from<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:34.050> heart<00:00:34.170> so

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
carries blood away from the heart so

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.790 
carries blood away from the heart so
this<00:00:35.340> big<00:00:35.610> vessel<00:00:36.090> right<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.870> an<00:00:37.230> artery

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
this big vessel right here is an artery

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.890 
this big vessel right here is an artery
it's<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.309> aorta<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.090> carrying<00:00:39.390> blood<00:00:39.660> away

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
it's the aorta it's carrying blood away

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.900 
it's the aorta it's carrying blood away
from<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> heart<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.190> being<00:00:41.370> pushed<00:00:41.670> out

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
from the heart and it's being pushed out

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.790 
from the heart and it's being pushed out
to<00:00:42.210> all<00:00:42.330> parts<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> body<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.470> that's

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
to all parts of the body and that's

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.439 
to all parts of the body and that's
going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.190> bringing<00:00:44.489> oxygen<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.390> parts

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
going to be bringing oxygen to all parts

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.500 
going to be bringing oxygen to all parts
of<00:00:45.839> the<00:00:45.930> body<00:00:46.129> okay<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.790> right<00:00:48.089> below<00:00:48.479> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
of the body okay but right below that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810 
of the body okay but right below that
you've<00:00:49.049> got<00:00:49.080> another<00:00:49.589> vessel<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.430> which<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
you've got another vessel here which is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.200 
you've got another vessel here which is
blue<00:00:51.150> which<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.960> also<00:00:52.229> an<00:00:52.739> artery<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> it's

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
blue which is also an artery and it's

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.140 
blue which is also an artery and it's
carrying<00:00:54.629> blood<00:00:54.870> towards<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> lungs<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.339> it's

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
carrying blood towards the lungs so it's

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.729 
carrying blood towards the lungs so it's
still<00:00:57.479> carrying<00:00:57.960> blood<00:00:58.080> away<00:00:58.320> from<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.650> heart

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
still carrying blood away from the heart

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.270 
still carrying blood away from the heart
so<00:00:59.190> don't<00:00:59.220> go<00:00:59.699> with<00:01:00.000> arteries<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.140> blue<00:01:01.860> or<00:01:02.159> red

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so don't go with arteries or blue or red

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.460 
so don't go with arteries or blue or red
and<00:01:02.519> veins<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.360> blue<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.839> doesn't<00:01:04.320> always

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and veins are blue that doesn't always

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.539 
and veins are blue that doesn't always
work<00:01:04.680> remember

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
work remember

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.450 
work remember
arteries<00:01:06.030> carry<00:01:06.060> blood<00:01:06.390> away<00:01:06.869> from<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.290> heart

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
arteries carry blood away from the heart

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.580 
arteries carry blood away from the heart
veins<00:01:08.460> carry<00:01:08.880> blood<00:01:09.060> towards<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.810> heart<00:01:10.049> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
veins carry blood towards the heart so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.200 
veins carry blood towards the heart so
you've<00:01:10.710> got<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> aorta<00:01:11.549> carrying<00:01:11.880> blood<00:01:12.000> away

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you've got the aorta carrying blood away

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.820 
you've got the aorta carrying blood away
from<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> heart<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.590> pulmonary

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
from the heart this is your pulmonary

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.590 
from the heart this is your pulmonary
trunk<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.640> carrying<00:01:14.939> blood<00:01:15.060> away<00:01:15.330> from<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
trunk this carrying blood away from the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.039 
trunk this carrying blood away from the
heart

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
heart

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.810 
heart
but<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.440> you<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> superior<00:01:17.430> vena<00:01:17.640> cava

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
but then you have the superior vena cava

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.420 
but then you have the superior vena cava
which<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.870> bringing<00:01:19.170> blood<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:20.250> head

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
which is bringing blood from your head

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.250 
which is bringing blood from your head
down<00:01:20.760> towards<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.390> heart<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.050> an

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
down towards the heart you have an

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.230 
down towards the heart you have an
inferior<00:01:22.950> vena<00:01:23.250> cava<00:01:23.370> which<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.970> bringing

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
inferior vena cava which is bringing

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.910 
inferior vena cava which is bringing
blood<00:01:24.540> from<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> below<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.500> part<00:01:25.740> I'll

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
blood from the below your part I'll

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590 
blood from the below your part I'll
parts<00:01:26.190> of<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:26.370> body<00:01:26.550> back<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:26.880> towards<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
parts of your body back up towards the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840 
parts of your body back up towards the
heart<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.560> you've<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> abdominal

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
heart then you've got the abdominal

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
heart then you've got the abdominal
aorta<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:30.930> carrying<00:01:31.350> blood<00:01:31.620> away<00:01:31.830> from

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
aorta which is carrying blood away from

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.840 
aorta which is carrying blood away from
the<00:01:32.370> heart

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the heart

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.420 
the heart
so<00:01:33.140> remember<00:01:34.140> arteries<00:01:34.560> carry<00:01:34.800> blood<00:01:34.920> away

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so remember arteries carry blood away

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.790 
so remember arteries carry blood away
from<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.120> heart<00:01:36.210> veins<00:01:36.690> carry<00:01:36.990> blood<00:01:37.110> towards

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
from the heart veins carry blood towards

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.130 
from the heart veins carry blood towards
the<00:01:37.920> heart<00:01:38.160> and<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.420> depends<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.900> whether

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the heart and it just depends on whether

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.680 
the heart and it just depends on whether
or<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.620> oxygenated<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.610> not<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
or not it's oxygenated or not as to the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.230 
or not it's oxygenated or not as to the
color<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.350> these<00:01:43.560> models<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.550> this<00:01:44.730> has<00:01:44.940> no

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
color on these models so this has no

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.420 
color on these models so this has no
oxygen<00:01:45.480> in<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
oxygen in it because it's going to the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.880 
oxygen in it because it's going to the
lungs<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.150> that<00:01:48.300> it<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.659> get<00:01:48.780> reoxygenate<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890

think<00:02:35.540> about<00:02:35.870> what's<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.530> your<00:02:36.770> skin<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.610> your

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
think about what's in your skin and your

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.670 
think about what's in your skin and your
tissues<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.360> everything<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:39.200> want<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.470> take

that<00:02:39.950> liquid<00:02:40.730> from<00:02:41.239> your<00:02:41.420> tissues<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.200> you

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
that liquid from your tissues and you

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.990 
that liquid from your tissues and you
want<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.620> filter<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.220> out<00:02:43.400> through<00:02:43.790> these

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
want to filter it out through these

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.120 
want to filter it out through these
lymph<00:02:44.300> nodes<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.290> just<00:02:45.440> right<00:02:45.650> running

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
lymph nodes so it's just right running

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.460 
lymph nodes so it's just right running
all<00:02:46.370> your<00:02:46.640> fluids<00:02:47.600> through<00:02:47.840> these<00:02:47.989> filters

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
all your fluids through these filters

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.770 
all your fluids through these filters
and<00:02:48.709> then<00:02:49.370> we're<00:02:49.640> going<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.790> take<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.239> fluid

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
and then we're going to take that fluid

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.620 
and then we're going to take that fluid
and<00:02:50.989> dump<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.769> back<00:02:51.800> into<00:02:52.459> our<00:02:52.640> blood<00:02:53.030> vascular

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
and dump it back into our blood vascular

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.710 
and dump it back into our blood vascular
system<00:02:54.110> so<00:02:54.709> these<00:02:55.100> would<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.400> lymph<00:02:56.060> nodes<00:02:56.360> or

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
system so these would be lymph nodes or

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.420 
system so these would be lymph nodes or
sees<00:02:56.989> me<00:02:57.110> lymph<00:02:57.290> vessels<00:02:57.800> these<00:02:58.069> would<00:02:58.280> be

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
sees me lymph vessels these would be

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.550 
sees me lymph vessels these would be
lymph<00:02:58.640> nodes<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.239> if<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.780> were<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.050> name<00:03:00.230> this

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
lymph nodes so if you were to name this

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.470 
lymph nodes so if you were to name this
you<00:03:00.830> would<00:03:00.920> say<00:03:01.130> this<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.519> femoral<00:03:02.209> region

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
you would say this is the femoral region

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.460 
you would say this is the femoral region
of<00:03:02.870> your<00:03:03.260> body<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:04.160> on<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.760> left<00:03:05.480> side<00:03:05.780> so

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
of your body it's on the left side so

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.790 
of your body it's on the left side so
these<00:03:06.680> would<00:03:06.890> be<00:03:06.950> left<00:03:07.550> femoral<00:03:08.800> lymphatic

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
these would be left femoral lymphatic

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.059 
these would be left femoral lymphatic
vessels<00:03:10.340> these<00:03:10.730> would<00:03:10.940> be<00:03:11.090> left<00:03:11.420> femoral

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
vessels these would be left femoral

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.190 
vessels these would be left femoral
lymph<00:03:13.069> nodes<00:03:13.400> if<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.269> went<00:03:14.450> up<00:03:14.540> in<00:03:14.720> here<00:03:15.019> like

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
lymph nodes if you went up in here like

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.199 
lymph nodes if you went up in here like
a<00:03:15.260> near<00:03:15.530> armpit<00:03:16.100> remember<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.579> armpit<00:03:17.030> region

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
a near armpit remember the armpit region

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.229 
a near armpit remember the armpit region
is<00:03:17.570> known<00:03:17.750> as<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.110> axillary<00:03:18.890> area<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:20.060> these

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
is known as the axillary area so these

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.740 
is known as the axillary area so these
would<00:03:20.510> be<00:03:20.570> left<00:03:21.200> axillary<00:03:22.160> lymph<00:03:22.610> node<00:03:22.750> lymph

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
would be left axillary lymph node lymph

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.900 
would be left axillary lymph node lymph
vessels<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.530> then<00:03:24.950> these<00:03:25.100> little<00:03:25.370> brown<00:03:25.519> dots

here<00:03:26.299> which<00:03:26.480> are<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.019> filters<00:03:27.440> would<00:03:27.739> be<00:03:27.920> left

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
here which are the filters would be left

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.970 
here which are the filters would be left
