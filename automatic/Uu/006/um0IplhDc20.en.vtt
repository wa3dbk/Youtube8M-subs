back in this video I will show you one
really<00:00:05.609> really<00:00:06.180> old<00:00:06.390> contraption<00:00:07.200> surprise

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
really really old contraption surprise

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.940 
really really old contraption surprise
no<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.330> just<00:00:09.660> think<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.230> not<00:00:10.559> many<00:00:10.769> people

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
no I just think that not many people

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.669 
no I just think that not many people
know<00:00:11.460> about<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.900> also<00:00:13.110> easy<00:00:13.530> to

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
know about it and it is also easy to

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.160 
know about it and it is also easy to
build<00:00:14.160> even<00:00:14.490> for<00:00:14.820> beginners<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.450> redstone<00:00:15.929> so

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
build even for beginners in redstone so

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.320 
build even for beginners in redstone so
I've<00:00:16.350> decided<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.830> include<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.580> my<00:00:17.730> series

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
I've decided to include it in my series

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.510 
I've decided to include it in my series
because<00:00:18.810> I'm<00:00:19.410> usually<00:00:19.770> doing<00:00:20.189> really

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
because I'm usually doing really

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.849 
because I'm usually doing really
advanced<00:00:21.060> stuff<00:00:21.210> but<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.230> nice<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.500> take<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
advanced stuff but it's nice to take a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.070 
advanced stuff but it's nice to take a
break<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.490> something<00:00:23.880> simpler<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.840> yeah<00:00:25.050> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
break and do something simpler so yeah I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.040 
break and do something simpler so yeah I
am<00:00:25.380> talking<00:00:25.830> about<00:00:25.980> infinite<00:00:26.699> by<00:00:27.029> 9<00:00:27.359> quasi

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
am talking about infinite by 9 quasi

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.250 
am talking about infinite by 9 quasi
door<00:00:28.349> or<00:00:28.650> gate<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.970> before<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.689> will<00:00:30.869> look<00:00:31.080> at

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
door or gate but before we will look at

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.130 
door or gate but before we will look at
it<00:00:31.410> I've<00:00:31.980> got<00:00:32.250> these<00:00:32.520> diamonds<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> collect<00:00:33.719> so

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it I've got these diamonds to collect so

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.100 
it I've got these diamonds to collect so
yeah<00:00:34.530> diamonds<00:00:35.399> let's<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.600> let's<00:00:36.870> collect

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
yeah diamonds let's do it let's collect

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.430 
yeah diamonds let's do it let's collect
some<00:00:37.230> die<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:39.379> what<00:00:40.379> oh<00:00:42.050> I'm<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.320> kidding

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
some die what what oh I'm just kidding

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.700 
some die what what oh I'm just kidding
of<00:00:43.800> course<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.390> wanted<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.450> know<00:00:45.809> how<00:00:46.170> well<00:00:46.440> you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
of course I wanted to know how well you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.279 
of course I wanted to know how well you
can<00:00:46.950> imitate<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.730> diamond<00:00:48.120> or<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.140> can

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
can imitate a diamond or and as you can

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.819 
can imitate a diamond or and as you can
see<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.620> looks<00:00:49.800> pretty<00:00:50.129> similar<00:00:51.320> anyway<00:00:52.350> let's

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
see it looks pretty similar anyway let's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.389 
see it looks pretty similar anyway let's
see<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.670> gate<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.340> is

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
see the gate and here we are and this is

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.450 
see the gate and here we are and this is
the<00:00:56.670> door<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.510> gate<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.199> whatever<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.250> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the door or the gate or whatever it is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
the door or the gate or whatever it is
and<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.270> my<00:01:00.420> old<00:01:00.899> creative<00:01:01.469> world<00:01:01.739> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and we are in my old creative world so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.529 
and we are in my old creative world so
for<00:01:02.219> example<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> an<00:01:03.329> arrow

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
for example right there is an arrow

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.840 
for example right there is an arrow
generator<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.799> music<00:01:05.220> disc<00:01:05.369> found<00:01:05.700> out

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
generator with a music disc found out

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120 
generator with a music disc found out
below<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.110> why<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.740> we

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
below but that is not why we are here we

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.580 
below but that is not why we are here we
are<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.700> appreciate<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.510> design<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
are here to appreciate this design and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
are here to appreciate this design and
the<00:01:11.010> design<00:01:11.189> came<00:01:11.729> from<00:01:11.760> jamol<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:13.049> six

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the design came from jamol one one six

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.429 
the design came from jamol one one six
or<00:01:13.619> after<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> saw<00:01:14.939> his<00:01:15.150> video<00:01:15.360> about<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> similar

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
or after I saw his video about a similar

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.280 
or after I saw his video about a similar
concept<00:01:16.740> he<00:01:17.670> used<00:01:17.909> glass<00:01:18.270> paints<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.930> iron

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
concept he used glass paints and iron

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.249 
concept he used glass paints and iron
bars<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:20.189> create<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> 2x2<00:01:21.060> door<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.689> basically

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
bars to create a 2x2 door and basically

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.219 
bars to create a 2x2 door and basically
the<00:01:22.409> design<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.950> probably<00:01:23.689> not<00:01:24.689> working

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the design is probably not working

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
the design is probably not working
anymore<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.979> those<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.640> connect<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
anymore because those two connect to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.910 
anymore because those two connect to
each<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.140> still<00:01:28.409> use<00:01:28.470> these

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
each other but we can still use these

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
each other but we can still use these
fences<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.240> go<00:01:30.390> through<00:01:30.689> they

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
fences because we can go through they

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.740 
fences because we can go through they
are<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.650> connected<00:01:31.950> connected<00:01:32.939> connected

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
are not connected connected connected

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
are not connected connected connected
right<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.369> push<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.939> button

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
right now but we can push this button

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.359 
right now but we can push this button
and<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:37.020> will<00:01:37.229> connect<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> each<00:01:37.829> other<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and they will connect to each other and

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.560 
and they will connect to each other and
now<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.360> course<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:40.140> cannot<00:01:40.710> go<00:01:41.009> through<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
now of course we cannot go through it

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.319 
now of course we cannot go through it
and<00:01:42.570> yeah<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.350> again<00:01:44.040> open<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.000> it's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and yeah we can again open it and it's

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.330 
and yeah we can again open it and it's
really<00:01:45.630> easy<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.350> create<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.860> even<00:01:47.189> though

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
really easy to create this even though

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.580 
really easy to create this even though
you<00:01:47.700> can't<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.270> customize<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.200> much

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you can't really customize it much

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.410 
you can't really customize it much
because<00:01:49.829> yeah<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:51.530> even<00:01:52.530> when<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.430> when

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
because yeah and even when it is when

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.469 
because yeah and even when it is when
you<00:01:54.689> close<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.430> let's<00:01:56.430> close<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> yet<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.270> it's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
you close it let's close it yet now it's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.600 
you close it let's close it yet now it's
closed<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.649> push<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.219> close<00:01:59.460> button

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
closed now we can push the close button

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.270 
closed now we can push the close button
again<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.600> will<00:02:00.810> open<00:02:01.290> itself<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
again and it will open itself for a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.819 
again and it will open itself for a
split<00:02:02.640> second<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.299> yeah<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:04.140> how<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.469> can

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
split second so yeah that's how you can

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.520 
split second so yeah that's how you can
use<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.219> if<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.090> are<00:02:06.119> building<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.780> castle<00:02:07.049> or

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
use it if you are building a castle or

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.070 
use it if you are building a castle or
something<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:09.119> could<00:02:09.360> appreciate

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
something like that you could appreciate

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.030 
something like that you could appreciate
this<00:02:10.379> design<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.280> don't<00:02:11.489> know<00:02:11.640> it's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
this design but I don't know it's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.170 
this design but I don't know it's
I<00:02:13.099> find<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.269> handy<00:02:14.780> yeah<00:02:15.579> so<00:02:16.579> let's<00:02:16.849> see<00:02:17.030> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
I find it handy yeah so let's see the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.059 
I find it handy yeah so let's see the
Redstone<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:17.900> behind<00:02:18.079> it<00:02:18.469> I<00:02:18.620> basically

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
Redstone that is behind it I basically

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.949 
Redstone that is behind it I basically
used<00:02:19.430> mcedit<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.090> copy<00:02:20.359> paste<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.719> and<00:02:20.900> then

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
used mcedit to copy paste it and then

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.839 
used mcedit to copy paste it and then
actually<00:02:21.709> remove<00:02:21.950> all<00:02:22.159> the<00:02:22.219> blocks<00:02:22.519> that<00:02:22.670> were

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
actually remove all the blocks that were

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.369 
actually remove all the blocks that were
in<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.150> way<00:02:23.269> so<00:02:23.329> now<00:02:23.689> it<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.989> just<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
in the way so now it is just the

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.740 
in the way so now it is just the
skeleton<00:02:24.859> and<00:02:25.099> we<00:02:25.819> can<00:02:25.969> see<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.269> is<00:02:26.390> even<00:02:26.599> a

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
skeleton and we can see it is even a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.630 
skeleton and we can see it is even a
resource<00:02:27.079> friendly<00:02:27.290> yeah<00:02:27.799> we<00:02:28.310> have<00:02:28.459> two

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
resource friendly yeah we have two

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.699 
resource friendly yeah we have two
buttons<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:29.120> is<00:02:29.450> stone<00:02:29.810> button<00:02:30.230> one<00:02:30.470> is

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
buttons one is stone button one is

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.130 
buttons one is stone button one is
wooden<00:02:31.400> button<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.909> if<00:02:32.060> we<00:02:32.239> press<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.840> stone

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
wooden button and if we press the stone

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.349 
wooden button and if we press the stone
button<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.799> closes<00:02:34.370> itself<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
button it closes itself because the

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.780 
button it closes itself because the
length<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.590> signal<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.129> different<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:37.670> is

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
length of the signal is different it is

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.550 
length of the signal is different it is
shorter<00:02:38.150> than<00:02:38.299> with<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.659> wooden<00:02:38.959> button<00:02:39.379> and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
shorter than with the wooden button and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.770 
shorter than with the wooden button and
that<00:02:40.069> is<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.639> only<00:02:40.879> difference<00:02:41.569> between

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
that is the only difference between

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.530 
that is the only difference between
opening<00:02:42.500> opening<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.609> closing<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.269> door

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
opening opening and closing this door

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.899 
opening opening and closing this door
basically<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.620> depends<00:02:45.980> on<00:02:46.159> the<00:02:46.370> length<00:02:46.609> of

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
basically it depends on the length of

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.690 
basically it depends on the length of
the<00:02:46.970> signal<00:02:47.629> so<00:02:47.870> these<00:02:48.439> two<00:02:48.650> buttons<00:02:48.829> can<00:02:49.159> open

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
the signal so these two buttons can open

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.729 
the signal so these two buttons can open
and<00:02:49.879> close<00:02:49.909> it<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.450> then<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.079> signal<00:02:51.500> goes

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
and close it and then the signal goes

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.659 
and close it and then the signal goes
through<00:02:52.579> this<00:02:52.909> tower<00:02:53.329> up<00:02:53.629> here<00:02:54.489> into<00:02:55.489> this

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
through this tower up here into this

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:00.610 
through this tower up here into this
repeater<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:58.010> Pass<00:02:58.810> shortener<00:02:59.810> that

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
repeater and this Pass shortener that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.629 
repeater and this Pass shortener that
makes<00:03:01.370> one<00:03:01.760> pass<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.389> that<00:03:02.799> goes<00:03:03.799> up<00:03:04.040> through

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
makes one pass and that goes up through

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.839 
makes one pass and that goes up through
these<00:03:04.959> Pistons<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.200> those<00:03:07.189> Pistons<00:03:07.609> can

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
these Pistons and those Pistons can

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.629 
these Pistons and those Pistons can
extend<00:03:08.209> only<00:03:08.599> if<00:03:08.840> these<00:03:09.200> Pistons<00:03:10.010> are<00:03:10.189> not

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
extend only if these Pistons are not

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.470 
extend only if these Pistons are not
extended<00:03:11.299> so<00:03:11.599> if<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:13.010> pass<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.760> too<00:03:14.060> short

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
extended so if the pass is too short

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.990 
extended so if the pass is too short
then<00:03:15.169> those<00:03:15.409> Pistons<00:03:15.829> down<00:03:16.099> will<00:03:16.459> not<00:03:16.489> be

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
then those Pistons down will not be

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.110 
then those Pistons down will not be
extended<00:03:17.359> when<00:03:17.750> those<00:03:18.139> Pistons<00:03:18.590> up<00:03:18.879> want<00:03:19.879> to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
extended when those Pistons up want to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.170 
extended when those Pistons up want to
extend<00:03:20.659> or<00:03:20.900> if<00:03:21.799> these<00:03:22.159> pistons<00:03:22.729> with<00:03:22.970> the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
extend or if these pistons with the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.899 
extend or if these pistons with the
wooden<00:03:23.810> button<00:03:24.169> and<00:03:24.379> we<00:03:25.010> can't<00:03:25.280> really<00:03:25.459> see<00:03:25.790> it

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
wooden button and we can't really see it

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.569 
wooden button and we can't really see it
right<00:03:26.030> now<00:03:26.389> but<00:03:26.989> if<00:03:27.680> we<00:03:27.769> press<00:03:28.159> the<00:03:28.310> wooden

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
right now but if we press the wooden

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.309 
right now but if we press the wooden
button<00:03:28.940> basically<00:03:29.449> the<00:03:29.569> signal<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.049> still

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
button basically the signal is still

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.240 
button basically the signal is still
down<00:03:30.560> there

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
down there

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.119 
down there
so<00:03:31.639> those<00:03:32.120> Pistons<00:03:32.599> up<00:03:32.750> here<00:03:33.109> cannot<00:03:33.470> extend

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
so those Pistons up here cannot extend

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.219 
so those Pistons up here cannot extend
and<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.120> principle<00:03:35.359> that<00:03:35.900> is<00:03:36.049> behind

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229 
and that is the principle that is behind

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.610 
and that is the principle that is behind
it<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.849> hope<00:03:37.849> you<00:03:38.000> understand<00:03:38.599> because<00:03:39.049> because

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
it I hope you understand because because

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.530 
it I hope you understand because because
that<00:03:39.829> was<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.159> end<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.609> tutorial<00:03:40.790> part

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
that was the end of the tutorial part

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.629 
that was the end of the tutorial part
and<00:03:41.810> now<00:03:41.959> I<00:03:41.989> want<00:03:42.379> to<00:03:42.500> just<00:03:42.680> demonstrate<00:03:42.859> it<00:03:43.459> it

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
and now I want to just demonstrate it it

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.420 
and now I want to just demonstrate it it
is<00:03:43.790> really<00:03:44.090> infinite<00:03:44.449> by<00:03:44.750> nine<00:03:45.109> door<00:03:45.560> or<00:03:46.069> gate

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
is really infinite by nine door or gate

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.030 
is really infinite by nine door or gate
and<00:03:46.699> so<00:03:46.879> let's<00:03:47.120> open<00:03:47.299> it<00:03:47.599> and<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:48.349> goes<00:03:48.560> even<00:03:48.799> to

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
and so let's open it and it goes even to

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.069 
and so let's open it and it goes even to
unloaded<00:03:49.609> chunks<00:03:49.639> it<00:03:50.389> is<00:03:50.599> a<00:03:50.629> little<00:03:50.930> bit

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
unloaded chunks it is a little bit

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.319 
unloaded chunks it is a little bit
impractical<00:03:51.470> because<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.519> can't<00:03:52.879> use<00:03:53.180> it

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
impractical because you can't use it

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.649 
impractical because you can't use it
with<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.569> horse<00:03:54.049> for<00:03:54.290> example<00:03:54.709> but<00:03:54.939> whatever<00:03:55.939> it

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
with a horse for example but whatever it

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.770 
with a horse for example but whatever it
looks<00:03:56.959> cool<00:03:57.349> and<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:58.159> is<00:03:58.220> easy<00:03:58.699> to<00:03:58.819> build<00:03:59.209> even

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
looks cool and it is easy to build even

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.500

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
wondering how the terrain for this

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.159 
wondering how the terrain for this
diamond<00:04:12.680> ore<00:04:12.829> looks<00:04:13.430> like<00:04:13.759> it<00:04:14.030> looks<00:04:14.299> pretty

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
diamond ore looks like it looks pretty

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.839 
diamond ore looks like it looks pretty
crazy<00:04:16.690> but<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.870> mainly<00:04:18.320> made<00:04:18.979> out<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.579> wool

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
so theoretically you could do it in

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.390 
so theoretically you could do it in
survival<00:04:23.060> for<00:04:23.690> example<00:04:24.110> with<00:04:24.260> my<00:04:24.469> AFK<00:04:25.130> wool

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400
