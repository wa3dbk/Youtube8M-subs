another this way you can give two or

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.520 
another this way you can give two or
more<00:00:17.700> symbols<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.360> exact<00:00:18.780> same<00:00:19.050> animation

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
more symbols the exact same animation

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.040 
more symbols the exact same animation
behavior<00:00:20.190> without<00:00:20.340> having<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.000> recreate<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
behavior without having to recreate the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.439 
behavior without having to recreate the
animation<00:00:22.619> again<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.070> again<00:00:23.279> simply<00:00:24.179> copy

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
animation again and again simply copy

and paste so what we're looking at here
on<00:00:27.359> my<00:00:27.539> stage<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.500> bird<00:00:28.710> graphic

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
on my stage is I have a bird graphic

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.890 
on my stage is I have a bird graphic
that's<00:00:29.550> being<00:00:29.730> tween<00:00:30.060> de<00:00:30.210> cross<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> stage

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that's being tween de cross the stage

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.080 
that's being tween de cross the stage
from<00:00:31.169> frames<00:00:31.500> 1<00:00:31.830> through<00:00:32.099> 50<00:00:34.640> if<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.790> hit<00:00:35.970> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
from frames 1 through 50 if I hit the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.639 
from frames 1 through 50 if I hit the
return<00:00:36.450> key<00:00:36.480> you'll<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.200> moved<00:00:37.469> from

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
return key you'll see it moved from

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.369 
return key you'll see it moved from
right<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.070> left<00:00:38.100> across<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.910> stage<00:00:39.230> now<00:00:40.230> what

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
right to left across the stage now what

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.290 
right to left across the stage now what
I'd<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.219> take<00:00:41.399> another<00:00:41.789> instance

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
I'd like to do is take another instance

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.060 
I'd like to do is take another instance
of<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.510> bird<00:00:42.750> symbol<00:00:43.199> and<00:00:43.320> animate<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.949> in

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
of this bird symbol and animate it in

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.270 
of this bird symbol and animate it in
the<00:00:44.219> exact<00:00:44.550> same<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.390> whole<00:00:45.690> new<00:00:45.870> layer

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
the exact same way on a whole new layer

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.770 
the exact same way on a whole new layer
so<00:00:47.280> first<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> set<00:00:48.149> myself<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.719> for

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so first I'm going to set myself up for

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.650 
so first I'm going to set myself up for
a<00:00:49.020> new<00:00:49.260> tween<00:00:49.590> by<00:00:50.430> clicking<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> insert<00:00:51.120> layer

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a new tween by clicking the insert layer

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.599 
a new tween by clicking the insert layer
icon<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> bottom<00:00:52.590> left<00:00:52.800> hand<00:00:53.129> corner<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
icon in the bottom left hand corner of

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.000 
icon in the bottom left hand corner of
the<00:00:53.760> timeline<00:00:53.910> panel<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the timeline panel and this is going to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
the timeline panel and this is going to
create<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.280> new<00:00:56.370> blank<00:00:56.789> layer<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.359> a<00:00:57.390> single

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
create a new blank layer with a single

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.349 
create a new blank layer with a single
keyframe<00:00:58.460> now<00:00:59.460> I'm<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> go<00:00:59.940> over<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.149> my

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
keyframe now I'm going to go over to my

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.299 
keyframe now I'm going to go over to my
library<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.989> drag<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> brand<00:01:01.649> new<00:01:01.800> instance<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
library and drag a brand new instance of

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.369 
library and drag a brand new instance of
the<00:01:02.430> bird<00:01:02.609> symbol<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.269> just<00:01:03.809> place<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the bird symbol and just place it on the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.870 
the bird symbol and just place it on the
bottom<00:01:04.680> over<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.250> where<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> want<00:01:05.730> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
bottom over here where I want the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.410 
bottom over here where I want the
animation<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.480> start<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.850> order<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.940> copy<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
animation to start in order to copy the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.030 
animation to start in order to copy the
motion<00:01:09.840> tween<00:01:10.049> behavior<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> first

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
motion tween behavior from the first

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.800 
motion tween behavior from the first
animation<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.150> select<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> entire
