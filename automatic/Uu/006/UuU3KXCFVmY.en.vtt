00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.810
 professional construction businessmen on pay tv and 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.320
 teachers and infrastructure capable of meeting academic needs 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.409
 and already works December can be seen 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.019
 the sound technical actions form of entrance of federal quotas of balls 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.439
 basically me 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.300
 I have always worked within the course area if 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.939
 and I saw this quick opportunity 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 graduation from 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.099
 have higher positions within companies 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.530
 the demand is very large and even being favored by government investments 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.280
 federal and as pac then there are works all over brazil 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.560
 today there is a lack of specific workforce because most people are so 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 all contracted in fact or not 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.390
 in the construction sector has a small business 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.800
 service provider 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.840
 to the same format of the course 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.829
 and here you can treat me 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.080
 the possibility of 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.880
 It's also the administrative system that I want to add and take this to 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.900
 Me and my day to day life. 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.329
 vendramin arrested in the implementation of tourism 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.730
 the best performance 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.780
 Tag Fight 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.780
 the goal as he increasingly admits that it is difficult 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.520
 in black standing 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.650
 so setting the ifc course will make it possible there 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.280
 every day the materials evolves and the techniques evolve then it is fundamental 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.240
 what 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.240
 ah the primary 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.270
 the give farc error near technologist that the case I think there is a gap 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.890
 coexist in the day-to-day work of the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.979
 so I think it's fundamental 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.580
 and this course comes in handy even more this demand that is having in the country 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.850
 investments 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.690
 the actress spoke at the award saw herself 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.719
 then the very large gap 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.570
 so we have a niche there 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.570
 quite interesting teachers 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.830
 knowing now right? 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.520
 but the first impression very good are professionals who work in the area 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.310
 You are not aware that people 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.459
 the irna efe with structures of the valley really surprised me I did not 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.529
 knew 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.940
 knew that the rudder 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.130
 but I did not imagine it was so complete 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.469
 do not run until the propagation of engineering teaches 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.669
 a lot is missing for this law 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.419
 the research is part of the academic formation of the technologist under construction 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.889
 of buildings 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.799
 improvement and sleeping of materials are results obtained by those who go beyond 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:40.739
 practice 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.269
 the idea that 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.879
 the professional 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.489
 he has an idea that has a link with the search will add knowledge 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.619
 and varig to new pc technologies 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:53.909
 that is 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.329
 today we are working out different materials 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.329
 different constructive technologies 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.939
 a professional version 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.609
 acting in research he is already going 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.539
 knowledge is evident 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:12.129
 in the near future to apply these materials on own 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.479
 then it would be a knowledge beyond jean 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.229
 stimulates stimulated research 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.719
 Nelson's day of this person did not sound back to more construction sites. 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.719
 for all the lines of research 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.459
 research will stimulate in a way today a great way 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.460
 movement 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.760
 of these people involving title 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.429
 the war 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.429
 the new 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:44.290
 often a professional who already works in the field 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.099
 he does not recycle himself 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.159
 so often a professional 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.109
 not here 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.829
 you recycle it you end up seeing technologies and materials that often 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:53.739
 does not dominate 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.299
 and there may appear pathology problems 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.950
 as we really like it is to play in the backgrounds of pathology of the functions 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.469
 the cougar in fact hyperextension research 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.109
 linking action is a tripod that we today considered fundamental importance 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.529
 the development 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:10.769
 professional 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.309
 of sixth professionals going and comets work 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:15.969
 instead 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.039
 pay' 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.409
 pro-residence nor the environment 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:21.590
 is the power in 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.379
 contamination of the environment 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.009
 we develop 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.259
 a technology that calls stabilization suspension technology 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.249
 protected 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.770
 Potential risk and not potential sale with sounds and saw 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.630
 these new materials they have to be searched valued for once 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.930
 proven performance 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.960
 placed on the market 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.090
 today for example we have a net search line I brought the in the examples 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:54.879
 that from a residue of the thermoelectric plant that is now used in 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:55.560
 cement 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.210
 an action is not 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.240
 part of them we can 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.979
 dr 100% because it is cement or we play concept of 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.059
 of the waste would make symantec that to this day is no longer complicated 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.059
 then president of such bets 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.460
 we managed 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.610
 jl resistances to aprosmat close to conventional cement 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.199
 carbon partition 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.199
 waste is discarded 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.219
 mainly from boats 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:31.960
 these surveys can also 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.419
 similar materials or that we have today of less environmental impact 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.509
 and di menor 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.279
 the course will be hot 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:45.629
 if you want to know the spaces and the course of technology in construction of 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:51.460
 buildings schedule a visit contact by phone between 50 half 8 8 

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:57.139
 00 on the sites www puntofrio vale mid-point full information 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.389
 about gradation 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.479
 in the next program, come back with more force to you until there
