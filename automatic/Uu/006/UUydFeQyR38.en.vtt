for you absolutely had some problems I

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.070 
for you absolutely had some problems I

he<00:05:36.169> has<00:05:36.259> more<00:05:36.529> problems<00:05:36.680> or<00:05:36.949> less<00:05:37.069> problems

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
he has more problems or less problems

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.450 
he has more problems or less problems
and<00:05:37.699> Viper<00:05:38.029> does<00:05:38.300> ah<00:05:38.509> i<00:05:39.169> personally<00:05:40.039> think<00:05:40.249> he

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
and Viper does ah i personally think he

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.820 
and Viper does ah i personally think he
has<00:05:42.159> this<00:05:43.159> really<00:05:43.430> go<00:05:44.180> either<00:05:44.210> way<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:44.870> think<00:05:45.620> it

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
has this really go either way I think it

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.869 
has this really go either way I think it
could<00:05:45.919> go<00:05:46.039> either<00:05:46.069> way<00:05:46.309> but<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.580> also<00:05:46.759> think

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
could go either way but I also think

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.700 
could go either way but I also think
that<00:05:47.089> the<00:05:47.270> dr<00:05:47.479> cake<00:05:47.809> gives<00:05:48.349> him<00:05:48.559> an<00:05:48.680> advantage

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
that the dr cake gives him an advantage

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.040 
that the dr cake gives him an advantage
that<00:05:49.189> the<00:05:49.309> burning<00:05:49.580> pig<00:05:49.729> doesn't<00:05:49.999> I<00:05:50.509> also

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
that the burning pig doesn't I also

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.600 
that the burning pig doesn't I also
think<00:05:51.259> that<00:05:51.409> there's<00:05:51.710> a<00:05:51.770> little<00:05:52.309> bit<00:05:52.459> more

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
think that there's a little bit more

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.299 
think that there's a little bit more
relaxed<00:05:52.699> execution<00:05:53.479> on<00:05:53.629> Rufus<00:05:53.930> it's<00:05:54.499> not<00:05:54.800> SN

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:55.309 
relaxed execution on Rufus it's not SN

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:56.529 
relaxed execution on Rufus it's not SN
not<00:05:55.459> saying<00:05:55.699> Mardon<00:05:56.029> doesn't<00:05:56.360> have<00:05:56.449> the

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
not saying Mardon doesn't have the

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.179 
not saying Mardon doesn't have the
ability<00:05:56.959> to<00:05:56.990> do<00:05:57.169> it<00:05:57.259> but<00:05:57.529> I<00:05:57.620> think<00:05:57.649> it's<00:05:58.069> going

00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:58.189 
ability to do it but I think it's going

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.070 
ability to do it but I think it's going
to<00:05:58.339> give<00:05:58.610> him<00:05:58.729> a<00:05:59.119> little<00:05:59.419> bit<00:05:59.539> more<00:05:59.689> forgiving

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
to give him a little bit more forgiving

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.379 
to give him a little bit more forgiving
window<00:06:00.349> to<00:06:00.409> get<00:06:00.979> to<00:06:01.159> be<00:06:01.249> some<00:06:01.430> type<00:06:01.610> successful

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
window to get to be some type successful

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.159 
window to get to be some type successful
rather<00:06:03.110> take<00:06:03.409> Viper<00:06:03.649> over<00:06:04.270> over<00:06:05.270> over<00:06:05.300> I<00:06:05.870> guess

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
rather take Viper over over over I guess

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.879 
rather take Viper over over over I guess
for<00:06:06.349> you<00:06:06.469> rather<00:06:07.159> than<00:06:07.279> grievousness<00:06:07.729> because

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
for you rather than grievousness because

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.199 
for you rather than grievousness because

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:11.209 
if it's on with those GPS that's going

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:13.299 
if it's on with those GPS that's going
