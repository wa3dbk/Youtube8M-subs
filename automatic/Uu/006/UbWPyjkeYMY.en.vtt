00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.659
 hi to all youtube friends here e 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.400
 now 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.899
 and these people see one last 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.700
 update a tweak that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.980
 practically thinks it is one of the most 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.440
 known of siria i'm talking about 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 youtube to mp3 that actually some 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.210
 a little while ago already 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.170
 released its latest update 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.449
 introducing a function as much 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.820
 you wish he definitely did and has 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.340
 made and will make very comfortable year i 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.880
 Apple device owners with 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.009
 jailbreak then we are at version 7.5 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.559
 of youtube to mp3 that just like it says 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.020
 the name allows us to extract the file 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.800
 audio from a youtube video convert it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.809
 precisely in mp3 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.040
 in this way, for example, we will be able to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.590
 download directly to ours 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.860
 songs device or whatever 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.649
 take audio from any video 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:54.210
 then how do you want to see we have the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.980
 in the news section a post where it comes from 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.870
 listed the update that finally 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.460
 was introduced with the latter 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.430
 over version we will also have the opportunity 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.840
 to import songs directly from 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.060
 youtube and p3 to our ipod what that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.890
 until a few months ago it was not possible 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.530
 obviously we have all the features that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.360
 are the features ie 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.630
 convert youtube videos to mp3 in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.890
 the integrated youtube search 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.560
 charles international would be one 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.840
 international ranking is a 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 music player embedded in the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.979
 application we can say so we have 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.799
 the various links there is also a beta testing 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.200
 or a beta phase a first beta of 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.939
 a new version of youtube to mp3 that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.860
 users can either try 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.280
 and maybe say if they encounter errors or 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.049
 bugs 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.840
 then let's analyze this 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.180
 application including news section 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.439
 as usual we have 55 sections 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.439
 let's go where each charles 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.290
 it will practically allow us to see 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.740
 all the songs anymore 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.750
 most requests plus the speakers of the moment 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.450
 in short we can also pressing the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.630
 button at the top right split into 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.460
 based on our genre example has dance 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.170
 got back the dance songs of the moment in 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.460
 that moment for example in first in 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.880
 ranking we have titans of david 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.130
 guetta is really from this ranking 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.860
 we can decide to go and download 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.970
 a song for example by pressing well 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.680
 gray skrillex gangs fail 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.220
 produces as it is pronounced 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.020
 we have the opportunity to download it in 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.360
 various versions of course based on the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.800
 videos that are on youtube we can 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.770
 choose any one once 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.370
 pressed on the song we can 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.080
 choose whether to convert it to m4a that is 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.640
 recommended now is not always that it is 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.220
 recommended but not always available 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.560
 because many times there are some kind 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.030
 of the conflicts with the copri then 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.160
 to be on the safe side let's go to 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.140
 download it in mp3 and we know that 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:02.330
 however in a short time we will have the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:03.590
 song on our non device 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.820
 wait for the upload with so it is 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.400
 very fast of course depends on 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.570
 your connection this one 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.700
 application because in the end a 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.019
 application works quietly in 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.260
 3g 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.120
 the download is finished andrea we can 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.090
 download as many songs as we want 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.930
 they obviously depend on space 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.930
 that we have on our device 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.799
 gives me access to all genres 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.570
 practically all are available 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.840
 we cannot go to select also 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.769
 there he can ask and we have rankings 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.470
 in continuous updating 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.989
 we have the search function you could 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.049
 catch a glimpse before we will use it 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.760
 for example if I'm a fan of I don't know 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.080
 we can obviously try with 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.239
 any sing based on actions 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.150
 that there are on youtube at the moment mi 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.290
 I come to mind 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.700
 j ax so let's try with article 31 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.930
 of which honestly already many songs 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.840
 on youtube to mp3 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.340
 however, it has an example card 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.579
 Article 31 if all videos come out 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.310
 correlated precisely with Article 31 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.680
 maria maria we have the opportunity to 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.720
 example as usual to download it e 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.579
 I want to show the conflicts m4 here it is 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.259
 in this case they can download the 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.739
 song or maria practically 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:23.260
 of article 31 in m4a as vi 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.300
 announce before there is a conflict of 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.400
 practiced copyright tells us this 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.860
 video contained contents of del sm is 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.750
 so we can't download it 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.370
 so the m4a function does not work 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.350
 always 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.910
 obviously we have a music folder 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.320
 this folder music this section 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.590
 minors that we have the opportunity to 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.750
 create our playlists now based 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.190
 also to the artists therefore in the case of 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.360
 Article 31 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.039
 we can go to do little the folder 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.900
 for articles 31 in series on almost 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.570
 all the songs of the articles 31 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.099
 of course we have a folder 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.270
 all songs where cameras have me 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.099
 downloaded and then based on ours 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.440
 needs we can create various playlists 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.180
 arrives in the olsson folder is true 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.910
 example here we find girls who have 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.409
 downloaded first maria maria I do 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.150
 see for example by starting one 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.169
 song makes the integrated player cede 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.169
 in all mp3 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:25.479
 now suddenly part of just like 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.770
 in the application of the 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.560
 our device has an opportunity 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.569
 to paint various functions such as the 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.319
 random repetition which the 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.520
 same repetition of the song not 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.080
 we can be all the songs 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.099
 communal because we are for it 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.340
 the youtube application to mp3 goes to 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:47.590
 perfectly to emulate that of the ipad 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.669
 very different people of course 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.919
 photo with ios 5 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.750
 on an aesthetic level by clicking on one 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.979
 song any have opportunities to 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.240
 name it add the playlist 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.530
 send it by email 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.620
 the case adds some for the playlist 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.210
 how do you want to see article 31 and which 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.780
 we will have the song just moved 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.659
 send it by email renaming it maria 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.199
 marine you can hear the comic then 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:12.909
 maria for example the song will come 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.940
 immediately named in the plus function 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:18.460
 important just come to your ipod in 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.050
 very little this will succeed this 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.580
 banner that practically tells us that the 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.090
 our song has been moved from 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.940
 youtube to mp3 ipod perfect 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.229
 now let's go check they do n't have it on 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.000
 music 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.000
 we have the song just entered 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:43.090
 can go quietly boasts a 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.450
 in quotation marks we can define it 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.700
 defect is that not being in quotes 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.240
 songs inserted directly from itunes 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.050
 in our device does not go to 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.420
 differentiate based on the title like 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.250
 you don't want to have a sidebar with 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.780
 various letters then abcde not 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.850
 we can scroll quickly we must 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.890
 use it so that you know I'm in order 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.840
 alphabetical another in this case 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.640
 let's talk about tips I can give you 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.370
 because when for example went to 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.170
 download a song at least that you seek 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.450
 you don't know the official video of 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.180
 download it from I do n't know file anyway 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.460
 video where it says that I know hq that 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.750
 it would be high quality avoiding 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.020
 download the official videos because a lot 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.850
 you can often find yourself with the 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.090
 song that starts in the first minute 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:33.160
 instead of starting right away maybe before 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.470
 this world one minute there is a part 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.660
 dialogue then you can also wanting 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.480
 have a preview a preview of the 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:43.060
 song in song you are going to 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.770
 download anything this guys 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.260
 application surely I'm sure 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.730
 many of you already knew it though 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.240
 what an update and in any case it is a lot 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.220
 important 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.380
 there is a need however to do so 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.640
 see nothing to say 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.220
 continue to follow us on ours 

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.340
 blogs and kids from that if everything to 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.340
 next
