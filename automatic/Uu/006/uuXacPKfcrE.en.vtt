all right today I'm doing a review on

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.030 
all right today I'm doing a review on
the<00:00:04.049> L<00:00:04.859> Series<00:00:05.660> Canon<00:00:06.660> lens<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.230> 70<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.859> 200

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
the L Series Canon lens the 70 to 200

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.400 
the L Series Canon lens the 70 to 200
millimeter<00:00:11.030> has<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> f-stop<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:12.960> four

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
millimeter has a f-stop of four

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.140 
millimeter has a f-stop of four
throughout<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.549> focal<00:00:14.940> range<00:00:15.800> as<00:00:16.800> USM<00:00:17.460> does

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
throughout the focal range as USM does

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.689 
throughout the focal range as USM does
not<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.890> image<00:00:19.890> stabilization<00:00:22.490> it's<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
not have is image stabilization it's a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.880 
not have is image stabilization it's a
metal<00:00:24.060> body<00:00:24.330> construction<00:00:25.699> pretty<00:00:26.699> light<00:00:26.880> for

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
metal body construction pretty light for

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.640 
metal body construction pretty light for
these<00:00:29.090> this<00:00:30.090> L<00:00:30.300> Series<00:00:30.539> lens<00:00:30.869> there's<00:00:31.470> other

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
these this L Series lens there's other

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.790 
these this L Series lens there's other
ones<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.130> 70<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> 200<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> which<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
ones the 70 the 200 that which is the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.130 
ones the 70 the 200 that which is the
2.8<00:00:34.800> I've<00:00:35.219> had<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> pleasure<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.660> using<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
2.8 I've had the pleasure of using that

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.430 
2.8 I've had the pleasure of using that
one<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.739> lot<00:00:38.399> bulkier<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:38.969> heavier

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
one it's a lot bulkier and heavier

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.330 
one it's a lot bulkier and heavier
believe<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.739> does<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.100> image

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
believe that one does have image

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280 
believe that one does have image
stabilization<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.870> about<00:00:42.989> half

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
stabilization but this one is about half

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.830 
stabilization but this one is about half
the<00:00:43.320> price<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.070> $600<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:45.539> B&amp;H<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.530> sale

the price this was $600 at B&amp;H on sale

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.260 
the price this was $600 at B&amp;H on sale
like<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> L<00:00:49.260> Series<00:00:49.500> lens<00:00:50.059> lenses<00:00:51.059> it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
like all the L Series lens lenses it

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.319 
like all the L Series lens lenses it
came<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> hood<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.820> also<00:00:53.969> came<00:00:54.270> with

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
came with the hood and it also came with

a leather bag that comes with the the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.670 
a leather bag that comes with the the
zoom<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.340> contained<00:00:59.820> inside<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.840> lens<00:01:01.079> which

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
zoom is contained inside the lens which

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.740 
zoom is contained inside the lens which
is<00:01:01.710> another<00:01:01.980> great<00:01:02.190> feature<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.539> this

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
is another great feature so like this

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.109 
is another great feature so like this
lens<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.589> notice<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.119> when

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
lens right here you notice when you when

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
lens right here you notice when you when
you<00:01:06.210> zoom<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> 300<00:01:07.670> part<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> lens

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
you zoom up to 300 part of the lens

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
you zoom up to 300 part of the lens
comes<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:11.390> it's<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.689> big<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.840> deal

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
comes out well it's not that big a deal

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.109 
comes out well it's not that big a deal
but<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.770> dust<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
but you get dust on this and then you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.660 
but you get dust on this and then you
retract<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.720> lens<00:01:15.930> back<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> dust<00:01:17.400> goes

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
retract the lens back all that dust goes

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.510 
retract the lens back all that dust goes
inside<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.240> lens<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.340> makes

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
inside your lens and that just makes

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.910 
inside your lens and that just makes
this<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.270> better<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.659> far<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:21.960> weather

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this one a lot better as far as weather

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
this one a lot better as far as weather
protection<00:01:23.340> too<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:24.960> say

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
protection too because if you would say

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.080 
protection too because if you would say
out<00:01:25.409> shooting<00:01:25.920> kids<00:01:26.159> soccer<00:01:26.490> practice<00:01:26.970> or

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
out shooting kids soccer practice or

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.990 
out shooting kids soccer practice or
whatever<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:28.710> rains<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.549> droplets

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
whatever in it it rains you get droplets

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.219 
whatever in it it rains you get droplets
on<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:31.970> pull<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> lens<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.540> those

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
on here you pull the lens back those

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.690 
on here you pull the lens back those
water<00:01:34.530> droplets<00:01:35.070> will<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> little

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
water droplets will get a little

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310 
water droplets will get a little
moisture<00:01:35.820> inside<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> lens<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.170> could

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
moisture inside the lens and that could

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.600 
moisture inside the lens and that could
lead<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> some<00:01:38.460> fungus<00:01:38.880> issues<00:01:40.189> does<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.400> have

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
lead to some fungus issues does not have

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.060 
lead to some fungus issues does not have
image<00:01:41.880> stabilization<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> saying<00:01:43.079> so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
image stabilization like a saying so

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.950 
image stabilization like a saying so
when<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.250> get<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.540> 200<00:01:46.430> millimeter<00:01:47.960> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
when you get up to 200 millimeter you

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.499 
when you get up to 200 millimeter you
want<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.530> sure<00:01:49.560> your<00:01:50.090> shutter<00:01:51.090> speed<00:01:51.390> is

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
want to make sure your shutter speed is

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.499 
want to make sure your shutter speed is
at<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.840> pretty<00:01:52.710> high<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.920> would<00:01:53.250> say<00:01:53.490> 200<00:01:54.390> or

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
at a pretty high I would say 200 or

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.469 
at a pretty high I would say 200 or
above<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:56.549> case<00:01:56.759> there's<00:01:56.969> any<00:01:57.149> shake

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
above just to in case there's any shake

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.850 
above just to in case there's any shake
and<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> camera<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.140> you're<00:01:58.290> getting<00:01:58.500> shaking

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and the camera if you're getting shaking

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.209 
and the camera if you're getting shaking
the<00:01:58.950> camera<00:01:59.130> obviously<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.560> with<00:02:01.560> no<00:02:01.710> emic

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the camera obviously the with no emic

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.270 
the camera obviously the with no emic
stabilization<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.619> image<00:02:04.619> will<00:02:04.799> probably<00:02:05.100> be

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
stabilization the image will probably be

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.909 
stabilization the image will probably be
a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.520> blurred
