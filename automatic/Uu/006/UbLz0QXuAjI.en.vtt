00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Speak, then, guys, beauty, guys, today. 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.080
 I'm making a video for you here. 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.510
 how to clean the video card since this 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.599
 channel here is all about 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.030
 Today's tutorial games will be a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.490
 problem that many users of the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.279
 computer when they go to play suffers 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.100
 this problem is that before the games 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.710
 well and are now either dropping or 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.269
 species is falling pretty then today 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 tutorial will be how to solve this 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.800
 problem that one of the factors 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.800
 At least one of the main 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 video and then let's go 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.700
 well before starting cleaning made a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 comparing the temperature of when the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 video card was dirty and after that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.379
 not cleaned with video card 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.180
 dirty playing belfield video card 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.730
 it was 65 degrees 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.969
 Ok let's see if we can clean the people. 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.730
 can decrease the temperature good 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.879
 first step that you at least know 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.989
 so the cold is usually are pins 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.210
 or screws behind and after opening the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.600
 first people are going to have to take the plate 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.869
 video to be able to clean it up. 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.180
 hence my but having 520 is a 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.220
 but I can run any 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.930
 thing at the last minute 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.270
 so it's ok time to remove the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.180
 video, we must remove the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.180
 where it is positioned 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.530
 well after that to remove the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.710
 release the safety catch 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.850
 normally it locks depending on the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.800
 model of your computer 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.440
 it can be equal to this lock or 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.820
 different 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.670
 after that to remove the video card 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.420
 push a little bit into each 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.360
 over there and dropping gradually without 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.820
 cause damage to the computer it is up 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.160
 even your hand 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.060
 depending on how it was until she 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.580
 Leave it, she left. I do not know what she says. 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.580
 here's why I comment on here she left 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.230
 so put your video card in one place 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.720
 preferably on top of a 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.420
 when not only of phelps 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.819
 as you can see the flu is very dirty 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.130
 even with four months without even speaking well 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.590
 we will start a cloth cooler with the brush 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.340
 which is preferably clean and with the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.340
 soft tip 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.250
 well after we have taken the cure every stone that 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.860
 was in it must have to have a 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.260
 suisse sink sink ferrinho 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.570
 serve that are beside the cooler they 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.970
 they absorb the heat that the plate 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.130
 genetic video so let's do the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.380
 next we will use a thinner brush 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.290
 to clean inside the elevator to 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.030
 clean every sink and also 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.450
 some tracks that should be 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.450
 dust 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.140
 good now we'll be the swab for me 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.140
 for the club and the underside of it 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.030
 as you can see this is the dust that 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.030
 I could not take with brush 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.249
 we will also take the back where 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.650
 It should have a bit of dust so the 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:53.109
 single with a brush free with care 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:00.400
 take advantage of 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:02.170
 video ready video card clean 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.260
 It's time to go to the third and 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:09.609
 last step is to replace it with the 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.980
 computer to restore a process 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.290
 same as the beginning then we will put 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.030
 the video card carefully 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.030
 identify any part of it 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.680
 after that we will work the lock 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.680
 her security 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.660
 after placing it, let's see if she's okay 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.750
 firmly in place we will accuse 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.750
 again 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.419
 then we will see the results before the 

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:47.509
 video card marked 65 degrees playing 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:51.680
 stone the field in the minimum chart he 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:54.830
 wheel and now you can clean there she is 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.139
 changing to 53 degrees 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.050
 yes an additional program with nothing 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.119
 simply opened the cleaning that did 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.039
 that 

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:05.569
 good staff this is the first tutorial 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.849
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:11.749
 I 'm sorry for anything 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.099
 that you have not tanned and expensive 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:16.490
 so this is it I'm not used to 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:18.379
 tutorial so, but I hope to have 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.589
 Help you for who needs to do it. 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.569
 at home in such a difficult process. 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:24.889
 but it requires a lot of care so that's it 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.520
 see you next time 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.520
 I speak
