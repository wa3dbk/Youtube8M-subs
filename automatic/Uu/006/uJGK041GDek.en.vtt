00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.419
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.419
 simple Christmas ornament 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.790
 The materials that you will need are 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.790
 cork balls 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.270
 popcorn 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.140
 silicone gun 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.680
 scissors 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.789
 and tie or decorative cords 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.989
 start taking the ball I will use one of 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.400
 6 centimeters in diameter so you do not 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.950
 be very big when you put the decoration 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.290
 first of all take a piece of tape or 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.430
 decorative cord to place them 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.430
 before the popcorn 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.780
 cut a piece about 10 centimeters 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.400
 and hit the ball the ends 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.850
 and then go applying glue 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.310
 and hitting the popcorn in the form of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.730
 spiral covering the entire surface of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730
 the ball 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.900
 press for a few seconds so that it 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.360
 adhere well 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.000
 if you are more comfortable, place the ball 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.770
 on top of something that holds and applies 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.770
 the glue on the popcorn 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.320
 make sure you cover it so that 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.320
 do not see cork holes 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.430
 and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.290
 squeezes in this way every certain 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.290
 time for it to take shape 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.760
 and once it's all covered it will be 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.769
 something like that if you want you can do a 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.610
 loop on the top so that it is 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.610
 more colorful 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.050
 I hope you liked this 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.850
