00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.679
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:25.480
 woopie everyone here, welcoming Corolla is the 11th generation released in 2010 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.890
 Hit 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.540
 As you can see and understand very much 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.930
 An appearance like nodding or something that seems to be true 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:42.290
 I think that looks looks especially pointed 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:47.880
 Asui charm Do you say Nante there is almost no place disgusting instead of hard to heading the Japanese people 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:51.330
 Or politely pack in the greatest common divisor of the world's car users 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.230
 I like that kind of car that broke down the fault 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:01:00.780
 Hybrid is added to this year's summer Corolla underneath 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:06.770
 This is Toyota's hybrid car since its first launch in 1997 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.900
 The appearance of hybrids in the Corolla has made it possible for Toyota to 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.570
 hybrid 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:16.530
 Would not it be nice to say that the era came to an almost complete of the times 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:23.220
 Yes this is inside the Corolla hybrid carp net 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.030
 As you can see, the right half is the engine and the left half contains the hybrid electrical system 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 It is done 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.560
 This is the first engine This is the same 1.5 HP 4 and 74 aqua 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.000
 Here is the fuel consumption using the Atkinson cycle 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:42.909
 It is designed for the purpose, and the motor to make up for it is this 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.390
 We stop to 61 horsepower two combined customers horsepower because the system output but this also is 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:51.909
 Because it is 1500 Corolla's when the 109 horsepower of the gasoline 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.580
 You can think of it as roughly the same level as the fuel efficiency of jc 08 mode on the catalog 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.670
 Ritter 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.850
 The fuel consumption has been improved by more than 50% just by hybridizing 33 kilometers at a stretch 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.509
 Right 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:09.569
 This is the Corolla hybrid of the Interior 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.319
 Say that indeed after all Toyota utility vehicle this is Now in I think also that it is obvious take a look 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.390
 Should 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:19.870
 Where immediately you can see at a glance what is in the inside of this beta 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:25.659
 I finely display or energy such as instantaneous fuel consumption average fuel consumption 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:31.420
 Is to or expressed in Figure is one of the features of the as that hybrids but examples 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:37.480
 The rest is fine but behind this console ev ev for traveling 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:39.860
 Mode There is a button of the ECO section live mode Then it is different only about it 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.670
 There is no gas car until yesterday 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.319
 There is no sense of incongruity even if people switch suddenly 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.770
 I do not understand well with eyes if it seems to be Corolla hybrid though 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.020
 Also 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.860
 Sheet of skin material a little touch of 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.960
 Comfortable cloth has become to this hybrid-only 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:04.500
 What is introduced today is the advanced version of the hybrid g 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:10.040
 Only there is this glass this 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:16.549
 It has become easy to glass to prevent the intrusion of sound-insulating glass Well its sound 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 As I saw in the rear seat, there is a lot of space in front of my knees. 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.299
 From 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:25.129
 It appears to be much higher than is this front sitting point 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:30.060
 I say this theater type but thanks to this front party dress and quite big 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:35.430
 Since But modal meeting in front of the eyes try to sit less feels 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.250
 It's a so-called, so-called wide-ranging view that you can enjoy even with achievements 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.590
 There is no feeling of claudication 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:47.480
 It is a protection room. The loading room volume is vda without taking this rear seat . 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.780
 With this measurement system and lifting this pleasantly 407 liters 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:57.900
 Flat and underboxed across the width of the car 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.240
 Further below this also comes with a puncture repair kit installed without spares 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.640
 I do 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.420
 But there is a space here where you can buy and store spare tires as separate items . 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.280
 I will 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.120
 Also, I would like to make the most of the loading room if I say station wagon 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.610
 Right 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.610
 Please take a look here and plunge your hand from here and pull it 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.329
 It's ok now that it falls like this 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.939
 Rear seat is to 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.939
 We fall in right and left split with release of 6 to 4 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.400
 Well then let's run a little 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:40.300
 Omnidirectional optimal 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:40.300
 I just say that it is good I think that it is a finished product that hit an appropriate point
