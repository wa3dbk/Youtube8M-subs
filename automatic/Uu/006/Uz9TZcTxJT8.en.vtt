table<00:00:09.870> level<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:11.010> want<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.340> able<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.580> get

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
table level you want to be able to get

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.669 
table level you want to be able to get
an<00:00:11.820> offensive<00:00:12.240> shot<00:00:12.660> going<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.200> keep<00:00:13.410> yourself

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
an offensive shot going to keep yourself

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.320 
an offensive shot going to keep yourself
on<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.759> offensive<00:00:16.190> motion<00:00:17.190> where<00:00:17.490> you're

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
on the offensive motion where you're

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.359 
on the offensive motion where you're
going<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.660> possibly<00:00:18.840> get<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> point<00:00:19.830> off<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.100> it

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
going to possibly get a point off of it

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.250 
going to possibly get a point off of it
instead<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:20.789> blocking<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.900> ball<00:00:22.050> back

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
instead of just blocking the ball back

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.570 
instead of just blocking the ball back
into<00:00:22.529> play<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.830> try<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.010> stay<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> point

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
into play and try to stay on the point

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.769 
into play and try to stay on the point
so<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:25.140> we're<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.920> focus<00:00:26.189> on

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
so what we're going to do is focus on

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.769 
so what we're going to do is focus on
trying<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.019> come<00:00:28.289> really<00:00:29.160> from<00:00:29.609> almost<00:00:30.179> your

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
trying to come really from almost your

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.130 
trying to come really from almost your
knee<00:00:31.050> level<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> paddle<00:00:32.489> up<00:00:32.910> above<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
knee level with the paddle up above and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.580 
knee level with the paddle up above and
rolling<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.829> forward<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:36.020> hitting<00:00:37.020> swinging

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
rolling it forward and hitting swinging

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.619 
rolling it forward and hitting swinging
in<00:00:37.739> towards<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.579> net<00:00:38.790> at<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> same<00:00:39.180> time<00:00:39.390> so

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
in towards the net at the same time so

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.100 
in towards the net at the same time so
you're<00:00:39.780> combining<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:41.219> low<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> high<00:00:42.110> we

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
you're combining the low to high we

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.990 
you're combining the low to high we
remember<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> jar<00:00:43.829> thing<00:00:44.129> again<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.700> jar

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
remember the jar thing again the jar

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.889 
remember the jar thing again the jar
wrist<00:00:45.809> action<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:47.000> punching<00:00:48.000> towards<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
wrist action and punching towards the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.869 
wrist action and punching towards the
net<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> be<00:00:50.370> critical<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
net but it's going to be critical to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.330 
net but it's going to be critical to
really<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.510> some<00:00:51.780> extra<00:00:52.590> topspin<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
really get some extra topspin on the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.610 
really get some extra topspin on the
ball<00:00:53.449> because<00:00:54.449> you're<00:00:54.750> actually<00:00:55.079> hitting

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
ball because you're actually hitting

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.790 
ball because you're actually hitting
making<00:00:56.039> contact<00:00:56.489> below<00:00:57.300> table<00:00:58.079> level<00:00:58.410> almost

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
making contact below table level almost

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.040 
making contact below table level almost
so<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.760> lot<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> people<00:01:00.420> think<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.780> can't

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so a lot of people think that you can't

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
so a lot of people think that you can't
hit<00:01:01.230> an<00:01:01.350> offensive<00:01:01.829> shot<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.489> angle

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
hit an offensive shot from that angle

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
hit an offensive shot from that angle
but<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.809> enough<00:01:04.129> topspin<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
but if you get enough topspin on the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.570 
but if you get enough topspin on the
ball<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.760> enough<00:01:06.330> pace<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:08.010> makes<00:01:08.430> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
ball and enough pace to it it makes it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:21.999 
ball and enough pace to it it makes it
very<00:01:08.610> hard<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> return<00:01:09.390> after<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.049> shot

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.770 

and<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> want<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.399> be<00:01:23.460> able<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.820> move<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.570> able

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and you want to be able to move be able

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.999 
and you want to be able to move be able
to<00:01:24.869> move<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.200> feet<00:01:25.500> enough<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.840> keep<00:01:28.009> your

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to move your feet enough to keep your

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
to move your feet enough to keep your
body<00:01:29.189> fluid<00:01:30.090> enough<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.840> can

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
body fluid enough so that you can

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.039 
body fluid enough so that you can
readjust<00:01:31.320> readjust<00:01:32.009> readjust<00:01:32.429> even<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
readjust readjust readjust even to the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.830 
readjust readjust readjust even to the
point<00:01:34.229> where<00:01:34.649> you<00:01:35.399> can<00:01:35.610> actually<00:01:35.850> come<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.630> off

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
point where you can actually come up off

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.069 
point where you can actually come up off
of<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.500> floor<00:01:38.240> with<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.539> bit<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.719> a<00:01:39.840> hop

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
of the floor with a little bit of a hop

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.959 
of the floor with a little bit of a hop
so<00:01:40.649> that<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> kind<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.250> gives<00:01:41.399> you<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.640> burst

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
so that it kind of gives you that burst

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.059 
so that it kind of gives you that burst
coming<00:01:42.869> towards<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> net<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.560> getting<00:01:43.920> some

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
coming towards the net and getting some

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.340 
coming towards the net and getting some
top<00:01:44.340> spin<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.869> practice<00:01:46.319> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
top spin on it but if you practice that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.340 
top spin on it but if you practice that
shot<00:01:46.709> enough<00:01:47.009> you'll<00:01:47.340> actually<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> be

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
shot enough you'll actually get to be

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.069 
shot enough you'll actually get to be
get<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> point<00:01:49.709> where<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.719> be<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.869> very

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
get to the point where it can be a very

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.620 
get to the point where it can be a very
consistent<00:01:52.709> return<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.939> will<00:01:54.149> put<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.509> in

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
consistent return that will put you in

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.969 
consistent return that will put you in
an<00:01:54.720> offensive<00:01:55.159> mode<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:57.000> possibly<00:01:57.720> get<00:01:58.409> a

an offensive mode to possibly get a
