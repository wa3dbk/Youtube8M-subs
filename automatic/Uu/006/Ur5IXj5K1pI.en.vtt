00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610

off<00:02:17.790> which<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.300> what<00:02:18.480> happens<00:02:18.810> when<00:02:18.930> they're

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
off which is what happens when they're

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.839 
off which is what happens when they're
not<00:02:19.200> baked<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.770> anything<00:02:20.099> really<00:02:20.580> it's

the Middle where all the hot sauce was
pulling<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:36.090> would<00:04:36.210> be<00:04:36.300> much<00:04:36.450> hotter<00:04:36.660> but<00:04:36.990> that

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
pulling it would be much hotter but that

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.930 
pulling it would be much hotter but that
wasn't<00:04:37.530> really<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:38.550> nice

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940

barbecue<00:05:33.050> barbecue<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:35.400> tasted<00:05:35.790> more<00:05:35.970> and

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
barbecue barbecue it tasted more and

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.250 
barbecue barbecue it tasted more and
more<00:05:36.270> like<00:05:36.390> a<00:05:36.420> sandwich

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
more like a sandwich

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.380

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
without the bun I was feeling daring I'd

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.240 
without the bun I was feeling daring I'd
probably<00:05:39.570> go<00:05:39.780> for<00:05:39.810> more<00:05:40.080> jalapeno<00:05:40.650> pineapple
