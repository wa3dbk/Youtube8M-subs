a real 3d background you know make it as
beautiful<00:01:30.190> as<00:01:30.520> we<00:01:30.670> could<00:01:30.850> in<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.509> beginning

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
beautiful as we could in the beginning

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.540 
beautiful as we could in the beginning
the<00:01:32.020> game<00:01:32.200> wasn't<00:01:32.440> beautiful<00:01:32.860> at<00:01:33.190> all<00:01:33.340> of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
the game wasn't beautiful at all of

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.400 
the game wasn't beautiful at all of
course<00:01:33.789> but<00:01:34.149> then<00:01:34.330> later<00:01:34.570> on<00:01:34.869> when<00:01:35.020> we<00:01:35.110> started

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
course but then later on when we started

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.859 
course but then later on when we started
merging<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.399> new<00:01:36.580> building<00:01:37.149> blocks<00:01:37.539> and

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
merging the new building blocks and

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.990 
merging the new building blocks and
props<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.070> graphics<00:01:39.430> team<00:01:39.610> have<00:01:39.789> built

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
props that the graphics team have built

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.060 
props that the graphics team have built
then<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.050> started<00:01:41.289> looking<00:01:41.590> really<00:01:41.890> good

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
then it started looking really good

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.630 
then it started looking really good
since<00:01:43.140> VCR<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.320> built<00:01:44.619> on<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.920> same<00:01:45.070> engine<00:01:45.520> as

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
since VCR is built on the same engine as

since VCR is built on the same engine as
next<00:01:46.030> gen<00:01:46.180> bc<00:01:46.600> we<00:01:47.350> can<00:01:47.530> also<00:01:47.680> reuse<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.310> editor

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
next gen bc we can also reuse the editor

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.590 
made by martin van this lowers the time
before<00:01:52.929> we<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.380> start<00:01:53.410> producing<00:01:53.920> levels

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
before we can start producing levels

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.630 
before we can start producing levels
it's<00:01:55.600> very<00:01:55.840> easy<00:01:56.049> to<00:01:56.380> use<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:57.009> editor<00:01:57.400> because

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
it's very easy to use the editor because

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.510 
it's very easy to use the editor because
all<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.240> have<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.509> do<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:58.869> choose<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.520> building

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
all you have to do is choose a building

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.510 
all you have to do is choose a building
block<00:02:00.670> or<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.119> tile<00:02:01.689> and<00:02:02.020> then<00:02:02.740> just<00:02:03.040> paint<00:02:03.280> with

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
block or a tile and then just paint with

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.370 
block or a tile and then just paint with
it<00:02:03.670> this<00:02:03.939> way<00:02:04.150> we<00:02:04.360> create<00:02:04.689> a<00:02:04.720> level<00:02:05.020> very

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
it this way we create a level very

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.100 
it this way we create a level very
easily<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:06.430> most<00:02:06.460> powerful<00:02:07.000> tool<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:08.079> that

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
easily the most powerful tool is that

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.039 
easily the most powerful tool is that
it's<00:02:08.530> built<00:02:09.100> in<00:02:09.340> game<00:02:09.610> which<00:02:10.209> means<00:02:10.570> that<00:02:10.750> we

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
it's built in game which means that we

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's built in game which means that we
with<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.470> push<00:02:11.769> of<00:02:11.799> the<00:02:11.980> button<00:02:12.070> can<00:02:12.610> test<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
with a push of the button can test the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.470 
with a push of the button can test the
level<00:02:14.320> we're<00:02:14.470> producing

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.790 

my<00:02:21.480> roles<00:02:21.720> changed<00:02:22.200> throughout<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.620> project

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
my roles changed throughout the project

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.310 
my roles changed throughout the project
and<00:02:23.220> later<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.850> moved<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.360> doing<00:02:24.600> more<00:02:25.290> of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
and later on I moved on to doing more of

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.430 
and later on I moved on to doing more of
a<00:02:25.410> sort<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:26.450> well<00:02:27.450> actually<00:02:27.900> taking<00:02:28.380> the

design<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.290> characters<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.920> simple<00:02:50.490> as

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
design of the characters as simple as

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.850 
design of the characters as simple as
possible<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:51.720> I'm<00:02:51.900> also<00:02:52.380> trying<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.740> add

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
possible but I'm also trying to add

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.950 
possible but I'm also trying to add
elements<00:02:53.280> which<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:54.450> can<00:02:54.600> clearly<00:02:54.840> see

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
elements which you can clearly see

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.650 
elements which you can clearly see
separates<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:56.640> different<00:02:56.940> body<00:02:57.120> parts<00:02:57.450> like

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
separates the different body parts like

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.120 
separates the different body parts like
the<00:02:57.780> lower<00:02:57.930> leg<00:02:58.200> from<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.530> upper<00:02:58.740> leg<00:02:58.890> and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
the lower leg from the upper leg and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.970 
the lower leg from the upper leg and
such<00:02:59.510> most<00:03:00.510> most<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> time<00:03:01.410> we<00:03:01.650> get<00:03:01.830> an

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
such most most of the time we get an

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.310 
such most most of the time we get an
opportunity<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.940> talk<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.510> little<00:03:03.900> bit<00:03:04.110> about

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
opportunity to talk a little bit about

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.410 
opportunity to talk a little bit about
each<00:03:04.560> character<00:03:05.160> what<00:03:05.880> they're<00:03:06.060> supposed<00:03:06.330> to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
each character what they're supposed to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.530 
each character what they're supposed to
do<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.870> game<00:03:07.110> if<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.890> don't<00:03:08.100> like

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.080 
characters gonna work in the game the
biggest<00:03:18.750> challenge<00:03:19.230> for<00:03:19.500> me<00:03:19.650> was<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:20.090> make

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
biggest challenge for me was to make

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.150 
biggest challenge for me was to make
things<00:03:21.360> work<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:22.050> know<00:03:22.170> cuz<00:03:22.530> they're<00:03:22.920> so

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
things work you know cuz they're so

things work you know cuz they're so
small<00:03:23.490> screen<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.300> think<00:03:24.840> when<00:03:24.990> I<00:03:25.020> felt<00:03:25.320> that

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
small screen I think when I felt that

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.770 
small screen I think when I felt that
too<00:03:25.709> yeah<00:03:26.040> they're<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.520> small<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.090> Yoko<00:03:27.600> has

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780

with<00:03:38.310> our<00:03:39.060> Lee<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.020> product<00:03:40.500> way<00:03:40.620> I

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
with our Lee in the product way I

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.520 
with our Lee in the product way I
realize<00:03:41.100> this<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.580> not<00:03:41.820> going<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.600> work<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.350> we

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
realize this is not going to work so we

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.640 
realize this is not going to work so we
have<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.920> think<00:03:44.640> bigger<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.390> less<00:03:46.050> detail

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
have to think bigger and less detail

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.070 
have to think bigger and less detail
more<00:03:47.010> color<00:03:47.430> eyes<00:03:47.730> yeah<00:03:48.000> more<00:03:48.300> caller<00:03:48.570> more

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
more color eyes yeah more caller more

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.340 
more color eyes yeah more caller more
more<00:03:49.860> bigger<00:03:50.130> shapes<00:03:50.550> yeah<00:03:51.060> definitely<00:03:51.660> which

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
more bigger shapes yeah definitely which

which you know as an artist do you see
all<00:03:54.840> these<00:03:54.959> details<00:03:55.170> on<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.680> concepts<00:03:56.160> and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
all these details on the concepts and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.160 
all these details on the concepts and
you<00:03:56.400> want<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.730> add<00:03:56.850> them<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.360> badly<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:57.959> you

know it's you don't see it and it's an
art<00:04:01.470> in<00:04:01.739> itself<00:04:02.190> bits<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.360> pieces<00:04:03.390> on<00:04:04.020> every

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
art in itself bits and pieces on every

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.050 
art in itself bits and pieces on every
character<00:04:04.800> glows<00:04:05.040> just<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.760> make<00:04:05.790> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
character glows just to make the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.900 
character glows just to make the
movement<00:04:06.270> more<00:04:06.720> fluid<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.739> yeah<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.459> also<00:04:08.610> in

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
movement more fluid in yeah and also in

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.490 
movement more fluid in yeah and also in
the<00:04:09.060> different<00:04:09.390> environments<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.170> because

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
the different environments to because

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.020 
the different environments to because
we're<00:04:10.739> dealing<00:04:11.130> with<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.580> different

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
we're dealing with the different

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.790 
we're dealing with the different
lighting<00:04:12.209> environments<00:04:12.959> as<00:04:13.080> well<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.590> these

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
lighting environments as well and these

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.449 
lighting environments as well and these
load<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:15.000> crazy<00:04:15.420> environment<00:04:16.130> Yoakam<00:04:17.130> and

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
load it's crazy environment Yoakam and

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.229 
load it's crazy environment Yoakam and
Stellan<00:04:18.060> makes<00:04:19.049> color<00:04:19.350> go<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:20.010> limit

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
Stellan makes color go to limit

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.870 
Stellan makes color go to limit
with<00:04:21.569> the<00:04:21.690> lighting<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.289> so<00:04:22.560> yeah<00:04:23.160> we<00:04:23.580> have<00:04:23.729> to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
with the lighting and so yeah we have to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.300 
with the lighting and so yeah we have to
keep<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.330> simple<00:04:24.840> even<00:04:25.349> more<00:04:25.530> simple<00:04:25.979> i<00:04:26.069> think

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
keep it simple even more simple i think

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.780 
keep it simple even more simple i think
on<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.699> textures<00:04:27.949> hey

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.040 

the<00:04:34.790> neutral<00:04:35.210> zones<00:04:35.420> in<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.660> original<00:04:35.840> game

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
the neutral zones in the original game

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.810 
the neutral zones in the original game
weren't<00:04:36.350> that<00:04:36.500> interesting<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.340> started

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
weren't that interesting so I started

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.400 
weren't that interesting so I started
thinking<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.180> maybe<00:04:38.300> we<00:04:38.630> can<00:04:38.780> add<00:04:38.960> some<00:04:39.230> kind

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
thinking that maybe we can add some kind

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.230 
thinking that maybe we can add some kind
of<00:04:39.440> an<00:04:39.560> obstacle<00:04:39.980> course<00:04:40.340> in<00:04:40.520> every<00:04:40.850> you<00:04:41.120> know

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
of an obstacle course in every you know

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.390 
of an obstacle course in every you know
each<00:04:41.570> one<00:04:41.780> of<00:04:41.810> these<00:04:41.960> zones<00:04:42.290> so<00:04:42.980> that<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:43.250> can

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
each one of these zones so that you can
