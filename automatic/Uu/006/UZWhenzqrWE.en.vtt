00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
chip or peel on the edges so my first

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.560 
chip or peel on the edges so my first

advice again is no oil on your manicure

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.080 
advice again is no oil on your manicure

then nail salon is going to help you
that's<00:01:39.689> something<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> do

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that's something that you have to do

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.859 
that's something that you have to do
every<00:01:40.799> single<00:01:40.950> day<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.579> nighttime<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.659> that's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
every single day at nighttime and that's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.810 
every single day at nighttime and that's
a<00:01:42.990> different<00:01:43.259> video<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.220> we're<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
a different video so we're going to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.389 
a different video so we're going to
assume<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.149> nobody<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.750> any<00:01:45.810> lotion<00:01:46.399> or

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
assume that nobody got any lotion or

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.039 
assume that nobody got any lotion or
anything<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:48.000> their<00:01:48.210> hands<00:01:48.659> while<00:01:48.869> they're

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
anything on their hands while they're

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.630 
anything on their hands while they're
getting<00:01:49.229> their<00:01:49.409> nails<00:01:49.530> done<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
getting their nails done and so the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.120 
getting their nails done and so the
first<00:01:50.880> step<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> take<00:01:52.200> alcohol<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
first step is that I take alcohol and I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.969 
first step is that I take alcohol and I
swipe<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.939> whole<00:01:54.750> nail<00:01:54.990> bed<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.470> alcohol

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
swipe the whole nail bed with alcohol

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.880 
swipe the whole nail bed with alcohol
and<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.729> second<00:01:57.060> thing<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.299> do<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.469> use<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and the second thing I do is I use a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.609 
and the second thing I do is I use a
product<00:01:59.250> called<00:01:59.460> chips<00:01:59.969> Kip<00:02:00.299> by<00:02:00.509> OPI<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.350> think

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
product called chips Kip by OPI I think

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.999 
product called chips Kip by OPI I think
it's<00:02:01.710> retails<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.610> five<00:02:02.820> dollars<00:02:03.030> and

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
it's retails for like five dollars and

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.740 
it's retails for like five dollars and
you<00:02:05.009> take<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.060> smells<00:02:06.329> like

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
you take this and kind of smells like

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.139 
you take this and kind of smells like
exit<00:02:06.930> own<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.380> don't<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.100> acetone<00:02:08.670> is

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
exit own I don't think that acetone is

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.660 
exit own I don't think that acetone is
the<00:02:09.539> product<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.979> take<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.580> put

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the product but you take it and you put

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.710 
the product but you take it and you put
it<00:02:12.000> all<00:02:12.240> over<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.230> nail<00:02:13.410> bed<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:15.330> dries

it all over the nail bed and it dries
instantly<00:02:16.220> which<00:02:17.220> makes<00:02:17.490> me<00:02:17.610> think<00:02:17.640> there's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
instantly which makes me think there's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.990 
instantly which makes me think there's
acetone<00:02:18.750> or<00:02:18.780> alcohol<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.890> go<00:02:20.760> all
