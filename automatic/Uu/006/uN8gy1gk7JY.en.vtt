00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
okay in this scenario what we've done is

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.810 
okay in this scenario what we've done is
actually<00:03:45.170> loaded<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.590> container<00:03:45.980> using<00:03:46.730> the

actually loaded a container using the
slip<00:03:47.060> sheet<00:03:47.240> process<00:03:47.870> this<00:03:48.470> enables<00:03:48.950> us<00:03:49.070> to

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
slip sheet process this enables us to

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.660 
slip sheet process this enables us to

get maximum utilization maximum volume

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.210 
get maximum utilization maximum volume

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
maximum container loading rates but at

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.730 
maximum container loading rates but at
the<00:03:55.310> same<00:03:55.520> time<00:03:55.940> we<00:03:56.510> can<00:03:56.690> actually<00:03:56.840> devein<00:03:57.530> at

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
the same time we can actually devein at

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.140 
the same time we can actually devein at
the<00:03:57.830> same<00:03:58.040> pace<00:03:58.310> as<00:03:58.520> we<00:03:58.640> would<00:03:58.820> do<00:03:58.970> with<00:03:59.000> a

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
the same pace as we would do with a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.730 
the same pace as we would do with a
forklift<00:03:59.600> so<00:04:00.110> we're<00:04:00.260> getting<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.560> same

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
forklift so we're getting the same

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.710 
forklift so we're getting the same

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
unloading the containers where you would

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.100 
unloading the containers where you would
do<00:04:04.220> with<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.700> pallet<00:04:05.210> but<00:04:05.690> we<00:04:05.810> are<00:04:05.960> achieving
