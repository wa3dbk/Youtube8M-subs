wishing you die rise dev Diaries - and

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.820 
wishing you die rise dev Diaries - and
since<00:00:06.270> first<00:00:06.509> episode<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:07.020> made<00:00:07.259> quite<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.710> lot

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
since first episode I made quite a lot

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.959 
since first episode I made quite a lot
of<00:00:07.890> progress<00:00:08.389> so<00:00:09.830> I'm<00:00:10.830> back<00:00:11.010> at<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> spawn

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
of progress so I'm back at the spawn

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.410 
of progress so I'm back at the spawn
room<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:13.410> think<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.429> fix<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.759> elevator<00:00:15.089> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
room and I think I fix this elevator to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.390 
room and I think I fix this elevator to
make<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.780> automatic<00:00:16.070> so<00:00:17.070> when<00:00:17.160> all<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
make it automatic so when all the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.900 
make it automatic so when all the
players<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:18.029> signing<00:00:19.020> under<00:00:19.230> yellow<00:00:19.380> arrow

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
players are signing under yellow arrow

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.140 
players are signing under yellow arrow
this<00:00:20.910> will<00:00:21.090> happen<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.189> then<00:00:23.189> they<00:00:23.970> get

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
this will happen and then they get

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.839 
this will happen and then they get
dropped<00:00:24.359> down<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.320> real<00:00:25.470> game

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
dropped down here like in the real game

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.169 
dropped down here like in the real game
so<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.449> put<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.960> test<00:00:28.920> full<00:00:29.160> loop<00:00:29.369> which

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
so I just put up a test full loop which

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.170 
so I just put up a test full loop which
I<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.689> show<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.109> now<00:00:33.500> around<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:35.180> someone

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
I can show you now around here someone

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.650 
I can show you now around here someone
cuts<00:00:36.500> making<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.590> lot<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> noise<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:38.160> there<00:00:38.660> so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
cuts making a lot of noise down there so

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.860 
cuts making a lot of noise down there so
it's<00:00:39.899> got<00:00:40.020> loop<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.270> test<00:00:42.270> for<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.719> all

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it's got loop here and test for if all

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.470 
it's got loop here and test for if all
the<00:00:42.960> players<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.190> lift<00:00:44.640> area<00:00:44.910> if

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the players are in that lift area if

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.290 
the players are in that lift area if
they<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.140> original<00:00:46.739> latch<00:00:46.890> will<00:00:47.370> switch

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
they are this original latch will switch

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.810 
they are this original latch will switch
the<00:00:48.989> loop<00:00:49.170> will<00:00:49.350> stop<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.520> lift<00:00:50.700> will

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the loop will stop and the lift will

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.479 
the loop will stop and the lift will
open<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.070> haven't<00:00:53.190> got<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
open and so if I haven't got the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.060 
open and so if I haven't got the
fireworks<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.239> work<00:00:54.440> but<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.680> let<00:00:55.949> them

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
fireworks to work but I have let them

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.779 
fireworks to work but I have let them
get<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.340> fixed<00:00:56.730> next<00:00:57.800> episode<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:01.789> just

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
get that fixed next episode so I just

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.429 
get that fixed next episode so I just
think<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.059> early<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.359> last<00:01:03.510> time<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.290> open

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
think as early as last time you can open

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.660 
think as early as last time you can open
the<00:01:04.589> doors<00:01:05.240> have<00:01:06.240> enough<00:01:06.420> points<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the doors have enough points and the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670 
the doors have enough points and the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
per elevators working and good curve

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.700 
per elevators working and good curve
I've<00:01:12.470> speed<00:01:13.470> color<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.670> loyal<00:01:15.150> essence

everything<00:05:16.189> else<00:05:16.669> is<00:05:16.909> fine<00:05:17.089> oh<00:05:17.389> here<00:05:18.110> we<00:05:18.169> are

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
everything else is fine oh here we are

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:24.389 
everything else is fine oh here we are
I<00:05:18.499> haven't<00:05:19.339> done<00:05:19.429> this<00:05:19.610> either<00:05:19.879> this<00:05:20.360> door<00:05:22.659> but

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:24.399 
I haven't done this either this door but

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:26.699 
I haven't done this either this door but
it's<00:05:25.399> going<00:05:25.519> to<00:05:25.579> tell<00:05:25.729> a<00:05:25.759> power<00:05:25.999> off<00:05:26.149> first

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:26.709 
it's going to tell a power off first

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:29.619 
it's going to tell a power off first
the<00:05:27.709> power<00:05:27.949> Tommy<00:05:28.339> off<00:05:28.550> turned<00:05:29.029> off<00:05:29.239> out<00:05:29.479> to

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
the power Tommy off turned off out to

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.429 
the power Tommy off turned off out to
start<00:05:29.809> the<00:05:29.929> game<00:05:30.999> but<00:05:31.999> after<00:05:32.959> that<00:05:33.050> manually

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:33.439 
start the game but after that manually

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:38.409 
start the game but after that manually
for<00:05:33.589> now<00:05:35.259> so<00:05:36.259> I<00:05:36.709> made<00:05:37.339> it<00:05:37.369> so<00:05:37.699> the<00:05:37.789> power<00:05:37.999> is

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
for now so I made it so the power is

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.689 
for now so I made it so the power is
resettable<00:05:39.019> as<00:05:39.889> in<00:05:40.189> if<00:05:40.279> you<00:05:40.339> start<00:05:40.519> a<00:05:40.550> new<00:05:40.579> game

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
resettable as in if you start a new game

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.429 
resettable as in if you start a new game
you'll<00:05:41.360> be<00:05:41.449> able<00:05:41.599> to<00:05:41.719> play<00:05:41.839> whether<00:05:42.019> it's<00:05:42.229> down

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:42.439 
you'll be able to play whether it's down

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:48.339 
you'll be able to play whether it's down
up<00:05:42.759> so<00:05:43.759> press<00:05:44.509> it<00:05:44.629> once<00:05:45.429> noise<00:05:46.429> and<00:05:47.229> power<00:05:48.229> is

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
up so press it once noise and power is

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.139 
up so press it once noise and power is
now<00:05:48.469> online<00:05:48.819> if<00:05:49.819> you<00:05:49.969> try<00:05:50.149> to<00:05:50.209> press<00:05:50.449> it<00:05:50.629> again

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:52.149 
now online if you try to press it again

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:56.859 
now online if you try to press it again
it<00:05:53.149> will<00:05:53.240> say<00:05:53.449> the<00:05:53.599> levers<00:05:53.869> stuck<00:05:54.279> and<00:05:55.869> this

00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:56.869 
it will say the levers stuck and this

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:01.029 
it will say the levers stuck and this
works<00:05:57.169> by<00:05:57.909> if<00:05:58.909> you<00:05:59.149> hit<00:05:59.629> it<00:05:59.779> once<00:05:59.990> then<00:06:00.529> one<00:06:00.889> of

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
works by if you hit it once then one of

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.959 
works by if you hit it once then one of
these<00:06:01.159> two<00:06:02.829> circuits<00:06:03.829> will<00:06:04.039> be<00:06:04.159> activated<00:06:04.459> so

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969 
these two circuits will be activated so

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.969 
these two circuits will be activated so
this<00:06:05.089> is<00:06:05.209> a<00:06:05.269> pulse<00:06:05.479> shortener<00:06:06.139> I<00:06:06.349> don't

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
this is a pulse shortener I don't

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.829 
this is a pulse shortener I don't
activate<00:06:07.219> its<00:06:07.339> RS<00:06:07.579> nor<00:06:07.699> latch<00:06:07.759> and<00:06:08.209> this<00:06:08.389> turns

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:08.839 
activate its RS nor latch and this turns

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.109 
activate its RS nor latch and this turns
on<00:06:08.899> the<00:06:08.959> power<00:06:09.399> turning<00:06:10.399> on<00:06:10.459> the<00:06:10.519> power<00:06:10.729> also

00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:11.119 
on the power turning on the power also

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:13.209 
on the power turning on the power also
activates<00:06:11.839> this<00:06:11.989> piston<00:06:12.439> so<00:06:12.709> if<00:06:12.829> you<00:06:12.949> try<00:06:13.189> to

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
activates this piston so if you try to

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.009 
activates this piston so if you try to
toggle<00:06:13.519> the<00:06:13.639> power<00:06:14.050> then<00:06:15.369> it<00:06:16.369> will<00:06:16.519> say<00:06:17.019> leave

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:18.019 
toggle the power then it will say leave

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:21.339 
toggle the power then it will say leave
a<00:06:18.050> stuck<00:06:18.379> and<00:06:19.189> once<00:06:19.369> powers<00:06:19.610> turned<00:06:19.879> on<00:06:20.349> then

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
a stuck and once powers turned on then

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.219 
a stuck and once powers turned on then
all<00:06:21.529> these<00:06:21.619> neighbor<00:06:21.829> blocks<00:06:22.009> come<00:06:22.369> on<00:06:22.550> and

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
all these neighbor blocks come on and

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.509 
all these neighbor blocks come on and
the<00:06:24.229> come<00:06:24.529> on<00:06:24.619> look<00:06:24.769> that<00:06:24.889> says<00:06:25.069> power<00:06:25.339> is

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:25.519 
the come on look that says power is

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:31.149 
the come on look that says power is
online<00:06:25.699> and<00:06:27.009> that's<00:06:28.009> if<00:06:28.189> the<00:06:28.309> power<00:06:29.769> but<00:06:30.769> the

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
online and that's if the power but the

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.249 
online and that's if the power but the
power<00:06:31.209> signal<00:06:32.209> goes<00:06:32.360> all<00:06:32.629> the<00:06:32.659> way<00:06:32.749> down<00:06:32.839> here

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259 
power signal goes all the way down here

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.319 
power signal goes all the way down here
to<00:06:33.379> pretty<00:06:34.099> much<00:06:34.189> the<00:06:34.279> bottom<00:06:34.519> of<00:06:34.579> the<00:06:34.669> map<00:06:34.849> and

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:35.329 
to pretty much the bottom of the map and

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:39.939 
to pretty much the bottom of the map and
goes<00:06:36.019> into<00:06:36.319> these<00:06:38.139> comparators<00:06:39.139> redstone

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 
goes into these comparators redstone

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.729 
goes into these comparators redstone
comparator<00:06:40.159> redstone<00:06:40.659> all<00:06:41.659> the<00:06:41.869> way<00:06:41.989> to<00:06:42.529> the

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:42.739 
comparator redstone all the way to the

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:44.949 
comparator redstone all the way to the
perk<00:06:42.949> elevators<00:06:43.459> on<00:06:43.999> the<00:06:44.059> previous<00:06:44.599> buildings

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:44.959 
perk elevators on the previous buildings

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:47.350 
perk elevators on the previous buildings
this<00:06:45.679> is<00:06:45.829> so<00:06:46.009> that<00:06:46.339> other<00:06:46.759> redstone<00:06:47.089> carries

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
this is so that other redstone carries

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.720 
this is so that other redstone carries
on<00:06:47.449> through<00:06:47.569> the<00:06:47.689> chunks<00:06:48.399> but

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
on through the chunks but

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.830 
on through the chunks but
so<00:06:51.730> it's<00:06:51.850> unspun<00:06:52.180> to<00:06:52.330> moving<00:06:52.570> that's<00:06:52.690> why<00:06:52.810> I

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
so it's unspun to moving that's why I

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.560 
so it's unspun to moving that's why I
can't<00:06:53.020> see<00:06:53.110> the<00:06:53.200> block<00:06:53.410> and<00:06:57.270> quite<00:06:58.270> high<00:06:58.420> up

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
can't see the block and quite high up

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.940 
can't see the block and quite high up
it's<00:06:59.380> a<00:06:59.440> very<00:06:59.620> big<00:06:59.770> map<00:07:00.660> so<00:07:01.660> this<00:07:02.110> signal<00:07:02.500> takes

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
it's a very big map so this signal takes

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.540 
it's a very big map so this signal takes
a<00:07:03.130> few<00:07:03.430> seconds<00:07:03.730> to<00:07:03.880> get<00:07:04.000> here<00:07:04.240> and<00:07:04.630> then<00:07:05.560> it

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
a few seconds to get here and then it

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.930 
a few seconds to get here and then it
goes<00:07:07.120> and<00:07:07.990> to<00:07:08.200> various<00:07:08.530> other<00:07:08.650> things<00:07:08.940> so

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
goes and to various other things so

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.790 
goes and to various other things so
here's<00:07:10.150> the<00:07:10.560> Dara's<00:07:11.560> elevators<00:07:12.040> and<00:07:13.650> it's<00:07:14.650> got

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
here's the Dara's elevators and it's got

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.250 
here's the Dara's elevators and it's got
timing<00:07:15.130> system<00:07:15.490> I<00:07:15.790> could<00:07:16.660> adjust<00:07:16.750> the<00:07:16.960> timing
