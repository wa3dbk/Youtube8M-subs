using frog masking tape it has a special

using frog masking tape it has a special
coating<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.110> when<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.350> gets

even a cleaner crisper line
you<00:00:45.420> start<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.899> by<00:00:46.140> putting<00:00:46.920> masking<00:00:47.489> tape<00:00:47.670> in

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
you start out by putting masking tape in

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360 
you start out by putting masking tape in
the<00:00:47.940> corner<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> by<00:00:50.010> using

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the corner and I like to do it by using

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.180 
the corner and I like to do it by using
about<00:00:51.090> 24<00:00:51.660> inch<00:00:51.840> sections<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.559> masking<00:00:53.160> tape

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
about 24 inch sections of masking tape

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.130 
about 24 inch sections of masking tape
it's<00:00:53.910> easier<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.329> work<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.750> way

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it's easier to work that way

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.860 
it's easier to work that way
it's<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.559> accurate<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.910> start<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it's more accurate and just start on the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's more accurate and just start on the
top<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:59.399> slowly<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.420> carefully<00:01:01.289> work

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
top and just slowly and carefully work

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
top and just slowly and carefully work
your<00:01:02.250> way<00:01:02.370> down<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> corner<00:01:03.170> take<00:01:04.170> your

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
your way down in the corner take your

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
your way down in the corner take your
time<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:05.129> time<00:01:05.460> well<00:01:05.700> spent

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
time it's time well spent

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.690 
time it's time well spent
you'll<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.810> crisper<00:01:07.320> results<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.490> won't

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you'll get crisper results and you won't

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.410 
you'll get crisper results and you won't
have<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.119> back<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.110> again<00:01:11.240> once<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
have to go back and do it again once the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
have to go back and do it again once the
masking<00:01:12.900> tape<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.500> press<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.490> very

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
masking tape is on press it in very

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.940 
masking tape is on press it in very
firmly<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:15.600> fingertips<00:01:16.350> really

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
firmly with your fingertips really

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.640 
firmly with your fingertips really
firmly<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:18.000> idea<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.659> create<00:01:18.869> profiles

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
firmly the idea is to create profiles

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.800 
firmly the idea is to create profiles
along<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> texture<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.909> won't<00:01:21.090> sleep<00:01:21.540> in

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
along the texture so it won't sleep in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.289 
along the texture so it won't sleep in
and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.590> once<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.040> done<00:01:23.250> take<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> putty

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and then once that's done take a putty

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.950 
and then once that's done take a putty
knife<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.840> press<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.890> even<00:01:26.729> further<00:01:27.060> keep

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
knife and press it in even further keep

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.140 
knife and press it in even further keep
adding<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.680> 24<00:01:29.220> inch<00:01:29.369> sections<00:01:29.820> until

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
adding it in 24 inch sections until

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.539 
adding it in 24 inch sections until
you've<00:01:30.270> done<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> entire<00:01:30.840> corner<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:32.189> first

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you've done the entire corner the first

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.399 
you've done the entire corner the first
coat<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.820> paint<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.299> give<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> corner<00:01:34.259> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
coat of paint you give in the corner is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.859

a<00:01:34.680> paint<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.549> original<00:01:35.970> color<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.689> on

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
a paint of the original color that's on

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.929 
a paint of the original color that's on
the<00:01:37.020> wall<00:01:37.200> already<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.400> don't<00:01:38.579> need<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.790> do

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the wall already you don't need to do

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.270 
the wall already you don't need to do
much<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.840> enough<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.770> dab<00:01:41.009> into

the<00:01:41.430> corners<00:01:41.909> start<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the corners start and just kind of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.569 
the corners start and just kind of
wiggle<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.159> here

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
wiggle it in here

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.300 
wiggle it in here
and<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:45.119> we're<00:01:45.299> doing<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.960> we're<00:01:46.560> sealing

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and what we're doing is we're sealing

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060 
and what we're doing is we're sealing
the<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.970> pores<00:01:48.360> where<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> new<00:01:49.500> color<00:01:49.799> can

the little pores where the new color can
slip<00:01:50.460> through<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.060> we're<00:01:51.659> sealing<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.110> up

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
slip through and we're sealing that up

with<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> original<00:01:53.130> paint<00:01:53.670> color<00:01:53.939> you're

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
with the original paint color you're

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.319 
with the original paint color you're
going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.110> go<00:01:55.290> back<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.950> cut<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.759> with<00:01:57.149> your

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
going to go back and cut in with your

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.080 
going to go back and cut in with your
new<00:01:57.479> paint<00:01:57.780> color<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.350> again<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.790> just

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
new paint color and again you do it just

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.569 
new paint color and again you do it just
like<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.390> did<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> first<00:02:00.719> time<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:02.040> cut<00:02:02.399> in

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
like you did the first time just cut in

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.620 
like you did the first time just cut in
very<00:02:02.880> carefully<00:02:03.590> start<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.829> here<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.630> just

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
very carefully start up here and just

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.570 
very carefully start up here and just
work<00:02:06.930> your<00:02:07.110> way<00:02:07.170> down<00:02:07.290> we're<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
work your way down we're going it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.270 
work your way down we're going it
carefully<00:02:09.060> into<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> corner<00:02:10.160> getting<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
carefully into the corner getting it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.230 
carefully into the corner getting it
tightly

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
tightly

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.400 
tightly
into<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.630> corner<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.290> then<00:02:13.890> keep<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.400> going

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
into the corner and then keep on going

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.290 
into the corner and then keep on going
and<00:02:16.410> now<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:17.100> paint<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.490> wall<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.180> you

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
and now you paint the wall just like you

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.540 
and now you paint the wall just like you
would<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.480> any<00:02:18.720> other<00:02:18.870> wall<00:02:19.260> with<00:02:20.010> textured

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
would with any other wall with textured

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.550 
would with any other wall with textured
surfaces<00:02:21.090> you'll<00:02:21.480> want<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.720> use<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.900> longer<00:02:22.230> nap

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
surfaces you'll want to use a longer nap

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.680 
surfaces you'll want to use a longer nap
roller<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> paint<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.300> get<00:02:24.450> into

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
roller so that the paint can get into

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.110 
roller so that the paint can get into
the<00:02:24.780> crevices<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:26.010> basically<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.790> take

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the crevices but basically you just take

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.340 
the crevices but basically you just take
it<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.720> start<00:02:28.230> rolling<00:02:28.560> cut<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.670> pretty<00:02:29.940> close

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
it and start rolling cut in pretty close

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.980 
it and start rolling cut in pretty close
in<00:02:31.350> your<00:02:31.470> W<00:02:31.860> shape<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:32.910> keep<00:02:33.210> heading<00:02:33.870> on

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
in your W shape and just keep heading on

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.920 
in your W shape and just keep heading on
down<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.380> wall<00:02:34.940> again<00:02:35.940> as<00:02:36.060> close<00:02:36.360> as<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.690> can

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
down the wall again as close as you can

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.500 
down the wall again as close as you can
to<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.200> existing<00:02:37.830> ball<00:02:38.040> with<00:02:38.250> your<00:02:38.400> roller<00:02:38.700> so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
to the existing ball with your roller so

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.960 
to the existing ball with your roller so
that<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.900> texture<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.740> wall<00:02:40.950> looks<00:02:41.790> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
that the texture on the wall looks the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.050 
that the texture on the wall looks the
same<00:02:42.240> across<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.990> wall<00:02:43.170> okay<00:02:44.160> we<00:02:44.610> put<00:02:44.820> on<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
same across the wall okay we put on the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.210 
same across the wall okay we put on the
second<00:02:45.450> coat<00:02:45.480> we've<00:02:46.140> let<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:46.650> good<00:02:46.950> and

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
second coat we've let it get good and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.030 
second coat we've let it get good and
dry<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.030> now<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.870> time<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.410> remove<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.830> tape

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
dry and now it's time to remove the tape

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.430 
dry and now it's time to remove the tape
a<00:02:50.370> good<00:02:50.970> paint<00:02:51.270> is<00:02:51.510> going<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.840> stick<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.320> the

a good paint is going to stick to the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.530 
a good paint is going to stick to the
wall<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.460> also<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.150> stick<00:02:54.420> to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
wall and so it's also going to stick to

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.050 
wall and so it's also going to stick to
your<00:02:54.600> tape<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.830> order<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.160> get<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.550> Crispus

in the corner where the tape is don't
press<00:03:05.160> too<00:03:05.310> hard<00:03:05.460> you'll<00:03:06.240> cut<00:03:06.570> right<00:03:06.840> through

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
press too hard you'll cut right through

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.450 
press too hard you'll cut right through
the<00:03:07.170> drywall<00:03:08.150> but<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.570> nice<00:03:09.780> crisp<00:03:10.620> cut<00:03:11.100> so
