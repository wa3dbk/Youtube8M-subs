00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
really just aside from very small things

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.569 
really just aside from very small things
that<00:02:57.120> are<00:02:57.329> easy<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.599> fix<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:59.280> clutch

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
that are easy to fix and the clutch

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.899 
that are easy to fix and the clutch
after<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> while<00:03:00.920> like<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.310> can't<00:03:02.519> tell<00:03:02.790> them

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
after a while like you can't tell them

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.539 
after a while like you can't tell them
it's<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.120> running<00:03:03.450> obviously<00:03:04.049> but<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:05.159> gets

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
it's not running obviously but it gets

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.610 
it's not running obviously but it gets
pretty<00:03:05.819> hard<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.269> shift<00:03:06.540> gears<00:03:06.659> like<00:03:07.379> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
pretty hard to shift gears like the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.170 
pretty hard to shift gears like the
clutch<00:03:07.890> starts<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.370> go<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.549> little<00:03:08.760> bit<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.030> think

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
clutch starts to go a little bit I think

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.050 
clutch starts to go a little bit I think
after<00:03:10.049> like<00:03:10.230> years<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.129> years<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.459> rattling

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
after like years and years of rattling

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.050 
after like years and years of rattling
and<00:03:12.209> shaking<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.690> bike<00:03:12.840> run<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:14.400> know<00:03:14.519> abuse

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
and shaking the bike run you know abuse

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.440 
and shaking the bike run you know abuse
and<00:03:15.329> stuff<00:03:15.599> but<00:03:16.700> pretty<00:03:17.700> hard<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.030> shift<00:03:18.269> into

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and stuff but pretty hard to shift into

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.589 
and stuff but pretty hard to shift into
second<00:03:18.900> gear<00:03:19.049> now<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.919> you<00:03:20.880> know<00:03:21.030> I'm<00:03:21.329> done

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
second gear now but you know I'm done

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.039 
second gear now but you know I'm done
riding<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.139> thing<00:03:22.349> now<00:03:22.500> because<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:24.049> rim

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
riding this thing now because the rim

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.460 
riding this thing now because the rim
the<00:03:25.410> rear<00:03:25.769> tire<00:03:25.980> rim<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.900> spokes<00:03:27.900> are<00:03:28.169> all

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
the rear tire rim that spokes are all

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.800 
the rear tire rim that spokes are all
snapping<00:03:29.069> on<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.370> now<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:29.819> there's<00:03:30.419> a<00:03:30.599> big

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
snapping on it now so there's a big

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.140 
snapping on it now so there's a big
groove<00:03:31.590> ducking<00:03:32.190> around<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.519> tire<00:03:32.730> almost

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
groove ducking around the tire almost

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.289 
groove ducking around the tire almost
right<00:03:33.359> through<00:03:34.250> my<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.459> bolt<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:36.030> there

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
right through my that bolt in there

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.530 
right through my that bolt in there
rubbing<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.200> because<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:39.060> wasn't<00:03:39.239> rubbing

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
rubbing on it because it wasn't rubbing

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.990 
rubbing on it because it wasn't rubbing
on<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.870> bolt<00:03:40.049> before<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:41.099> spokes<00:03:41.430> broke<00:03:41.730> but

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
on the bolt before the spokes broke but

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.949 
on the bolt before the spokes broke but
now<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.449> because<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.019> tire<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.260> wobbly<00:03:43.769> I

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
now it is because the tire is wobbly I

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.420 
now it is because the tire is wobbly I
have<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.079> say<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.379> suspension<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.069> actually

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
have to say the suspension is actually

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.360 
have to say the suspension is actually
pretty<00:03:47.849> good<00:03:48.060> on<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.389> bike<00:03:48.629> and<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:50.099> motor

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
pretty good on this bike and the motor

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.800 
pretty good on this bike and the motor
is<00:03:50.549> really<00:03:50.940> good<00:03:51.769> can<00:03:52.769> go<00:03:52.919> like<00:03:53.129> easy<00:03:53.549> like<00:03:54.299> 90

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
is really good can go like easy like 90

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.099 
is really good can go like easy like 90
clicks<00:03:55.430> floored<00:03:56.430> downhill<00:03:57.919> just<00:03:59.150> rips<00:04:00.150> I

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
think I got a bit faster bike then um

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.409 
think I got a bit faster bike then um
other<00:04:05.489> people<00:04:05.790> that's<00:04:05.879> because<00:04:06.060> my<00:04:06.180> brother

other people that's because my brother
you<00:04:06.569> storm<00:04:06.810> one<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.079> these<00:04:07.199> ones<00:04:07.410> runs<00:04:07.650> he<00:04:07.799> sold

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
you storm one of these ones runs he sold

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.270 
you storm one of these ones runs he sold
it<00:04:08.220> for<00:04:08.400> like<00:04:08.489> 4<00:04:08.910> bucks<00:04:09.470> like<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> year<00:04:10.889> ago<00:04:11.129> but

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
it for like 4 bucks like a year ago but

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.800 
it for like 4 bucks like a year ago but
yeah<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.430> one<00:04:14.579> was<00:04:14.730> faster<00:04:14.970> than<00:04:15.359> his<00:04:15.569> buy

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
yeah this one was faster than his buy

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.500 
yeah this one was faster than his buy
but<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.289> think<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.680> was<00:04:16.739> like<00:04:17.060> geared<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.209> little

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
but I think it was like geared a little

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.959 
but I think it was like geared a little
differently<00:04:19.019> or<00:04:19.199> something<00:04:19.530> but<00:04:19.769> yeah<00:04:20.639> anyway

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:20.969 
differently or something but yeah anyway

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.620 
differently or something but yeah anyway
