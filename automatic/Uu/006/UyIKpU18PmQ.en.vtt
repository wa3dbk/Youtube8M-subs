like<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.379> goal<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:40.860> was<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> have

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
like that and the goal here was to have

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.670 
like that and the goal here was to have
a<00:00:41.760> very<00:00:42.090> light<00:00:42.329> engine<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.050> still<00:00:43.379> burns

a very light engine that still burns

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.819 
a very light engine that still burns
kerosene<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.020> solve<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.559> is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
kerosene and the way they solve this is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.790 
kerosene and the way they solve this is
by<00:00:46.860> igniting<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.090> kerosene<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.800> here's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
by igniting the kerosene and here's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.100 
by igniting the kerosene and here's

compression to ignite by themselves we

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
compression to ignite by themselves we
don't<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.909> inject<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.659> fuel<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
don't do that here we inject a fuel and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.620 
don't do that here we inject a fuel and
air<00:01:25.650> under<00:01:26.130> pressure<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:27.060> ignited<00:01:27.390> with

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
a conventional plug system up there we

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.730 
a conventional plug system up there we
have<00:01:30.950> an<00:01:31.950> injector<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> fuel<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.110> for

have an injector for the fuel and for

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.219 
have an injector for the fuel and for
the<00:01:34.920> air<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.600> pressurize

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the air and what we do is we pressurize

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.190 
the air and what we do is we pressurize
the<00:01:37.590> air<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.400> compressor<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.180> 27<00:01:39.780> bars

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the air and this compressor here 27 bars

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.300 
the air and this compressor here 27 bars
and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.030 
and
then<00:01:41.430> put<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.960> common<00:01:43.409> rail<00:01:43.619> up

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
then put it up in the common rail up

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.030 
then put it up in the common rail up
there<00:01:44.430> where<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.390> fuel<00:01:45.689> gets<00:01:45.990> injected<00:01:46.350> also

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
there where the fuel gets injected also

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.249 
there where the fuel gets injected also
and<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> diesel<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.700> injected<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.329> six<00:01:48.990> bar

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and the diesel is injected at six bar

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.090 
and the diesel is injected at six bar
and<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.549> compression<00:01:51.329> ratio<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and the compression ratio in the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.289 
and the compression ratio in the
cylinder<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:54.590> 721<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.250> inject<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> mixture

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
cylinder is 721 so we inject the mixture

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.630 
cylinder is 721 so we inject the mixture
that<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.720> prepared<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.950> then

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that we prepared up there and then

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.960 
that we prepared up there and then
ignited<00:02:00.360> with<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> conventional<00:02:01.140> plug<00:02:01.970> the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
ignited with a conventional plug the

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.580 
ignited with a conventional plug the
concept<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.689> engine<00:02:04.049> makes<00:02:04.289> sense

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
concept of this engine makes sense

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.880 
concept of this engine makes sense
because<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.720> kerosene<00:02:06.720> has<00:02:06.990> much<00:02:07.679> better

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
because a kerosene has much better

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
beginning I had a small aircraft and I

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.930 
beginning I had a small aircraft and I
am<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.390> lot<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> problem<00:02:40.680> with<00:02:40.950> my<00:02:41.130> two<00:02:41.670> stroke

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
am a lot of problem with my two stroke

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.710 
am a lot of problem with my two stroke
engine<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.230> decide<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.920> put<00:02:44.849> an<00:02:45.090> electric

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
engine and I decide to put an electric

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.830 
engine and I decide to put an electric
engine<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.370> was<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.549> success<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.810> I

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
engine on it and it was a success so I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.099 
engine on it and it was a success so I

the overall design of the engine because

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.260 
the overall design of the engine because
we<00:04:51.380> don't<00:04:51.530> have<00:04:51.650> an<00:04:51.770> accessory<00:04:52.580> gearbox<00:04:53.000> this

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
we don't have an accessory gearbox this

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.719 
we don't have an accessory gearbox this
allows<00:04:53.930> us<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.169> have<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.409> lot<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.770> much<00:04:55.070> simpler

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
allows us to have a lot a much simpler

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.480 
allows us to have a lot a much simpler
maintenance<00:04:56.210> scheme<00:04:56.479> in<00:04:57.139> terms<00:04:57.979> of<00:04:58.130> thrust

the engine can develop around 250
kilograms<00:05:01.460> of<00:05:01.789> thrust<00:05:02.120> so<00:05:02.300> about<00:05:02.479> five

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
kilograms of thrust so about five

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.290 
kilograms of thrust so about five
hundred<00:05:03.259> sixty<00:05:03.710> pounds<00:05:04.039> of<00:05:04.130> thrust<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:05.000> has<00:05:05.150> an

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
hundred sixty pounds of thrust it has an

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.460 
hundred sixty pounds of thrust it has an

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
sfc of 0.7 t8 so this would be your

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.740 
sfc of 0.7 t8 so this would be your
typical<00:05:10.430> cruise<00:05:10.909> conditions<00:05:11.479> you<00:05:11.630> would

typical cruise conditions you would

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.140 
typical cruise conditions you would
reach<00:05:11.930> about<00:05:12.199> 100<00:05:12.470> litres<00:05:12.979> of<00:05:13.009> kerosene<00:05:13.159> per

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
reach about 100 litres of kerosene per

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.870 
reach about 100 litres of kerosene per
hour<00:05:14.330> so<00:05:15.020> that<00:05:15.050> would<00:05:15.289> be<00:05:15.320> at<00:05:15.530> 15,000<00:05:16.520> feet<00:05:16.550> and

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
hour so that would be at 15,000 feet and

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.879 
hour so that would be at 15,000 feet and
cruising<00:05:17.389> at<00:05:17.509> 230<00:05:18.080> knots<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:18.440> overall<00:05:18.740> weight

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
cruising at 230 knots the overall weight

cruising at 230 knots the overall weight
of<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.130> engine<00:05:19.220> would<00:05:19.490> be<00:05:19.669> 85<00:05:20.210> kilograms<00:05:20.720> so

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
of the engine would be 85 kilograms so

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.760 
of the engine would be 85 kilograms so
about<00:05:21.590> 175<00:05:22.370> pounds<00:05:23.050> also<00:05:24.050> at<00:05:24.199> the<00:05:24.320> engineer

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770
