season<00:01:28.470> ghost-like<00:01:28.860> that's<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.369> sure

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
season ghost-like that's for sure

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.420 
season ghost-like that's for sure
there's<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.420> any<00:01:30.689> maps<00:01:31.049> from<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.770> DLC<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
there's not any maps from this DLC that

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.090 
there's not any maps from this DLC that
I<00:01:32.460> don't<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.689> play<00:01:33.930> I'd<00:01:34.409> probably<00:01:34.650> say<00:01:34.920> my

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I don't like to play I'd probably say my

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.649 
I don't like to play I'd probably say my
least<00:01:35.400> favorite<00:01:35.820> would<00:01:35.939> probably<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.420> core

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
least favorite would probably be core

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.359 
least favorite would probably be core
just<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.320> map<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.829> huge<00:01:38.040> but

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
just because that map is just huge but

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.770 
just because that map is just huge but
it's<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.670> even<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.909> bad<00:01:39.119> map<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.479> all<00:01:39.600> either

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it's not even a bad map at all either

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.469 
it's not even a bad map at all either

that map
I<00:02:10.560> really<00:02:11.220> don't<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:12.060> voting<00:02:12.420> against<00:02:12.930> it

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
I really don't like voting against it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.050 
I really don't like voting against it
because<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.770> fast<00:02:14.010> paced<00:02:14.280> map<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.850> I

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
because it's just a fast paced map and I

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.699
