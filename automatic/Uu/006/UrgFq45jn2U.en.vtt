00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
you call blitz don't and by the way if

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.280 
you call blitz don't and by the way if

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
you're playing against receivers that

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.400 
you're playing against receivers that
are<00:02:06.440> let's<00:02:06.650> say<00:02:06.770> like<00:02:07.149> 79<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.720> your<00:02:09.020> corners

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
are let's say like 79 and your corners

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.970 
are let's say like 79 and your corners
or<00:02:09.560> 80s<00:02:09.890> well<00:02:10.280> then<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.610> can<00:02:10.790> use<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.570> tactic

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
or 80s well then you can use the tactic

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.199 
or 80s well then you can use the tactic
you<00:02:12.980> know<00:02:13.070> that<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.250> use<00:02:13.459> on<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.700> Raiders<00:02:13.970> which

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
you know that I use on the Raiders which

islands for longer than you know 23
seconds<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:27.240> they<00:05:27.360> can<00:05:27.539> handle<00:05:27.690> that<00:05:27.960> they're

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
seconds and they can handle that they're

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:47.050 
seconds and they can handle that they're
good<00:05:28.500> players<00:05:29.030> its<00:05:30.030> fourth<00:05:30.270> and<00:05:30.389> ten

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.690 

and<00:05:47.810> I<00:05:48.320> think<00:05:48.380> I<00:05:48.650> stop<00:05:48.889> them<00:05:49.040> here<00:05:49.250> from<00:05:49.550> here

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
and I think I stop them here from here

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.040 
and I think I stop them here from here
I'm<00:05:49.880> gonna<00:05:49.970> cut<00:05:50.180> this<00:05:50.300> video<00:05:50.510> short<00:05:50.840> because

I'm gonna cut this video short because

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.220 
I'm gonna cut this video short because
this<00:05:51.830> is<00:05:52.010> what<00:05:52.160> continues<00:05:52.490> I<00:05:52.970> don't<00:05:53.510> get<00:05:54.020> very

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
this is what continues I don't get very

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.070 
this is what continues I don't get very
risky<00:05:54.680> with<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:55.120> see<00:05:56.120> that<00:05:56.330> I<00:05:56.480> don't<00:05:56.780> get<00:05:56.900> very

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
risky with the see that I don't get very

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.440
