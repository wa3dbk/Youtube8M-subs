00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.590 
double a single jointed elbow and then a
hinge<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.860> wrist<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.340> then<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.330> have<00:02:27.450> an

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
hinge on the wrist and then we have an

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.800 
hinge on the wrist and then we have an
upper<00:02:27.930> torso<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.770> waist<00:02:29.220> articulation<00:02:29.430> -<00:02:30.060> but

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
upper torso and waist articulation - but

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.440 
upper torso and waist articulation - but
it<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.830> really<00:02:32.100> difficult<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.730> move<00:02:33.000> this

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it is really difficult to move this

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.390 
it is really difficult to move this
figure<00:02:33.810> around<00:02:34.110> because<00:02:34.410> once<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.830> do<00:02:35.010> it

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
figure around because once you do it

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.949 
figure around because once you do it
snaps<00:02:36.060> off<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.930> like<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:39.390> equally

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
snaps off just like so but it is equally

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.070 
snaps off just like so but it is equally
easy<00:02:40.439> to<00:02:40.830> plug<00:02:41.250> everything

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
easy to plug everything

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.380 
easy to plug everything
back<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.770> then<00:02:43.130> we<00:02:43.250> have<00:02:43.430> some<00:02:43.700> hip<00:02:43.970> joints

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
back in and then we have some hip joints

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.130 
back in and then we have some hip joints
here<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:45.770> so<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:47.120> have<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.360> swivel<00:02:47.720> point

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
here just like so we have a swivel point

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.530 
here just like so we have a swivel point
here<00:02:48.380> at<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.650> foot<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.520> hinge<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:50.270> small

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
here at the foot and a hinge a small

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.290 
here at the foot and a hinge a small
hinge<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.170> toe<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:52.430> that's<00:02:52.730> basically<00:02:53.150> it

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
hinge on the toe so that's basically it

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.320 
hinge on the toe so that's basically it

a<00:03:16.010> really<00:03:16.700> flat<00:03:17.150> base<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:18.260> we<00:03:18.560> can't<00:03:18.830> really

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
a really flat base so we can't really

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.430 
a really flat base so we can't really
