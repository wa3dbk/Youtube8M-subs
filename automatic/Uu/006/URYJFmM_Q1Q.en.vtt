00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
one of the heads was given to a group of

of Archaeology to research and to see if

of Archaeology to research and to see if
they<00:00:18.830> could<00:00:18.890> find<00:00:19.160> any<00:00:19.369> more<00:00:19.490> information

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
they could find any more information

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.130 
they could find any more information
about<00:00:20.000> it<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:20.390> we<00:00:20.450> could<00:00:20.570> start<00:00:20.720> using<00:00:20.900> them

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
about it so we could start using them

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.620 
about it so we could start using them
again<00:00:21.320> back<00:00:21.500> to<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:22.070> only<00:00:22.189> kind<00:00:23.119> of<00:00:23.210> clue<00:00:23.419> we

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
again back to the only kind of clue we

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.929 
again back to the only kind of clue we
had<00:00:23.840> was<00:00:24.169> a<00:00:24.200> tag<00:00:24.529> that<00:00:25.130> said<00:00:25.869> number<00:00:26.869> 34

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
had was a tag that said number 34

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.910 
had was a tag that said number 34
murderer<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.359> then<00:00:29.539> it<00:00:29.660> said<00:00:29.900> his<00:00:30.170> name<00:00:30.439> but

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
murderer and then it said his name but

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.220 
murderer and then it said his name but
the<00:00:31.130> script<00:00:32.119> was<00:00:32.300> very<00:00:32.510> difficult<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:32.960> read<00:00:33.199> so

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
the script was very difficult to read so

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.810 
the script was very difficult to read so
we<00:00:33.440> weren't<00:00:33.680> quite<00:00:33.980> sure<00:00:34.010> actually<00:00:34.610> what<00:00:34.730> his

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
we weren't quite sure actually what his

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.110 
we weren't quite sure actually what his
name<00:00:35.000> was<00:00:35.680> they<00:00:36.680> did<00:00:37.460> an<00:00:37.519> excellent<00:00:37.790> job

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
name was they did an excellent job

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.840 
name was they did an excellent job
and<00:00:39.019> were<00:00:39.710> able<00:00:39.769> to<00:00:39.920> find<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.250> publication

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
and were able to find a publication

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.070 
and were able to find a publication
written<00:00:41.000> by<00:00:41.330> Knoll<00:00:41.540> which<00:00:41.750> was<00:00:41.900> in<00:00:42.019> the

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
written by Knoll which was in the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.420 
written by Knoll which was in the
British<00:00:42.320> Library<00:00:42.379> as<00:00:42.830> far<00:00:43.040> as<00:00:43.100> we<00:00:43.190> know<00:00:43.309> it's

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
British Library as far as we know it's

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.329 
British Library as far as we know it's
the<00:00:43.519> only<00:00:43.610> in<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.850> country<00:00:47.559> I<00:00:48.559> was<00:00:49.010> smiling

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
the only in the country I was smiling

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.399 
the only in the country I was smiling
oddly<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.299> probably<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:50.900> people<00:00:51.019> around<00:00:51.260> me

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
oddly and probably the people around me

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.590 
oddly and probably the people around me
thought<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:51.710> was<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.920> little<00:00:52.070> strange<00:00:52.339> in<00:00:52.940> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
thought it was a little strange in the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.020 
thought it was a little strange in the
book<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:54.049> contains<00:00:54.199> all<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.460> information<00:00:55.580> we

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
book it contains all the information we

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.539 
book it contains all the information we
could<00:00:56.150> want<00:00:56.330> to<00:00:56.360> know<00:00:56.510> about<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:58.129> collection

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
could want to know about the collection

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.270 
could want to know about the collection
yes<00:00:59.299> this<00:00:59.479> is<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.659> huge<00:00:59.690> advantage<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:00.710> it

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
yes this is a huge advantage and it

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.350 
yes this is a huge advantage and it
means<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.580> we<00:01:01.670> can<00:01:01.790> now<00:01:01.879> actually<00:01:02.030> start

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
means that we can now actually start

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.179 
means that we can now actually start
calling<00:01:02.960> them<00:01:03.049> by<00:01:03.199> their<00:01:03.229> real<00:01:03.500> names<00:01:03.769> which

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
calling them by their real names which

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.190 
calling them by their real names which
is<00:01:04.369> something<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:04.909> but<00:01:05.330> also<00:01:05.510> we<00:01:05.810> can<00:01:05.960> start

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
is something and but also we can start

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.219 
is something and but also we can start
trying<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.650> look<00:01:06.860> into<00:01:07.040> a<00:01:07.430> bit<00:01:07.850> about<00:01:08.030> why<00:01:08.600> they

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
trying to look into a bit about why they

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.690 
trying to look into a bit about why they
were<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.530> collection<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.340> what<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:10.580> was

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
were in the collection and what it was

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.580 
were in the collection and what it was
they<00:01:10.850> did<00:01:11.030> what's<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:11.810> interesting<00:01:12.140> is<00:01:12.439> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
they did what's so interesting is the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.010 
they did what's so interesting is the
way<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:12.920> no<00:01:13.130> writes<00:01:13.580> about<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.299> sets<00:01:14.390> up

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
way that no writes about it and sets up

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.160 
way that no writes about it and sets up
these<00:01:15.320> casts<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.670> sets<00:01:17.119> up<00:01:17.359> notions<00:01:18.020> of

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
these casts and sets up notions of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.490 
these casts and sets up notions of
criminality<00:01:18.670> before<00:01:19.670> even<00:01:20.240> showing<00:01:21.020> us<00:01:21.289> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
criminality before even showing us the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.120 
criminality before even showing us the
cast<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.579> we've<00:01:22.759> been<00:01:22.909> able<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.979> look

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
cast and so we've been able to to look

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.730 
cast and so we've been able to to look
at<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.579> way<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:26.060> he<00:01:26.329> interpreted<00:01:26.750> these

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
at the way that he interpreted these

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.069 
at the way that he interpreted these
heads<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:28.969> to<00:01:29.149> look<00:01:29.270> at<00:01:29.390> some<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.780> stories

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
heads and to look at some of the stories

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.950 
heads and to look at some of the stories
about<00:01:30.499> the<00:01:30.920> individuals<00:01:31.549> behind<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.749> heads

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
about the individuals behind the heads

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.480 
about the individuals behind the heads
if<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.259> like<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.710> which<00:01:33.799> are<00:01:33.950> absolutely

if you like and which are absolutely
fascinating<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:35.390> think<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.899> most<00:01:36.049> interesting

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
fascinating I think the most interesting

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.859 
fascinating I think the most interesting
ones<00:01:37.039> are<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.579> criminals
