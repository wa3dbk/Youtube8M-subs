00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.400
 origami for you to make your own 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.730
 paper planes there are dozens of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.679
 ac models and airplanes that you can 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.579
 create and just have one sheet of yours 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.040
 imagination 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.290

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.390
 region 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.350

 that twitter 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.820

 the release of the film for the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.530
 is a shooter in the same style tried 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 It is where you have to run around behind 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.840
 people who stole his flag from the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:19.140
 University is that qat art that he 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.310
 study another game in the same style is the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.920
 dest agent 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 Let's say it 's a long time but with 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.430
 graphics here you have the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.310
 math style 007 where you have to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.950
 obviously occur and pick up the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.409
 diamonds and pass the obstacles already 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.770
 It has enough phases and it 's very interesting. 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.159
 it counts with 3d graphics are pretty cool 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.439
 and it's worth downloading this game that 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.490
 Is there a play lake that was launched 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.490
 during this week 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.979
 cpu z is a well known software 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.440
 for pc where you can identify 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.030
 All I have is your smartphone's radio now 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.220
 in android version you can 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.890
 identify the architecture of your 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.910
 can you identify the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.090
 speed her clock as well as gpu 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.640
 you have access to the system that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.320
 you will see with the android version the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.900
 amount of ram 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.030
 the available screen resolution ram and 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.980
 information about the battery with a 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.709
 percentage that she is up to 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.959
 temperature and the will it consumes 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.610
 usually an application 13 for 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.030
 to know how is yours is there 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.650
 smartphone 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.270
 the next tire is the application 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.340
 developed by a Brazilian 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.190
 It's a little game called tatters. 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.580
 mathematician the game quite simple no 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.620
 you can help kids and improve their 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.110
 this math technique for example 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.180
 here you have to get the numbers 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.760
 pairs after the simple 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.920
 after multiples of 2 multiples 350 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.140
 and as you go from one level and 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.180
 It gets harder and you have 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.220
 let's think fast there 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.980
 in mathematics the game is really cool there 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.459
 for the girls of the hi maps is a 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.640
 application is made by NDrive but 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.130
 most prominently is that it is 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.709
 free of charge or is one of the few 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.950
 gps browsers there is an android 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.720
 which was released this week which is an account 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.850
 with maps and offline 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.980
 he saw it when you first start it 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.700
 Are you going to download both the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.709
 maps are about 200 mega map for 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.640
 you access the office online you already go 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:50.150
 women's voices too. 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.030
 in Brazilian Portuguese he counts on 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.549
 all the functions of the first GPS 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.280
 how he traces the route 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.099
 you have alternate routes it shows 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.920
 also radars which is a a function 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.740
 interesting you have routes to walk 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.550
 walk beyond 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:13.360
 you have places of interest such as 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:17.200
 restaurants place to sleep setra 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.520
 you also have the list with all the 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.470
 your path is the application 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.600
 Completely there for android gps 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.590
 mainly the fact of being 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.140
 free is very good sound a very play 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.770
 addictive game very fun 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.920
 the bike game and this is the game with graphics 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.990
 simple that the first instance can 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.120
 until it seems like a game with the child but 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.610
 just play with it a little 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.280
 that you will not get normal is a 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.100
 game that will increase the difficulty there 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.180
 It's a difficult game but it's okay. 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.580
 challenging and in extremely addictive 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.950
 think the great aspect of him there he 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.040
 I was using a paid pro application 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.560
 about $ 2 is already on google play for 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.300
 close an application that understands that 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.630
 this request that is Troy himself said 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.390
 it serves for what to connect to 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.520
 proxy servers, for example in the 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.700
 company where you work the great 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.220
 advantage you can put 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.350
 automatically is login and password or be 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.210
 different from those of the 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.820
 own native android function you 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.000
 will not only be able to access the internet 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.130
 but also how to access applications 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.430
 who use the internet just put 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.250
 here a new proxy server put the 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.650
 this the user password put the option 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.140
 auto connect ready and ready 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.060
 to connect to proxy servers 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.890
 very interesting application 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.210
 so this is it folks this was 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.220
 this week with the best 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.920
 applications if you liked any
