00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.950
 to use the German railway as well 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.509
 think and that proves the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.429

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.409
 Frankfurt on the main boarded one 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.000
 ticket inspector comes to me and 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.979
 I can ask for the ticket 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.360

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.560
 at the moment he receives the receipt 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.789
 I want to transfer my ticket 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.860
 and show it to you 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.420
 then he just commented to me 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.890
 Sorry but it's too late now 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.000

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.840

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.220

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.480
 Factsheets erich the German 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.980
 train more than once 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.420

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.430

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.350
 Girl that she had to pay 40 euros 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.090

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.590
 valid student ticket and had 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.329
