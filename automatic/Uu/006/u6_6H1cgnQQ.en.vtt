00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.410
 video video on the game euro truck simulator 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.930
 2 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.689
 this time it again mod reviews and 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:29.120
 today I would like to show and tell 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:30.860
 about this mod called volvo f10 then 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.110
 there is this truck it is prescribed in 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.940
 a separate slot is tested this all on 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.670
 version 1825 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.930
 with the authors of this mod, if not mistaken 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.269
 are dmitriy 68 estas 556 for what they 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.830
 many thanks Well let 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.960
 look first at so let's say external 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.870
 characteristic of the car 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.870
 It is made in very high quality 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.930
 there is everything hanging in its place all everywhere 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.309
 how to all sorts of shelves everywhere 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.250
 I do not know there any cylinders with done 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.960
 pretty high that is 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.330
 wheels even if we look at the wheels they 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.090
 like a little dust in the dirt 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:19.070
 that is, it shows that he is a truck 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.979
 worker what he is for simple laborers 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.140
 if I may say so let's see 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.930
 what is he like here 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.640
 we are all according to the standard all one by one 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.920
 interior as for the interior we have on 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.350
 This salon is your salon that is, let's 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.630
 look around let's see everything around that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.609
 we have sleeping bags sitting like this 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.799
 scary woman on whom I don't even 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:44.140
 I want to watch as for 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.920
 dashboard she performed on 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.259
 proper level but i am sorry but 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 the only thing that strains me is 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.490
 low quality textures and even a bar yes then 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.560
 there is but 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.079
 tsiferki somehow all vague but can 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.509
 just be this in some photo texture 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.110
 and well, there was just no better texture 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.750
 well, from tuning we have two pennants 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.459
 navigator so let's say such a globe 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.220
 which we do not know what is tied 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.590
 only the steering wheel wrapped gas on this board 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.900
 we are shown the whole 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.569
 correct correct my whole current 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.060
 the information that is how much mileage 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.660
 gasoline left and so on 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.390
 actually all that can be shown 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.970
 in this salon that is, will remain in 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.370
 the rest and mostly textures in 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.370
 good principle nice to eat nice 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.530
 look at them as for repaint a 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.200
 in principle, the model will support repainting 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.190
 but still better to put the very first 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.829
 owls trance because on the back there 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.690
 supposedly dirt from the wheels that is well 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.900
 looks cool enough 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.060
 leave her as for the very top 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.340
 here is the top scoreboard but we 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.930
 illuminated by the inclusion of parking 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.579
 lights then do you just farm and 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.000
 turn on us highlighted saw 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:09.660
 transavto what else can you say with this 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.090
 mod goes immediately trailer software trans auto 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.700
 but I didnâ€™t install it anymore 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.579
 downloaded the truck activated on the menu in 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.670
 the game and decided to actually write something 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.260
 all business as for wheels the wheels 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.660
 on the model which thread and but you can 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.970
 put any other but still really 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.540
 leave these but they look real 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.730
 cool to leave them through the cabin no 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.150
 tuning except even mirrors yes even 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.830
 mirrors are not for media okay let's 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.750
 let's get that case staging garage 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.700
 and try to ride eh 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.710
 see how it works there 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.950
 lighting wipers and other other 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.460
 other that's what's gone so fast here 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.440
 download let's look around 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.680
 in the game, that is, the model drops 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.770
 pretty good shadow basically 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.569
 there are visible all sat down on the places where 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.980
 they are kind 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:08.819
 we are basically sound nice here 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.440
 from my century and in my opinion if I am not mistaken 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.390
 oriflame 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.360
 it seems they are very similar to it 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.630
 It all seems to me that this is from sounds from 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.810
 and the century cabin we swing that is when 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.940
 braking 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.700
 picking up let's say speed cab on 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.090
 downloaded principle so it should be 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.360
 as for lighting let's 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.110
 turn on neighbor as say parking 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.260
 lights dipped far so we 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.790
 alarm does not work 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.520
 the corresponding indication goes here and 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.030
 on the dashboard that is all this 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.380
 lights up as needed what is the only thing u 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.970
 us arrows are constantly burning red 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.290
 if they impact some had 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.320
 radiation that they are constantly now she 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.210
 shines oh well leave them as they are 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.280
 in principle, there is light on the radio 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.750
 backlight on something else in a woman 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.030
 glow eyes in the dark 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.250
 pretty pretty scary will be if we 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.900
 accidentally spend our heads looking at us 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.500
 glowing eyes from the dark well okay 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.660
 that's actually all about 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.660
 lighting let's us fast forward to 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.020
 day turned off the lights so as not to plant 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.000
 battery and still wipers turned on 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.300
 I was pleasantly surprised by that moment 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.790
 what's even here 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.700
 the wipers on the headlights cool 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.980
 actually not going there cool 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.100
 our developers have done what they did 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.560
 such a thing in this language is still 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.120
 a trifle which we will not see in the course 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.570
 gameplay ie basically 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.250
 will be in the cabin all the same 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.580
 glad that even such an animation 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.280
 attend the headlamps for a reason 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.460
 just hang an object like 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.530
 inactive, well, actually we are all 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.060
 what I wanted to tell you about this mod 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.340
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.440
 link to the description of this mod and 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.990
 leave in the description for this video with 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:15.120
 Alexey was you I wish you all good 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.120
