actually can lay a foundation down for

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.030 
actually can lay a foundation down for
my<00:00:58.050> paintings<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.730> quarter<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.660> time

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
my paintings in a quarter of the time

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.910 
my paintings in a quarter of the time
what<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.700> found<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:04.140> blades<00:01:04.770> in

particular<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:06.720> Bend<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
particular is that because they Bend and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.760 
particular is that because they Bend and
they<00:01:08.130> move<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:09.180> me<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:10.200> pressure<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
they move with me in the pressure that I

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
they move with me in the pressure that I
put<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.460> hard<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.300> go<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> know

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
put on as hard as I can go you know

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.440 
put on as hard as I can go you know
sometimes<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.440> pressing<00:01:13.830> hard<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.520> I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
sometimes I'm really pressing hard and I

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.390 
sometimes I'm really pressing hard and I
don't<00:01:15.570> worry<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.560> gonna<00:01:16.680> pierce<00:01:17.070> my

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.790 
don't worry that it's gonna pierce my
canvas<00:01:17.910> because<00:01:18.360> they<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.170> move<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
canvas because they really do move and

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.530 
canvas because they really do move and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
on and one of the ways I've been using

on and one of the ways I've been using
the<00:01:25.320> blades<00:01:25.620> in<00:01:25.860> particular<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:27.180> really

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the blades in particular is to really

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.080 
the blades in particular is to really
get<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.350> product<00:01:28.890> mediums<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.640> different

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
get the product mediums the different

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.120 
get the product mediums the different
gels<00:01:30.300> and<00:01:30.510> glues<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.990> use<00:01:31.260> under<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
gels and glues that I use under the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.270 
gels and glues that I use under the
surface<00:01:32.370> and<00:01:33.500> taking<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.800> just<00:01:35.100> doing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
surface and taking it and just doing

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
surface and taking it and just doing
like<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.550> sculpting<00:01:36.119> process<00:01:36.540> around<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
like a sculpting process around the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.310 
like a sculpting process around the
actual<00:01:37.850> object<00:01:38.850> itself<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.900> I'm<00:01:39.990> able<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
actual object itself so that I'm able to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.170 
actual object itself so that I'm able to
actually<00:01:40.830> make<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> look<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:41.850> part<00:01:42.060> of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
actually make it look like it's part of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.590 
actually make it look like it's part of
the<00:01:42.270> architecture<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:43.020> painting<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:44.600> was

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the architecture of the painting I was

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
the architecture of the painting I was
putting<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.020> hands<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.560> products<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
putting my hands in products that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.710 
putting my hands in products that
oftentimes<00:01:47.640> were<00:01:47.910> not<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.300> good<00:01:48.450> once

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
oftentimes were not really good once

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.109 
oftentimes were not really good once
they<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:48.960> absorbed<00:01:49.140> into<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.590> skin<00:01:50.119> there

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
they got absorbed into your skin there

are things that I don't know that I do
that<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> always<00:01:54.060> felt<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.900> only<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.290> if

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
that I always felt like I can only do if

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.290

one<00:02:05.120> of<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.300> other<00:02:05.450> things<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.440> has<00:02:06.620> changed

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
one of the other things that has changed

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.529 
one of the other things that has changed
about<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.430> way<00:02:07.520> I'm<00:02:07.670> painting<00:02:07.910> now<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.390> I'm

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
about the way I'm painting now that I'm

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.960 
about the way I'm painting now that I'm
using<00:02:08.750> these<00:02:09.080> wonderful<00:02:09.590> tools<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.280> I

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
using these wonderful tools is that I

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.270 
using these wonderful tools is that I
can<00:02:11.420> take<00:02:11.450> my<00:02:11.660> paint<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.260> literally<00:02:12.890> pour<00:02:13.190> it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
can take my paint and literally pour it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.120 
can take my paint and literally pour it
directly<00:02:13.460> onto<00:02:13.940> my<00:02:14.090> canvas<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.930> get<00:02:15.710> right<00:02:15.980> in

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
directly onto my canvas and get right in

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.330 
directly onto my canvas and get right in
there<00:02:16.370> with<00:02:16.730> any<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.150> these<00:02:17.300> tools<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.900> begin

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
there with any of these tools and begin

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.730 
there with any of these tools and begin
moving<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.460> around<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.450> really<00:02:20.750> does<00:02:20.930> you

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
moving it around and it really does you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.020 
moving it around and it really does you
know<00:02:21.860> kind<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.130> goes<00:02:22.280> into<00:02:22.459> all<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.760> nooks<00:02:22.970> and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
know kind of goes into all the nooks and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.000 
know kind of goes into all the nooks and
crannies<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.780> textures<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
crannies in the textures and the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.640 
crannies in the textures and the
layering<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.730> happens<00:02:26.209> in<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.510> creates<00:02:27.470> a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
layering that happens in that creates a

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.010 
layering that happens in that creates a
depth<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.880> think<00:02:29.090> an<00:02:29.209> interest<00:02:29.690> that

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
depth and I think an interest that

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.430 
depth and I think an interest that
really<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.940> pops<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.450> painting<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.020> creates<00:02:33.350> a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
really it pops the painting it creates a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.920 
really it pops the painting it creates a
dimensionality<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.580> otherwise<00:02:35.180> was

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
dimensionality that I otherwise was

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.820 
dimensionality that I otherwise was
having<00:02:36.170> difficulty<00:02:36.709> trying<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.580> create
