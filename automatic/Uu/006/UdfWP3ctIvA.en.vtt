disabled<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.960> put<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.170> satellite<00:02:16.560> over

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
the west coast of Mexico so the people

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.650 
the west coast of Mexico so the people

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
in off the west coast California can use

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.540 
in off the west coast California can use
it<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> people<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.290> Hawaii<00:02:22.410> but<00:02:23.280> we're<00:02:23.430> going

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
it the people in Hawaii but we're going

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.310 
it the people in Hawaii but we're going
to<00:02:23.640> be<00:02:23.760> blind<00:02:24.120> over<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.720> East<00:02:24.870> Atlantic

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
to be blind over in the East Atlantic

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.930 
to be blind over in the East Atlantic
because<00:02:25.470> then<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.130> satellite<00:02:26.490> just<00:02:26.520> won't

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
because then the satellite just won't

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.090 
because then the satellite just won't
see<00:02:27.180> over<00:02:27.480> there<00:02:27.660> now<00:02:28.320> we're<00:02:28.530> very<00:02:28.710> concerned

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
see over there now we're very concerned

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.920 
see over there now we're very concerned
about<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.400> because<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> possibility

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
about that because of the possibility

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.630 
about that because of the possibility
that<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.350> existing<00:02:31.800> satellite<00:02:32.190> might<00:02:32.430> go

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
that the existing satellite might go

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.250 
that the existing satellite might go
down<00:02:32.790> as<00:02:32.970> well<00:02:33.180> because<00:02:33.570> that's<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.900> could

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
down as well because that's that could

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.470 
down as well because that's that could
happen<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.710> know<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.760> does<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.450> just

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
happen you know and if it does we just

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480 
happen you know and if it does we just
are<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.530> have<00:02:37.710> any<00:02:37.980> equator

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
are not going to have any equator

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.370 
are not going to have any equator
orbiting<00:02:38.910> satellite<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.080> will<00:02:40.230> mean

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
orbiting satellite and that will mean

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.960 
orbiting satellite and that will mean
we'll<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.770> very<00:02:40.980> handicapped<00:02:41.610> we're<00:02:41.850> not

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
we'll be very handicapped we're not

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.280 
we'll be very handicapped we're not
going<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:42.270> able<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.840> pictures<00:02:43.140> we

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
going to be able to see the pictures we

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.570 
going to be able to see the pictures we
see<00:02:43.470> now<00:02:43.620> we're<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.310> be<00:02:44.400> able<00:02:44.490> to

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
see now we're not going to be able to

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.980 
see now we're not going to be able to
have<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.880> satellite<00:02:45.180> loose<00:02:45.480> anywhere

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
have the satellite loose anywhere

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.260 
have the satellite loose anywhere
because<00:02:46.200> we're<00:02:47.040> entirely<00:02:47.550> dependent<00:02:48.209> on

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
because we're entirely dependent on

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.690 
because we're entirely dependent on
these<00:02:48.480> satellites<00:02:48.930> for<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.260> kind<00:02:49.530> of

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
these satellites for this kind of

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.700 
these satellites for this kind of
presentation
