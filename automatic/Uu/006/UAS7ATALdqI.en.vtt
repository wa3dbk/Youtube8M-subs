 the address of the customer who bought the 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.099
 violin and that took her to an unusual place 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.760

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.980
 or seen 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.950
 I only hear a spooky music from 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.350
 violin I'm talking about this amazing 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.450
 musical 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.880
 he blessed the violin to a guy who lives 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.090
 in a cemetery if his name was 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.020
 disassemble third cannon this is the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.020
 name in that grave 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.670
 and not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.750
 if not 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.879
 Patricia who sent for the violin and 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.980
 I know that she used to be my beloved but 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.850
 we fought on his birthday he did not talk to me in 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.850
 200 years 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.629
 so that they believe and forgive 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.250
 I bought your violin waiting to bring it 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.000
 towards me 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.010
 no no 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.140
 if we want patricia to stop 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.360
 bewitch sonic boom we have to do 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.280
 that her ideas reconcile her 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.590
 we'll say we found a violin in the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.540
 cemetery when I got here we see the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.750
 reconquest 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.380
 It can not be hard for her to lie down 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.380
 see him 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.730
 in contrast I saw violin like that but I did not 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.450
 we already have it 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:50.930
 hello patricia oh you you look good no 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.480
 it seems not a day over 215 years yet 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.830
 I continue if I tell you what kind of husband 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.350
 puts dynamite on a birthday cake 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.350
 I believe they were big candles 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.280
 the kids forget who is to exploit 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.920
 who was a long time ago the point is 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.700
 that the tone your violin believes that you came 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.030
 towards him it 's true desmond I think that still 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.430
 I feel something for you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.709
 you know if instead of talking and come here 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.390
 I'm a ghost but I do not have the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.390
 integrity to hear your chattering 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.980
 excuse we want privacy 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.980
 we try to make them disappear 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.170
 I'm glad that we've gathered them together and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.400
 now that patricia has her violin no longer 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.400

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.150

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.530
 parents expect their parents are patricia and 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.060
 desmond 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.060
 in mind 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.760

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.730
 years 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.780
