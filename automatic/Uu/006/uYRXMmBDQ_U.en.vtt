00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
things for damaged and overworked hair

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.619 
things for damaged and overworked hair
and<00:00:57.629> my<00:00:58.199> hair<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.680> pretty<00:00:59.030> it<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.359> pretty

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and my hair is pretty it can get pretty

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
and my hair is pretty it can get pretty
dry<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.530> always<00:01:01.829> look<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.160> something<00:01:02.460> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
dry so I always look for something that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
dry so I always look for something that
helps<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.629> felt<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.409> did<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
helps with that and I felt like it did a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.830 
helps with that and I felt like it did a
really<00:01:04.769> great<00:01:05.280> job<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.820> making<00:01:05.970> my<00:01:06.270> hair<00:01:06.540> just

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
really great job at making my hair just

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.620 
really great job at making my hair just
smooth<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.890> frizzy<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.299> liked<00:01:09.479> it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
smooth not frizzy and I really liked it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.000 
smooth not frizzy and I really liked it
I'm<00:01:09.750> using<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> different<00:01:10.470> shampoo<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
I'm using a different shampoo and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.130 
I'm using a different shampoo and
conditioner<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
conditioner right now which I like a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.480 
conditioner right now which I like a
little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.560> better<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> probably<00:01:14.220> won't

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
little bit better so I probably won't

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.640 
little bit better so I probably won't
repurchase<00:01:15.030> them<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.720> because<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.200> found

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
repurchase them just because I found

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.899 
repurchase them just because I found
something<00:01:16.979> else<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> would<00:01:17.759> recommend

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
something else but I would recommend

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.850 
something else but I would recommend
them<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.570> you're<00:01:18.750> interested<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.439> trying<00:01:19.619> out

of<00:01:48.240> hard<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.509> replace<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.290> while<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> have

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
of hard to replace and while I have

other<00:01:50.310> alternatives<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.909> are<00:01:51.090> cheaper<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
other alternatives that are cheaper that

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.429 
other alternatives that are cheaper that

do the job
I<00:01:52.470> would<00:01:53.040> probably<00:01:53.790> repurchase<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.689> just

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899

to do so but I love this so so much and
I<00:01:59.310> recommend<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.759> next<00:01:59.969> thing<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.210> used<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.719> is

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I recommend the next thing I used up is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.560 
I recommend the next thing I used up is
by<00:02:01.049> Pangea<00:02:01.649> organics<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.090> facial

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
by Pangea organics and it is this facial

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.020 
by Pangea organics and it is this facial
scrub<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.380> got<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.890> long<00:02:05.219> time<00:02:05.490> ago<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.939> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
scrub I got this a long time ago and I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.910 
scrub I got this a long time ago and I
was<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.570> better<00:02:07.049> use<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.619> because

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
was like I better use this up because

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.410 
was like I better use this up because
I'm<00:02:08.069> sure<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.580> had<00:02:08.759> an<00:02:08.849> expiration<00:02:09.209> date

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
I'm sure it had an expiration date

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.029 
I'm sure it had an expiration date
because<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> had<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> lot<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.530> natural

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
because it had a lot of like natural

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.130 
because it had a lot of like natural
products<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.660> liked

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
products in it and I liked

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.260

it's<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.350> lot<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.920> would<00:02:14.280> smells<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.850> little<00:02:15.090> bit

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
it's a lot I would smells a little bit

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.030 
it's a lot I would smells a little bit
weird<00:02:15.600> because<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.170> has<00:02:16.319> some<00:02:16.620> kind<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.920> like

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
weird because it has some kind of like

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.940 
weird because it has some kind of like
beans<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.209> cranberry<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.500> liked<00:02:19.800> it

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
beans in it and cranberry but I liked it

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.410 
beans in it and cranberry but I liked it
because<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.160> was<00:02:20.250> natural<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.300> use

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
because it was natural and I like to use

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.960 
because it was natural and I like to use
a<00:02:21.450> little<00:02:21.660> bit<00:02:21.720> more<00:02:22.130> like<00:02:23.130> natural<00:02:23.400> products

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
a little bit more like natural products

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330 
a little bit more like natural products
on<00:02:24.120> my<00:02:24.240> face<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.959> found<00:02:25.290> another<00:02:25.620> facial

full-sized<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.530> kind<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.310> pricey<00:03:05.550> for<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> dry

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
full-sized is kind of pricey for a dry

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.900 
full-sized is kind of pricey for a dry
shampoo<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.830> really<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.340> was<00:03:08.370> gentle

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
shampoo but it was really it was gentle

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.310 
shampoo but it was really it was gentle
I<00:03:09.180> think<00:03:09.390> that's<00:03:09.540> why<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.690> liked<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.080> because<00:03:10.170> it

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
I think that's why I liked it because it

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.199 
I think that's why I liked it because it
says<00:03:10.590> extra<00:03:11.010> gentle<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.610> because<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.060> was

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
says extra gentle and because I was

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.310 
says extra gentle and because I was
going<00:03:12.450> through<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:12.959> scalp

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
going through that like scalp

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.199 
going through that like scalp
sensitivity<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.220> found<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.000> didn't

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
sensitivity I found that it didn't

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.360 
sensitivity I found that it didn't
irritate<00:03:15.570> my<00:03:15.720> scalp<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.320> scent<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.040> little

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
irritate my scalp the scent is a little

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.949 
irritate my scalp the scent is a little
bit<00:03:17.489> strange<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.120> definitely<00:03:18.540> smells<00:03:18.810> like

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
bit strange it definitely smells like

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.620 
bit strange it definitely smells like
oats<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:20.310> because<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.150> made<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.510> oat

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
oats but because it's made of the oat

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.150 
oats but because it's made of the oat
milk<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.140> really<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.739> liked<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.040> I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
milk but I really really liked it I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.979 
milk but I really really liked it I
think<00:03:23.489> thinking<00:03:24.209> about<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.690> might<00:03:24.900> go

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
think thinking about is that I might go

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.900 
think thinking about is that I might go
back<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.320> repurchase<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.860> because<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.519> didn't

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
back and repurchase it because it didn't

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.670 
back and repurchase it because it didn't
irritate<00:03:27.269> my<00:03:27.420> scalp<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.019> worked<00:03:28.410> really

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
irritate my scalp and it worked really

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.880 
irritate my scalp and it worked really
well<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.489> next<00:03:29.730> one<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:29.940> by<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.120> brand<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:31.290> it

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
well the next one is by the brand and it

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.819 
well the next one is by the brand and it
is<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.519> dry<00:03:32.790> shampoo<00:03:32.850> again<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.810> liked<00:03:34.320> this<00:03:34.590> one

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
is a dry shampoo again I liked this one

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.860 
is a dry shampoo again I liked this one
as<00:03:35.010> well<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.489> felt<00:03:35.730> like<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.970> worked<00:03:36.180> really

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
as well I felt like it worked really

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.080 
as well I felt like it worked really
well<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.470> didn't<00:03:37.769> like<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.040> as<00:03:38.160> much<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.700> this

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
well it didn't like it as much as this

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.630 
well it didn't like it as much as this
one<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.900> think<00:03:40.380> again<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.280> works<00:03:41.430> really

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
one but I think again it works really

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.890 
one but I think again it works really
well<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.850> don't<00:03:42.090> have<00:03:42.209> any<00:03:42.329> complaints<00:03:42.780> about

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
well I don't have any complaints about

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.410 
well I don't have any complaints about
it<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.260> haven't<00:03:43.590> seen<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.250> my<00:03:44.400> drugstores<00:03:44.970> so

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
it I haven't seen it in my drugstores so

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.810 
it I haven't seen it in my drugstores so
I<00:03:45.690> probably<00:03:46.200> can't<00:03:46.590> repurchase<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.250> just

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
I probably can't repurchase it just

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.340 
I probably can't repurchase it just
because<00:03:48.030> I'd<00:03:48.180> go<00:03:48.420> for<00:03:48.630> one<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:49.079> find

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
because I'd go for one that I can find

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.259 
because I'd go for one that I can find
but<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.190> no<00:03:50.310> complaints<00:03:50.760> about<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:51.000> the

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
but I have no complaints about it the

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.160 
but I have no complaints about it the
last<00:03:51.480> one<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.860> one<00:03:53.220> which<00:03:53.670> is<00:03:53.750> catwalk<00:03:54.750> by

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
last one is this one which is catwalk by

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.970 
last one is this one which is catwalk by
tiki<00:03:55.950> tgd<00:03:56.670> um<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:57.959> think<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.769> one

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
tiki tgd um but I think that this one

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.069 
tiki tgd um but I think that this one
was<00:03:59.100> good<00:03:59.310> too<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.519> can't<00:04:00.060> it's<00:04:00.390> not<00:04:00.810> like<00:04:00.989> a

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
was good too I can't it's not like a

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.870 
was good too I can't it's not like a
stand<00:04:01.350> out<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.739> my<00:04:01.769> mind<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.400> don't<00:04:02.640> think

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
stand out in my mind so I don't think

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.910 
stand out in my mind so I don't think
that<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.120> did<00:04:03.269> anything<00:04:03.510> crazy<00:04:04.019> but<00:04:04.890> I

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
that it did anything crazy but I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.440 
that it did anything crazy but I
remember<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.610> left<00:04:05.790> like<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.090> lot<00:04:06.420> of

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
remember that it left like a lot of

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.180 
remember that it left like a lot of
white<00:04:06.810> residue<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.530> my<00:04:07.650> hair<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.890> couldn't

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
white residue in my hair you couldn't

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.560 
white residue in my hair you couldn't
obviously<00:04:08.280> brush<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.940> out<00:04:09.060> but<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.420> wasn't

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
obviously brush it out but it wasn't

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.039 
obviously brush it out but it wasn't
like<00:04:09.870> subtle<00:04:10.470> try<00:04:10.799> shampoo<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:12.030> this<00:04:12.600> brand

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
like subtle try shampoo and I this brand

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:13.970 
like subtle try shampoo and I this brand
is<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> little<00:04:13.470> bit<00:04:13.560> more<00:04:13.680> on<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.890> expensive

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
is a little bit more on the expensive

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.430 
is a little bit more on the expensive
side<00:04:14.459> I'm<00:04:14.640> pretty<00:04:14.850> sure<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.660> probably<00:04:16.140> won't

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
side I'm pretty sure so I probably won't

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.750 
side I'm pretty sure so I probably won't
repurchase<00:04:16.769> this<00:04:17.070> just<00:04:17.310> because<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.640> have

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
repurchase this just because I have

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.849 
repurchase this just because I have
other<00:04:17.940> drugstore<00:04:18.840> alternatives<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.590> like

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
other drugstore alternatives that I like

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.279 
other drugstore alternatives that I like
but<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.579> don't<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.359> any<00:04:21.539> complaints<00:04:21.750> about<00:04:22.019> it

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
but I don't have any complaints about it

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.050 
but I don't have any complaints about it
so<00:04:22.500> that's<00:04:22.710> good<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.520> have<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.669> little<00:04:23.880> mini

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
so that's good so I have a little mini

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.860 
so that's good so I have a little mini
size<00:04:24.450> of<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:24.960> restoring<00:04:25.530> dry

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
size of that restoring dry

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.600 
size of that restoring dry
who<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.290> I<00:04:26.380> got<00:04:26.530> when<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.740> was<00:04:26.919> traveling<00:04:27.490> that

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
who that I got when I was traveling that

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.090 
who that I got when I was traveling that
I<00:04:27.669> used<00:04:27.940> up<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:28.570> onto<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.470> make<00:04:29.650> up<00:04:29.860> which

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
I used up and onto the make up which

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.830 
I used up and onto the make up which
apparently<00:04:30.490> is<00:04:30.820> at<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.090> bottom<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.660> bag

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
apparently is at the bottom of the bag

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.740 
apparently is at the bottom of the bag
so<00:04:32.199> the<00:04:32.320> first<00:04:32.560> thing<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.220> this<00:04:33.910> covergirl

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
so the first thing is this covergirl

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.200

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
separating and lengthening it's just

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.390

formula I found it really really dry and
I<00:05:58.180> asked<00:05:58.810> around<00:05:59.020> like<00:05:59.410> in<00:05:59.500> a<00:05:59.590> couple<00:05:59.800> of<00:05:59.860> my

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
I asked around like in a couple of my

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.310 
I asked around like in a couple of my
videos<00:06:00.310> if<00:06:00.639> it<00:06:00.910> was<00:06:01.090> just<00:06:01.360> me<00:06:01.660> or<00:06:02.020> if<00:06:02.139> that's

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
videos if it was just me or if that's

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.719 
videos if it was just me or if that's
the<00:06:02.440> formula<00:06:02.860> and<00:06:03.010> a<00:06:03.099> lot<00:06:03.220> of<00:06:03.310> people<00:06:03.520> said

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
the formula and a lot of people said

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.879 
the formula and a lot of people said
it's<00:06:03.910> a<00:06:04.000> drier<00:06:04.270> mascara<00:06:04.930> and<00:06:05.470> I<00:06:05.590> prefer

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
it's a drier mascara and I prefer

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.100 
it's a drier mascara and I prefer
mascaras<00:06:06.340> that<00:06:06.400> are<00:06:06.580> like<00:06:06.729> a<00:06:06.760> lot<00:06:07.120> more<00:06:07.360> wet<00:06:07.720> so

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 
sample size but I finally used like I

and<00:07:12.339> I<00:07:12.519> am<00:07:12.939> sad<00:07:13.239> because<00:07:13.569> I<00:07:13.719> loved<00:07:14.110> it<00:07:14.229> so<00:07:14.709> much

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:14.739 
and I am sad because I loved it so much

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:17.100 
and I am sad because I loved it so much
but<00:07:15.219> it's<00:07:15.369> a<00:07:15.429> little<00:07:15.459> bit<00:07:15.759> pricey<00:07:15.999> I<00:07:16.419> think<00:07:16.989> I

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
but it's a little bit pricey I think I

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.779 
but it's a little bit pricey I think I
am<00:07:17.289> going<00:07:17.499> to<00:07:17.649> splurge<00:07:18.009> and<00:07:18.309> get<00:07:18.459> it<00:07:18.610> because

am going to splurge and get it because

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:21.749 
am going to splurge and get it because
it<00:07:19.059> is<00:07:19.179> my<00:07:19.299> favorite<00:07:19.689> primer<00:07:19.899> but<00:07:20.469> it's<00:07:21.429> really

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 
it is my favorite primer but it's really

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.759 
it is my favorite primer but it's really
great<00:07:21.999> and<00:07:22.179> I<00:07:22.239> definitely<00:07:22.689> recommend<00:07:22.959> it<00:07:23.259> so
