00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
so yeah this definitely the coolest belt

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.280 
so yeah this definitely the coolest belt
that<00:04:16.290> I<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.560> now<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.930> makes<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.049> even<00:04:19.169> more

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
that I have now and makes it even more

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.159 
that I have now and makes it even more
cool<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.700> is<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.570> real<00:04:21.919> WWF<00:04:24.169> version

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
cool that it is the real WWF version

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.120 
cool that it is the real WWF version
they<00:04:25.530> have<00:04:25.560> WWE<00:04:26.370> version<00:04:26.760> out<00:04:26.880> there<00:04:27.090> that

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
they have WWE version out there that

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.740 
they have WWE version out there that
really<00:04:29.130> doesn't<00:04:29.580> do<00:04:29.700> much<00:04:29.730> for<00:04:29.910> me<00:04:30.210> since<00:04:30.570> they

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
really doesn't do much for me since they

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.460 
really doesn't do much for me since they
never<00:04:30.990> use<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.290> burden<00:04:32.390> but<00:04:33.390> I<00:04:33.450> guess<00:04:33.690> if<00:04:33.840> WWE

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
never use that burden but I guess if WWE

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.860 
never use that burden but I guess if WWE
wants<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:35.010> make<00:04:35.790> any<00:04:35.970> money<00:04:36.150> off<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.419> this<00:04:36.600> belt

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
wants to make any money off of this belt

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.260 
wants to make any money off of this belt
they<00:04:36.990> kind<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.260> have<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.850> use<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:39.060> version

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
they kind of have to use this version

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.180 
they kind of have to use this version
now<00:04:39.690> but<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.970> version<00:04:42.210> that<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:43.760> but<00:04:44.760> yeah

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
now but that version that is but yeah

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:53.120
