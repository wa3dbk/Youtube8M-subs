hey ready Sun back once again it's time

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.080 
hey ready Sun back once again it's time
to<00:00:02.070> test<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.610> beast

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
to test the beast

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.760 
to test the beast
well<00:00:03.929> my<00:00:04.500> Safari<00:00:04.890> Noah<00:00:05.150> you<00:00:06.150> send<00:00:06.390> me

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
well my Safari Noah you send me

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.770 
well my Safari Noah you send me
benchmark<00:00:07.770> let's<00:00:08.519> do<00:00:08.639> it

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.330 

so<00:00:13.780> yes<00:00:13.990> we<00:00:14.200> are<00:00:14.290> gonna<00:00:14.440> run<00:00:14.590> the<00:00:14.740> three<00:00:15.040> of<00:00:15.219> my

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
so yes we are gonna run the three of my

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.720 
so yes we are gonna run the three of my
most<00:00:15.790> popular<00:00:16.689> ones<00:00:16.869> until<00:00:17.860> two<00:00:18.010> quadrant<00:00:18.610> and

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
most popular ones until two quadrant and

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.580 
most popular ones until two quadrant and
Geekbench<00:00:19.240> so<00:00:19.510> first<00:00:19.779> of<00:00:19.930> all<00:00:19.960> we<00:00:20.140> will<00:00:20.259> do<00:00:20.439> one

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
Geekbench so first of all we will do one

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.100 
Geekbench so first of all we will do one
to<00:00:20.770> two<00:00:21.300> threes<00:00:22.300> mobile<00:00:22.570> use<00:00:22.689> these<00:00:22.869> threes

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
to two threes mobile use these threes

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.540 
to two threes mobile use these threes
because<00:00:23.349> they<00:00:23.500> three<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:23.860> most<00:00:24.040> universally

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
because they three the most universally

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.730 
because they three the most universally
accepted<00:00:24.939> ones<00:00:25.119> I<00:00:25.360> know<00:00:25.720> that<00:00:26.170> quadrants<00:00:26.619> no

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
accepted ones I know that quadrants no

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.160 
accepted ones I know that quadrants no
longer<00:00:27.040> the<00:00:27.160> best<00:00:27.369> are<00:00:27.820> isn't<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:28.840> know<00:00:28.930> used

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
longer the best are isn't you know used

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.800 
longer the best are isn't you know used
to<00:00:29.260> be<00:00:29.350> good<00:00:29.529> but<00:00:29.800> we<00:00:30.220> still<00:00:30.550> use<00:00:30.760> it<00:00:31.000> I<00:00:31.090> don't

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
to be good but we still use it I don't

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.990 
to be good but we still use it I don't
know<00:00:31.869> why<00:00:31.990> it's<00:00:32.140> my<00:00:32.260> go-to<00:00:32.500> benchmark<00:00:33.160> but<00:00:33.790> do

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
know why it's my go-to benchmark but do

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.310 
know why it's my go-to benchmark but do
these<00:00:34.150> ones<00:00:34.420> as<00:00:34.480> well<00:00:34.629> because<00:00:34.960> these<00:00:35.140> are

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
these ones as well because these are

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.979 
these ones as well because these are
pretty<00:00:35.470> much<00:00:35.590> more<00:00:35.860> universally<00:00:36.580> kind<00:00:36.850> of

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
pretty much more universally kind of

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.320 
pretty much more universally kind of
recognized<00:00:37.989> now<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:38.980> we'll<00:00:39.160> let<00:00:40.059> it<00:00:40.120> do<00:00:40.269> its

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
recognized now so we'll let it do its

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.740 
recognized now so we'll let it do its
thing

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
thing

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.770 
thing

fantastic there's a 1 6 0 5 7 now this
is<00:01:10.750> really<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.020> quad-core<00:01:11.439> processor<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:13.260> it's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
is really a quad-core processor and it's

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.330 
is really a quad-core processor and it's
not<00:01:14.530> much<00:01:14.710> better<00:01:15.010> than<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.850> HTC<00:01:16.000> One<00:01:16.480> X<00:01:16.690> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
not much better than the HTC One X the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.140 
not much better than the HTC One X the
Google<00:01:18.340> Nexus<00:01:18.630> 4<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.650> Samsung<00:01:21.130> Galaxy<00:01:21.520> s3<00:01:21.700> in

Google Nexus 4 the Samsung Galaxy s3 in
the<00:01:22.240> Nexus<00:01:22.570> 10<00:01:22.860> they're<00:01:23.860> all<00:01:24.010> bad<00:01:24.280> enough<00:01:24.610> I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
the Nexus 10 they're all bad enough I

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.590 
the Nexus 10 they're all bad enough I
can't<00:01:25.060> want<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:25.600> too<00:01:25.870> obvious<00:01:26.170> like<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:27.600> well

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
can't want to too obvious like so well

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.180 
can't want to too obvious like so well
that's<00:01:28.720> we're<00:01:28.870> in<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:28.990> next<00:01:29.080> one<00:01:29.350> so<00:01:29.890> here<00:01:30.040> is

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
that's we're in the next one so here is

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.220 
that's we're in the next one so here is
the<00:01:30.340> next<00:01:30.430> we're<00:01:30.670> gonna<00:01:30.760> run<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.240> yes<00:01:31.660> quadrant

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
the next we're gonna run is yes quadrant

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.420 
the next we're gonna run is yes quadrant
we're<00:01:32.410> gonna<00:01:32.500> let<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.770> do<00:01:32.890> its<00:01:32.920> thing<00:01:33.100> once

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
we're gonna let it do its thing once

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.010 
we're gonna let it do its thing once
again<00:01:33.760> I'm<00:01:34.150> gonna<00:01:34.300> come<00:01:34.540> back<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:34.930> we're

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
again I'm gonna come back and we're

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.630 
again I'm gonna come back and we're
gonna<00:01:35.140> see<00:01:35.290> how<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.410> does<00:01:35.590> perform<00:01:35.770> again

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
gonna see how it does perform again

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.070 
gonna see how it does perform again
while<00:01:37.120> this<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.390> going<00:01:37.630> for<00:01:37.750> this<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:37.900> want<00:01:38.050> to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
while this is going for this I want to

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.170 
while this is going for this I want to
make<00:01:38.200> here<00:01:38.380> we're<00:01:38.730> benchmarks<00:01:39.730> don't<00:01:40.000> mean

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
make here we're benchmarks don't mean

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.230 
make here we're benchmarks don't mean
everything<00:01:41.020> they<00:01:41.920> just<00:01:41.950> form<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.430> do<00:01:42.580> so<00:01:43.120> yeah

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
everything they just form to do so yeah

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:51.810 
everything they just form to do so yeah
keep<00:01:43.930> that<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.200> mind<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.520> that's<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
keep that in mind so that's the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.390 
keep that in mind so that's the
benchmark<00:01:52.210> done<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.720> that<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.050> we're<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.220> it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
benchmark done on that and we're so it

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.050 
benchmark done on that and we're so it
gets<00:01:54.610> performed<00:01:55.330> we<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:58.800> where<00:01:59.800> our<00:01:59.950> oh<00:02:00.250> my

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
gets performed we have where our oh my

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.390 
gets performed we have where our oh my
device<00:02:01.330> is<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.690> top<00:02:01.930> syllabus<00:02:02.650> um<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.280> we've

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
device is the top syllabus um so we've

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.750 
device is the top syllabus um so we've
got<00:02:03.550> five<00:02:03.940> two<00:02:04.240> zero<00:02:04.450> seven<00:02:05.260> so<00:02:05.800> yeah<00:02:05.979> again

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
got five two zero seven so yeah again

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.570 
got five two zero seven so yeah again
not<00:02:07.000> exactly<00:02:07.360> amazing<00:02:08.319> but<00:02:09.069> we<00:02:09.220> are<00:02:09.310> looking

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
not exactly amazing but we are looking

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.030 
not exactly amazing but we are looking
in<00:02:09.729> my<00:02:09.879> budget<00:02:10.149> device<00:02:10.599> running<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.500> processor

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
in my budget device running a processor

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.979 
in my budget device running a processor
that<00:02:12.069> nobody<00:02:12.819> really<00:02:13.030> knows<00:02:13.269> about<00:02:13.450> because

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
that nobody really knows about because

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.220 
that nobody really knows about because
it<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:15.069> while<00:02:15.819> there<00:02:16.269> I<00:02:16.450> was<00:02:16.629> on<00:02:16.750> version

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
it is a a a while there I was on version

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.470 
it is a a a while there I was on version
of<00:02:17.319> processors<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.549> yeah<00:02:18.670> flash<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
of processors so yeah flash on to the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.480 
of processors so yeah flash on to the
next<00:02:19.659> one<00:02:19.810> which<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:19.990> keen<00:02:20.200> pinch<00:02:20.410> three<00:02:20.800> right

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
next one which is keen pinch three right

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.130 
next one which is keen pinch three right
so<00:02:21.520> here<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.819> now<00:02:22.180> as<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.390> compromise<00:02:22.630> see<00:02:22.900> here

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
so here is now as a compromise see here

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
so here is now as a compromise see here
when<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.410> get<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.860> bit<00:02:24.010> closer

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
when I get a bit closer

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.220 
when I get a bit closer
see<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.520> our<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.060> while<00:02:26.300> we<00:02:26.450> arm<00:02:26.750> which<00:02:27.200> is

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
see and our the while we arm which is

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.160 
see and our the while we arm which is
1.5<00:02:27.890> gigahertz<00:02:28.250> quad-core<00:02:28.780> Italy<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.960> gig

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
1.5 gigahertz quad-core Italy to gig

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.780 
1.5 gigahertz quad-core Italy to gig
around<00:02:30.410> obviously<00:02:30.620> always<00:02:31.220> shows<00:02:31.370> lesson

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
around obviously always shows lesson

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.130 
around obviously always shows lesson
here<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.090> 1.75<00:02:33.020> Android<00:02:33.950> 4.1.2<00:02:34.820> now<00:02:35.720> take<00:02:35.960> into

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
here so 1.75 Android 4.1.2 now take into

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.630 
here so 1.75 Android 4.1.2 now take into
account<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.440> operating<00:02:36.830> system<00:02:37.100> may<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.370> a

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
account the operating system may have a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.920 
account the operating system may have a
little<00:02:37.850> imperfect<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.450> know<00:02:38.570> kind<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.810> a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
little imperfect you know kind of a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.080 
little imperfect you know kind of a
effectiveness<00:02:39.620> as<00:02:39.740> well<00:02:39.890> but<00:02:40.700> as<00:02:40.790> always

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
effectiveness as well but as always

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.730 
effectiveness as well but as always
let's<00:02:41.330> run<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:41.630> benchmark<00:02:41.960> let's<00:02:42.320> come<00:02:42.530> back

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
let's run this benchmark let's come back

00:02:42.740 --> 00:03:00.220 
let's run this benchmark let's come back
and<00:02:42.950> watch<00:02:43.040> see<00:02:43.190> how<00:02:43.220> she<00:02:43.340> performs<00:02:59.080> that's<00:03:00.080> it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
and watch see how she performs that's it

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.930 
and watch see how she performs that's it
people<00:03:00.350> there<00:03:00.650> we<00:03:00.770> go<00:03:00.920> there<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.250> final<00:03:01.490> scars

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
people there we go there the final scars

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.000 
people there we go there the final scars
on<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.150> doors<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.780> gives<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.590> bit<00:03:03.710> of<00:03:03.770> a<00:03:03.830> weird

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
on the doors it gives a bit of a weird

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.940 
on the doors it gives a bit of a weird
kind<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.340> wherever<00:03:05.090> no<00:03:05.210> look<00:03:05.360> at<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.950> hmm

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
kind of a wherever no look at that hmm

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.540 
kind of a wherever no look at that hmm
yeah<00:03:07.550> anywhere<00:03:08.440> 384<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.680> single<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.460> a

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
yeah anywhere 384 on a single and a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.420 
yeah anywhere 384 on a single and a
woman<00:03:10.850> won<00:03:10.970> 6-0<00:03:11.390> on<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.810> multi<00:03:12.260> again<00:03:12.890> they're

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
woman won 6-0 on a multi again they're

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.940 
woman won 6-0 on a multi again they're
not<00:03:13.460> exactly<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.270> most<00:03:14.900> cracking<00:03:15.440> scars<00:03:15.740> out

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
not exactly the most cracking scars out

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.160 
not exactly the most cracking scars out
there<00:03:16.160> in<00:03:16.340> fact<00:03:16.850> they<00:03:17.090> are<00:03:17.120> they<00:03:17.390> do<00:03:17.450> look<00:03:17.810> poor

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
there in fact they are they do look poor

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.960 
there in fact they are they do look poor
but<00:03:18.950> again<00:03:19.220> as<00:03:19.520> I<00:03:19.580> said<00:03:19.820> previously

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
but again as I said previously

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.240 
but again as I said previously
benchmarks<00:03:20.810> don't<00:03:21.050> mean<00:03:21.170> everything<00:03:21.590> they

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
benchmarks don't mean everything they

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.970 
benchmarks don't mean everything they
she<00:03:22.310> just<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.910> test<00:03:23.660> because<00:03:23.900> we<00:03:24.350> can<00:03:24.590> would<00:03:24.830> get

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
she just a test because we can would get

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.320 
she just a test because we can would get
to<00:03:25.130> like<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.490> know<00:03:25.610> what<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.820> benchmarking

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
to like to know what the benchmarking

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.840 
to like to know what the benchmarking
score<00:03:26.600> is<00:03:26.750> in<00:03:27.500> terms<00:03:27.830> of<00:03:28.040> performance<00:03:28.580> so<00:03:28.670> far

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
score is in terms of performance so far

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.220 
score is in terms of performance so far
for<00:03:29.270> me<00:03:29.360> playing<00:03:29.690> with<00:03:29.810> it

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
for me playing with it

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.170 
for me playing with it
I've<00:03:30.709> been<00:03:30.890> relatively<00:03:31.220> impressed<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.940> think

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.710 
it's been pretty snappy and it's not
much<00:03:34.340> it's<00:03:34.370> kind<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.790> stored<00:03:35.120> on<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.390> if

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
much it's kind of stored on and if
