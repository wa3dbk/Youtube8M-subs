00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
so this is like a security number and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.999 
so this is like a security number and
like<00:01:19.310> it's<00:01:19.460> used<00:01:19.880> on<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.929> long<00:01:21.409> sequence<00:01:21.890> that

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
like it's used on the long sequence that

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:34.640 
like it's used on the long sequence that
I'll<00:01:22.130> get<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.280> these<00:01:22.429> once

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
so if somebody catches it again or if we

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.279 
so if somebody catches it again or if we
catch<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.399> again<00:01:48.490> or<00:01:48.850> they<00:01:49.570> find<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:49.960> after<00:01:50.079> it
