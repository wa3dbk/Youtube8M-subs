00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.530
 do not 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.550
 I guarantee that at some point everything 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.550
 can go to the ready 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.210
 and you are going to say it's over 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.310
 and that's how it ended 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.930
 then you can accept it 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.950
 and you can not get to work this 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 It can surprise my 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.240
 crewmates 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.310
 and to the nasa 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.570
 and the whole world 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.570
 but I'm still alive 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.320
 surprise there is a problem to another mission 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.159
 It would take four years to get to 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.899
 here 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.899
 and I'm in a life created for a 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.670
 31 day period I have to get 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.080
 water and growing food on a planet 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.700
 where nothing grows 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.650
 but if I can not find a way to establish 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.300
 contact with nasa none of this will be 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.300
 served we have a new message 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:31.770
 and stay alive let's go find 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.770
 water will take the dive 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.640
 let's do calculations I have enough food 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.040
 for 50 days you will die of hunger before 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.630
 that we can help you more so I'm going 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.300
 to have to resort to science to 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.010
 do not crash 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.740
 up to 80 million kilometers from the 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.530
 It is land and is only saved am 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.450
 the best botanist on this planet 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.010
 I know how to save and we'll need the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.390
 crew of the gun there is a great 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.180
 probability of killing a person or 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.160
 little chance of killing six 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.920
 do not risk your lives this matters 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.920
 more than a person no no sir 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.080
 the nasa rejected gamesa so if I 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.290
 we do it would be a riot if something 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.319
 failure 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.510
 we will die you realize that it is a 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.500
 madness 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.500
 there was no other option 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.090
 no matter what happens 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.180
 tell the monkey 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.310
 and tell my family to never stop 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.310
 try to go home 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.480
