 in its texture at the wedding is here 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.780
 so I 'll select the texture to 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.670
 first I tried to trigger I return well 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.739
 but I have here the first heats here 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.440
 textures hence her name is plastic I 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.080
 I think that's right plastic is then 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 here are the general boxes here 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.390
 rails in the hygiene box that the ores 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.720
 is that the ore blocks are not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.840
 much more mouths are woods here too 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.860
 and everything else is that you have water is to wash with 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.920
 sponge and here's the furniture too, right? 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.619
 we never have here the cow is the new 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.790
 Here the sheep the little that is not 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.170
 wanting to look at me 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.170
 the cow who also is not 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.710
 the village of influenza and bpi that can not 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.479
 see nothing and that also spider has two in 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.500
 macular but only that they do not 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.720
 stopped right 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.899
 Can not show you better the first time. 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.810
 text is so I'm going to move here to 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.509
 the next one already the vote then well games to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.549
 second texture is a spac bd 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.040
 it's a texture I liked the most 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.329
 for 0.9 point no my god I'm talking 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.920
 the old version for 0 10 point zero is 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.899
 interesting is the enamel with the texture 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.969
 very interesting even those ores 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.260
 As I said, I 'll leave you in 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.570
 Blocks right there 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.040
 so here's 12 we got the pumpkins 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.760
 which got very interesting text 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.180
 also ne 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.500
 The water washes here, well let's go here. 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.670
 mode was the most important part of 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.840
 interesting ne 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.280
 here we have the vague mushroom is here or 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.230
 You're crazy, you do not want to. 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.300
 look at me in the case but he will have 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:36.410
 that look won is also the old is the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:39.030
 little the cow the chicken the villager the clip 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.760
 and she wore a bikini that're not giving to 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.130
 see nothing new and here's a spider 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.330
 Nothing has changed at least I think more 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.310
 well then this is the second one, right? 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.910
 so I'm going to move on to the next one and 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.670
 I came back again game of the third text 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.830
 It's his craft 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.780
 I found the sword very interesting too. 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.190
 that you see her there she is well 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.930
 interesting then this was one of the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.459
 things that attracted me most in texture as well 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.410
 here we have the ores 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.390
 here we have the rails well I do not put 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.800
 It's unique because I fit tacumbú no 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.670
 You can put it on and that's a good thing. 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.250
 boring but ok here we have the ores right 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.680
 here we have the droughts all things net 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.880
 what other new things to update 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:29.300
 all the general blocks is that we have 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:32.690
 sponge water and has the bed too 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:37.350
 we have the furniture that the cow mushroom is 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:40.730
 dog came the little cow chicken is 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.480
 green also arrived is to be an old 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.880
 is also the name pm and spider 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.600
 because right there the third text is not then 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.180
 Here we go for that even in 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.640
 Fourth then I'm going to games on Wednesday. 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.590
 Tested if it's called adele, I think 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.600
 that's right dell do not know I have not seen 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.420
 more right is for sure that's right 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.880
 well here is she I think she too 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.720
 very very very interesting children 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.209
 they change a lot 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.550
 You come there to change the texture too. 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.010
 who have the right minerals 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.989
 At night I do not know why but the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.850
 chancellery with this now in the creative 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.890
 huh 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.000
 is very interesting but ok here we have the 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.460
 Spider is a pygmy zombie clip is the village 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.630
 of the chicken in the part of the furniture already 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.830
 they have changed a lot, right? 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.750
 we have the people the sheep the wolf and the wave 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.360
 like - but the blocks here with you 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.760
 see how you're seeing there changed 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.310
 very right here we have to also wash 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.410
 has hardly changed but the share of 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.860
 Blocks was what made it more interesting is 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:50.210
 that has changed a lot but since then 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.310
 iaa right of the fourth texture then we 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.130
 pass to the fifth and last then 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.060
 I'll then there're games come on back 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.730
 for the last texture that is the coconut mimi 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.100
 and I think that's it, I do not think it's 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.680
 that's right her name but we take 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.930
 Here we have the right rails also as 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.600
 very interesting having the ores that 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.670
 it was 1 too much of the time nor was it 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.530
 of the things that strikes me as most attention 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:21.140
 well we have here also the blocks né 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:23.600
 and the mt is straight is crazy about wood and 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.990
 the blocks in general also there né 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.740
 here we have the pumpkin watermelon the 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:34.070
 cacti chests furnaces and here we have lava 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.200
 and water well we also have here sponge 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:41.210
 glass and the blocks I do not know which 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.760
 It's the names here, but that's okay. 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.920
 we have that mushroom cow 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.070
 let's promote to the modes now the 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.430
 wolf, that in the case of money for nobody 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.800
 will look continues without looking 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.820
 look at me now but there's looking 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:04.550
 even though the sheep are the people 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:11.510
 the cow the chicken the village of flu 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:13.520
 the man pigment the spider and only then was 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.440
 the video was like your home and comment 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.960
 I write with part of some social network 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.160
 So that's it, he said until next time. 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.540
 the Olympics raised this precise question 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.950
 download then that's it said that the 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.950
 I went there next
