00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.470

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.900
 amount onion what are you getting into 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.390

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.270
 break of red carrot that I have for 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.250
 here is perfect have mixed everything 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.800
 with the beef but let's go to 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.050
 content all this meat well with this 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.629
 with this vegetable that with ground chili 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.670
 I have here my next given the idea is 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.320
 flavor nothing or much flavor you have to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.750
 preparation this little bug that today 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.680
 a ground chili mass we are going to place 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.410
 two laurel leaves 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.090
 I have two days because I'm going to crush him 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.920
 and we will place it so that it goes well 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.670
 giving flavor to everything is for the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.800
 match 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.890
 We mix you like it and I have rosemary 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.520
 that is very good 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.440
 It's good some wisps are doing very well 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.960
 with meat seasoning well I have with 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.960
 millionaire recommended living with him 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:33.830
 a smoked fish for doing very well 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.600
 here the then rosemary and ground combined 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.630
 the condiments that or more than you to 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.119
 flavor I will not put pepper salt 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.520
 black I'm going to put it will be because 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.500
 to go marinated is a whole night with you 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.800
 to go marinated with a liquid medium with 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.800
 wine 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.829
 floods all the flavor that a wine uses 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.009
 the night that will be marinated with a look 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.009
 look 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.080
 I remember then the marinade with wine 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.720
 red is not a red wine of very little 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.910
 quality there are more or less normal wines and 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.910
 you do not need a wine 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:27.630
 on board on the other hand the vinotinto does not 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.120
 know why the idea is not to lose 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.200
 all football to posters throughout the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:39.960
 table and notified the afternoon when the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:43.200
 meat meat we mix it there 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.770
 everything if I did not put salt to him so that all his 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.780
 juice but it was well capped the air 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:54.300
 during the night so that the taste does not 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:01.800
 is marking this not that that brand does not 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:04.400
 still this because what I have here is 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400
 optional 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.630
 we will place when the whole 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.760
 Marine 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.250
 exactly here I have it here but 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.930
 what are we going to do school is marinated 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.930
 we are not going to use all the video 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.440
 any cut in cubes chubby that you 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.760
 put a couple of cloves of garlic carrot 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.800
 colorful pepper onion all 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.620
 rustically with the big size code 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.360
 size caserito as it corresponds is 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.300
 oasis milled laurel rosemary and wine 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.270
 red and we strain all the cement because 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.000
 if it does not go 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.010
 moisten the whole mass and we strain 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.290
 all this red wine face to the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.240
 perfectly fine red hurts me and now if 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.240
 we put in a bowl thank you very much 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.310
 and now if we are going to place 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.100
 now exactly now yes after 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.050
 about six hours that way would be 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.640
 list now yes we are going to place it out 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.980
 there is a good amount of salt 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.260
 mix well with a perfect spoon 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.959
 now we are going to put salt because it is 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.590
 all the taste of the paprika 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.440
 I activate the video of cumin of rosemary 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.440
 the laurel imagine all the flavors 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.570
 concentrated and now I'm going to place 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.000

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.450

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.730
 not exactly but eat a lot 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.670
 people the idea of opening this out of the 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.220
 oven about two hours from the oven that was coming 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.080
 in the pancito you do not open so you can do 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.540

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:11.189
 butter makes the dough of fat flour 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.219
 one 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:24.690
 use common oil and reach a
