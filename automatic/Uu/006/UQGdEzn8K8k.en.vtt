00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.630
 i 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.800
 to the mania of English as well as sure 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.720

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.029
 I 'm going to make some videos from today 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.199
 related to summer and it was declared 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.199
 guilty of going to bed late 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.650
 and I at least have put on super 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.750
 meat usually past midnight 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.460
 if I know it's a bad habit that I have 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.530
 to leave as I have already become very expensive 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.420
 and also but very early generally 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.860
 really hungry so what I do is 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.290
 that I prepare a small one that is 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.390

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.880

 favorite way and snack I loved it 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.539
 how do you know the mix of your two 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.240
 ingredients simply use cheese 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.009
 fat-free cottage and some prey what 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.140
 which is and also of course a container 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.509
 to mix what he did also served 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.280
 a quantity of cheese does not appear in the 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.950
 that you think you're going to eat depending 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.619
 the little girl you have and pique a strawberry 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.000
 and I put it on top of the cheese and 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.159
 serve only with those two 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.569
 ingredients if I tell them that I loved it 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.430

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.140
 spread the tortilla de casabe with 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.299

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.209
 of the video and chop it in slices 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.790
 then I just put it on the top 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.560
