00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.700
 video this video will be a unboxing like 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.930
 the video acts, however, will be an unboxing man 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.580
 box of what 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.460
 as you saw in my unbox 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.500
 I showed earlier that the package 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.990
 this just comes to most 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.210
 today I show you the unboxing in 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.710
 this game 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.470
 this and battlefield 4 had to go out at 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.910
 31 instead came out today to me they have me 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.650
 called what I call weight 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.380
 today since October 25 exit 31 broken 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.190
 two years six days this is the deluxe 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.040
 edition 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.600
 as you see rapid and deluxe edition 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.200
 we are about to see the face of 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.160
 cellophane and the first with you 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.480
 then let's do something 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.560
 we hope we can open it this way 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:10.570
 to the banner that costs to 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.570
 booking cost 80 euros 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:21.220
 take it 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:24.670
 as you can see now I don't know in April here 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.340
 that there is the package of good to evil 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.390
 predict the arrival in which there is some with 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:37.350
 the camera for everything normal and it 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.350
 steel box let's say beautiful colors 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.540
 in here there is also 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.299
 and must 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:56.259
 if I have this again, nothing to see 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.799
 this is steelbox let 's say no here 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.340
 inside 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.939
 now let's see what's in the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.520
 normal packaging then let's see if 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:10.679
 we can finish fast fast 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.679
 let's say a neighbor 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.620
 as for xbox 360 because I don't know if 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:27.120
 it was available for playstation 3 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:30.180
 because being called two authors neither 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.890
 love because they did n't know they were there 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:40.910
 they had brought them the deluxe edition 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.910
 then here is the game 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.290
 which are two disks 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.130
 ie disk 1 disk 1 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.420
 esko 1 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.420
 sorry the tv is open and disk 2 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.790
 I don't know maybe it should install 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.860
 they answer I go through all night a 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:15.400
 install risks then oh well I still have 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.390
 we close we put the risks can 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:24.120
 see this normal water pack 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.120
 as you see butterfield and cook the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.219
 code for china rising this is the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.219
 booklet 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.390
 much and we don't have to see the codes 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:44.599
 because they already know then this is the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:48.950
 code package to download beats pax 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:52.730
 gold beats cold ok 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.080
 expect video tracks here I am 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.030
 they also love this stuff that i am 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.560
 place if it is an exclusive in the game stop 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:03.319
 for me they also gave it and now let's see 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.860
 let's see what I already know what those 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.690
 to book the game and knows it too 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.390
 let's just see how we can open it 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.390
 folk rock clean open 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:26.920
 and here 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.920
 and military battlefield doubles 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.919
 are the nameplates 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:49.680
 as a military you can see in one there 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:52.789
 written for par for butler you can see it is 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.789
 the 3 is written 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.080
 a pact the feedback 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:06.979
 so summing up in this luxury 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:10.000
 there was not even the promised there 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.000
 carton pack 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:20.919
 the steel box I always remember the deluxe 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:23.530
 edition the game the game divided into two 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.889
 records that already when talking about three 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.600
 giorgio discs is much better than a record 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.350
 just because battlefield 3 was just a 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.560
 disk only for the various codes I will go to 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.370
 download now on the xbox anyway cost 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:43.660
 this some package was 80 euros 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:45.639
 I tried it in August it seems to me e 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:51.280
 then rather than later it is the work he did not have 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:52.720
 August and nothing I sincerely though 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.630
 But he said generates the beta has 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.169
 since it is good I will go to install it 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:02.020
 pits must be the first disc is already 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.070
 I did not like the game unloading all 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.180
 the contents however as I said the 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.280
 the one was broken 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.380
 if the days before I expected 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.210
 because when I'm at the stop there is also 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.640
 available batman and that came out today is 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.380
 also assassin's creed ie it would be for 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.510
 now the great Asti to offend is 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.700
 even climbed beats website going to 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.660
 take that already available for xbox 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.970
 360 is safe for playstation 3 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.770
 I don't really know why I am 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.260

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.850

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.740

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.750

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.479
