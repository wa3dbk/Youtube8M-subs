the<00:05:31.560> Philippines<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.930> just<00:05:34.200> thought<00:05:34.350> I'd

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
the Philippines and I just thought I'd

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.270 
the Philippines and I just thought I'd
come<00:05:34.680> in<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.980> this<00:05:35.100> motorcycle<00:05:35.520> shop<00:05:36.710> a<00:05:37.710> pass

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
come in to this motorcycle shop a pass

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.370

it every day

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.930 
it every day
and

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.300 

I<00:05:42.970> think<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:43.750> green-eyed<00:05:44.170> monster<00:05:44.800> comes<00:05:45.040> out

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
I think the green-eyed monster comes out

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.720 
I think the green-eyed monster comes out
of<00:05:45.520> it<00:05:45.670> because<00:05:46.060> I<00:05:46.330> had<00:05:46.450> to<00:05:46.480> get<00:05:46.690> rid<00:05:46.900> of<00:05:46.960> my

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
of it because I had to get rid of my

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.400 
of it because I had to get rid of my
Suzuki<00:05:48.730> 650<00:05:49.690> when<00:05:49.840> I<00:05:49.870> left<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.320> UK<00:05:52.410> but

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
Suzuki 650 when I left the UK but

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.000 
Suzuki 650 when I left the UK but
unfortunately<00:05:54.340> because<00:05:54.880> of<00:05:55.470> my<00:05:56.470> financial

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
unfortunately because of my financial

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.610 
unfortunately because of my financial
situation<00:05:58.050> it's<00:05:59.050> not<00:05:59.230> really<00:05:59.860> viable<00:06:00.130> to<00:06:01.620> buy

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
situation it's not really viable to buy

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.770 
situation it's not really viable to buy
a<00:06:02.650> motorcycle<00:06:03.220> at<00:06:03.730> the<00:06:03.850> moment<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:06.630> little<00:06:07.630> bit

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
a motorcycle at the moment a little bit

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.720 
a motorcycle at the moment a little bit
further<00:06:08.080> down<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:08.590> line<00:06:08.770> so<00:06:09.130> I<00:06:09.190> can<00:06:09.400> probably

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
further down the line so I can probably

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.570 
further down the line so I can probably
go<00:06:10.000> further<00:06:10.270> afield<00:06:10.800> but<00:06:11.800> up<00:06:11.920> to<00:06:12.100> now<00:06:12.130> going<00:06:12.520> to

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
go further afield but up to now going to

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.050 
go further afield but up to now going to
be<00:06:12.640> sensible<00:06:13.150> about<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.780> now<00:06:14.500> these

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
be sensible about it now these

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.120 
be sensible about it now these
motorcycles<00:06:16.060> they<00:06:16.540> start<00:06:16.990> from<00:06:17.260> thirty<00:06:17.710> four
