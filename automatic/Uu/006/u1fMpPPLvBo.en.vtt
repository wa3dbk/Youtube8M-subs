00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.510
 hello everyone and all the friends it's 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.890
 suddenly hdg perfused was going great 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.390
 listen to me I'm very very good at 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.820
 my part and today we will meet again 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.550
 on a video a bit special because it will be 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.439
 so a video on the screamer of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.349
 Maubeuge is therefore registered 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.909
 normally terrifying scene on my 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.600
 beast when you look on the horizon 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.240
 grace 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.290
 the sniper bezel so that's when 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.960
 you look on the horizon when you 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.670
 are on the roof looking down where 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.830
 a lot of money where you build 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.450
 the plane sorry and when you look at 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.650
 the horizon towards the fireworks you 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.230
 will find that it will make you a 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.370
 kind of screamer scene so it happens 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.660
 only once in the whole part 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.110
 so you can not do it again 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.309
 many times for the displayed so that 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.230
 only happen once so for 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.970
 show you in this video what is this 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.870
 what will it take to know 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.420
 how to proceed 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.909
 and in order to get that image of 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.290
 screamer and this action you need everything 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.150
 first have a sniper 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.100
 so that's a little normal so he's you 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.140
 must care the desert 50 be the bar 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.510
 so there are only two snipers that we 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.490
 can get in the wrong version 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.080
 the dead in his be so me I you 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.460
 advise the dr 50 because it's a 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.810
 more formidable weapon and it's a weapon 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.670
 more 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.649
 I think it's better 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.810
 best sneijder to zombie mode and in 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.520
 the multi mode so I do not know after this 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.720
 that it's for you so you choose 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.670
 what you want is the bar is either 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.049
 the dsr and then you go on 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.229
 the roof and there when you're on the 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.720
 roof you look on the horizon so with 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.600
 the telescope of the sniper and you 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.789
 see the fencer you're going to 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.890
 to have some kind of scene that does a little 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.289
 scared the first time so me perso that 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.090
 not really going to flip samaj was 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.860
 just amazed I could buy myself 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.179
 the first time I saw that so 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.799
 in the light of a year on the horizon you go 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.600
 see that that's actually register me back here 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.209
 so normally you will have a 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.130
 little bit scared if you have the first 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.590
 time but otherwise it's not scary at all 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.530
 it's just a scene this crime they 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.569
 wanted to place just like that for 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.970
 show that we are in a good place 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.410
 terrifying what in a prison but if 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.840
 it's really a story of you 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.849
 check out where to scare what was it 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.590
 I think it was music spread in 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.660
 for that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.269
 otherwise I'll let you watch in slow motion 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.250
 to see pretty much the screamer how 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.260
 here realize and on those I hope that 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.850
 this video will please you do not hesitate 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.410
