 since the weekend has been giving the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.860
 northeast of the united states the close 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 of the federal government the activities already 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.070
 been in cities like Philadelphia that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 washington departure from new york but 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.570
 they also closed the schools 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.550
 universities the capital of the usa has 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.760
 remained in this neighborhood is 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.250
 practically desolate because also the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.979
 public transportation in some tasks is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.839
 has been affected in neighboring states to 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.260
 washington as maryland and virginia 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:05.250
 also that the effects of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.170
 up to 7 inches of snow where many 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 houses have also run out of 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.140

 the temperatures have even arrived 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.869
 up to minus four degrees to four 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.700
 degrees below zero and it is believed that 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.369
 probably for the next few days 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.770

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.020

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.960
 has been present practically in all 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.220
