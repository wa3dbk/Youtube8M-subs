this<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> section<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.770> layered<00:00:08.670> drinks<00:00:09.269> and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
this is a section on layered drinks and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.540 
this is a section on layered drinks and
what<00:00:10.349> I'm<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.620> be<00:00:10.740> explaining<00:00:11.219> here

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
what I'm going to be explaining here

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.700 
what I'm going to be explaining here
today<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.120> how<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.509> layer<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.990> drink<00:00:13.320> properly

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
today is how to layer a drink properly

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.430 
today is how to layer a drink properly
now<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.700> reason<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.240> drinks<00:00:15.870> were<00:00:16.139> layered

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
now the reason that drinks were layered

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.950 
now the reason that drinks were layered
was<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.430> got<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:18.029> different<00:00:18.720> flavor

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
was so you got a different flavor

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.050 
was so you got a different flavor
sensation<00:00:19.650> as<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:21.090> drink<00:00:21.390> got<00:00:21.779> drunk<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:23.060> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
sensation as the drink got drunk so the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.330 
sensation as the drink got drunk so the
way<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.539> works<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.800> method<00:00:26.220> is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
way that that works is this method is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.400 
way that that works is this method is
called<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> pues<00:00:26.910> Cafe<00:00:27.330> method<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.080> means<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
called the pues Cafe method it means to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.099 
called the pues Cafe method it means to
push<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.859> coffee<00:00:29.070> down<00:00:29.689> lot<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> older

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
push the coffee down lot of the older

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.709 
push the coffee down lot of the older
recipes<00:00:31.529> had<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> raw<00:00:32.369> egg<00:00:32.669> or<00:00:33.000> quail<00:00:33.239> egg<00:00:33.510> in

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
recipes had a raw egg or quail egg in

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.930 
recipes had a raw egg or quail egg in
there<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:34.890> give<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.579> something

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
there to really give it something

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.380 
there to really give it something
different<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.879> works<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
different now the way that this works is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.470 
different now the way that this works is
each<00:00:39.660> liquor<00:00:40.649> such<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.460> our<00:00:41.640> cordials<00:00:42.180> over

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
each liquor such as our cordials over

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.709 
each liquor such as our cordials over
here<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.620> specific<00:00:44.250> density<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.059> which

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
here have a specific density to it which

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.959 
here have a specific density to it which
means<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.100> different<00:00:47.640> amounts

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
means that they have different amounts

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.950 
means that they have different amounts
of<00:00:48.030> sugar<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.610> each<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:51.300> has<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.600> different

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
of sugar so each one has a different

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.840 
of sugar so each one has a different
amount<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.170> sugar<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.739> we're<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
amount of sugar this one we're going to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.639 
amount of sugar this one we're going to
start<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.079> Kahlua<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
start out with is going to be Kahlua and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
start out with is going to be Kahlua and
that's<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.309> our<00:00:56.550> heaviest<00:00:57.090> liqueur

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that's going to be our heaviest liqueur

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.779 
that's going to be our heaviest liqueur
and<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> go<00:00:58.530> from<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:58.859> heaviest<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and then you go from your heaviest to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.910 
and then you go from your heaviest to
your<00:00:59.940> lightest<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.840> get<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.260> specific

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
your lightest to get your specific

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.329 
your lightest to get your specific
layers<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.789> those<00:01:03.149> drinks<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
layers of those drinks the way that

do is put my bar spoon in concave side
up

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
up

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.840 
up
make<00:01:52.320> sure<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.710> spoon<00:01:53.070> touches<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.580> end<00:01:53.730> of

make sure the spoon touches the end of
the<00:01:53.940> glass<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.140> helps<00:01:55.440> disperse<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.160> a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
the glass so it helps disperse it a

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
so now we got our two distinct layers we

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.640 
so now we got our two distinct layers we
got<00:03:20.640> our<00:03:20.760> Kahlua<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.300> our<00:03:21.840> Bailey's<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.380> top
