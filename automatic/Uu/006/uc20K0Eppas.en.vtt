okay<00:00:38.989> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.140> probably<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> most<00:00:40.590> difficult

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
okay this is probably the most difficult

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.400 
okay this is probably the most difficult
part<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.090> keeping<00:00:43.050> these<00:00:43.170> two

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
part of this is keeping these two

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.700 
part of this is keeping these two
together<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.190> since<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.520> pinned<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.710> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
together but since you pinned it it's it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.310 
together but since you pinned it it's it
should<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.039> real<00:00:47.309> easy<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.930> use<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.200> many

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
should be real easy you can use as many

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
should be real easy you can use as many
pins<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.860> want<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.640> try<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.940> run

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
pins as you want just try not to run

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.270 
pins as you want just try not to run
over<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> breaking<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.860> needle<00:00:55.219> okay<00:00:56.219> so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
over on a breaking and needle okay so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.069 
over on a breaking and needle okay so
that's<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> closing<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:57.870> I'm<00:00:57.989> just

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that's the closing and now I'm just

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.900 
that's the closing and now I'm just
going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> go<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.559> way<00:00:58.649> around<00:00:58.879> with<00:00:59.879> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
tension on your cell machine to make the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280 
tension on your cell machine to make the
threads<00:01:17.759> meet<00:01:18.060> where<00:01:18.720> they're<00:01:18.840> supposed<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
soon as I give it a little press I think

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.300 
soon as I give it a little press I think
i'm<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.470> start<00:01:58.590> running<00:01:58.830> this<00:01:59.040> draw

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
i'm going to start running this draw

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.470 
i'm going to start running this draw
through<00:01:59.580> string<00:02:00.030> through<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.500> casing<00:02:02.010> and

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
through string through the casing and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.910 
through string through the casing and
then<00:02:03.480> we'll<00:02:03.630> really<00:02:03.870> get<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:04.800> it

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
then we'll really get to see what it

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.520 
then we'll really get to see what it
looks<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.250> then
