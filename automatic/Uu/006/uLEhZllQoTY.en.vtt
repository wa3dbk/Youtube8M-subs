00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.350
 I told you to put it on if I see it. 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:17.250
 this detail is that we also avoid here 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 this part here is removable a 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.520
 thing for you're

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.340
 be done in the country is not 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.990
 the first thing we do is me 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.180
 I'll say stuff we need 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.360
 accurate back need fabric 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.560
 Needs to be and does not need a screen and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:49.460
 you need the glue from the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.460
 Hot silicone glue is not any 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.010
 finish things and also needs to 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.780
 nylon line a needle scissors as 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.500
 things you will see the course of the video 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.280
 fine 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.590
 put on top of the rubber is 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.540
 return 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.920
 okay with a pen you get letters 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.120
 back the two equal parts draws the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.549
 also part 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.069
 ax and remember when you crop 62 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.140
 part of these are these two parts you 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.730
 You will start working on it. 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.040
 start work in these two shares 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.980
 go with her all happened 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.260
 you will get for example tá show 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:41.280
 You and this fabric here are picking up and bouncing. 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.379
 My part here I'm gonna cut here like this 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:51.720
 not much above nor will I give an example 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:53.370
 how can i cut your you can draw 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.769
 if you want the pen it's because I'm 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.109
 a person practicing and I think it will not 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.010
 be like this because I need a little 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.450
 bigger 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.799
 just have to be always a little bigger 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.799
 for you to bend the ends right 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.209
 I 'll cut it, then I 'll get your bills. 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.730
 I'll put here what silva stole glue 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.340
 here I go and I go there and I'll stick it 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.629
 close it all after closing 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.190
 It's all going to stay the way it is. 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.040
 this way hiding from the coladinho 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.480
 this part belongs to the other phase 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.150
 3 when the side here in that part you 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.440
 will see that the weak teams with the screen 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.760
 You do not need to use the team, are you? 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.030
 can do with pearl and you will 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.530
 involve and all together draw only 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.510
 before you get involved you have to use 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.949
 your creativity is you can do the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.260
 drawing as you want 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:52.260
 so I have a ready part like 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.780
 You see what I did, I cut a 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.790
 red color the color is destined to cut 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.370
 another red strip choose that side 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.720
 I picked up two applications here and one 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.040
 red ink and then I saw that 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.560
 Show me everything here and paste it back 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.889
 then here with the pearl harvest also 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.930
 and which will build your college application 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:15.000
 and rhinestones and pomegranate can show you 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.840
 What I did is in the pen told a little 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.900
 ahead 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.389

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.999

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.490
 I did the same thing I put around the 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:29.110
 of drawing that we made with fabric and made 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.330

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.990

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:54.490
 Stitch all the strokes after I 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.349

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.770

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.069
 I have this part is how I told 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.779
