automatic<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> my<00:01:43.049> fenders<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
automatic so this is one of my fenders I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.789 
automatic so this is one of my fenders I
might<00:01:44.549> replace<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
might replace this one because as you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.910 
might replace this one because as you
can<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.790> bit<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.920> dent

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920

and<00:01:50.250> stuff<00:01:50.759> right<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.630> i<00:01:51.659> might<00:01:51.960> just

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and stuff right there so i might just

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.810 
and stuff right there so i might just
end<00:01:52.320> up<00:01:52.470> replacing<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.189> instead<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.490> paul<00:01:53.670> from

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
