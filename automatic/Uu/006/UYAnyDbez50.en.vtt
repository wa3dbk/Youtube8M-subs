00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.060 
flat and so now when you're playing I
would<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.000> would<00:01:21.390> learn<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:22.770> one

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
would I would learn to do that with one

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.200 
would I would learn to do that with one
button<00:01:23.369> first<00:01:24.470> learn<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
button first learn to get to get the the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.289 
button first learn to get to get the the
scale<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:32.600> okay<00:01:33.600> then<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.380> graduate

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
scale of that okay then you graduate

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.219 
scale of that okay then you graduate
where<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.420> play<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.659> harmony<00:01:37.460> Wow<00:01:38.720> yeah<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
one here there's nothing to don't

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.249 
one here there's nothing to don't
harmonize<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> because<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.899> too<00:01:43.110> low

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
harmonize with it because it's too low

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.410 
harmonize with it because it's too low
on<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> scale<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.939> get<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> by<00:01:45.390> going

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
on the scale but you can get it by going

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.520
