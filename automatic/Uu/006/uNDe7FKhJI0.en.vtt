00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
mean obviously I'm from Chicago so like

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.110 
mean obviously I'm from Chicago so like
I<00:00:38.610> had<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.000> tied<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.570> Michael<00:00:40.290> Jordan<00:00:40.620> but

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
I had that tied to Michael Jordan but

I had that tied to Michael Jordan but
you<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.300> beyond<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.590> guess<00:00:44.280> I'm

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you know beyond that like I guess I'm

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.150

probably<00:00:44.760> doing<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:46.140> tinker's<00:00:46.649> designs

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
probably doing it for tinker's designs

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
probably doing it for tinker's designs
and<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.940> whole<00:00:47.969> design<00:00:48.480> team<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.230> all

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
and like that whole design team and all

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.200 
and like that whole design team and all
that<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.129> love<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.969> know<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that and like I love like you know the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.700 
that and like I love like you know the
story<00:00:51.480> behind<00:00:51.539> half<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.199> prayer<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.620> all

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
story behind half and prayer and all

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.299 
story behind half and prayer and all
that<00:00:52.890> kind<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.160> stuff<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
that kind of stuff but you know and I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.700 
that kind of stuff but you know and I
guess<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.670> why<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.820> didn't<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.350> get<00:00:58.350> into

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
guess it's why I didn't really get into

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.760 
guess it's why I didn't really get into
like<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.160> Kobe<00:00:59.550> liner<00:01:00.289> through<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.530> brown

like the Kobe liner through the brown

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
like the Kobe liner through the brown
line<00:01:01.800> too<00:01:02.430> much<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:03.059> mean<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
line too much I mean I really like the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
line too much I mean I really like the
color<00:01:04.229> ways<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.739> stuff<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.100> there

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
