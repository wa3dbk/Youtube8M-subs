School on that occasion would be

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.620 
School on that occasion would be
unrecognizable<00:00:16.320> as<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.820> use<00:00:18.000> today

so<00:00:19.320> back<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.710> 1823<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.460> ball<00:00:20.730> would<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:20.910> been

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
so back in 1823 the ball would have been

first<00:00:30.929> began<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:31.769> started<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.309> become<00:00:32.430> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
first began they started to become a

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.490 
first began they started to become a
little<00:00:32.730> bit<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:32.910> structure<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
little bit more structure and then the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.110 
little bit more structure and then the
following<00:00:34.739> 40<00:00:35.190> years<00:00:35.340> from<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.550> different

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
following 40 years from that different

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
following 40 years from that different
unions<00:00:36.480> evolved<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.079> they<00:00:37.500> started<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> have

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
unions evolved and they started to have

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.400 
unions evolved and they started to have
a<00:00:38.070> ball<00:00:38.579> shape<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.120> wanted<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> keep<00:00:40.200> so

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
a ball shape that they wanted to keep so

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.260 
a ball shape that they wanted to keep so
it<00:00:40.469> was<00:00:40.559> consistent<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.309> from<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.059> point

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it was consistent so from that point

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
it was consistent so from that point
forward<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:43.680> shape<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.399> would<00:00:44.520> see

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
forward the shape that we we would see

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.779 
forward the shape that we we would see
today<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:44.940> recognize<00:00:45.120> today<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:45.750> born<00:00:45.960> as

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
today and recognize today was born as

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.090 
today and recognize today was born as
the<00:00:47.789> ball<00:00:48.180> changed<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.230> did<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> methods<00:00:49.950> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the ball changed so did the methods of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.209 
the ball changed so did the methods of
kicking<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:51.539> evolved<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.320> nothing

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
kicking it it's evolved from nothing

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.459 
kicking it it's evolved from nothing
from<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> hole<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.000> ground<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.570> through

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
from a hole in the ground to through

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
from a hole in the ground to through
sand<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.070> telescopic<00:00:56.789> tees<00:00:57.030> where<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> got

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
sand to telescopic tees where you got

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.240 
sand to telescopic tees where you got
the<00:00:57.690> ball<00:00:57.870> sort<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.289> tremendously<00:00:58.829> high<00:00:59.070> off

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the ball sort of tremendously high off

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.709 
the ball sort of tremendously high off
the<00:00:59.399> floor<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.640> never<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.180> suited<00:01:00.390> me

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the floor I never really suited me

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.360 
the floor I never really suited me
always<00:01:00.840> preferred<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.320> lower<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> then

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
always preferred a lower one and then

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.429 
always preferred a lower one and then
you<00:01:02.460> find<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> works<00:01:03.930> for<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you find one that works for you as you

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.190 
you find one that works for you as you
as<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:04.830> technique<00:01:05.159> develops<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:07.080> know

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
as your technique develops and you know

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.539 
as your technique develops and you know
and<00:01:07.320> that's<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.159> putting<00:01:08.490> on

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
means you get 10 to 15 percent extra in

means you get 10 to 15 percent extra in
the<00:02:02.750> ball<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.860> takes<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.430> lot<00:02:04.580> more<00:02:04.640> out

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880
