you know that and someone needs to make
a<00:01:44.880> lounge<00:01:45.149> chair<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.810> suspends<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
a lounge chair that suspends you in the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
a lounge chair that suspends you in the
air<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.310> rotates<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.630> while

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
air and then rotates you and then while

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.410 
air and then rotates you and then while
while<00:01:49.619> you're<00:01:49.829> rotating<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:51.000> spins

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
while you're rotating it also spins

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.960 
while you're rotating it also spins
around<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.250> think<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.310> saw<00:01:53.490> something<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
around I think I saw something like that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.130 
around I think I saw something like that
at<00:01:54.090> Pam<00:01:54.270> Anderson's<00:01:54.720> house<00:01:54.899> once

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
at Pam Anderson's house once

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.360 
at Pam Anderson's house once
but<00:01:58.140> actually<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.740> think<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.190> I

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
but actually now that I think about it I

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.130 
but actually now that I think about it I
guess<00:01:59.580> you<00:01:59.729> could<00:01:59.760> do<00:01:59.970> somersaults<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.870> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
guess you could do somersaults in the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.320 
guess you could do somersaults in the
Sun<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.620> then<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.460> would<00:02:02.580> get<00:02:02.700> an<00:02:02.850> even<00:02:03.120> tan

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
Sun and then you would get an even tan

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.540 
Sun and then you would get an even tan
that's<00:02:03.810> why<00:02:03.960> they<00:02:04.140> call<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.350> somersaults<00:02:05.250> by

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
that's why they call it somersaults by

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.400 
that's why they call it somersaults by
the<00:02:05.610> way<00:02:05.729> cuz<00:02:05.910> in<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.060> winter<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.630> doesn't

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
the way cuz in the winter it doesn't

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.370 
the way cuz in the winter it doesn't
work<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.550> summer
