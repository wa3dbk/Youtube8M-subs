was a very successful feature last year

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.150 
was a very successful feature last year
and<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.460> focus<00:00:17.670> mainly<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.650> visuals<00:00:20.009> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and we focus mainly on on the visuals of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.919 
and we focus mainly on on the visuals of
players<00:00:20.400> making<00:00:20.730> sure<00:00:20.939> they<00:00:21.119> look<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.810> like

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
their real life counterparts their

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.739 
their real life counterparts their
dribble<00:00:24.210> styles<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:26.130> body<00:00:26.369> styles<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.179> also

dribble styles the body styles and also
on<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> gameplay<00:00:28.470> set<00:00:28.679> of<00:00:28.800> things<00:00:28.919> we<00:00:29.699> focused

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
on the gameplay set of things we focused

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.420 
on the gameplay set of things we focused
on<00:00:30.390> making<00:00:30.569> sure<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.960> attributes<00:00:31.529> really

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
on making sure the attributes really

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.700 
on making sure the attributes really
meant<00:00:32.730> something<00:00:32.899> when<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> were<00:00:34.079> executing

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
meant something when you were executing

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.230 
meant something when you were executing
all<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> different<00:00:35.160> actions<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.670> our<00:00:35.760> game<00:00:35.970> so

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
all the different actions in our game so

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.690 
all the different actions in our game so
if<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> were<00:00:36.660> shooting<00:00:36.900> or<00:00:37.380> passing<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.460> if

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
if you were shooting or passing that if

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.250 
if you were shooting or passing that if
you<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.940> players<00:00:39.240> that<00:00:39.390> were<00:00:39.600> excellent<00:00:40.170> at

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
you have players that were excellent at

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020 
you have players that were excellent at
these<00:00:40.410> areas<00:00:40.830> you<00:00:41.220> could<00:00:41.400> really<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
these areas you could really see the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.060 
these areas you could really see the
difference<00:00:42.060> when<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> were<00:00:42.810> doing<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:43.920> these

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
difference when you were doing all these

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
difference when you were doing all these
things<00:00:44.130> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.580> game<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:45.600> doing<00:00:45.810> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
things in the game what we're doing this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.780 
things in the game what we're doing this
year<00:00:45.990> with<00:00:46.470> pro<00:00:46.680> player<00:00:46.890> intelligence<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
year with pro player intelligence is

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.110 
year with pro player intelligence is
given<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> CPU<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> AI<00:00:49.980> control<00:00:50.520> players<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
given the CPU and AI control players a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.020 
given the CPU and AI control players a
new<00:00:51.720> layer<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.350> self-awareness<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.370> will

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
new layer of self-awareness that will

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.280 
new layer of self-awareness that will
allow<00:00:54.240> them<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.600> make<00:00:54.750> different<00:00:55.260> decisions

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
allow them to make different decisions

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.990 
allow them to make different decisions
in<00:00:56.660> different<00:00:57.660> scenarios<00:00:57.810> so<00:00:58.560> in<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.800> video

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
in different scenarios so in this video

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.390 
in different scenarios so in this video
you<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.360> how<00:01:00.480> Peter<00:01:00.720> Crouch<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.320> already<00:01:02.160> in

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
you see how Peter Crouch is already in

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.920 
you see how Peter Crouch is already in
the<00:01:02.460> heart<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.060> the<00:01:03.120> box<00:01:03.360> in<00:01:03.540> a<00:01:03.600> great<00:01:03.780> position

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the heart of the box in a great position

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.310 
the heart of the box in a great position
for<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> header<00:01:05.040> situation<00:01:05.810> now<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:07.140> just

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
for for a header situation now we just

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
for for a header situation now we just
run<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> regular<00:01:08.100> logic<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> game<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
run the regular logic in the game and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
run the regular logic in the game and
see<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.360> cpu<00:01:09.750> decision-making<00:01:10.440> once<00:01:10.800> he

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
see what cpu decision-making once he

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.700 
see what cpu decision-making once he
gets<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.370> ball<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.530> in

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
gets to the ball is going to be and in

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.830 
gets to the ball is going to be and in
the<00:01:13.800> Peter<00:01:13.950> Crouch<00:01:14.190> example<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.180> CPU<00:01:15.570> player

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the Peter Crouch example the CPU player

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.710 
the Peter Crouch example the CPU player
is<00:01:16.020> asking<00:01:16.440> himself<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:17.430> only<00:01:17.570> what<00:01:18.570> am<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
is asking himself not only what am I

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.840 
is asking himself not only what am I
really<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.860> who<00:01:20.370> are<00:01:20.460> my<00:01:20.550> players

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
really good at but who are my players

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.270 
really good at but who are my players
where<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.510> my<00:01:21.630> teammates<00:01:22.050> and<00:01:22.229> what<00:01:23.100> are<00:01:23.190> they

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
where are my teammates and what are they

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
where are my teammates and what are they
really<00:01:23.460> good<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.540> case<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
really good at and in this case is that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
really good at and in this case is that
teammate<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.470> Peter<00:01:25.650> crowd<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> can

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
teammate is Peter crowd so as you can

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.300 
teammate is Peter crowd so as you can
see<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.540> he<00:01:27.690> gets<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> ball<00:01:28.260> he<00:01:28.950> puts<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
see when he gets to the ball he puts the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.760 
see when he gets to the ball he puts the
cross<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.729> first<00:01:29.970> time<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:31.229> results<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
cross in first time and it results in a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.330 
cross in first time and it results in a
goal<00:01:31.920> by<00:01:32.100> Peter<00:01:32.310> Crouch<00:01:32.580> off<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.909> header

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.440 

now<00:01:36.340> we're<00:01:36.460> going<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.610> run<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.880> same<00:01:37.030> scenario

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
now we're going to run the same scenario

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.290 
now we're going to run the same scenario
again<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:38.250> all<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.520> variables<00:01:39.790> are<00:01:39.970> exactly

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
again and all the variables are exactly

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.490 
again and all the variables are exactly
the<00:01:40.420> same<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.930> only<00:01:41.110> thing<00:01:41.260> that<00:01:41.380> we're

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
the same the only thing that we're

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.800 
the same the only thing that we're
changing<00:01:42.010> is<00:01:42.220> substituting<00:01:43.000> Peter<00:01:43.480> Crouch

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
changing is substituting Peter Crouch

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.950 
changing is substituting Peter Crouch
for<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.380> Spanish<00:01:44.590> striker<00:01:44.860> WV<00:01:45.580> dia<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:45.970> of

excellent striker but he is not known

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.510 
excellent striker but he is not known
for<00:01:50.670> being<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:52.510> you<00:01:53.170> know<00:01:53.200> an<00:01:53.320> aerial<00:01:53.590> threat<00:01:53.830> so

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
in this case the CPU is now running

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.770 
in this case the CPU is now running
towards<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.010> ball<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:58.630> his

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
towards the ball and now his

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.060 
towards the ball and now his
decision-making<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.500> going<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.860> change

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
decision-making is going to change

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.560 
decision-making is going to change
precisely<00:02:00.610> because<00:02:00.790> of<00:02:00.910> this<00:02:01.030> factor

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
precisely because of this factor

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.210 
precisely because of this factor
everything<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.050> exactly<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.590> same<00:02:02.830> but<00:02:02.860> he

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
everything is exactly the same but he

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.160 
everything is exactly the same but he
knows<00:02:03.400> that<00:02:03.640> his<00:02:03.730> VJ<00:02:04.090> now<00:02:04.210> inside<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.690> box<00:02:04.930> and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
knows that his VJ now inside the box and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.780 
knows that his VJ now inside the box and
that<00:02:05.650> it's<00:02:05.800> not<00:02:05.980> really<00:02:06.400> a<00:02:06.430> good<00:02:06.550> opportunity

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
that it's not really a good opportunity

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.870 
that it's not really a good opportunity
to<00:02:07.180> cross<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.570> ball<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.980> so<00:02:08.980> when<00:02:09.550> he<00:02:09.640> gets<00:02:09.790> to

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
to cross the ball in so when he gets to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.190 
to cross the ball in so when he gets to
the<00:02:09.910> ball<00:02:10.090> he<00:02:10.210> actually<00:02:10.330> takes<00:02:10.570> another<00:02:10.840> touch

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
the ball he actually takes another touch

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.740 
the ball he actually takes another touch
tries<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.950> buy<00:02:12.070> himself<00:02:12.250> some<00:02:12.490> time<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:13.300> ended

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
tries to buy himself some time I ended

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.060 
tries to buy himself some time I ended
up<00:02:13.780> playing<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.260> back<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> teammate<00:02:14.950> that

up playing it back to a teammate that

up playing it back to a teammate that
supports<00:02:15.550> supports<00:02:16.420> close<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:18.250> know

incidentally<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.840> very<00:02:20.440> much<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.740> way

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890
