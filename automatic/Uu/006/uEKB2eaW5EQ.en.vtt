00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
been always a big fan of this plane I

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.630 
been always a big fan of this plane I
built<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.379> lot<00:00:41.470> of<00:00:41.530> models<00:00:41.949> of<00:00:42.070> it<00:00:42.190> in<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.370> smaller

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
built a lot of models of it in a smaller

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.549 
built a lot of models of it in a smaller
scale<00:00:42.970> so<00:00:43.510> I<00:00:43.570> was<00:00:43.690> pretty<00:00:43.900> impressed<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.379> see

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
different versions of it this happens to

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.460 
different versions of it this happens to
be<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.699> plug-and-play<00:00:48.970> so<00:00:49.870> plug<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.320> play

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
be the plug-and-play so plug and play

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.079

really all that's left is to assemble it
pop<00:01:17.619> in<00:01:17.799> a<00:01:17.860> receiver<00:01:18.220> so<00:01:18.759> let's<00:01:18.909> open<00:01:19.030> her<00:01:19.240> up

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
pop in a receiver so let's open her up

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.890 
pop in a receiver so let's open her up
and<00:01:19.479> take<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.689> look<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.759> thing<00:01:22.060> has<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.450> fair

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
and take a look this thing has a fair

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.780 
and take a look this thing has a fair
amount<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.409> hardware<00:01:23.740> on<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.010> in<00:01:24.340> terms<00:01:24.550> of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
amount of hardware on it in terms of

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.240 
amount of hardware on it in terms of
scale<00:01:25.120> realism<00:01:25.810> so<00:01:26.350> I<00:01:26.380> was<00:01:26.650> impressed<00:01:26.800> to<00:01:27.100> see

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
scale realism so I was impressed to see

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.649 
scale realism so I was impressed to see
that<00:01:27.400> they<00:01:27.520> went<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.790> extra<00:01:27.820> mile<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.240> kind<00:01:28.600> of

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
that they went the extra mile to kind of

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.840 
that they went the extra mile to kind of
make<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.840> look<00:01:29.170> like<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:30.340> know<00:01:30.460> you're<00:01:30.670> used

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
make it look like you know you're used

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.120 
make it look like you know you're used
to<00:01:30.970> old<00:01:31.720> stick<00:01:32.110> planes<00:01:32.440> made<00:01:32.680> out<00:01:32.800> of<00:01:32.920> balsa

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
to old stick planes made out of balsa

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.890 
to old stick planes made out of balsa
and<00:01:33.310> covered<00:01:33.700> with<00:01:33.850> wood<00:01:34.030> guys<00:01:34.270> put<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.570> lot<00:01:34.750> of

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
and covered with wood guys put a lot of

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.810 
and covered with wood guys put a lot of
time<00:01:35.110> into<00:01:35.440> detail<00:01:36.100> on<00:01:36.130> those<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.580> make<00:01:36.700> them

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
time into detail on those to make them

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.969 
time into detail on those to make them
look<00:01:36.940> as<00:01:37.090> scale<00:01:37.330> as<00:01:37.479> possible<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.229> believe<00:01:38.800> this

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
look as scale as possible I believe this

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.550 
look as scale as possible I believe this
plane<00:01:39.220> had<00:01:39.550> some<00:01:39.850> fabric<00:01:40.720> covering<00:01:41.080> on<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.350> so

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
plane had some fabric covering on it so

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.530 
plane had some fabric covering on it so
they've<00:01:41.740> kind<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.100> gone<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.670> extra<00:01:42.790> mile<00:01:43.210> to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
they've kind of gone the extra mile to

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.510 
they've kind of gone the extra mile to
mold<00:01:44.080> in<00:01:44.350> what<00:01:45.010> looks<00:01:45.250> like<00:01:45.370> fabric<00:01:45.909> covering

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
mold in what looks like fabric covering

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.740 
mold in what looks like fabric covering
what<00:01:48.520> this<00:01:48.700> means<00:01:48.940> to<00:01:49.180> you<00:01:49.270> is<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.600> get<00:01:49.690> a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
what this means to you is you get a

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.500 
what this means to you is you get a

airline circles molded in and kind of

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.590 
airline circles molded in and kind of
covered<00:03:55.100> to<00:03:55.250> add<00:03:55.370> again<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> realism<00:03:56.480> so

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
covered to add again to the realism so

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.650 
covered to add again to the realism so
you<00:03:56.660> don't<00:03:56.810> see<00:03:56.959> a<00:03:56.989> servo<00:03:57.320> sticking<00:03:57.709> out<00:03:57.830> I

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
you don't see a servo sticking out I

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.120 
you don't see a servo sticking out I
believe<00:03:59.660> this<00:04:00.019> would<00:04:00.170> be<00:04:00.290> this<00:04:00.470> fake<00:04:00.739> fuel

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
believe this would be this fake fuel

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.070 
believe this would be this fake fuel

let's<00:04:09.890> skip<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.400> fuselage<00:04:10.880> out<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.300> here<00:04:11.450> if<00:04:11.660> I

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
let's skip the fuselage out of here if I

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:19.720 
let's skip the fuselage out of here if I
can<00:04:13.390> battle<00:04:14.390> with<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.510> little<00:04:14.780> bit<00:04:14.900> more<00:04:15.050> tape

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.880 

now<00:04:20.300> that<00:04:20.540> some<00:04:20.990> people<00:04:21.320> might<00:04:21.440> ask<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.830> know

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
now that some people might ask you know

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.490 
now that some people might ask you know
why<00:04:22.160> by<00:04:22.400> plane<00:04:22.790> or<00:04:23.090> what's<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.720> difference<00:04:24.380> of

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
why by plane or what's the difference of

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.090 
why by plane or what's the difference of
biplanes

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
biplanes

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.770 
biplanes
but<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.520> get<00:04:25.640> more<00:04:25.790> wing<00:04:26.030> area<00:04:26.390> on<00:04:26.480> a<00:04:26.570> biplane

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
but you get more wing area on a biplane

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.530 
but you get more wing area on a biplane
first<00:04:27.290> of<00:04:27.500> all<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:28.040> not<00:04:28.280> all<00:04:28.540> truly

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
first of all it's not all truly

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.210 
first of all it's not all truly
effective<00:04:30.020> wing<00:04:30.170> area<00:04:30.440> but<00:04:30.710> what<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:30.980> means

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
effective wing area but what that means

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.040 
effective wing area but what that means
to<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.820> more<00:04:32.090> lifts<00:04:32.360> when<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.930> have

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
to you is that more lifts when you have

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.240 
to you is that more lifts when you have
two<00:04:33.200> wings<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.620> have<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.770> lot<00:04:33.860> more<00:04:33.890> lift

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
two wings you have a lot more lift

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.980 
two wings you have a lot more lift
that's<00:04:34.370> allowed<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.700> fly<00:04:34.850> slower<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.600> with

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
that's allowed to fly slower and with

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.140 
that's allowed to fly slower and with
less<00:04:36.200> power<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.620> back<00:04:36.860> in<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.100> day<00:04:37.250> they<00:04:37.940> kind

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
less power and back in the day they kind

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.310 
less power and back in the day they kind

of went with that those the theme of the
day<00:04:39.470> because<00:04:39.830> they're<00:04:40.580> going<00:04:40.760> for<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.090> most

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
day because they're going for the most

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
amount of lift possible for the engines

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.950 
amount of lift possible for the engines
they<00:04:42.980> had<00:04:43.160> what<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.000> means<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.330> us<00:04:44.360> is<00:04:44.660> just<00:04:44.870> a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
they had what it means to us is just a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.180 
they had what it means to us is just a
great<00:04:45.110> flying<00:04:45.440> plane<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.710> mean<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:45.950> thing<00:04:46.130> is

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
great flying plane I mean this thing is

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.830 
great flying plane I mean this thing is
going<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.430> be<00:04:46.580> slow<00:04:46.910> predictable<00:04:47.660> very

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
going to be slow predictable very

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.460 
going to be slow predictable very
forgiving<00:04:49.330> easy<00:04:50.330> plan<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.900> went<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.290> won't

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
forgiving easy plan I went I won't

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.750 
forgiving easy plan I went I won't
necessarily<00:04:51.560> say<00:04:51.920> this<00:04:52.190> would<00:04:52.400> be<00:04:52.430> your<00:04:52.580> first

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
necessarily say this would be your first

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.850 
necessarily say this would be your first
plane<00:04:53.150> only<00:04:53.930> because<00:04:54.200> we<00:04:54.320> have<00:04:54.440> so<00:04:54.680> many

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
plane only because we have so many

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.890 
plane only because we have so many
pieces<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.550> hardware<00:04:56.000> on<00:04:56.090> here<00:04:56.150> by<00:04:56.570> planes

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
pieces of hardware on here by planes

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.450 
pieces of hardware on here by planes
when<00:04:57.080> they<00:04:57.110> crash<00:04:57.440> is<00:04:57.680> more<00:04:57.890> to<00:04:58.010> fix<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.340> mean

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
when they crash is more to fix I mean

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.220 
when they crash is more to fix I mean
you<00:04:58.550> got<00:04:58.670> two<00:04:58.850> wings<00:04:59.090> all<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.840> linkages

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
you got two wings all the linkages

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.050 
you got two wings all the linkages
between<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.740> wings<00:05:00.890> to<00:05:01.100> worry<00:05:01.250> about<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.730> mean

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
between the wings to worry about I mean

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.490 
between the wings to worry about I mean
look<00:05:02.210> at<00:05:02.270> all<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.480> detail<00:05:02.900> in<00:05:02.930> here<00:05:03.200> you<00:05:03.320> put

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
look at all the detail in here you put

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.020 
look at all the detail in here you put
this<00:05:03.620> bird<00:05:03.860> in<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.070> ground<00:05:04.280> you'll<00:05:04.760> spend

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
this bird in the ground you'll spend

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.790 
this bird in the ground you'll spend
some<00:05:05.210> fair<00:05:05.360> amount<00:05:05.540> of<00:05:05.600> coin<00:05:05.810> or<00:05:06.050> time<00:05:06.290> piecing

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
some fair amount of coin or time piecing

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.230 
some fair amount of coin or time piecing
it<00:05:06.860> back<00:05:06.920> together<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.490> make<00:05:07.640> it<00:05:07.670> look<00:05:07.790> as<00:05:08.030> good

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
it back together to make it look as good

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.570 
it back together to make it look as good
but<00:05:08.540> that<00:05:09.110> being<00:05:09.320> said<00:05:09.380> it's<00:05:09.950> a<00:05:10.190> very<00:05:10.220> well

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
but that being said it's a very well

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.580 
but that being said it's a very well
flying<00:05:10.850> plane<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:11.780> now<00:05:11.900> we<00:05:11.960> can<00:05:12.200> take<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.470> look

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
flying plane so now we can take a look

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.890 
flying plane so now we can take a look
at<00:05:12.740> some<00:05:12.890> of<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.040> details<00:05:13.460> on<00:05:13.790> this<00:05:13.940> thing<00:05:14.150> the

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
at some of the details on this thing the

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.800 
at some of the details on this thing the
scale<00:05:15.170> pipes<00:05:15.820> scaled<00:05:16.820> gone<00:05:17.120> here<00:05:17.420> the<00:05:17.600> scale

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.940 
windshield I mean on a foam plane you
just<00:05:25.520> never<00:05:25.640> see<00:05:25.970> this<00:05:26.120> kind<00:05:26.330> of<00:05:26.390> detail

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
just never see this kind of detail

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.410 
just never see this kind of detail
everything<00:05:27.950> is<00:05:28.190> molded<00:05:28.520> in<00:05:28.640> even<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.030> pilot

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
everything is molded in even the pilot

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.900 
everything is molded in even the pilot
step<00:05:29.690> right<00:05:30.440> here<00:05:30.740> we<00:05:30.890> read<00:05:30.980> step<00:05:31.280> in<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.850> I

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
step right here we read step in and I

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.240 
step right here we read step in and I
like<00:05:32.090> this<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.630> they<00:05:33.110> got<00:05:33.260> the<00:05:33.380> scale<00:05:33.740> grille

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
like this the they got the scale grille

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.100 
like this the they got the scale grille
in<00:05:34.430> front<00:05:34.700> here<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:34.910> hide<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.450> electric<00:05:35.900> motor

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
in front here to hide the electric motor

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.870 
in front here to hide the electric motor
and<00:05:36.350> then<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.770> props<00:05:37.010> actually<00:05:37.400> molded<00:05:37.730> in

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
and then the props actually molded in

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.370 
and then the props actually molded in
brown<00:05:38.150> to<00:05:38.360> kind<00:05:38.510> of<00:05:38.600> mimic<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.930> wood<00:05:39.110> props

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
brown to kind of mimic the wood props

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.020 
brown to kind of mimic the wood props
that<00:05:39.560> they<00:05:39.650> used<00:05:39.860> in<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:40.130> day<00:05:40.310> it's<00:05:40.850> got<00:05:40.970> a

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
that they used in the day it's got a

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.880 
that they used in the day it's got a
scale<00:05:41.420> cut<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:41.930> it<00:05:42.050> if<00:05:42.140> you<00:05:42.260> look<00:05:42.380> at<00:05:42.530> it<00:05:42.650> it

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
scale cut to it if you look at it it

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.260 
scale cut to it if you look at it it
kind<00:05:43.100> of<00:05:43.130> looks<00:05:43.190> like<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.520> olden<00:05:43.790> day<00:05:43.910> props

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
kind of looks like the olden day props

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.660 
kind of looks like the olden day props
so<00:05:44.960> again<00:05:45.230> very<00:05:45.410> cool<00:05:45.860> to<00:05:45.980> see<00:05:46.160> that<00:05:46.340> in<00:05:46.550> the

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
so again very cool to see that in the

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:47.980 
so again very cool to see that in the
air<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:46.910> just<00:05:46.940> leads<00:05:47.330> to<00:05:47.450> a<00:05:47.570> much<00:05:47.810> more

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
air it just leads to a much more

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.260 
air it just leads to a much more
realistic<00:05:48.380> flight<00:05:48.890> in<00:05:49.610> terms<00:05:49.880> of<00:05:50.090> power

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
realistic flight in terms of power

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.270 
realistic flight in terms of power
system<00:05:50.720> I<00:05:50.810> believe<00:05:51.050> we<00:05:51.170> have<00:05:51.290> a<00:05:51.380> 480<00:05:51.980> out

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
system I believe we have a 480 out

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.920 
system I believe we have a 480 out
runner<00:05:52.550> same<00:05:52.940> motor<00:05:53.150> that's<00:05:53.390> in<00:05:53.540> the<00:05:53.660> Trojan

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930

behind me it's going to be a 20 amp ESC

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.540 
behind me it's going to be a 20 amp ESC
and<00:05:56.690> servos<00:05:57.590> are<00:05:57.770> in<00:05:57.830> there<00:05:57.980> already<00:05:58.100> again

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
and servos are in there already again

this<00:06:00.620> is<00:06:00.680> a<00:06:00.800> plug<00:06:01.040> and<00:06:01.160> play<00:06:01.220> model<00:06:02.590> and<00:06:03.590> we're

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
this is a plug and play model and we're

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.440 
this is a plug and play model and we're
gonna<00:06:03.800> have<00:06:03.950> quite<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.340> bit<00:06:04.640> of<00:06:04.670> hardware<00:06:05.210> I<00:06:05.240> can

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
gonna have quite a bit of hardware I can

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.670 
gonna have quite a bit of hardware I can
pull<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:05.750> bag<00:06:05.930> out<00:06:06.080> for<00:06:06.290> you<00:06:06.380> I'm<00:06:06.440> not<00:06:06.470> gonna

pull the bag out for you I'm not gonna

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.200 
pull the bag out for you I'm not gonna
bore<00:06:07.280> you<00:06:07.460> with<00:06:07.550> putting<00:06:07.970> this<00:06:08.030> thing

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
bore you with putting this thing

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.450 
bore you with putting this thing
together<00:06:08.360> but<00:06:08.750> you<00:06:08.870> can<00:06:08.990> see<00:06:09.230> all<00:06:09.710> the<00:06:10.070> rigging

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
together but you can see all the rigging

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.890 
together but you can see all the rigging
and<00:06:10.610> hardware<00:06:10.940> in<00:06:11.030> this<00:06:11.180> bag<00:06:11.420> to<00:06:11.690> get<00:06:11.810> the

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
and hardware in this bag to get the

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.020 
and hardware in this bag to get the
wings<00:06:12.110> on<00:06:12.350> and<00:06:12.920> we<00:06:13.070> want<00:06:13.250> essentially<00:06:13.910> when<00:06:14.000> we

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
wings on and we want essentially when we

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.950 
wings on and we want essentially when we
end<00:06:14.270> up<00:06:14.450> with<00:06:14.690> is<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:16.310> wings<00:06:16.490> would<00:06:16.670> be<00:06:16.960> like

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
end up with is the wings would be like

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.230 
end up with is the wings would be like
this<00:06:18.260> and<00:06:18.950> you<00:06:19.220> have<00:06:19.340> all<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.640> harder<00:06:19.940> between

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
this and you have all the harder between

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.580 
this and you have all the harder between
them<00:06:20.360> holding<00:06:20.600> them<00:06:20.750> rigid<00:06:21.080> to<00:06:21.200> each<00:06:21.350> other

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
them holding them rigid to each other

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.590 
them holding them rigid to each other
this<00:06:22.250> thing<00:06:22.310> is<00:06:22.550> capable<00:06:22.730> probably<00:06:23.450> I'd<00:06:23.570> say

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
this thing is capable probably I'd say

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.390 
this thing is capable probably I'd say
at<00:06:23.960> least<00:06:23.990> loops<00:06:24.620> and<00:06:24.830> rolls<00:06:24.860> if<00:06:25.220> not<00:06:25.370> just

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
at least loops and rolls if not just

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.390 
at least loops and rolls if not just
mild<00:06:25.850> aerobatic<00:06:26.680> so<00:06:27.680> all<00:06:27.800> the<00:06:27.890> hardware<00:06:28.220> kind

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
mild aerobatic so all the hardware kind

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.370 
mild aerobatic so all the hardware kind
of<00:06:28.460> holds<00:06:28.670> that<00:06:28.760> together<00:06:28.960> the<00:06:29.960> wheels<00:06:30.200> are

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
of holds that together the wheels are

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.810 
of holds that together the wheels are
very<00:06:30.410> scale<00:06:30.890> these<00:06:31.220> are<00:06:31.280> actually<00:06:31.610> quite

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
very scale these are actually quite

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.070 
very scale these are actually quite
large<00:06:31.970> wheels<00:06:32.330> so<00:06:32.510> you<00:06:32.600> would<00:06:32.750> be<00:06:32.870> able<00:06:32.930> to

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
large wheels so you would be able to

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.640 
large wheels so you would be able to
take<00:06:33.230> off<00:06:33.410> and

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
take off and

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.020 
take off and
grass<00:06:33.830> now<00:06:34.100> I'd<00:06:34.220> say<00:06:34.400> the<00:06:34.430> only<00:06:34.550> thing<00:06:34.910> that

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
grass now I'd say the only thing that

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.879 
grass now I'd say the only thing that
might<00:06:35.210> hinder<00:06:35.449> you<00:06:35.750> is<00:06:36.139> they<00:06:36.290> have<00:06:36.440> the<00:06:36.590> scale

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
might hinder you is they have the scale

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.189 
might hinder you is they have the scale
wheel<00:06:37.160> brace<00:06:37.460> on<00:06:37.699> the<00:06:37.729> bottom<00:06:38.150> I<00:06:38.360> can't<00:06:38.990> show

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
wheel brace on the bottom I can't show

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.629 
wheel brace on the bottom I can't show
you<00:06:39.259> it<00:06:39.410> here<00:06:39.620> but<00:06:39.830> they<00:06:40.070> have<00:06:40.220> a<00:06:40.250> wheel<00:06:40.430> brace

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
you it here but they have a wheel brace

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.010 
you it here but they have a wheel brace
that<00:06:40.669> goes<00:06:40.940> between<00:06:41.120> the<00:06:41.389> wheels<00:06:41.600> but<00:06:41.780> halfway

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
that goes between the wheels but halfway

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.900 
that goes between the wheels but halfway
up<00:06:42.320> if<00:06:42.710> you<00:06:42.860> have<00:06:42.979> some<00:06:43.220> tall<00:06:43.430> grass<00:06:43.460> that's

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
up if you have some tall grass that's

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.520 
up if you have some tall grass that's
probably<00:06:44.210> gonna<00:06:44.389> hit<00:06:44.570> it<00:06:44.720> slowed<00:06:45.169> you<00:06:45.229> down

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
probably gonna hit it slowed you down

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.290 
probably gonna hit it slowed you down
probably<00:06:46.009> gonna<00:06:46.130> bring<00:06:46.340> the<00:06:46.460> nose<00:06:46.610> over<00:06:46.940> you

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
probably gonna bring the nose over you

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.969 
probably gonna bring the nose over you
got<00:06:47.449> so<00:06:47.660> much<00:06:47.780> weight<00:06:48.050> from<00:06:48.199> the<00:06:48.440> wing<00:06:48.590> sitting

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
you may want to keep that in mind when

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.379 
you may want to keep that in mind when
you<00:06:54.530> choose<00:06:54.740> in<00:06:54.889> your<00:06:54.979> flying<00:06:55.220> field<00:06:55.580> oh<00:06:55.850> here

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
you choose in your flying field oh here

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:57.730 
you choose in your flying field oh here
we<00:06:56.479> go<00:06:56.600> I<00:06:56.630> can<00:06:56.900> actually<00:06:57.020> show<00:06:57.320> you<00:06:57.410> it<00:06:57.530> right

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
we go I can actually show you it right

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.360 
we go I can actually show you it right
here<00:06:59.050> so<00:07:00.050> this<00:07:00.169> is<00:07:00.229> what<00:07:00.470> I<00:07:00.500> mean<00:07:00.710> by<00:07:00.770> the<00:07:01.009> the

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
here so this is what I mean by the the

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.670 
here so this is what I mean by the the
brace<00:07:01.610> on<00:07:01.850> bottom<00:07:02.240> you<00:07:02.840> got<00:07:02.990> this<00:07:03.169> bar<00:07:03.440> running

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
brace on bottom you got this bar running

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.710 
brace on bottom you got this bar running
across<00:07:04.070> so<00:07:04.460> really<00:07:05.150> you<00:07:05.240> only<00:07:05.270> have<00:07:05.570> about

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
across so really you only have about

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.360 
across so really you only have about
half<00:07:05.840> your<00:07:06.050> reel<00:07:06.350> diameter<00:07:06.830> to<00:07:06.979> land<00:07:07.160> in<00:07:07.310> the

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
half your reel diameter to land in the

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.830 
half your reel diameter to land in the
grass<00:07:07.580> that's<00:07:08.090> a<00:07:08.240> big<00:07:08.389> deal<00:07:08.539> with<00:07:08.660> a<00:07:08.690> lot<00:07:08.810> of

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
grass that's a big deal with a lot of

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.879 
grass that's a big deal with a lot of
people<00:07:09.139> because<00:07:09.320> some<00:07:09.440> of<00:07:09.500> you<00:07:09.590> may<00:07:09.680> not<00:07:09.830> have

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:09.889 
people because some of you may not have

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:11.110 
people because some of you may not have

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
the land in the grass I got a feeling

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.689 
the land in the grass I got a feeling
that<00:07:18.020> if<00:07:18.289> we<00:07:18.410> try<00:07:18.620> this<00:07:18.650> one<00:07:18.949> on<00:07:19.070> any<00:07:19.250> kind<00:07:19.520> of
