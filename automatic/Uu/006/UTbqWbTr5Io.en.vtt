 Dutch Cypriot Second Place 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.120

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.010
 duclos-lassalle the abandons of two 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.259

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.710
 roger zabel a cliché a worn image 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.890
 not at all the hell of the north exists the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.890
 evidence 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.040
 among the first victims of these 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.150
 muddy and slippery pavement 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.560
 the Irish stéphane rock mark mey 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.840
 on the ground in a good position 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.290
 uncomfortable in the company of willems 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.540
 gomez will undoubtedly be one of 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.540
 more unlucky of this test 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.400
 good 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.380
 but if the runners fell this 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.010
 afternoon in large numbers between paris 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.920
 and roubaix 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.410
 the bikers and cameramen of the sfp have 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.410
 they also experienced some problems 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.010
 and when a motorcycle gets in the way 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.970
 run and stuck an acrobatic exercise 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:26.090
 the runners 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.040
 would have gone from this trip to the end 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.650
 from hell north six runners are going 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.180
 leave at 20 km from the arrival kuyper the 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.520
 dutch the belgian ronaldo best 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.800
 the italian moser and the two french du 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.330
 collar to salty madiot the winner lies 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.550
 in this group but who scared fell 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.260
 logically and unless you are very strong 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.390
 he should not see the two again 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.390
 French Italian and Belgian 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.900
 but that can be very strong 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.030
 today and better than that a fast 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.580
 toilet and it's not finished 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.620
 hennie kuiper is not content with 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.870
 return to the mother's room coc 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.870
 meyer and madiot he goes alone 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.620
 and yet less than 10 kilometers from 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.300
 roubaix kuyper who wants to avoid cobblestones 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.920
 will throw himself into a hole on the edge of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.320
 the road and here again we can doubt 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.270
 chances of victory dutch because 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.180
 the other four runners come back 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.090
 on him but it's once again badly 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.670
 Kuyper know that at the age of 34 years 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.550
 will win for the first time this 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.550

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.060
