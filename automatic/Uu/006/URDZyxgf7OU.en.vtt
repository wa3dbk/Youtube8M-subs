00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.760
 a piece of granulated sugar that is approximately 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:52.699
 100 grams not to waste time 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:59.809

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:02.480
 water I add water to 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.920
 sugar dissolves faster will be such 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.090
 some light caramelization that will give 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.060
 more peach flavor 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.690
 jam better cooked from more ripe 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.849
 peaches 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:25.940
 their flavor is much stronger Well all all 

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:28.429

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.190
 the remaining sugar is still 100 grams 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.509
 sugar sand 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.690

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.800
 I'm half a lemon 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.840
 that will be enough while jim 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.440
 I'm preparing to put there a whole wand 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.560
 cinnamon 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.470
 then when I lay out the jar I 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.900
 remove cinnamon will give the right spicy 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.990
 the aroma is all now I'll wait a little 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:02.260
 because they have to boil about 5 minutes 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.760
 Here is such a great aroma and what 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.160
 the correct consistency turned out my 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.190
 jam, it's time to add a little bit 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.110
 starch quite a bit i'm cooking jam 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.180
 five minutes so i need to tighten 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.540
 starch if you're not in a hurry 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.360
 want to make jam longer 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.550
 way it should 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.660
 evaporate to the correct consistency then 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.720
 there is somewhere about one dining room 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.990
 a spoonful of starch and one tablespoon 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.400
 plain water 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:42.700
 I mix it dissolves quickly and so 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:48.450
 gently stirring add starch 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:52.750
 jam here turned out the right real 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.970
 consistency jam more starch 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.690
 you can not add it because when 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.140
 cool down 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.660
 the consistency of jam will become more dense 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.630
 it's time to put my jeep in the jar 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.840
 but before that I have to remove the wand 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.840

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:32.250
 minutes placed in the jar close 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.450

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.440
