 I hope you are well 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.880
 today we find ourselves the suroÃ®t or 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.740
 on mists of pandaria etc for a small 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.179
 guide I'm doing this video finally not 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.340
 really for a guide but for a 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.660
 tip i will help you as 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.100
 hunter because of course all those 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.710
 who are watching me are hunters of 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.810
 very high quality 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 side to several thousand toulon to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.630
 reindeer but that I'm sure and so if 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.710
 you are these famous hunter you 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.340
 have to know that so with mr pandaria 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.170
 a kind of new kind of 2.2 of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.899
 family appeared the blizzard has 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.129
 set up this how to say instituted that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.870
 did that yes instituted this system with mr 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.780
 is then for those who do not know 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.340
 is that there are pets so 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.730
 specific a little to each area 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 in all these mop areas of the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.719
 pandarie so ok it's fine but 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.670
 then he must find it then it is 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.049
 not normal pets like 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 families and parents that there was I 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.920
 am not a land of fire for example you 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.450
 know he's familiar they were 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.610
 well bitchy caught because he was 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 rather earlier 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 strong very strong same name there in fact it's 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.550
 no more the same system it's 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.800
 invisible yves families that only the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.170
 hunters can see and so you 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.000
 will have to follow the tracks that make 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.320
 walking but mostly time is 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.750
 invisible follow the footsteps happened to 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.400
 get to how to tell the monsters in 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.479
 do I do not really know how to say I 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.940
 will show you I make you 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.370
 show it on video anyway so 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.570
 it 's something nice frankly 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.700
 it's really nice as me 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.330
 hunter i love you classes will be my 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.880
 favorite class 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.160
 I really hooked on 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.170
 system it's a bit hard at first when 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.790
 here do not know too much but it's going fast 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.759
 very quickly 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.759
 it's going very well very quickly, here we go 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.700
 is fast so we're going to attack from 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.050
 next I will try to find a beast 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.729
 to show a little how it works 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.800
 but I do not know if I will do it 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.220
 live because I have a connection of 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.170
 shit that's okay but just now 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.480
 I saw a crappy connection so we 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.190
 go see we'll see that good listen and there 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.670
 I am in what zone knows how that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.580
 is already called 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.280
 valette of the eternal spring val de 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.780
 the eternal by thirty years for me I 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.489
 go get a pet so the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.620
 traces of a pet of a potential 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.140
 familiar what and we find ourselves all of 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.400
 next right now that's it I have 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.019
 finally found fingerprints 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.459
 so that's how it's done 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.780
 present like that it's in take 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.549
 dusty - a small annotation 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.049
 when you pass on it when you 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.800
 see these footprints so they are not 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.020
 not 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.070
 visible all the time finally it's not about 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.020
 everywhere to have a little luck 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.900
 when you see these footprints 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.360
 must follow the following then 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.600
 the logic would be that we follow them so 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.690
 in the sense that it indicates 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.730
 but there is a little bug apparently this 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.770
 which makes you have to follow meaning 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.800
 inverse so if you actually think 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.480
 that they come to say is 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.380
 that they go out there in fact eh 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.980
 Well no it will be simply 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.510
 opposite will follow from behind 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.300
 so it's a little con but good 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.060
 it's a bug like that it happens it will be 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.190
 soon to be at the patch is surely 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.110
 so we're going to pick up 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.220
 if we find a footprint 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.850
 freshly game for as much for me one 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.520
 borrows freshly made tape 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.890
 will have just launched a flare 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.890
 to see the famous the famous woman says 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.560
 no it's hard enough to find 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.540
 to seek must have luck there y 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.980
 has one ok so here I took some 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.010
 random monsters it's really not 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.160
 I could have gone to train another one 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.080
 other fart in another area 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.090
 here is for example I cut myself off from this 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.650
 world laval lava comes 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.860
 to appear what makes that that's the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.530
 monster was so close so that was 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.739
 of course that logic saw you 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.690
 see when a monster walks they 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.780
 make a small footprint like that to 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.370
 look at the person does not see apart - 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.459
 here is a footprint like that it wants 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.780
 to say that the monster has it so you can 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.520
 launch your flares in 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.250
 what then what to do is 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.690
 say and pose a hunter's mark 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.840
 unsold his sister will allow you so 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.660
 to keep the visibility 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.610
 so we are called julie de labex on 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.690
 has just fuck you 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:46.400
 scattered not deny the mess of god and 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.870
 he asked me here we are so here I am 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.920
 attack them and as a tale so 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.090
 now what you have to do 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.660
 it's just to capture him 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.690
 there are several things you can it's 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.140
 not you can go for example dropped 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.120
 a place piaget who of course did not 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.620
 market with my crappy connection this is 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.180
 awesome 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.130
 good ben otherwise there is really no big 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.400
 thing to do finally yes for these beasts 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.890
 there for the farts the ekiden because 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.830
 that in fact there are four kinds in 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.360
 teeth in this area in the two val 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.370
 spikes of eternal spring there are some 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.440
 400 but that's not the same I know that 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.690
 I will do I will redirect you 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.610
 to a guide the twin granny guide who 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.650
 was created by melody 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.090
 it's a guide you just have to type 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.590
 on google families is rare in 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.070
 pandarie and you will fall direct on the 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.480
 manning guide that will allow you 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.010
 to know the place of all the to 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.290
 families and and all families is 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.190
 possible that they are complaints is for 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.350
 the moment in mists of pandaria so that 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.000
 miss my throat as me so 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.160
 so here we would have really 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.680
 access to all and it will be much more 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.000
 convenient 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.950
 so what am I going to do as I see 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:02.780
 I already have the head was giving it to 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:06.320
 so sow hazard wants to say how 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.660
 he did not know I'm going to him 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.430
 to say that maybe he will forget so 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.080
 it's really easy as you can 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.870
 see moment there I was lucky I 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.360
 found fairly quickly but but the 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.400
 tracks are still pretty hard 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.990
 in some areas the footprints 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.680
 are very rare 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.889
 how to say 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.630
 to are very hard to find actually 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.190
 so it's really something 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.600
 complicated but with a little 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.169
 drive you will get there at 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.120
 to finish in the nose is soft and he 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.350
 do not go club to listen too bad I 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.120
 leaves revelers highly small auspices 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.600
 hasta luego boycott everyone I 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.340
 will leave you 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.600
 I hope this video will have you more 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.280
 that will have helped you especially if you have 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.039
 need to be feel free to write to me 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.479
 in comments or your trains we 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:53.009
 was sending a private message or whatever
