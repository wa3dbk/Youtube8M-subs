00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:16.070
 the son of a very rich man fell in love 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.599
 of one of the poorest girls in the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.369
 town and he said I want to marry you 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.430
 but she said I can not 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:29.119
 marry you because you can not marry 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.360
 with me because I promised my dad 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.989
 that I was going to marry a baker and 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.450
 as you promised that to your dad is that 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.990
 I'm going to explain my dad was a baker 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.160
 and before he died he taught me the trade 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:51.030
 of making bread and he made me an oven and I 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.120
 gave away some cans and told me daughter marry 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.210
 with a baker so they can together 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.520
 make the bread so they can together 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.600
 get ahead 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.940
 and you are not a baker and I promised you 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.240
 my dad who married me but with a 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.170
 baker and the young man told him but I 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 you allow to come in the afternoon 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.020
 accompany you when you are making bread 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.830
 let me come to light the oven 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.800
 to help you knead the dough to 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.100
 help you fill the cans you can 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.369
 teach the trade to me she told her is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.479
 well and he for a long time every 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.950
 afternoon I shared work with that 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.670
 young woman with time the young woman married 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.759
 him and married him not because he was rich 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.300
 nor because he was a baker because in the end 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.210
 he could make bread 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.770
 he got married 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.320
 because he had shown her that he loved her 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.250
 being a very rich man he learned a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:09.320
 simple job to show you love 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:13.610
 jesus being god became man and wanted 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.480
 live your life with the men way 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.900
 as a man I work as a man I love as 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.380
 man to show us men the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.980
 immense love that God has for us 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.180
 we correspond to that love 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.830
 thanking Jesus that he has done 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.450
 one of ours of the human race 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.580
 and we receive it in our heart that is 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.010
 the message of Christmas 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.600
 the Jesus child born in Bethlehem 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.990
 means house of bread wine for 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.400
 eat our bread to share it 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:59.810
 he wanted to be in a bread to be our 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.150
 fellow who shares with me the bread 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.239
 that example of Jesus should take us 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.270
 also to us to shorten distances 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.750
 to approach others to break 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.810
 barriers to tell the other I'm interested 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.660
 what he does is value who you are and what 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.040
 is what you do I want to share with you 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.810
 Christmas at the approach party 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.360
 at the party of the taking the initiative 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.870
 Take a step to meet the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.470
 other than this Christmas we 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.540
 we can also be close companions 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.400
 friends like our friend Jesus did 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.180
 and that Jesus who was born in Nativity 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.970
 they are going to be in our heart in our 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.780
 family and in our villages too 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.189
 May the Lord bless you and have a 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.189
 Merry Christmas
