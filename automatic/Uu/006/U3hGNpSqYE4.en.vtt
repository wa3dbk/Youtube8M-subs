00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:38.620

 I have a bit of the same color taste in my eyes 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.850
 Back to the palette and blending in bright colors 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:22.240

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.759

 As for the eyeline I tried to make a little eyes 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:24.580
 If you do, it will be easy to fall down, so be careful about that side 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:30.690
