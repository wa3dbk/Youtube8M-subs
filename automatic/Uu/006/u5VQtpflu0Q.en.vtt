of<00:02:05.860> this<00:02:06.070> event<00:02:06.250> and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
of this event and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.300 
of this event and
cooler<00:02:08.050> still<00:02:10.349> cooler<00:02:11.349> still<00:02:11.739> there<00:02:11.980> always

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
cooler still cooler still there always

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.280

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
one of the favorites but I think that

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.869 
one of the favorites but I think that
science<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:15.340> still<00:02:16.050> one<00:02:17.050> step<00:02:17.200> up<00:02:17.640> let's<00:02:18.640> play

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
science is still one step up let's play

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.550 
science is still one step up let's play
a<00:02:18.910> predictions<00:02:19.540> game<00:02:19.780> because<00:02:20.140> you're<00:02:20.349> out

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
a predictions game because you're out

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.949 
a predictions game because you're out
already<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:22.239> easily<00:02:22.390> predict<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
already so you can easily predict the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.900 
already so you can easily predict the
matches<00:02:23.410> we're<00:02:23.680> going<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:23.860> have<00:02:24.069> our<00:02:24.430> Vic<00:02:24.700> and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
matches we're going to have our Vic and

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.640 
matches we're going to have our Vic and
fast<00:02:25.209> what<00:02:25.510> should<00:02:25.870> we<00:02:25.989> expect<00:02:26.019> from<00:02:26.379> that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
fast what should we expect from that

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.699 
fast what should we expect from that
much<00:02:27.090> its<00:02:28.090> best<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.480> five<00:02:28.540> rights<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:31.709> think

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
much its best of five rights I think

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.020 
much its best of five rights I think
that<00:02:32.860> fast<00:02:33.730> could<00:02:33.940> take<00:02:34.120> take<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:36.640> will<00:02:36.819> take

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
that fast could take take it will take

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.440 
that fast could take take it will take
hectic<00:02:38.670> maybe<00:02:39.670> maybe<00:02:40.360> also<00:02:40.900> t4<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.340> I've<00:02:43.180> just

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
hectic maybe maybe also t4 but I've just

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.309 
hectic maybe maybe also t4 but I've just
gonna<00:02:43.660> win<00:02:43.959> i<00:02:45.209> think<00:02:46.209> is<00:02:46.480> gonna<00:02:46.630> win<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:47.049> it's<00:02:47.200> a

match<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.690> what<00:02:55.930> about<00:02:56.049> cooler<00:02:56.440> versus<00:02:56.799> kills

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
match so what about cooler versus kills

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.199 
match so what about cooler versus kills
him<00:02:58.410> mmm<00:02:59.410> yesterday<00:03:00.340> went<00:03:00.489> up<00:03:00.579> like<00:03:00.700> hills<00:03:00.970> and

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
him mmm yesterday went up like hills and

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.000 
him mmm yesterday went up like hills and
his<00:03:01.480> aim<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:04.450> was<00:03:04.720> good<00:03:05.049> but<00:03:05.349> not<00:03:05.410> really<00:03:05.950> in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
his aim it was good but not really in

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.819 
his aim it was good but not really in
top<00:03:06.220> shape<00:03:06.519> but<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.450> played<00:03:07.780> him<00:03:07.900> today<00:03:08.110> in<00:03:08.680> a

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
top shape but I played him today in a

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.039 
top shape but I played him today in a
few<00:03:09.040> prank<00:03:09.519> games<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.269> was<00:03:10.540> top-notch

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
few prank games and it was top-notch

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:18.920 
few prank games and it was top-notch
really<00:03:11.579> yeah<00:03:12.579> like<00:03:12.870> 55<00:03:13.870> person<00:03:14.260> trail<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.859> I

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.370 

think<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:21.030> since<00:03:22.030> he<00:03:22.150> already<00:03:22.180> qualify<00:03:23.139> for

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
think that since he already qualify for

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.229 
think that since he already qualify for
World<00:03:23.560> Finals<00:03:24.040> he<00:03:24.160> didn't<00:03:24.400> really<00:03:24.549> prepare<00:03:25.859> I

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
World Finals he didn't really prepare I

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.300 
World Finals he didn't really prepare I
say<00:03:28.239> us<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.780> gonna<00:03:29.019> do<00:03:29.410> for<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> World<00:03:29.920> Finals

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
say us is gonna do for a World Finals

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.809 
say us is gonna do for a World Finals

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
but he still really in a good shape but

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.089 
but he still really in a good shape but
i<00:03:33.880> think<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.510> i<00:03:34.840> was<00:03:35.440> still<00:03:35.859> gonna<00:03:36.099> win<00:03:38.099> who

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
i think that i was still gonna win who

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.050 
i think that i was still gonna win who
did<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.430> say<00:03:39.609> is<00:03:39.669> gonna<00:03:39.790> win<00:03:40.530> who<00:03:41.530> did<00:03:41.680> he<00:03:41.709> play

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
did you say is gonna win who did he play

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.229 
did you say is gonna win who did he play
it's<00:03:43.079> cooler<00:03:44.079> killzone<00:03:44.590> okay<00:03:44.829> right<00:03:45.239> that's

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
it's cooler killzone okay right that's

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.909 
it's cooler killzone okay right that's
why<00:03:46.389> I<00:03:46.419> was<00:03:46.599> like<00:03:46.859> okay<00:03:47.859> cool<00:03:48.669> is<00:03:48.819> gonna<00:03:49.000> win

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
why I was like okay cool is gonna win

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.020 
why I was like okay cool is gonna win
cool<00:03:50.919> is<00:03:51.069> gonna<00:03:51.220> win<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.730> semis<00:03:54.000> cipher<00:03:55.000> is

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
cool is gonna win in the semis cipher is

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.000 
cool is gonna win in the semis cipher is
in<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.389> semi<00:03:55.630> already<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.290> strengths<00:03:56.709> is<00:03:56.859> in

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
in the semi already and strengths is in

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.309 
in the semi already and strengths is in
the<00:03:57.099> semi<00:03:57.340> already<00:03:59.040> so<00:04:00.040> what<00:04:00.280> happens

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
the semi already so what happens

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.569 
the semi already so what happens
ciphering<00:04:02.319> strikes<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.769> not<00:04:03.010> gonna<00:04:03.280> play<00:04:03.430> each

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
ciphering strikes is not gonna play each

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.849 
ciphering strikes is not gonna play each
other<00:04:03.730> right<00:04:04.290> they<00:04:05.290> are<00:04:05.349> not<00:04:05.470> going<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.709> place

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
other right they are not going to place

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.449 
other right they are not going to place
so<00:04:06.900> what's<00:04:07.900> gonna<00:04:08.109> happen<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.889> cipher<00:04:09.430> is

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
so what's gonna happen is that cipher is

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.880 
so what's gonna happen is that cipher is
gonna<00:04:10.150> play

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
gonna play

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.750 
gonna play
avek<00:04:12.850> or<00:04:13.830> fast<00:04:14.830> and<00:04:17.070> strength<00:04:18.070> is<00:04:18.250> gonna<00:04:18.579> play

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
avek or fast and strength is gonna play

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.750 
avek or fast and strength is gonna play
cooler<00:04:19.720> or<00:04:19.870> Kilton<00:04:22.320> yes<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.710> fanatic<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.700> in
