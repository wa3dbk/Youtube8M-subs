00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
heat silk and in that thread I try to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.860 
heat silk and in that thread I try to
improve<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.650> I<00:00:38.280> guess<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.420> heat<00:00:39.570> silk

resistance<00:00:40.769> in<00:00:41.040> an<00:00:41.910> EJ<00:00:42.180> 25<00:00:42.600> engine<00:00:43.910> yeah<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> saw

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
resistance in an EJ 25 engine yeah I saw

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.540 
resistance in an EJ 25 engine yeah I saw
that<00:00:45.269> first<00:00:45.989> thing<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.230> did<00:00:46.290> was<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.860> insulate

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that first thing I did was to insulate

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.100 
that first thing I did was to insulate
this<00:00:47.790> guy<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.210> here<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> first

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
this guy right here this is the first

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
this guy right here this is the first
place<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.350> air<00:00:49.710> makes<00:00:49.920> contact<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.790> before

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
place that air makes contact with before

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.410 
place that air makes contact with before
entering<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> engine<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.699> I'm<00:00:53.699> gonna<00:00:53.850> try<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
entering the engine so I'm gonna try to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.280 
entering the engine so I'm gonna try to
pop<00:00:54.720> this<00:00:54.870> off<00:00:55.140> already<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> temp<00:00:56.129> removed

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
pop this off already got a temp removed

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.770 
pop this off already got a temp removed
to<00:00:58.290> show<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> guys<00:00:59.089> what<00:01:00.089> I've<00:01:00.269> done<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.659> this

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to show you guys what I've done to this

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.640 
to show you guys what I've done to this
in<00:01:01.080> order<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.040> air<00:01:02.400> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.089> cooler<00:01:03.650> entering

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
in order for air to be cooler entering

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
in order for air to be cooler entering
the<00:01:04.710> engine<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> wrapped<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.150> IDE

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the engine so I wrapped it with this IDE

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.180 
the engine so I wrapped it with this IDE
I<00:01:07.490> design<00:01:08.490> engineering<00:01:09.950> forget<00:01:10.950> what<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
I design engineering forget what the I

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.730 
I design engineering forget what the I
stand<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:11.790> Saudi<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.320> some<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> heat

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
stand for but Saudi I some kind of heat

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.190 
stand for but Saudi I some kind of heat
shield<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.159> sound<00:01:14.670> insulation<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.960> made<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
shield or sound insulation it's made of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.450 
shield or sound insulation it's made of
aluminum<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.680> there's<00:01:16.860> some<00:01:16.979> kind<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
aluminum and there's some kind of a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.289 
aluminum and there's some kind of a
fiber<00:01:17.939> packing<00:01:18.689> behind<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.030> it's<00:01:21.030> also

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
fiber packing behind it and it's also

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
fiber packing behind it and it's also
adhesive<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.350> forms<00:01:22.680> well<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.250> whatever

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
adhesive and it forms well to whatever

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.959 
adhesive and it forms well to whatever
surface<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.150> put<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:26.220> between<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
surface you put it on and in between I

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.139 
surface you put it on and in between I
put<00:01:27.689> some<00:01:27.899> high<00:01:28.049> temp<00:01:28.320> silicone<00:01:28.520> sealant<00:01:29.520> in

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
put some high temp silicone sealant in

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.880 
put some high temp silicone sealant in
here<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.869> closes<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.140> gaps<00:01:34.380> makes<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:34.770> look

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
here so it closes the gaps makes it look

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.200 
here so it closes the gaps makes it look
nice<00:01:35.039> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> looks<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.179> a<00:01:36.509> aircraft<00:01:38.210> so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
nice kind of looks like a aircraft so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.660 
nice kind of looks like a aircraft so
yeah<00:01:39.960> that's<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:43.049> helps

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
yeah that's that so this actually helps

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.440 
yeah that's that so this actually helps
coming<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.570> air<00:01:45.719> coming<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:47.149> with<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.179> cool

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
coming in with air coming in with a cool

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
coming in with air coming in with a cool
surface<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.109> I<00:01:49.170> touched<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> before<00:01:49.950> prior<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
surface so I touched it before prior to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.370 
surface so I touched it before prior to
this<00:01:50.999> and<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.539> really<00:01:51.869> hot<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.520> adding<00:01:53.520> this

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
this and it's really hot so adding this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.020 
this and it's really hot so adding this
keeps<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.469> heat<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
keeps the heat here and not on the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.319 
keeps the heat here and not on the
plastic<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:58.289> here<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:59.039> cool<00:01:59.329> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
plastic and all here is really cool and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.669 
plastic and all here is really cool and
then<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:01.579> have<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.729> cob<00:02:03.030> SF<00:02:03.479> air<00:02:03.630> box<00:02:03.840> alright

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
then I have this cob SF air box alright

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.090 
then I have this cob SF air box alright
so<00:02:04.890> there's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.340> lot<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.409> arguments<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.619> which

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
so there's a lot of arguments of which

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.219 
so there's a lot of arguments of which
which<00:02:08.550> intake<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:09.060> better<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.899> know<00:02:09.990> because

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
which intake is better you know because

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.860 
which intake is better you know because
some<00:02:10.470> guys<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.950> AE<00:02:11.400> m<00:02:11.670> intakes<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.270> cob<00:02:12.540> I

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
some guys have AE m intakes and cob I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.400 
some guys have AE m intakes and cob I
mean<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:14.100> doesn't<00:02:14.370> matter<00:02:14.720> they<00:02:15.720> both<00:02:15.960> perform

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
mean it doesn't matter they both perform

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.040 
mean it doesn't matter they both perform
within<00:02:16.770> like<00:02:17.069> maybe<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.760> couple<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.600> horsepower

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
within like maybe a couple of horsepower

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.410 
within like maybe a couple of horsepower
difference<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:20.880> chose<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.240> because

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
difference so I just chose this because

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.960 
difference so I just chose this because
it<00:02:21.840> was<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.990> first<00:02:22.080> one<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.740> work<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.580> cobs

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
it was the first one to work with cobs

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.460 
it was the first one to work with cobs
off-the-shelf<00:02:24.810> maps<00:02:25.080> or<00:02:25.860> which<00:02:26.490> now<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
off-the-shelf maps or which now I have a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.400 
off-the-shelf maps or which now I have a
pro<00:02:28.470> tune<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.240> doesn't<00:02:30.510> matter<00:02:30.660> not<00:02:31.290> sure

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
pro tune so it doesn't matter not sure

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.230 
pro tune so it doesn't matter not sure
if<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.530> guys<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:32.280> there's<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.610> red

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
if you guys can see but there's a red

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.210 
if you guys can see but there's a red
filter<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.660> there

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
filter in there

a<00:04:41.030> PTP<00:04:41.780> turbo<00:04:42.470> blanket<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:44.419> lava<00:04:44.660> version

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
a PTP turbo blanket the lava version

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.050 
a PTP turbo blanket the lava version
and<00:04:45.900> then<00:04:46.050> put<00:04:46.889> on<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.040> parent<00:04:47.550> heat<00:04:47.760> shield

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
and then put on a parent heat shield

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.060 
and then put on a parent heat shield
because<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.930> saw<00:04:49.080> one<00:04:49.410> that<00:04:50.540> fits<00:04:51.540> down<00:04:51.720> here

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
because I saw one that fits down here

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.640 
because I saw one that fits down here
and<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.190> gotta<00:04:53.340> clean<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.580> thing<00:04:54.230> so<00:04:55.230> that<00:04:55.500> way

and I gotta clean that thing so that way

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.470 
and I gotta clean that thing so that way
the<00:04:55.830> top<00:04:56.280> Mountain<00:04:56.550> cool<00:04:56.730> is<00:04:56.790> not<00:04:56.910> as<00:04:57.060> hot<00:04:57.270> I

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
the top Mountain cool is not as hot I

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.420 
the top Mountain cool is not as hot I
mean<00:04:57.810> it<00:04:57.990> does<00:04:58.139> get<00:04:58.320> hot<00:04:58.530> when<00:04:58.980> you're<00:04:59.070> sitting

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
mean it does get hot when you're sitting

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.670 
mean it does get hot when you're sitting
I<00:04:59.610> mean<00:04:59.790> whenever<00:05:00.120> you're<00:05:00.300> sitting<00:05:00.900> with<00:05:01.500> this

top mount setup anytime you'll you'll
get<00:05:05.340> eat<00:05:05.490> soap<00:05:05.700> I<00:05:06.020> mean<00:05:07.020> this<00:05:07.260> this<00:05:07.680> engine<00:05:07.980> is

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
get eat soap I mean this this engine is

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.320 
get eat soap I mean this this engine is
known<00:05:08.220> for<00:05:08.370> heat<00:05:08.520> soak<00:05:08.700> like<00:05:08.880> really<00:05:09.150> bad

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
known for heat soak like really bad

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.590 
known for heat soak like really bad
nothing<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.169> is<00:05:10.350> I<00:05:10.380> wrap<00:05:10.980> this<00:05:11.360> silicone<00:05:12.360> hose

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
nothing to is I wrap this silicone hose

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.570 
nothing to is I wrap this silicone hose
with<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.200> I<00:05:13.230> brush<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:13.950> shield<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:14.370> know<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
with the I brush the shield you know the

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.430 
with the I brush the shield you know the
stuff<00:05:14.760> they<00:05:14.790> use<00:05:15.060> for<00:05:15.360> starters<00:05:15.870> that's<00:05:16.320> the

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
stuff they use for starters that's the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.129 
stuff they use for starters that's the
one<00:05:16.620> you<00:05:17.430> can<00:05:17.580> cut<00:05:17.730> it<00:05:17.820> to<00:05:17.850> shape<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.360> I<00:05:18.900> just

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
one you can cut it to shape and I just

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.150 
one you can cut it to shape and I just
stapled<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.669> to<00:05:20.669> seem<00:05:21.260> very<00:05:22.260> go<00:05:22.560> see<00:05:22.800> see<00:05:23.070> the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
stapled it to seem very go see see the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.550 
stapled it to seem very go see see the
multiple<00:05:23.490> seams<00:05:23.700> yeah<00:05:24.150> velcro<00:05:24.600> so<00:05:25.290> it's<00:05:25.410> easy

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
multiple seams yeah velcro so it's easy

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.370 
multiple seams yeah velcro so it's easy
to<00:05:25.710> take<00:05:25.889> off<00:05:26.130> and<00:05:26.370> then<00:05:27.240> this<00:05:27.600> this<00:05:28.260> is

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
to take off and then this this is

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.650 
to take off and then this this is
terrible<00:05:28.710> design<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.070> this<00:05:29.669> coolant<00:05:30.510> overflow

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
terrible design to this coolant overflow

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.480 
terrible design to this coolant overflow
hoses<00:05:31.320> they<00:05:31.680> just<00:05:31.889> sit<00:05:32.070> right<00:05:32.100> over<00:05:32.250> the

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
hoses they just sit right over the

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.570 
hoses they just sit right over the
intake<00:05:32.729> how's<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:33.330> so<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.380> on<00:05:34.770> top<00:05:35.040> of<00:05:35.160> this<00:05:35.280> I

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
intake how's that so I on top of this I

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.240 
intake how's that so I on top of this I
added<00:05:36.360> some<00:05:36.720> holes<00:05:36.930> here<00:05:37.290> to<00:05:37.740> insulate<00:05:38.160> it

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
added some holes here to insulate it

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.219 
added some holes here to insulate it
more<00:05:38.460> so<00:05:39.300> that<00:05:39.419> way<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:39.630> doesn't<00:05:39.960> get<00:05:40.050> hot

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
more so that way that doesn't get hot

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.020 
more so that way that doesn't get hot
and<00:05:40.410> it<00:05:40.800> kind<00:05:41.100> of<00:05:41.130> works<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.430> little<00:05:41.520> bit<00:05:41.700> I<00:05:41.880> mean

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
and it kind of works a little bit I mean

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.510 
and it kind of works a little bit I mean
this<00:05:42.389> was<00:05:42.600> this<00:05:42.900> wasn't<00:05:43.080> how<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.350> do<00:05:43.530> CB<00:05:43.770> but<00:05:43.979> it

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
this was this wasn't how to do CB but it

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.670 
this was this wasn't how to do CB but it
still<00:05:44.790> goes<00:05:44.940> under<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.450> hot<00:05:45.660> intake<00:05:46.139> manifold

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
still goes under the hot intake manifold

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.640 
still goes under the hot intake manifold
and<00:05:46.860> then<00:05:47.700> goes<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.300> scorching<00:05:48.630> turbo<00:05:48.960> but

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
and then goes to the scorching turbo but

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.650 
and then goes to the scorching turbo but
you<00:05:50.250> know<00:05:50.340> this<00:05:50.520> it's<00:05:50.729> little<00:05:51.210> things<00:05:51.240> that

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
you know this it's little things that

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.680 
you know this it's little things that
kind<00:05:51.960> of<00:05:51.990> help<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.260> little<00:05:52.530> bit<00:05:53.270> you<00:05:54.270> know<00:05:54.360> it

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
kind of help a little bit you know it

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.450 
kind of help a little bit you know it
doesn't<00:05:54.900> help<00:05:55.169> much<00:05:55.500> when<00:05:55.860> it's<00:05:56.010> sitting<00:05:56.190> but

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
doesn't help much when it's sitting but

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.580 
doesn't help much when it's sitting but
once<00:05:56.910> you<00:05:56.970> start<00:05:57.180> getting<00:05:57.300> moving<00:05:57.630> good<00:05:58.350> it'll

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
once you start getting moving good it'll

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.120 
once you start getting moving good it'll
get<00:05:58.710> better

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
get better

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.640 
get better
and<00:05:59.880> of<00:06:00.000> course<00:06:00.210> you<00:06:00.479> can<00:06:00.600> always<00:06:00.750> change<00:06:01.530> the

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
and of course you can always change the

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.200 
and of course you can always change the
intercooler<00:06:01.919> but<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.490> stock<00:06:02.700> one<00:06:02.850> is<00:06:02.970> pretty

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
intercooler but the stock one is pretty

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.350 
intercooler but the stock one is pretty
sufficient<00:06:03.720> up<00:06:04.590> until<00:06:04.979> you<00:06:05.520> know<00:06:05.580> X<00:06:06.060> amount<00:06:06.150> of

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
sufficient up until you know X amount of

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.529 
sufficient up until you know X amount of
horsepower<00:06:07.340> other<00:06:08.340> than<00:06:08.520> that<00:06:08.669> you<00:06:09.240> guys<00:06:09.330> got

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
horsepower other than that you guys got

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.330 
horsepower other than that you guys got
any<00:06:09.660> ideas

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
any ideas

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.529 
any ideas
speaking<00:06:11.340> of<00:06:11.430> ideas<00:06:11.789> I<00:06:12.030> was<00:06:12.150> supposed<00:06:12.330> to<00:06:12.360> add

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
speaking of ideas I was supposed to add

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.279 
speaking of ideas I was supposed to add
some<00:06:12.870> kind<00:06:13.080> of<00:06:13.140> active<00:06:13.530> cooling<00:06:13.740> fan<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.490> help

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
some kind of active cooling fan to help

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.680 
some kind of active cooling fan to help
cool<00:06:16.289> the<00:06:16.350> filter<00:06:16.770> and<00:06:17.039> MAF<00:06:17.430> housing<00:06:17.690> while

right here all these holes cut open
there's<00:06:27.270> going<00:06:27.419> to<00:06:27.479> be<00:06:27.539> a<00:06:27.600> duct<00:06:27.810> that<00:06:27.990> goes<00:06:28.169> up

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
there's going to be a duct that goes up

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.920 
there's going to be a duct that goes up
I'm<00:06:28.860> have<00:06:29.070> to<00:06:29.190> make<00:06:29.340> a<00:06:29.370> bottom<00:06:30.360> panel<00:06:30.600> for<00:06:30.870> this

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930
