00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:07.670
 Hello, how are you? I'm going to show you the 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.180
 simple algebraic factorization 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.820
 ah 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.710
 our polynomial in this case is x 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.830
 square plus 4 x 4 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.790
 what we can do in this case is going to 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.690
 be using the least common multiple 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.300
 algebraic 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.119
 which is not very commonly used but 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.220
 it's easy 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.220
 we write the polynomial to the left side 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:40.060
 and we start to reduce as 4 and 4 have 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:44.690
 half we scored 2 half of 4 is 2 and the 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.699
 half of 4 is 2 we copy the X's 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.109
 As everyone is positive we do not make ourselves 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.789
 no problem 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:54.360
 then as everyone still continues 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:58.770
 having half we put 2 here then 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 1 and 1 we continue copying the x now as 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.370
 these can no longer be reduced 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.190
 we note x here for x 2 is x as 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.740
 this has no exponent stays at 0 and 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.000
 is x we ​​continue to reduce the xy 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.580
 another x more then we end up with this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.500
 now so that you get the result 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.270
 correct because this is only the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.380
 realization of the terms and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.180
 factors here we have two factors 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.770
 we have to first separate the numbers 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:37.370
 which are common 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:40.340
 like in this case x and x2 and 2 then 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.200
 we write them down as the two have 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.990
 exponent two we only write them down in a 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.300
 parentheses as all the numbers are 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.400
 positive we only write it in positive 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.520
 then x + 2 squared now as 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.250
 we realize certain correct 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.650
 doing this exercise because x by 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.680
 X 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.680
 x square 2 x 2 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:15.709
 do not forgive then we wrote down two 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:23.040
 equal terms for the exponent that is 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:25.830
 xx 22 as everything is positive positive if 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.299
 is that we had less more is intercalated 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.299
 more less plus less 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:44.320
 and this is what we have to do 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:49.550
 xxxx square xx 226 plus 2 x 2 xx 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:52.850
 2x and 2 x 24 as these two are factor 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.710
 common we simplify them in 1 then 4 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:01.670
 x 4 x 2 this is the result that 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.030
 agrees with the root that's the way 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.030
 of the
