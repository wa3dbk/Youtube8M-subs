00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.340
 it's already dark 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.270
 it was almost clean 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.890
 the person has changed dramatically 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.890
 what is it 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.309
 How to pass not drive 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.539
 repeat 43 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.040
 on saturday still stay tough 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.150
 criteria moto 6 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.350
 and still I had no documents 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.640
 injured official said 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.950
 When you fly to study, what's the problem? 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.450
 eight people died 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.450
 bandits 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.920
 the beginning was a plan to be 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.230
 administrative protocol 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.000
 in the area of 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.530
 there was a case when 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.810
 release is 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.660
 in the same way 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.750
 you have her 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.400
 apple with problem banks 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.330
 no matter what 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.880
 need not as much to talk about 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.290
 administrative code 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.850
 at 19 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.590
 what article should show 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.880
 you can be the first 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.690
 quite understandable since 20 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.540
 and one suffered pack in agitation 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.230
 no and then hours 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.910
 almost 30 years 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.190
 but here we look at the protocols 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.600
 accounting was of course possible 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510
 because this year is not 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.060
 today in the smolny mayor of vadim 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.450
 Abdrashitova I would like to us 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.820
 well, people 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.370
 but if it is arranged this institute is second 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.090
 my address and but I think that 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.229
 aggressive rhetoric questions secretary 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.790
 no one wanted to show the British 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.300
 the abode was fear 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.390
 administrative penalty 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.450
 in opinion that the commission is very sharp 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.060
 l 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.240
 number at least years on ruling on 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.700
 similar problems Spartak 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 by such an alloy 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.709
 he said this in response to a question 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.519
 while 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.519
 during the passage 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.749
 then I think that the adoption of the law 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.639
 but if of course finam 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.069
 so fly and show 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.919
 and here are the words 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.029
 this question 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.029
 in answer to this question a in the second about the first 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.210
 until the new year it has become very difficult 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.210
 for the second stage will receive 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.199
 in fact it is very difficult
