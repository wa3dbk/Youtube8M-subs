product is very important if it's too

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.940 
product is very important if it's too
watery<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.960> won't<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.350> remove<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
watery then it won't really remove the

watery then it won't really remove the
hair<00:02:02.159> well<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.210> too<00:02:03.479> thick<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.229> could

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
hair well and if it's too thick it could

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.709 
hair well and if it's too thick it could
irritate<00:02:04.920> your<00:02:05.189> skin<00:02:05.460> plus<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.180> harder<00:02:06.540> to

inside and it's for shaking up powder
drinks<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.269> works<00:02:36.569> really<00:02:36.930> great<00:02:37.230> for<00:02:37.379> this<00:02:37.950> I

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
drinks it works really great for this I

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.720 
drinks it works really great for this I
just<00:02:38.250> use<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:39.209> for<00:02:40.170> my<00:02:40.530> shading<00:02:41.129> powder<00:02:41.370> at

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
just use this for my shading powder at

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.000 
just use this for my shading powder at
all<00:02:41.849> times<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.540> do<00:02:42.599> not<00:02:42.870> use<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.439> drink<00:02:43.829> out

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
all times I do not use it to drink out

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.300 
all times I do not use it to drink out
of<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.720> way<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.109> do<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.769> technique

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
of so the way that I do this technique

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.550 
of so the way that I do this technique
is<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:47.609> put<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> little<00:02:48.269> bit<00:02:48.569> of<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> powder<00:02:49.049> into

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
is I put a little bit of the powder into

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.009 
is I put a little bit of the powder into
the<00:02:50.010> shaker<00:02:50.220> bottle<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:51.659> I<00:02:51.690> add<00:02:51.989> my

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
the shaker bottle and then I add my

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.190 
the shaker bottle and then I add my
water<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.829> put<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.700> silver<00:02:54.480> ball<00:02:54.720> back<00:02:54.930> in

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
water and put the silver ball back in

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.619 
water and put the silver ball back in
and<00:02:55.409> when<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.530> shake<00:02:55.859> it<00:02:56.010> up<00:02:56.159> it<00:02:56.700> does<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.329> so

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
and when I shake it up it does it so

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.360 
and when I shake it up it does it so
quick<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.349> don't<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.680> stir<00:02:58.980> stir<00:02:59.340> stir

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
quick so I don't have to stir stir stir

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.490 
quick so I don't have to stir stir stir
with<00:02:59.939> a<00:02:59.970> spoon<00:03:00.299> which<00:03:00.599> can<00:03:00.810> take<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> really

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
with a spoon which can take a really

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.879 
with a spoon which can take a really
long<00:03:01.530> time<00:03:01.849> so<00:03:02.849> this<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.889> time-saving

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
long time so this is a time-saving

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:17.509 
long time so this is a time-saving
method<00:03:05.159> that<00:03:05.939> I<00:03:05.970> really<00:03:06.540> enjoy<00:03:13.609> I<00:03:16.340> just<00:03:17.340> want

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
method that I really enjoy I just want

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.770 
method that I really enjoy I just want
to<00:03:17.579> tell<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.790> though<00:03:18.030> be<00:03:18.269> sure<00:03:18.299> that<00:03:18.690> you

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
to tell you though be sure that you

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.199 
to tell you though be sure that you
start<00:03:19.109> off<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> very<00:03:19.769> small<00:03:20.519> amount<00:03:21.060> of

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
start off with a very small amount of

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.689 
start off with a very small amount of
water<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.750> always<00:03:21.989> add<00:03:22.379> more<00:03:22.410> because<00:03:23.400> if

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
water you can always add more because if

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.970 
water you can always add more because if
you<00:03:23.819> add<00:03:24.000> too<00:03:24.030> much<00:03:24.359> water<00:03:24.680> before<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.829> know

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
you add too much water before you know

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.539 
you add too much water before you know
it<00:03:26.129> will<00:03:26.340> become<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:27.230> liquid<00:03:28.230> soup<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.010> it

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
it will become a liquid soup and it

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.759 
it will become a liquid soup and it
won't<00:03:29.819> be<00:03:30.000> thick<00:03:30.329> enough<00:03:30.359> for<00:03:30.810> application

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
won't be thick enough for application

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.589 
won't be thick enough for application
and<00:03:32.040> then<00:03:32.370> when<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.639> put<00:03:32.849> it<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.269> shake

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
and then when you put it in the shake
