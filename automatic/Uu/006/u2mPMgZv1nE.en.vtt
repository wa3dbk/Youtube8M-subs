00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello friends today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.509
 special sandwich arrives videos for it 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.509
 We need the following ingredients 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.830
 ok let's start by putting in a 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.830
 I dip a little water 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.730
 and we'll put some chicken breasts 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.750
 we will also put a little salt and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.849
 we will bring it to boil once it is 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.060
 boiling we will put the three quarters 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.150
 parts of the big red pepper 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.790
 and leave it boiling another short while one 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.210
 Once the pepper is ready , 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.110
 let's drain a little bit and what 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.110
 we will crush 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.400
 everything well drained because if we put it 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.760
 a lot of water we will have the patÃ© a little 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.120
 liquid 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.280
 while everything will be written we will 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.390
 two or three or four those you prefer and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.519
 spoons of mayonnaise 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.860
 and we keep shredding so that all 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.380
 our products are mixed 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 and we have to shred very well remember 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.369
 that this is a chicken pate 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.320
 well once we have it ready 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.320
 we will change it 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.850
 and we will prepare our sandwiches 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.180
 you can do it in normal bread or toast the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 Bread and prepare it with more ingredients 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.560
 that and at each one's choice 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.580
 this is the presentation suggestion 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.220

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.930
