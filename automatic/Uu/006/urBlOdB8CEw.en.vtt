so I'm assuming that maybe it's coming
out<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:41.520> America<00:01:41.939> first<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.750> would<00:01:42.869> suck

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
out in America first that would suck

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
out in America first that would suck

because I wouldn't mind having the
