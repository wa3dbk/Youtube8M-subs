00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
in the past couple years that I would

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.670 
in the past couple years that I would
only<00:02:32.150> get<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.540> far<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.050> then<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.410> stopped

effortless very nice knife this is this

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.870 
effortless very nice knife this is this
is<00:02:38.390> great<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.930> it's<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.010> easy<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.850> use

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880

and<00:02:42.700> perfect<00:02:43.700> perfect<00:02:44.120> size<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.480> one<00:02:44.600> thing<00:02:44.780> I

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
and perfect perfect size the one thing I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.780 
and perfect perfect size the one thing I
like<00:02:44.959> about<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.290> UT<00:02:45.530> x85<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.459> blade

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
like about the UT x85 is that the blade

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.070 
like about the UT x85 is that the blade
length<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:48.620> handle<00:02:49.220> length<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.840> very<00:02:50.840> very

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
length to handle length is very very

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.390 
length to handle length is very very
good<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.590> lot<00:02:51.739> better<00:02:51.920> than<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
good it's a lot better than the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.100 
good it's a lot better than the
ultratech<00:02:52.820> which<00:02:53.000> basically<00:02:53.450> has<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:54.019> a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
ultratech which basically has just a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.040 
ultratech which basically has just a
slightly<00:02:54.530> longer<00:02:55.310> blade<00:02:55.819> but<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.600> lot<00:02:56.870> longer

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
slightly longer blade but a lot longer

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.650 
slightly longer blade but a lot longer
handle<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:57.860> it's<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.489> good<00:02:58.670> ratio<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.480> knife

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
handle so it's a good ratio this knife

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.570 
handle so it's a good ratio this knife
and<00:02:59.810> it's<00:02:59.989> um<00:03:00.200> they<00:03:00.920> did<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.100> really<00:03:01.160> good<00:03:01.519> job

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
and it's um they did a really good job

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.660 
and it's um they did a really good job
with<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.269> this<00:03:03.110> knife<00:03:03.340> you've<00:03:04.340> seen<00:03:04.519> other

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
with this this knife you've seen other

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.180 
with this this knife you've seen other
videos<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.269> daytonas<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:06.080> this<00:03:06.950> one's

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
videos with the daytonas but this one's

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.220 
videos with the daytonas but this one's
pretty<00:03:07.310> nice<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.900> think<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:08.989> is<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.200> little

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
pretty nice I think this is a little

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.990 
pretty nice I think this is a little
better<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.830> plus<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.340> lot<00:03:10.489> people<00:03:10.580> don't<00:03:10.730> like

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
better and plus a lot people don't like

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.910 
better and plus a lot people don't like
the<00:03:11.150> inlays<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:12.200> can<00:03:12.350> really<00:03:12.590> use<00:03:12.739> this

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
the inlays and you can really use this

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.650 
the inlays and you can really use this
knife<00:03:13.130> if<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.489> want<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.730> use<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:13.880> as<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.510> user

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
knife if you want to use it as the user

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.870 
knife if you want to use it as the user
I<00:03:14.780> guess<00:03:15.070> so<00:03:16.070> here<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.280> have<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.489> this<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.850> the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
I guess so here you have it this is the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.259 
I guess so here you have it this is the
