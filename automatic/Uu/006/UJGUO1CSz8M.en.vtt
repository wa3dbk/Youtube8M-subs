with them is that you cannot fit any
game<00:03:40.430> with<00:03:40.670> any<00:03:40.879> type<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.150> dust<00:03:41.510> covers

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
game with any type of dust covers

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.110 
game with any type of dust covers
doesn't<00:03:42.530> matter<00:03:42.709> if<00:03:42.890> it's<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.220> NES<00:03:43.670> one<00:03:43.910> or

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
doesn't matter if it's the NES one or

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.030 
doesn't matter if it's the NES one or
the<00:03:44.239> Super<00:03:44.540> Nintendo<00:03:44.690> one<00:03:45.110> I<00:03:45.319> understand<00:03:45.950> that

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
the Super Nintendo one I understand that

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.710 
the Super Nintendo one I understand that
this<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.340> done<00:03:46.519> because<00:03:46.879> of<00:03:47.000> how<00:03:47.150> perfect<00:03:47.390> the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
this is done because of how perfect the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.509 
this is done because of how perfect the
cutters<00:03:48.050> are<00:03:48.200> for<00:03:48.470> each<00:03:48.650> game<00:03:48.950> but<00:03:49.130> still<00:03:49.459> I

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
cutters are for each game but still I

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.430 
cutters are for each game but still I
just<00:03:49.849> like<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.180> have<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.420> dust<00:03:50.630> covers<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.200> just

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
just like to have the dust covers I just

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.080 
just like to have the dust covers I just
like<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.709> way<00:03:51.739> it<00:03:51.920> looks<00:03:52.099> but<00:03:52.310> again<00:03:52.640> in<00:03:52.880> its

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
like the way it looks but again in its

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.620 
like the way it looks but again in its

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.630

you<00:03:53.840> probably<00:03:54.080> don't<00:03:54.470> really<00:03:54.890> need<00:03:55.130> any<00:03:55.400> dust

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
you probably don't really need any dust

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.830 
you probably don't really need any dust
covers<00:03:56.000> because<00:03:56.300> they're<00:03:56.450> very<00:03:56.690> well

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
covers because they're very well

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.539 
covers because they're very well
protected<00:03:57.200> inside<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.010> don't<00:03:58.069> think<00:03:58.250> any

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
protected inside and I don't think any

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.580 
protected inside and I don't think any
dust<00:03:58.849> will<00:03:59.120> come<00:03:59.299> in<00:03:59.450> also<00:04:00.049> if<00:04:00.230> you're<00:04:00.440> not

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
dust will come in also if you're not

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.680 
dust will come in also if you're not
careful<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:01.220> apply<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.700> little<00:04:02.150> bit<00:04:02.269> of<00:04:02.390> course

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
careful and apply a little bit of course

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.170 
careful and apply a little bit of course
you<00:04:03.110> can<00:04:03.290> be<00:04:03.440> formed<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:03.890> plastic<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.730> it's<00:04:04.880> not

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
you can be formed a plastic and it's not

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.020 
you can be formed a plastic and it's not
coming<00:04:05.480> back<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.989> way<00:04:06.019> it<00:04:06.200> was<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:07.340> cases<00:04:07.849> are

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
coming back the way it was the cases are

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.850 
coming back the way it was the cases are
different<00:04:08.239> sizes<00:04:08.750> here<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.440> can<00:04:09.590> see<00:04:09.739> the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
different sizes here you can see the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.740 
different sizes here you can see the
tree<00:04:10.099> stuck<00:04:10.370> together<00:04:10.549> this<00:04:11.060> means<00:04:11.360> that<00:04:11.599> they

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
tree stuck together this means that they

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.960 
tree stuck together this means that they
will<00:04:11.900> not<00:04:12.380> fit<00:04:12.799> together<00:04:13.190> perfectly

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
will not fit together perfectly

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.180 
will not fit together perfectly
not<00:04:14.239> even<00:04:14.510> between<00:04:14.750> beatboxes<00:04:15.500> but<00:04:15.799> this<00:04:15.950> also

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
not even between beatboxes but this also

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.069 
not even between beatboxes but this also
means<00:04:16.669> that<00:04:17.000> if<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:17.389> have<00:04:17.419> them<00:04:17.750> stuck

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
means that if you have them stuck

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.500 
means that if you have them stuck
together<00:04:18.350> very<00:04:18.859> tight<00:04:19.190> it's<00:04:19.549> easier<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.299> take

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
together very tight it's easier to take

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.110 
together very tight it's easier to take
them<00:04:20.690> out<00:04:20.840> but<00:04:21.139> personally<00:04:21.919> I<00:04:22.100> like<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.700> much

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
them out but personally I like it much

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.570 
them out but personally I like it much
better<00:04:23.510> how<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.930> universal<00:04:24.710> game<00:04:24.889> cases<00:04:25.340> look

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
better how the universal game cases look

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.580 
better how the universal game cases look
in<00:04:25.729> my<00:04:25.880> storage<00:04:26.270> racks<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.870> really<00:04:27.350> don't

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
in my storage racks I really don't

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.110 
in my storage racks I really don't
understand<00:04:28.070> beatbox<00:04:28.490> for<00:04:28.669> making<00:04:29.000> these

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
understand beatbox for making these

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.750 
understand beatbox for making these
cases<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:29.810> big<00:04:30.139> because<00:04:31.100> not<00:04:31.250> only<00:04:31.280> do<00:04:31.700> they

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
cases so big because not only do they

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.730 
cases so big because not only do they
look<00:04:32.030> like<00:04:32.090> they<00:04:32.389> don't<00:04:32.540> belong<00:04:32.900> but<00:04:33.229> also<00:04:33.410> the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
look like they don't belong but also the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.740 
look like they don't belong but also the
printed<00:04:34.100> covers<00:04:34.520> don't<00:04:34.760> fit<00:04:35.060> if<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.450> plan<00:04:35.720> to

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
printed covers don't fit if you plan to

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.110 
printed covers don't fit if you plan to
use<00:04:35.900> letter<00:04:36.320> size<00:04:36.620> paper<00:04:36.889> for<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.400> NES<00:04:37.820> ones

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
use letter size paper for the NES ones

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.420 
use letter size paper for the NES ones
you<00:04:38.270> can<00:04:38.479> print<00:04:38.780> in<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.110> legal<00:04:39.470> size<00:04:39.710> paper<00:04:39.740> and

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
you can print in a legal size paper and

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.860 
you can print in a legal size paper and
be<00:04:40.729> careful<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.150> print<00:04:41.479> with<00:04:41.690> these

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
be careful to print with these

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.600 
be careful to print with these
measurements<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:42.800> they<00:04:43.100> will<00:04:43.280> look<00:04:43.400> like

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
measurements and they will look like

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.270 
measurements and they will look like
this<00:04:43.820> which<00:04:44.479> is<00:04:44.510> not<00:04:44.930> bad<00:04:45.169> but<00:04:45.560> with<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.919> Super

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
this which is not bad but with the Super

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.159 
this which is not bad but with the Super
Nintendo<00:04:46.400> cases<00:04:47.210> since<00:04:47.570> they<00:04:47.750> are<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.960> same

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
Nintendo cases since they are the same

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.710 
Nintendo cases since they are the same
height<00:04:48.500> but<00:04:48.919> they're<00:04:49.190> much<00:04:49.580> longer<00:04:50.150> now<00:04:50.450> if

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
height but they're much longer now if

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.850 
height but they're much longer now if
you<00:04:50.840> don't<00:04:50.990> want<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.200> distort<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.830> picture

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
you don't want to distort the picture

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.520 
you don't want to distort the picture
you<00:04:52.400> need<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.700> use<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.150> same<00:04:53.510> measurements<00:04:54.380> as

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
you need to use the same measurements as

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.260 
you need to use the same measurements as
the<00:04:54.710> NES<00:04:54.860> one<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.610> they<00:04:55.669> would<00:04:55.850> look<00:04:56.060> like

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
the NES one and they would look like

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.020 
the NES one and they would look like
this<00:04:56.539> you<00:04:56.960> can<00:04:57.139> see<00:04:57.320> there<00:04:57.440> is<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.560> gap<00:04:58.030> it

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
this you can see there is a gap it

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.400 
this you can see there is a gap it
really<00:04:59.270> doesn't<00:04:59.660> look<00:04:59.690> very<00:04:59.870> well

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
really doesn't look very well

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.740 
really doesn't look very well
you<00:05:00.650> can<00:05:00.860> print<00:05:01.160> covers<00:05:01.639> directly<00:05:02.180> from<00:05:02.360> Stone

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
you can print covers directly from Stone

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.210 
you can print covers directly from Stone
Age<00:05:02.930> gamer<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.650> guess<00:05:03.889> they're<00:05:04.010> gonna<00:05:04.100> be

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
Age gamer and I guess they're gonna be

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.129 
Age gamer and I guess they're gonna be
tailor-made<00:05:04.700> so<00:05:05.210> it<00:05:05.300> would<00:05:05.419> fit<00:05:05.450> perfectly

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
tailor-made so it would fit perfectly

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.960 
tailor-made so it would fit perfectly
but<00:05:06.410> they<00:05:06.560> charge<00:05:06.889> for<00:05:07.220> it<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:07.760> guess

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
but they charge for it and I guess

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.010 
but they charge for it and I guess
that's<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.300> plan<00:05:08.510> all<00:05:08.660> along

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
that's the plan all along

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.080 
that's the plan all along
and<00:05:09.289> this<00:05:09.530> leads<00:05:09.800> me<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.010> what's<00:05:10.310> probably<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090
