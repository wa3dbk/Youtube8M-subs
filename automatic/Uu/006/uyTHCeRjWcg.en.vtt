00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.800
I'm going to a grocery store

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.233
where they sell lots of foreign food ingredients.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.766
Tadah!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.400
Green curry.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.700
I should buy something that's not in my country.Right?

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.566
I'll cook green curry

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.466
that I bought in Japan.

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.933
Seasoned chicken breast.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.800
This will make the sauce

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.733
taste better.

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.100
Wash the vitamins and cut the ends.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.833
Put it on the plate first.

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.566
My secret is

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.800
this fake crab meat

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.533
because it gives you chicken and sea food taste.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.066
It gives you foreign taste.

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:57.266
Canola oil.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.166
Hahaha, let's put some here.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.033
And then chicken breast we just sliced…

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.100
Hmm, it smells so good!

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.766
Then, boil this…

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.900
Green curry is really green.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.100
Boil it until it gets thick.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, put the crab meat.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.300
Let's roast it together, friend.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.066
This is going to be so delicious.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:21.000
If you put a little bit of peppers,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.233
everything is done.

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:25.033
I'm so good at taking this all by myself.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:26.500
Who could do this?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.533
Ugh, it's so hot.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.700
Ugh, it's so hot.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.600
Let's put this yellow fried thing here.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.800
Lastly, you put green curry sauce.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.033
Woohoo, look at that.

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:44.933
I can't wait, I can't wait…

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.100
Let me try this.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.966
Hmm, yes.

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.633
Am I in Thailand now?

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:08.766
I thought it wouldn't match with chicken breast, but wow!

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:10.933
It looks delicious, right?

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:14.100
Yeah, seriously.

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:19.900
But it's so hot.
