frank stella which i've used many times
where<00:00:32.700> he<00:00:32.790> says<00:00:33.059> he<00:00:33.899> wanted<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> make<00:00:34.430> the

where he says he wanted to make the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.280 
where he says he wanted to make the
paint<00:00:35.850> look<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.300> good<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> was<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.079> can

and<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.309> think<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.579> know<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.570> exactly

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
and I think you know that I know exactly

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
and I think you know that I know exactly
what<00:00:40.140> he<00:00:40.230> meant<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.309> minute

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
what he meant that there was the minute

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.549 
what he meant that there was the minute
you<00:00:41.700> open<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.090> tin<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> paint<00:00:42.809> there's<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
you open a tin of paint there's this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.260 
you open a tin of paint there's this
glorious<00:00:44.570> perfect<00:00:45.570> shiny<00:00:46.550> liquid<00:00:47.550> paint<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
glorious perfect shiny liquid paint and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.970 
glorious perfect shiny liquid paint and
the<00:00:48.719> more<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> spread<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.320> around<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the more you spread it around on the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.639 
the more you spread it around on the
surface<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> less<00:00:51.079> glorious<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.260> shiny<00:00:52.500> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
surface the less glorious and shiny and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
surface the less glorious and shiny and
liquid<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.010> becomes<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.699> love<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.480> idea<00:00:54.690> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
liquid it becomes I love that idea of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.600 
liquid it becomes I love that idea of
trying<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> keep<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> paint<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.739> good<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
trying to keep the paint as good as it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.400 
trying to keep the paint as good as it
is<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.030> its<00:00:57.180> unadulterated<00:00:57.600> State<00:01:00.230> one<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
is in its unadulterated State one of the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.729 
is in its unadulterated State one of the
pleasures<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.800> making<00:01:02.280> works<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.390> paper

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
pleasures of making works on paper

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.840 
pleasures of making works on paper
particularly<00:01:04.739> works<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.189> paper<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.610> refer

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
particularly works on paper that refer

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.780 
particularly works on paper that refer
to<00:01:06.590> three-dimensional<00:01:07.590> sculptures<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> one

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
to three-dimensional sculptures of one

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.520 
to three-dimensional sculptures of one
kind<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.060> another<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.110> don't<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
kind or another is that I don't have to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
kind or another is that I don't have to
worry<00:01:10.740> about<00:01:10.920> making<00:01:11.250> them<00:01:11.460> stand<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.909> their

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
worry about making them stand up their

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.719 
worry about making them stand up their
fantasies<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> sense<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:14.549> make

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
fantasies in the sense that I can make

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
fantasies in the sense that I can make
work<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.570> splatters<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.080> color<00:01:16.470> which

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
work of just splatters of color which

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.980 
work of just splatters of color which
would<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.490> entirely<00:01:17.790> impossible<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
would be entirely impossible to to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.310 
would be entirely impossible to to
realize<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.560> three<00:01:19.710> dimensions<00:01:20.869> they<00:01:21.869> point

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
realize in three dimensions they point

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.230 
realize in three dimensions they point
to<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> possibility<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:24.049> sculpture<00:01:25.049> made<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
to the possibility of sculpture made of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.780 
to the possibility of sculpture made of
independently<00:01:27.290> unsupported<00:01:28.579> blocks<00:01:29.579> of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
independently unsupported blocks of

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.020 
independently unsupported blocks of
color<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:31.070> there's<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.159> freedom<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.729> making

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
color and there's a freedom in making

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.160 
color and there's a freedom in making
the<00:01:33.119> drawings<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> simply<00:01:33.869> don't<00:01:34.079> have

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the drawings because I simply don't have

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.330 
the drawings because I simply don't have
to<00:01:34.320> worry<00:01:34.500> about<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.829> these<00:01:34.979> things<00:01:35.159> would

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to worry about how these things would

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.690 
to worry about how these things would
actually<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.700> built

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.810 

I<00:01:38.729> love<00:01:39.540> abstract<00:01:40.080> art<00:01:40.290> particularly<00:01:41.250> you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
I love abstract art particularly you

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.719 
I love abstract art particularly you
know<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.780> emerged<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> 1919<00:01:44.189> 20s<00:01:44.580> in

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
know as it emerged in the 1919 20s in

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.539 
know as it emerged in the 1919 20s in
Europe<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.330> in<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> 1950s<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.409> 60s<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.920> Latin

America and you know and what can lot of
contemporary<00:01:50.159> artists<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.520> doing<00:01:50.759> these

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
contemporary artists are doing these

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.380 
contemporary artists are doing these
days<00:01:52.009> but<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.700> my<00:01:53.939> work<00:01:54.180> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
days but I don't think my work is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.260 
days but I don't think my work is
unambiguously<00:01:55.170> abstract<00:01:56.090> they<00:01:57.090> are

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
unambiguously abstract they are

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.350 
unambiguously abstract they are
representations<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.380> possible<00:01:58.860> things<00:01:59.360> so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
representations of possible things so

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230 
representations of possible things so
they<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.600> figures<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.240> they're

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
they are figures in a way but they're

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
they are figures in a way but they're
figures<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.899> somehow<00:02:04.110> belong<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.680> abstract

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
figures that somehow belong to abstract
