00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
gonna stay now in the front I bought a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.050 
gonna stay now in the front I bought a
whole<00:01:40.860> bunch<00:01:41.189> more<00:01:41.340> glosso

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
I bought like three or three pots and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.039 
I bought like three or three pots and
that's<00:01:46.680> quite<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> bit<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.630> gloss

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that's quite a bit now the now the gloss

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
that's quite a bit now the now the gloss
or<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.530> local<00:01:50.040> fish<00:01:50.250> store<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.670> growing<00:01:51.060> very

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
or the local fish store was growing very

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.999 
or the local fish store was growing very
tall<00:01:52.049> very<00:01:52.380> vertical

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
tall very vertical

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.520 
tall very vertical
so<00:01:53.909> I'm<00:01:54.000> guessing<00:01:54.210> lights<00:01:54.659> weren't<00:01:55.170> strong

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
so I'm guessing lights weren't strong

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.230 
so I'm guessing lights weren't strong
enough<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> did<00:01:57.509> was<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.810> actually<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
enough so what I did was I actually I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.260 
enough so what I did was I actually I
cut<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.479> half<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.520> planted<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.969> about

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
cut it in half and planted them in about

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
cut it in half and planted them in about
two<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.659> three<00:02:03.689> bunches

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
two to three bunches

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.020 
two to three bunches
and<00:02:07.110> planted<00:02:08.110> them<00:02:08.229> but<00:02:08.880> honestly<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.970> think

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
and planted them but honestly I think

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.080 
and planted them but honestly I think
there's<00:02:10.360> still<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.690> little<00:02:10.930> too<00:02:11.260> tall<00:02:11.530> so<00:02:12.090> what

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
there's still a little too tall so what

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.270 
there's still a little too tall so what
I<00:02:13.120> think<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.960> might<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.470> do<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.740> trim<00:02:15.010> them

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
I think I might have to do is trim them

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.940 
I think I might have to do is trim them
a<00:02:15.310> little<00:02:15.910> bit<00:02:16.030> more<00:02:16.270> again<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.410> replant

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
a little bit more again and just replant

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.880 
a little bit more again and just replant
again<00:02:19.560> hoping<00:02:20.560> they<00:02:20.710> will<00:02:20.860> carpet<00:02:22.500> I'm<00:02:23.500> pretty

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
again hoping they will carpet I'm pretty

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.000 
again hoping they will carpet I'm pretty
sure<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.250> light<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:24.640> more<00:02:24.850> than<00:02:25.030> enough

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
sure this light is more than enough

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.260 
sure this light is more than enough
strong<00:02:27.010> enough<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.340> they<00:02:27.670> should<00:02:28.000> be<00:02:28.180> able

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
strong enough that they should be able

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.620 
strong enough that they should be able
to<00:02:28.420> grow<00:02:28.630> horizontal<00:02:30.120> you're<00:02:31.120> gonna<00:02:31.330> have<00:02:31.450> to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
to grow horizontal you're gonna have to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.810 
to grow horizontal you're gonna have to
see<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.500> believe<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> co2<00:02:33.670> is

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
see on that I believe the co2 is

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.820 
see on that I believe the co2 is
definitely<00:02:34.420> helping<00:02:34.780> there<00:02:35.350> they're<00:02:35.800> doing

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
definitely helping there they're doing

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.930 
definitely helping there they're doing
very<00:02:36.490> well<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:37.000> plants<00:02:37.330> are<00:02:37.420> doing<00:02:37.540> very<00:02:37.900> well

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
very well the plants are doing very well

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.280 
very well the plants are doing very well
didn't<00:02:39.940> have<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.209> problems<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.720> had<00:02:40.900> earlier

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
didn't have the problems I had earlier

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.320 
didn't have the problems I had earlier
without<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.980> co2<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:42.940> definitely

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
without the co2 so that definitely

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.070 
without the co2 so that definitely
helped<00:02:44.010> all<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.070> fish<00:02:45.400> are<00:02:45.550> doing<00:02:45.580> well<00:02:46.080> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
helped all the fish are doing well the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.560 
helped all the fish are doing well the
algae<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:48.130> little<00:02:48.520> bit<00:02:48.640> here<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:48.970> there<00:02:49.030> but<00:02:49.390> my

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
algae a little bit here and there but my

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.890 
algae a little bit here and there but my
autos<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.380> my<00:02:50.500> Hill<00:02:50.740> screen<00:02:51.100> loaches<00:02:51.900> they're

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
autos and my Hill screen loaches they're

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.770 
autos and my Hill screen loaches they're
doing<00:02:53.140> their<00:02:53.260> job<00:02:54.000> green<00:02:55.000> neons<00:02:55.360> are<00:02:55.570> always

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
doing their job green neons are always

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.550 
doing their job green neons are always
hiding<00:02:56.140> though<00:02:57.270> they're<00:02:58.270> on<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.480> bottom<00:02:58.630> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
hiding though they're on the bottom the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.350 
hiding though they're on the bottom the
light<00:02:59.800> is<00:02:59.950> pretty<00:03:00.250> strong<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.850> think<00:03:01.120> they

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
light is pretty strong I think they

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.240 
light is pretty strong I think they
don't<00:03:01.540> really<00:03:01.750> like<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:02.500> when<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:02.770> do<00:03:02.890> turn

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
don't really like it so when I do turn

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.070 
don't really like it so when I do turn
off<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.580> lights<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:04.420> know<00:03:04.540> they're<00:03:04.780> all<00:03:04.900> out

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
off the lights you know they're all out

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.190 
off the lights you know they're all out
there<00:03:05.500> all<00:03:05.590> over<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.890> place<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:07.200> my

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
there all over the place and my

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.110 
there all over the place and my
checkerboard<00:03:08.739> cichlids<00:03:09.190> they<00:03:09.550> like<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.910> hang

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
checkerboard cichlids they like to hang

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.960 
checkerboard cichlids they like to hang
around<00:03:10.330> in<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> cave<00:03:11.110> area<00:03:11.650> on<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.700> lower

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
around in the cave area on the lower

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.080 
around in the cave area on the lower
left<00:03:13.420> side<00:03:13.660> of<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.989> tank<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.160> rarely<00:03:15.489> do<00:03:15.820> see

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
left side of the tank so I rarely do see

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.840 
left side of the tank so I rarely do see
them<00:03:16.330> they<00:03:16.690> only<00:03:16.870> come<00:03:17.140> out<00:03:17.370> when<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.430> start

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
them they only come out when I start

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.600 
them they only come out when I start
feeding<00:03:19.090> them<00:03:19.709> other<00:03:20.709> than<00:03:20.799> that<00:03:21.100> guys<00:03:21.370> that

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
feeding them other than that guys that

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.570 
feeding them other than that guys that
the<00:03:22.030> tanks<00:03:22.450> starting<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.870> look<00:03:23.049> good<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:24.340> it

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
the tanks starting to look good but it

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.140 
the tanks starting to look good but it
would<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:25.000> know<00:03:25.120> definitely<00:03:26.489> look<00:03:27.489> real<00:03:27.820> good

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
would you know definitely look real good

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.440 
would you know definitely look real good
if<00:03:28.780> we<00:03:29.110> didn't<00:03:29.380> get<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:30.130> know<00:03:30.250> all<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:31.090> front

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
if we didn't get you know all that front

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.289 
if we didn't get you know all that front
area<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:32.019> just<00:03:32.260> totally<00:03:32.799> green<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:34.150> know

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
area is just totally green you know

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.210 
area is just totally green you know
without<00:03:34.420> all<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.870> black<00:03:35.110> areas<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.010> stuff

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
without all the black areas and stuff

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.180 
without all the black areas and stuff
the<00:03:37.000> substrate<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.959> think<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.709> would<00:03:38.890> start

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
the substrate I think that would start

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.820 
the substrate I think that would start
to<00:03:39.610> look<00:03:39.640> better<00:03:40.060> if<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.110> can<00:03:41.260> get<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.560> car

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
to look better if I can get that car

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.130 
to look better if I can get that car

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.289 
patrolling
but<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.290> far<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.680> good<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:45.280> co2<00:03:45.549> is<00:03:45.820> definitely

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
but so far so good the co2 is definitely

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.790 
but so far so good the co2 is definitely
working<00:03:47.200> helping

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
working helping

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.100 
working helping
so<00:03:50.800> that<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:52.000> definitely<00:03:52.450> gives<00:03:52.690> me<00:03:52.990> an
