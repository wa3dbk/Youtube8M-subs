00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.830 
hi I'm Lloyd Walker from Walker audio
and<00:00:11.410> I'm<00:00:11.830> going<00:00:12.040> to<00:00:12.070> demonstrate<00:00:12.809> how<00:00:13.809> to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
and I'm going to demonstrate how to

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.370 
and I'm going to demonstrate how to
clean<00:00:14.139> a<00:00:14.260> CD<00:00:14.769> with<00:00:15.309> our<00:00:15.549> ultra<00:00:16.150> vivid<00:00:16.510> first

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
clean a CD with our ultra vivid first

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.620 
clean a CD with our ultra vivid first
you<00:00:17.740> take<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.010> bottle<00:00:18.640> and<00:00:18.880> you<00:00:19.090> shake<00:00:19.330> it<00:00:19.359> up

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
you take the bottle and you shake it up

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.490 
you take the bottle and you shake it up
good<00:00:20.289> and<00:00:21.279> then<00:00:22.210> you<00:00:22.359> put<00:00:22.570> about<00:00:22.750> three<00:00:23.199> maybe

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
good and then you put about three maybe

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.310 
good and then you put about three maybe
four<00:00:23.800> drops<00:00:24.160> is<00:00:24.520> all<00:00:24.760> that's<00:00:25.030> needed<00:00:25.240> onto<00:00:26.200> the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
four drops is all that's needed onto the

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.660 
four drops is all that's needed onto the
CD<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:27.039> take<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.520> applicator<00:00:28.030> pad<00:00:28.360> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
CD and take the applicator pad and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.349 
CD and take the applicator pad and
softly<00:00:30.670> gently<00:00:31.270> go<00:00:31.539> around<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:32.169> CD<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:36.359> the

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.359 
softly gently go around the CD so the

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.689 
softly gently go around the CD so the
pad<00:00:37.660> is<00:00:37.989> very<00:00:38.350> very<00:00:38.649> soft<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.280> if<00:00:39.340> there's<00:00:39.550> any

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
pad is very very soft so if there's any

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.460 
pad is very very soft so if there's any
contaminants<00:00:40.390> on<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.540> CD<00:00:41.020> that<00:00:41.230> might

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
contaminants on the CD that might

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.170 
contaminants on the CD that might
scratch<00:00:41.800> it<00:00:42.040> it'll<00:00:42.370> actually<00:00:42.460> go<00:00:42.790> into<00:00:42.970> the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
scratch it it'll actually go into the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.200 
scratch it it'll actually go into the
pad<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.770> for<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.100> first<00:00:45.280> application

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
pad this is for the first application

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.450 
pad this is for the first application
very<00:00:46.450> lightly<00:00:46.780> go<00:00:47.140> around<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.980> outer<00:00:48.130> edge

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
very lightly go around the outer edge

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.910 
very lightly go around the outer edge
and<00:00:48.820> then<00:00:49.510> take<00:00:49.780> your<00:00:49.930> high-tech<00:00:50.410> cleaning

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
and then take your high-tech cleaning

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.880 
and then take your high-tech cleaning
cloth<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.840> quickly<00:00:53.140> buff<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:53.739> off

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
cloth and just quickly buff it off

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.660 
cloth and just quickly buff it off
across<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.180> surface<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.920> don't<00:00:57.040> have<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.489> do

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
across the surface you don't have to do

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.150 
across the surface you don't have to do
it<00:00:57.820> real<00:00:58.329> good<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.840> first<00:00:59.110> time<00:00:59.379> this<00:00:59.710> removes

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
it real good the first time this removes

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.119 
it real good the first time this removes
any<00:01:00.430> hard<00:01:00.969> contaminants<00:01:01.870> and<00:01:02.110> gets<00:01:02.710> rid<00:01:02.890> of<00:01:02.950> it

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
any hard contaminants and gets rid of it

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.429 
any hard contaminants and gets rid of it
next<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.180> put<00:01:04.210> another<00:01:04.659> two<00:01:04.899> or<00:01:05.019> three<00:01:05.199> drops

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
next you put another two or three drops

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.959 
next you put another two or three drops
again<00:01:05.969> on<00:01:06.969> the<00:01:07.240> CD<00:01:08.310> take<00:01:09.310> your<00:01:09.520> applicator

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
again on the CD take your applicator

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.660 
again on the CD take your applicator
cloth<00:01:10.509> and<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:12.070> go<00:01:12.400> around<00:01:12.549> it<00:01:13.080> again<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.710> go

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670

cloth and and go around it again and go
around<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.090> outer<00:01:16.240> edge<00:01:16.600> again<00:01:17.049> and<00:01:17.380> then<00:01:18.369> now

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
around the outer edge again and then now

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.080 
around the outer edge again and then now
you<00:01:19.420> take<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:20.440> high-tech<00:01:20.979> buffing<00:01:21.460> cloth<00:01:21.610> and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
you take the high-tech buffing cloth and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.010 
you take the high-tech buffing cloth and
buff<00:01:22.810> across<00:01:23.260> it<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:24.790> vigorously<00:01:25.659> now

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
buff across it very vigorously now

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.469 
buff across it very vigorously now
before<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:26.799> dries<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.490> want<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:27.790> off<00:01:28.000> before

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
before it dries you want it off before

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.560 
before it dries you want it off before
it<00:01:28.750> dries<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.340> while<00:01:30.790> you're<00:01:30.939> looking<00:01:31.119> at<00:01:31.420> it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
it dries and while you're looking at it

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.190 
it dries and while you're looking at it
you'll<00:01:32.200> see<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:34.240> surface<00:01:34.510> will<00:01:35.080> get

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
you'll see that the surface will get

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.719 
you'll see that the surface will get
real<00:01:35.560> bright<00:01:35.979> get<00:01:36.700> like<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.909> mirror<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.490> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
real bright get like a mirror so it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.660 
real bright get like a mirror so it
actually<00:01:42.729> renders<00:01:43.299> any<00:01:44.229> scratches<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.200> CD

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
actually renders any scratches on the CD

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.190 
actually renders any scratches on the CD
transparent<00:01:48.670> without<00:01:49.000> adding<00:01:49.420> any<00:01:49.659> scratches

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
transparent without adding any scratches

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.030 
transparent without adding any scratches
itself

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
itself

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.630 
itself
so<00:01:52.950> after<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.040> get<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.310> all<00:01:54.460> off<00:01:55.259> that's<00:01:56.259> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
so after you get it all off that's it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.480 
so after you get it all off that's it
look<00:01:57.640> at<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.939> surface<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:59.350> like<00:01:59.829> a<00:01:59.860> mirror

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
look at the surface just like a mirror

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.359 
look at the surface just like a mirror
now<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:01.329> plastic<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.110> now<00:02:02.350> transparent<00:02:03.250> and

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
now this plastic is now transparent and

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.350 
now this plastic is now transparent and
the<00:02:04.240> laser<00:02:04.540> will<00:02:05.079> be<00:02:05.259> able<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.950> read<00:02:06.280> all<00:02:06.909> the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
the laser will be able to read all the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.649 
the laser will be able to read all the
information<00:02:08.220> correctly<00:02:09.220> without<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:10.450> error

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
information correctly without the error

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.229 
information correctly without the error
correction<00:02:11.409> system<00:02:11.920> working<00:02:12.129> you'll<00:02:13.030> be

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
correction system working you'll be

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.640 
correction system working you'll be
amazed<00:02:13.629> at<00:02:13.930> how<00:02:14.140> good<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.769> CD<00:02:15.159> will<00:02:15.370> sound
