 a special one 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.199
 he combined scientific insights about I asked along with 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.460

 click here to be a reasonable one 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.650
 is the scientific and working try that science for one 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:26.740
 broader public access and combined that with 90 hp a partner 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.489

 that is not being sick in the food chain 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.820
 was added to the book during the weekend 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.520
 because we think yes if your body would be the company 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.630
 that you should manager mascha 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.020
 lead the company 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.250
 And now there will be an example to follow 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.610
 with its techniques you can apply 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.890
 that has to do with the concert hall people techniques are just one 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.880
 An example of a technique that is used is blackening 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.630

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.610
 and your scientific contribution has boiled siegel geert is coming 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.250
 foundation of many clouds and lots of research done on portion one 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.690
 portion large and how people react when they start eating more and less 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.799
 and they all gathered together in the book to show who matters 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.590
 being able to fit so that you don't improve too much is just the main part 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.220
 I will just go 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.450
 keep your size 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.870
 keeping size and still enjoying your food is not easy for the 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.030
 people 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.729
 no the environment in which the director does change post have become larger 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.010
 there is always a lot of food around us and then that is the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.040
 art to 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.230
 keep that in mind a bit 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.350
 and again people in your area to the perpetrators but also people 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.880
 in July people were tried out in your area 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.130
 jade number of people asked around me 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.240
 not even try the taste test for a month and the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.890
 reactions were that it is easily applicable that there is one for everyone 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.670
 the youth tip that they can apply and that it is for us too 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.689
 you can persist, yes 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.820
 we create after a lean animal 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.659
 it was intended 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.629
 no more recipes are needed 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.169
 or indeed writing in the book not day by day for what 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.700
 to have known you and not to know that it is a great place to decide for yourself 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.269
 live 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.659
 See the effective year later on the basis of some recipes how you simply 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.749
 were dishes 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.949
 this way they can prepare something that has fewer calories 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.180
 they can still continue to eat a nice game, but with slightly fewer calories 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.299
 one has here 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.180

 well very special book the father managers part the race 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.440

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.719
 smart season 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.509
 keep that scenario 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:56.579
