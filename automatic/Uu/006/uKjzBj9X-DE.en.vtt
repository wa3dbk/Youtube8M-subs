00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
the original mob trap that I made I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.990 
the original mob trap that I made I
decided<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.679> build<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.099> little<00:00:14.580> bit<00:00:14.759> better

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
decided to build it a little bit better

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.990 
decided to build it a little bit better
and<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.269> little<00:00:15.630> bit<00:00:15.929> bigger<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.529> um<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.850> is

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and a little bit bigger so um this is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.120 
and a little bit bigger so um this is
the<00:00:18.119> entrance<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.890> should<00:00:20.039> probably

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the entrance to it and I should probably

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.340 
the entrance to it and I should probably
light<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.029> nothing<00:00:21.660> comes<00:00:22.050> over

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
light all this up so nothing comes over

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.370 
light all this up so nothing comes over
here<00:00:23.119> it's<00:00:24.119> good<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:24.810> I'm<00:00:24.960> gonna<00:00:25.199> show<00:00:25.320> you

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
here it's good but I'm gonna show you

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.040 
here it's good but I'm gonna show you
all<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.560> right<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.359> uses<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> series

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
all that right now and it uses a series

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
all that right now and it uses a series
of<00:00:28.199> walkways<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.369> attract<00:00:29.730> stuff

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
of walkways like this to attract stuff

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.659 
of walkways like this to attract stuff
into<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.330> now<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.769> haven't<00:00:32.160> tested<00:00:32.460> it

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
into it now it's a I haven't tested it

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.540 
into it now it's a I haven't tested it
yet<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.149> first<00:00:33.420> video<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.809> made<00:00:33.989> after

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
yet this is the first video I made after

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.160 
yet this is the first video I made after
making<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.180> we're<00:00:36.510> gonna<00:00:36.600> test<00:00:36.899> how<00:00:37.079> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
making it so we're gonna test how it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.520 
making it so we're gonna test how it
works

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
works

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
works
but<00:00:38.460> um<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:39.059> walkway<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.510> designed<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.110> catch

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
but um this walkway is designed to catch

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.220 
but um this walkway is designed to catch
any<00:00:40.770> monsters<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.480> me<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.930> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that's exactly how it's supposed to work

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880 
that's exactly how it's supposed to work
and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.750> they'll<00:00:45.930> follow<00:00:46.170> me<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> way

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
thinking about making like some sort of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.920 
thinking about making like some sort of
caching<00:01:52.920> device<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:55.969> like<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.240> put<00:01:57.750> some

caching device like like to put some

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.359 
caching device like like to put some
water<00:01:58.140> down<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.649> it'll<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.950> drift<00:01:59.250> in

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
water down there so it'll like drift in

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.950 
water down there so it'll like drift in
the<00:01:59.520> middle<00:01:59.790> or<00:01:59.880> something<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> don't<00:02:00.659> know

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the middle or something but I don't know

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.819 
the middle or something but I don't know

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
enjoy the video I put quite a lot of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.110 
enjoy the video I put quite a lot of
time<00:02:22.360> into<00:02:22.540> making<00:02:22.780> this<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.349> I<00:02:23.970> think<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.060> a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
time into making this and I think it's a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.150 
time into making this and I think it's a
really<00:02:25.330> cool<00:02:25.510> design<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:26.110> made<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.950> I

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
really cool design and made it and I

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.280 
really cool design and made it and I
improved<00:02:27.519> it<00:02:27.640> from<00:02:27.790> before<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.900> now<00:02:28.959> it's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
improved it from before and now it's

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.930 
improved it from before and now it's
basically<00:02:29.470> foolproof<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.489> it's<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.700> lot

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
basically foolproof and it's a lot

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.690 
basically foolproof and it's a lot
bigger<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:32.200> just<00:02:33.129> go<00:02:33.220> up<00:02:33.250> here<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.489> show

not<00:03:01.780> close<00:03:02.140> because<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.590> thought<00:03:02.709> it'd<00:03:03.250> be<00:03:03.310> a

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
not close because I thought it'd be a

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.759 
not close because I thought it'd be a
neat<00:03:03.700> idea<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:04.360> UM<00:03:04.540> use<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.810> fishing<00:03:05.110> pole<00:03:05.410> it's

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
neat idea to UM use a fishing pole it's

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.500 
neat idea to UM use a fishing pole it's
like<00:03:05.920> if<00:03:06.190> there's<00:03:06.489> stuff<00:03:06.670> way<00:03:06.879> out<00:03:07.000> there<00:03:07.239> to

this is working holy crap there's a crap
load<00:03:12.609> of<00:03:12.670> stuff<00:03:12.880> down<00:03:13.090> there<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:14.139> I<00:03:14.170> just<00:03:14.350> come

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
load of stuff down there so I just come

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.830 
load of stuff down there so I just come
down<00:03:14.920> here<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.819> attract<00:03:16.180> everything<00:03:16.480> and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
down here you attract everything and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.890 
down here you attract everything and
then<00:03:17.650> go<00:03:17.920> ahead<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.130> fall<00:03:18.400> down<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.639> hole

let's do what we got this time yeah this
is<00:03:22.420> way<00:03:22.959> more<00:03:22.989> effective<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.220> lot<00:03:24.579> safer

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
is way more effective and a lot safer

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.900 
is way more effective and a lot safer
than<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.389> other<00:03:25.540> methods<00:03:26.280> just<00:03:27.280> sit<00:03:27.519> here<00:03:27.760> and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
than the other methods just sit here and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.530 
than the other methods just sit here and
click<00:03:28.299> away<00:03:28.560> No<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.859> hope<00:03:30.370> this<00:03:30.579> video<00:03:30.790> gets<00:03:31.359> all
