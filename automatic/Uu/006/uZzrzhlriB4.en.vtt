thanks for joining me
let's<00:00:44.269> get<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.920> so<00:00:45.920> this<00:00:46.159> is<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.400> magic<00:00:46.790> of

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
let's get to it so this is the magic of

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.990 
let's get to it so this is the magic of
a<00:00:47.150> 1by<00:00:47.479> system<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.440> ten<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:49.040> forty<00:00:49.369> two<00:00:49.549> rear

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
a 1by system the ten to forty two rear

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.590 
a 1by system the ten to forty two rear
cog<00:00:50.269> set<00:00:50.600> now<00:00:51.320> how<00:00:52.220> we<00:00:52.280> made<00:00:52.549> this<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:53.030> it's<00:00:53.360> one

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
cog set now how we made this is it's one

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.960 
cog set now how we made this is it's one
piece<00:00:53.839> of<00:00:54.110> tool<00:00:54.470> steel<00:00:54.500> for<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.220> lower<00:00:55.610> ten

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
piece of tool steel for the lower ten

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.579 
piece of tool steel for the lower ten
gears<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.600> then<00:00:57.170> it's<00:00:57.320> capped<00:00:57.619> with<00:00:58.610> a<00:00:58.640> forged

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
gears and then it's capped with a forged

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.789 
gears and then it's capped with a forged
aluminum<00:01:00.589> 42<00:01:01.269> so<00:01:02.269> unlike<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.809> standard<00:01:03.019> HD

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
aluminum 42 so unlike a standard HD

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.620 
aluminum 42 so unlike a standard HD
cassette<00:01:04.250> about<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.790> only<00:01:05.030> thing<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.330> shares

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
cassette about the only thing it shares

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.609 
cassette about the only thing it shares
is<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.890> old<00:01:07.040> Hg<00:01:07.640> lockring<00:01:08.150> tool<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:09.170> this<00:01:09.439> lock

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
is the old Hg lockring tool so this lock

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:10.959 
is the old Hg lockring tool so this lock
ring<00:01:09.859> is<00:01:09.950> quite<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.159> bit<00:01:10.340> different<00:01:10.369> it's<00:01:10.850> a

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
ring is quite a bit different it's a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.410 
ring is quite a bit different it's a
sleeve<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:11.990> pulls<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.500> tin<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.299> pushes<00:01:14.299> the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
sleeve that pulls the tin and pushes the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.499 
sleeve that pulls the tin and pushes the
42<00:01:14.899> on<00:01:15.109> to<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.670> proprietary<00:01:16.670> new<00:01:16.969> driver<00:01:17.240> body

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
42 on to a proprietary new driver body

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.050 
42 on to a proprietary new driver body
now<00:01:18.140> by<00:01:18.350> proprietary<00:01:18.979> I<00:01:19.130> mean<00:01:19.340> we<00:01:19.490> designed<00:01:19.880> it

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
now by proprietary I mean we designed it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.179 
now by proprietary I mean we designed it
but<00:01:20.570> it's<00:01:20.749> open<00:01:21.109> source<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.590> anybody<00:01:22.039> that

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
but it's open source to anybody that

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.209 
but it's open source to anybody that
wants<00:01:22.429> to<00:01:22.490> use<00:01:22.579> it<00:01:22.969> and<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:23.200> currently<00:01:24.219> about

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
wants to use it and so currently about

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.760 
wants to use it and so currently about
95%<00:01:25.820> of<00:01:26.270> all<00:01:26.450> hub<00:01:26.749> manufacturers<00:01:27.469> have

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
95% of all hub manufacturers have

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.760 
95% of all hub manufacturers have
adopted<00:01:28.249> the<00:01:28.399> XD<00:01:28.939> driver<00:01:29.749> body<00:01:30.020> concept<00:01:30.560> but

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
adopted the XD driver body concept but

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.139 
adopted the XD driver body concept but
you<00:01:30.829> can<00:01:31.009> see<00:01:31.159> it's<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.369> lot<00:01:31.549> different<00:01:31.700> it's<00:01:32.060> a

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
you can see it's a lot different it's a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.569 
you can see it's a lot different it's a
very<00:01:32.359> well<00:01:32.600> machined<00:01:33.020> interface<00:01:33.530> for<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.280> 42

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
very well machined interface for the 42

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.539 
very well machined interface for the 42
with<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.659> threads<00:01:35.929> in<00:01:36.109> board<00:01:36.380> now<00:01:37.009> what<00:01:37.460> does

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
with the threads in board now what does

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.279 
with the threads in board now what does
that<00:01:37.579> mean<00:01:37.909> that<00:01:38.090> means<00:01:38.719> we<00:01:38.840> got<00:01:38.990> away<00:01:39.140> with

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
that mean that means we got away with

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.590 
that mean that means we got away with
clocking<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:40.549> clocking<00:01:41.090> when<00:01:41.240> you're<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.509> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
clocking so clocking when you're in the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.480 
clocking so clocking when you're in the
lower<00:01:41.780> gear<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.439> standard<00:01:42.950> cogset

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
lower gear on a standard cogset

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.649 
lower gear on a standard cogset
pulls<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:44.469> to<00:01:45.469> the<00:01:45.789> to<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:46.880> bottom<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.359> when

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
pulls that to the to the bottom and when

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.389 
pulls that to the to the bottom and when
you're<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.960> highest<00:01:48.259> gear<00:01:48.499> it<00:01:48.979> pulls<00:01:49.249> it

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
you're in the highest gear it pulls it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.520 
you're in the highest gear it pulls it
on<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.609> other<00:01:49.729> side<00:01:49.999> so<00:01:50.539> uneven<00:01:51.020> bearing<00:01:51.350> wear

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
on the other side so uneven bearing wear

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.349 
on the other side so uneven bearing wear
so<00:01:51.889> by<00:01:52.009> creating<00:01:52.549> this<00:01:52.700> new<00:01:52.909> locking

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
so by creating this new locking

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.230 
so by creating this new locking
technology<00:01:53.869> we<00:01:54.350> get<00:01:54.499> even<00:01:54.829> where<00:01:55.009> we<00:01:55.280> drop<00:01:55.880> six

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
technology we get even where we drop six

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.629 
technology we get even where we drop six
to<00:01:56.359> eight<00:01:56.479> grams<00:01:56.780> on<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.020> driver<00:01:57.289> body<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.829> a

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639 
to eight grams on the driver body and a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.330 
to eight grams on the driver body and a
wider<00:01:59.270> range<00:01:59.539> of<00:01:59.719> gears<00:02:00.079> what's<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:01.039> bonus

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
wider range of gears what's the bonus
