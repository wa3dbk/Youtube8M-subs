00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 harley / alison, he certainly already 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 get out all your shoes again 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.859
 and today we do something about that 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.759
 a bit to individualize 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.420
 namely this jewelry here so completely 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.420
 have fun with it 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.170
 write live 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.109
 of course we need shoes for that 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.740
 and teachers or something on something 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.859
 in any case not from franz zettl 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.540
 pen and also a pair of scissors and if you are 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.360
 would like a punch and also 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.200
 solve or lie what you are there 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.149
 as well take with you first the first 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.149
 shoe and removed the laces 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.110
 and now we'll do the note 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.399
 as a kind of patterns we go to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.399
 because they fold in a bit 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 Company look the big therefore 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.520
 must all suppressed her because such a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.360
 little bit so you have the fold there 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.950
 and then you could draw that up 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.540
 I just do a little round that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.810
 You can do it for a short or long time 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.810
 as you like 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.600
 look how long the little wings 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.170
 have to be around to say that tongue 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.250
 me once 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.250
 to attach to the shoe 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.780
 then let's see what shapes of the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.780
 must have 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.479
 So I have the whole thing again 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.399
 a little neater and that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.240
 cut out my note was by the way 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.079
 9 cm wide so you just have to 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.340
 look how wide the show is me 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.819
 then draw the one again 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:05.990
 shoelace holes then transfer 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.990
 I put the whole thing on the fabric 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.470
 of course cut that out and then 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.420
 we need the little holes for the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.620
 shoelaces you can do that too 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.620
 Of course, just take it easy 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.160
 very important is just that the material 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.630
 not frayed so that would otherwise 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.960
 not life does not work 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.960
 deal 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.140
 You could take leather imitation leather 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.410
 everything that does not fray felt such 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.080
 things now you bring in the whole yes 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.070
 the forms in which you would like to have that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:09.239
 this lappet I'll cut it now 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:10.320
 here just in such small paths and 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.390
 then do the corners like that 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:18.690
 a bit edgy and that's how it looks 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.020
 finished off that comes now in the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.890
 school and then with the 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.170
 shoelaces attached that really holds 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.930
 super good and is it a very very 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.450
 nice variant of his shoe like that 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.560
 to give a certain individual look 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.760
 Of course there are many more 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.090
 other ways like that 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.549
 You can easily design there 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.440
 Do what we feel like doing too 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.440
 rivets and yes everything possible 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.299
 yes, that looks all dressed up then 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.810
 I think a nice variation around the 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.670
 shoes are a bit more interesting 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.349
 Just do it of course you can 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.760
 Also great in the shade of the shoe 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.739
 but I just have now 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.720
 these things there to show you the times 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.579
 I hope that I like that and that 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.110
 they tried it themselves and others 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.049
 You can then also videos again 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.930
 look at me here because you see on the left 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.840
 we rivet you high-heeled shoes 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.820
 can beautify and on the right 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.380
 you may already be able to join us 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.720
 the knitting beginning since they are still 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.300
 gets colder outside and gives you a whole 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.889
 simple hooded scarf then make hope 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.930
 I had a lot of fun with this 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.490
 Try this video yourself 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.440
 and yes we'll see each other in my next one 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.440
