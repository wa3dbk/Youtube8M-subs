00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.720
 home affairs today 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.670
 the recipe is very simple my taught me 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.939
 we need a friend 1 liter of milk and 1 liter 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.939
 kefir 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.849
 I take kefir and milk so soft 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.679
 bags or plastic bottles to me 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.019
 I really like paper bags because 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.769
 they are processed from the inside and curd 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.239
 sometimes gets a bitter taste 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.790
 the dough would be from the cooking process 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.190
 I take a 3 liter pot to 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.940
 the product is not burnt with strips in her 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 cold water pour out 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:01:07.430
 first milk then kefir i have 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.409
 sour cream residues I will add here too 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:19.140
 do not add the only condition 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:26.759
 old spoiled products now everything 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:29.069
 shuffle turned on eye medium large 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.069
 we do not include the eye so that we do not 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.049
 burnt milk and yogurt if I do 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:38.749
 be small and we will wait very long 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.609
 and now we just have to watch 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:45.600
 the most important fine thing is not to 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:51.149
 let boil if our liquid 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.429
 boils the creator get tough passed 3 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.770
 minutes and as you see already started 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:00.329
 peeling process if you like 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.299
 fine-grained cottage cheese you can now 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.359
 mix again all this mass well I 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.310
 I love when the curd turns into pieces 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.310
 so I will not touch her 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.450
 cottage cheese already 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:20.000
 like so more elastic when 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.740
 cottage cheese will begin to plow as it is 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.480
 the liquid will close boil the process 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.480
 can be considered complete 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:39.000
 You see, he became so pretty 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:44.400
 elastic as if united in such a mass 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.010
 I hand everything and leave it in this liquid 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:53.560
 for half an hour at least let and leave 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:57.250
 I close the lid before beating it completely 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.410
 and left the process of heating me 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.410
 took about 15 minutes 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.080
 top 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.020
 completely cooled but you can already choose 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.740
 from the pan and here there are two ways you 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.050
 you can just take a sieve and pour it there 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.100
 liquid trading and then you have it 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.200
 will wear and then he will 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.940
 there is practically no dense liquid in it 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.000
 it will be but me this option is not very 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.080
 I like to use more 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.900
 skimmer then remains for me a little 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.050
 liquid and cottage cheese is obtained more 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:46.470
 a gentle excess fluid then I can 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:48.110
 just over the edge like this 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.410
 nice 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.670
 we have about cottage cheese here 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.410
 300 350 grams of cottage cheese 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.660
 by the way the rest of the liquid you too 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.630
 can use can a little bit 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.090
 salt and and add add there 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.090
 yawning and get a great drink
