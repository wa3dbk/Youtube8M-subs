and a my take on it we're actually going

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.030 
and a my take on it we're actually going
to<00:02:19.480> prep<00:02:19.690> these<00:02:19.840> by<00:02:20.080> smoking<00:02:20.470> them<00:02:20.740> with<00:02:20.890> these

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040

Tabasco<00:02:21.640> wood<00:02:21.910> chips<00:02:22.210> this<00:02:23.170> will<00:02:23.290> just

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
Tabasco wood chips this will just

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.260 
Tabasco wood chips this will just
reinforce<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:24.130> heat<00:02:24.550> with<00:02:24.790> adding<00:02:25.060> like<00:02:25.240> a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
reinforce that heat with adding like a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.480 
reinforce that heat with adding like a
lot<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.750> kind<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.140> oak<00:02:26.320> flavor<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.100> undertones

around<00:02:55.420> 180<00:02:55.990> degrees<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:57.280> shouldn't<00:02:57.640> take<00:02:57.670> you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
around 180 degrees it shouldn't take you

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.160 
around 180 degrees it shouldn't take you
long<00:02:57.910> because<00:02:58.240> it's<00:02:58.360> not<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> lot<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.720> meat<00:02:58.930> like

to<00:03:10.420> just<00:03:10.600> reinforce<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:11.110> juiciness<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.040> what

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
to just reinforce that juiciness so what

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.820 
to just reinforce that juiciness so what
we're<00:03:13.150> going<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.330> do<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.690> we're<00:03:14.590> going<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.770> go

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
we're going to do is we're going to go

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.100 
we're going to do is we're going to go
outside<00:03:15.270> once<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.390> grill<00:03:16.570> is<00:03:16.690> heat<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.020> up

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
outside once the grill is heat it up

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.510 
outside once the grill is heat it up
we're<00:03:17.620> going<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:17.800> let<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.040> build<00:03:18.190> up<00:03:18.370> to

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
we're going to let it build up to

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.790 
we're going to let it build up to
probably<00:03:18.640> about<00:03:18.910> 300<00:03:19.480> 315<00:03:20.050> before<00:03:20.500> we<00:03:20.560> add<00:03:20.680> the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
probably about 300 315 before we add the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.920 
probably about 300 315 before we add the
chips<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.970> then<00:03:22.120> dial<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.420> back<00:03:22.450> down<00:03:22.780> to

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
chips in and then dial it back down to

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.890 
chips in and then dial it back down to
about<00:03:23.050> 2<00:03:23.230> 22<00:03:23.650> 250<00:03:24.330> with<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.360> indirect<00:03:25.720> cooking

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
about 2 22 250 with the indirect cooking

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.390 
about 2 22 250 with the indirect cooking
so<00:03:26.260> we're<00:03:26.380> going<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.560> get<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.800> set<00:03:27.070> up<00:03:27.100> in<00:03:27.310> a

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
so we're going to get that set up in a

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400 
so we're going to get that set up in a
second<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.880> we<00:03:28.720> will<00:03:28.870> put<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.110> wings<00:03:29.290> on

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
second and we will put the wings on

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:38.450 
second and we will put the wings on

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
sitting at about 230 degrees the smokes

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.030 
sitting at about 230 degrees the smokes
die<00:03:59.690> down<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.050> we'll<00:04:00.140> take<00:04:00.319> a<00:04:00.349> peek<00:04:00.560> kinda<00:04:00.950> at

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
die down so we'll take a peek kinda at

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.120 
die down so we'll take a peek kinda at
the<00:04:01.130> progress<00:04:01.580> on<00:04:01.760> this<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:03.410> remember<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.950> let

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
the progress on this so remember to let

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.070 
the progress on this so remember to let
the<00:04:04.340> egg<00:04:04.580> burp<00:04:05.030> because<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.750> don't<00:04:05.810> want<00:04:05.900> to

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
the egg burp because you don't want to

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.009 
the egg burp because you don't want to
glare<00:04:06.700> any<00:04:07.700> flare-ups<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:11.390> you'll<00:04:11.510> see<00:04:11.690> the

glare any flare-ups so you'll see the

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.120 
glare any flare-ups so you'll see the
sauce<00:04:12.260> really<00:04:12.500> starts<00:04:12.800> to<00:04:12.860> kind<00:04:13.010> of

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.179 

alright<00:05:17.939> it's<00:05:18.150> been<00:05:18.270> about<00:05:18.479> two<00:05:19.229> hours<00:05:19.439> so

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
we're gonna pull these off I priests

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.080 
we're gonna pull these off I priests
Austin<00:05:22.800> probably<00:05:23.219> another<00:05:23.430> three<00:05:23.789> or<00:05:23.819> four

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
Austin probably another three or four

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.529 
Austin probably another three or four
times<00:05:25.189> the<00:05:26.189> grill<00:05:26.819> is<00:05:26.939> gotten<00:05:27.180> a<00:05:27.240> little<00:05:27.389> bit

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
times the grill is gotten a little bit

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:28.879 
times the grill is gotten a little bit
over<00:05:27.719> 400<00:05:28.110> which<00:05:28.229> is<00:05:28.379> fine<00:05:28.560> because<00:05:28.680> it's

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
over 400 which is fine because it's

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:29.990 
over 400 which is fine because it's
indirect<00:05:29.159> cooking<00:05:29.340> so<00:05:29.639> they're<00:05:29.759> not<00:05:29.819> going<00:05:29.879> to

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
indirect cooking so they're not going to

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.459 
indirect cooking so they're not going to
burn<00:05:30.210> it<00:05:30.389> just<00:05:30.569> means<00:05:30.719> your<00:05:30.930> cook<00:05:31.080> time<00:05:31.110> can<00:05:31.439> be

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
burn it just means your cook time can be

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.379 
burn it just means your cook time can be
a<00:05:31.560> little<00:05:31.770> bit<00:05:31.919> shorter<00:05:32.159> so<00:05:32.610> I'm<00:05:33.210> going<00:05:33.330> to

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
a little bit shorter so I'm going to

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.719 
a little bit shorter so I'm going to
take<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.509> peek<00:05:33.719> at<00:05:33.840> these<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.370> look<00:05:35.610> we're

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
take a peek at these so I look we're

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.679 
take a peek at these so I look we're
going<00:05:35.819> to<00:05:35.909> let<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.689> grill<00:05:36.960> burp<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.800> little<00:05:38.069> and

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:38.689 
going to let the grill burp a little and

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:40.760 
going to let the grill burp a little and
that's<00:05:39.689> what<00:05:40.020> they<00:05:40.199> should<00:05:40.409> look<00:05:40.439> like<00:05:40.590> when

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
that's what they should look like when

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.290 
that's what they should look like when
they're<00:05:41.039> done<00:05:41.219> so<00:05:41.520> you'll<00:05:41.639> see<00:05:41.819> they're<00:05:42.000> kind

glistening and all that sauce is

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.800 
glistening and all that sauce is
caramelized<00:05:48.000> so<00:05:48.240> we're<00:05:48.330> going<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.509> pull<00:05:48.689> these
