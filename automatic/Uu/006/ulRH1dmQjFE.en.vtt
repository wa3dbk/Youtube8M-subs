00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
making it very solid oh maybe I'll just

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.460 
making it very solid oh maybe I'll just
go<00:00:44.040> ahead<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.940> paint<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> painting<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.230> blue

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470

one<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> sky<00:00:48.230> again<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> go<00:00:49.680> really

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
one for the sky again you can go really

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.930 
one for the sky again you can go really
thick<00:00:50.510> or<00:00:51.590> you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.950> very<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.430> lightly

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
thick or you can go very very lightly

thick or you can go very very lightly
with<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> water<00:00:54.540> now<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.500> concerned

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
with the water now I'm not concerned

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.470 
with the water now I'm not concerned
about<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.579> already<00:00:56.760> painted<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.329> in

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
about what I already painted it in

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
about what I already painted it in
because<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> blue<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.649> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> take<00:00:59.190> over

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because the blue is going to take over

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.230 
because the blue is going to take over
that<00:01:02.480> if<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:04.289> were<00:01:04.530> dry<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.759> can<00:01:05.789> apply<00:01:06.209> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that if this were dry you can apply a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.879 
that if this were dry you can apply a
few<00:01:07.079> layers<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.219> blue<00:01:08.490> sky<00:01:08.969> in<00:01:09.709> order<00:01:10.709> to

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:10.889 
few layers of the blue sky in order to

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:15.050 
few layers of the blue sky in order to
fix<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:11.909> mistake<00:01:12.530> now<00:01:13.530> me<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.069> think<00:01:14.459> mistakes

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
are cool they lead to some very exciting

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.410 
are cool they lead to some very exciting
things<00:01:18.259> but<00:01:19.259> that's<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.529> me<00:01:19.709> so<00:01:20.299> here<00:01:21.299> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
have it very thick and depending on the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
have it very thick and depending on the
quality<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> paint<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.289> this<00:01:25.619> paint<00:01:25.859> isn't<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
quality of paint to this paint isn't the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.209 
quality of paint to this paint isn't the
best<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.850> it'll<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.719> for<00:01:27.959> our<00:01:28.049> purposes<00:01:28.499> or

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
best but it'll do for our purposes or

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.719 
best but it'll do for our purposes or
you<00:01:29.459> can<00:01:29.639> do<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> very<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.450> lightly<00:01:31.729> again

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you can do it very very lightly again

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.789 
you can do it very very lightly again
I'm<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:32.999> dipping<00:01:33.179> my<00:01:33.329> paint<00:01:33.659> brush<00:01:34.259> into<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I'm just dipping my paint brush into the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.519 
I'm just dipping my paint brush into the
water<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.450> this<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:36.959> give<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.499> a

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:37.529 
water and this will also give you a

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:40.580 
water and this will also give you a
different<00:01:37.950> effect<00:01:38.509> notice<00:01:39.509> how<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:39.779> light

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
different effect notice how the light

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.239 
different effect notice how the light
sky<00:01:41.249> this<00:01:42.060> watered-down<00:01:42.569> sky<00:01:43.139> comes<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.859> more

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
sky this watered-down sky comes in more

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:48.099 
sky this watered-down sky comes in more
as<00:01:44.639> if<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> Sun<00:01:45.479> were<00:01:45.869> shining<00:01:45.929> through<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
as if the Sun were shining through that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.449 
as if the Sun were shining through that
all<00:01:49.109> right<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.409> that's<00:01:49.529> two<00:01:49.829> techniques<00:01:50.249> you

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
all right so that's two techniques you

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:51.589 
all right so that's two techniques you
can<00:01:50.609> either<00:01:50.789> apply<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.479> heavy

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
can either apply it with a very heavy

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.769 
can either apply it with a very heavy
hand<00:01:51.929> or<00:01:52.469> very<00:01:52.799> light<00:01:53.039> hand<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:54.569> next

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:54.779 
hand or very light hand the next

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:56.899 
hand or very light hand the next
technique<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.469> going<00:01:55.709> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.919> with<00:01:56.249> a<00:01:56.429> pallet

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
technique is going to be with a pallet

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.089 
technique is going to be with a pallet
knife<00:01:57.079> now<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.109> don't<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.919> is<00:01:59.069> a

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
knife now I don't know if this is a

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.719 
knife now I don't know if this is a
pallet<00:01:59.520> knife<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.989> know<00:02:00.989> this<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.919> a<00:02:01.979> pie<00:02:02.429> knife

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
pallet knife I know this is a pie knife

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.580 
pallet knife I know this is a pie knife
I<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.569> picked<00:02:03.749> it<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.109> thrift<00:02:04.139> store

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
I just picked it up at a thrift store

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.420 
I just picked it up at a thrift store
for<00:02:04.770> $0.50<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.289> think<00:02:07.349> is<00:02:07.679> just<00:02:07.919> a<00:02:08.039> regular

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
for $0.50 this I think is just a regular

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.010
