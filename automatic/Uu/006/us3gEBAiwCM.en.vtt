00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.740
 good day this time we will talk 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:12.130
 about the model has concluded us 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.200
 proposed in 1972 by singer nicholson 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.250
 today explains the composition 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.480
 structure 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.640
 plasma membrane 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.640
 which tell us that the provision 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.770
 molecular weight of the plasma membrane 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.250
 resembles a sea of ​​clean in constant 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.220
 movement 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.250
 what represents an important aspect 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.489
 of this model because it considers membrane 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.850
 cellular as dynamic structures whose 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.460
 components are very 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.500
 to meet and participate in 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.660
 transient interactions or 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.660
 semi - permanent of different types 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.920
 the basic structural framework of the 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:01.440
 plasma membrane is the lipid stage 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 that is, a double layer of liquid 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.290
 the main one and I ask that they make up the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.840
 plasma membrane is the lipid focus 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.450
 conforming 75% of the lipids of the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.479
 membrane which are of character 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.600
 unfriendly what does it mean to have 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.750
 polar parts like a polar eye 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.229
 lipid the polar segment is the head 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.140
 which contains phosphate and hydroxyl and 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.930
 the polar segments are formed by 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.659
 two tails of long arm acids that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.179
 they are hydrocarbon chains and groups 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.819
 in the tails of the liquid arm acid 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.310
 a loop is created thanks to the doubles 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.319
 links that are present or what 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.970
 It allows to increase the fluidity of the 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.100
 membrane 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.590
 since it prevents the molecules and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.210
 physical are packaged 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.140
 the main ones the polyps of the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.440
 membrane are combated fateful not 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.280
 phosphatidylcholine sheet compatibilize 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.140
 ina phosphatidylcholine among others 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.740
 lipids found in the membrane 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.540
 is the cholesterol whose function is to grant 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.540
 greater resistance to peaceful life 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 or 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.450
 most of the intact proteins 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.569
 and they join with the polar heads 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.959
 the membranes is different 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.709
 they can act as 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.360
 which unite 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.500
 as carrier proteins 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.960
 How is the case 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.010
 and facilitates the 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.940
 the new configuration has the farm 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.470
 of potassium 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.100
 binds to the protein 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.350
 and by this means is released 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.350
 and it was previously attached to the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.990
 outbreak 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.270
 which join 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.710
 on the other hand the membrane possesses in the 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.160
 internal surface or doctor loads 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.440
 negative due to ions that do not allow 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.660
 like phosphate and amino acid rest 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.120
 like glutamate jakarta 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.820
 coming from glucose which is a 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.610
 integral protein present in the 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.639
 membrane 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.430
 also on the outer surface has 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.009
 positive charge and as a result of 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.819
 this potential difference occurs 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:43.040
 a voltage of -70 millivolts and the 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:45.440
 called resting membrane potential 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.860
 in the cell and excitable as the 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.650
 neurons and muscle fibers when 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.950
 a chemical stimulus is produced 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:59.210
 organic light this schooling the 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:02.180
 membrane here - 55 thousand volts reaching 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.150
 its threshold level so it triggers 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.000
 the action potential 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.300
 if the stimulus is not enough 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.820
 strong just from polarizing the membrane ones 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.280
 few divorces so the same 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.340
 returns to its resting state when 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.230
 it is the stimulus 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.080
 immediately when the membrane is 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.780
 find in your threshold level they open 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.020
 the gates of proteins for the 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.610
 sodium ion transport does the 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.050
 sun room 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:37.129
 getting a s2000 voltage and hits 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.449
 subsequently it happens 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:44.149
 the maximum sodium entry point and the 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:47.480
 pianism is called about shot whose 

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:50.000
 voltage is 30 thousand volts 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.850
 which means that now the 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.740
 membrane is 30 times more positive in the 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.810
 interior with respect to the medium 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.600
 extracellular 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.570
 then the floodgates are closed 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.230
 for sodium and those that 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:09.280
 transport potassium producing the 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:12.400
 repolarization of the membrane 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.490
 reaching in the first place a value of 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.669
 zero as the discharge of sodium can 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:21.639
 be so important as to achieve a 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:24.590
 post hyper polarization where the voltage 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:27.320
 reaches at least 90 thousand volts 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:30.050
 that is, the inside of the membrane is 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.449
 more electro negative with respect to 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.389
 membrane potential at rest 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:37.939
 If this happens, the sodium pump intervenes 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:39.800
 potassium to regulate the charges and 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:42.129
 return the membrane you have been 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.129
 repose
