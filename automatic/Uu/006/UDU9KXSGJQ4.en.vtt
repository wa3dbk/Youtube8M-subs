00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.560
 Hi, people, I only look at my life blog. 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.600
 and how we are in the week of 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.970
 halloween in reply to you the tag 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.699
 along created by the channel 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.219
 literary path the first question of the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.149
 tec is consolidated from terror or suspense 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.860
 favorite 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.450
 I'm not much of a book reader. 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.980
 most of the books that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.170
 they did not finish me. 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.840
 conquering so much that they did not exercise there 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.850
 very well the effect on me of terror but 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.920
 there's a book like that I read that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 I really liked it, it's not just about the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.660
 terror aspect but for other aspects 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.489
 of the work that I'm going to explain to you 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.219
 the book in question is the turn of the screw 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.079
 river and james is a classic the book to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.390
 novel tells the story of a protector 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 who starts caring for two children in 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.739
 a mansion and she begins to suspect that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.880
 these children are possessed by 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.159
 spirits 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.100
 The big question in the book is that you 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.439
 can trust the narrative that at first 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.930
 person by the vision of the city hall because 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.820
 book does not make it clear whether this 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.750
 position of spirits is really 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.790
 happening 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.470
 or the fruit of the imagination of the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.110
 city ​​hall there are many 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.330
 about this book and that 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.790
 then it left indications that everything 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.850
 passes the mental state of preceptorship and 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.500
 that's what fascinated me so much that 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.600
 ambiguity of this narrative 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 popping up happening all the questions 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.740
 for anyone who wants to know 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 bit more of my opinion I made video 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.700
 review of this book here on the pro 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.220
 are inter-area when it was part of the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.200
 project and also the observation of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.509
 that the book the girl who could not read is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.619
 a kind of re-reading of the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.689
 screw 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.460
 ah and also for those who want to know the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.130
 book also exists with another title that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.719
 the other turn of the bolt then just to 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.310
 do not get doubts as much around 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.010
 of the screw as to the other 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.800
 screw 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.480
 in the same book the next question is 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.130
 halloween party you need 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.520
 to fantasize about a character from a book 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.240
 What will be my answer is needy harry? 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.580
 potter 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.350
 The third question is a character who 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.460
 It's not from a horror book but you 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.960
 finds scary 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.650
 I do not really know if my 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.330
 answer will fit because you do not 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.040
 It's about a horror book but it's about 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.050
 of a suspense book and in case I 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.390
 I chose here stolen identity native 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.100
 which has a written review on the blog 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.400
 also has video review here on channel 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.390
 also literary production and the character 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.210
 in question that I chose the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.910
 henchman the main character do 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.670
 a year in captivity and she goes through 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.400
 various terrible situations it is 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.130
 psychologically abused 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.260
 different ways the book finally 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.300
 left extremely distressed is a 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.090
 character then that causes me horror 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.190
 here 's this kidnapper because I think 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.650
 much more than a horror of a book 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.360
 of terror that often involve 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 supernatural issues 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.220
 we have here a real horror that I 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.440
 I think it's much more terrifying than 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.170
 any supernatural question can 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.020
 The next question is a vampire and 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.450
 a werewolf and I answer vampires and the 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.550
 fifth question and if vampires are 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.620
 I'm a favorite vampire of literature if 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.450
 formalized to oppose the favorite werewolf 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.209
 of literature in my case as a choice 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.150
 so vampires I will not talk about one and that 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.070
 is interview louis with the vampire a 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.920
 This bank won me all over the 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.680
 complexity of his feelings for 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.450
 all the existential conflict that he lives 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.280
 because he does not accept being a 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.620
 vampire for him still has so much of a 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.330
 human part within him and all these 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.760
 Conflicts of feelings 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.130
 they conquered and made him 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.420
 stand out for me in this vampiric world 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.850
 although I think the majority favorite 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.130
 between them in my son is to be in the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.200
 louis and also just a title of curiosity 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.790
 I think a lot of people might 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.890
 thought he would answer about the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.790
 Edward Twilight because I already said 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.610
 that he is one of my characters 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.350
 but the case of Eduard 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.210
 in people 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.850
 is not because it is a 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.040
 vampire but by the other characteristics 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.900
 of his personality even think the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.220
 edward a gentleman this is one of the 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.230
 main reasons why it is a 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.640
 character so dear to me then 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.430
 In case you had to choose a vampire 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.280
 by his vampire characteristics I 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.720
 I chose luena edward that question is 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.920
 What is a horror book you have? 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.900
 willingness to read 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.000
 in my case here I chose the illuminated 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.280
 this end and I also take advantage of 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.100
 that the stranger also invested in 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.680
 15 which unfortunately I still do not have and 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.270
 last trick or treat 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.960
 Tell a book in a book 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.100
 book thrill I'm going to go 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.170
 indicate one that has absolutely no 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.960
 nothing to do with fear but it was a 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.700
 reading delight and the french kiss 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.980
 Stephanie for whom are the most 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.660
 tasty that kind of pleasure legend that 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.240
 the books that do not make you want to stop 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.580
 that history is a delight and everything 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.220
 very cozy makes you want 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.260
 read ahead then when I thought 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.190
 I like that it was the first one that I 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.440
 came to mind 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.910
 already the prank book does not take a 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.460
 I will not list a book. 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.990
 mischief in that sense the level I 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.880
 I will not indicate here because I 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.740
 I lent it to a friend of mine and in the case 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.750
 I chose liars from there 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.390
 launch of the next publisher already has 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.160
 his review on the blog written review and 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.200
 I chose this book as a trick. 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.930
 because the author was extremely 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.240
 able to manipulate the player 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.670
 so she did a mischief there with the 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.010
 story with her narrative I did not see 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.840
 anyone who has read books now not 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.940
 surprised at the end because the 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.090
 author was really extremely 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.610
 talented and manipulative so I chose 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.710
 mischief in that sense 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.960
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.790
 kisses to all until the next video people 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.790
 I only enter the ball literary life 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.840
 And how are we at halloween week? 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.470
 I 'll answer you the tag along. 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.250
 literary and also the observation of 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.050
 that the book says it is not and also 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.060
 balance is left to the girl 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.889
 who did not know how to read is a kind of 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.889
 rereading the back at sea
