00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.469
 Hello, I am worried because of the rough and sensitive skin as the autumn winter approaches. 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.870
 I have a lot of people and I helped the day with my evening skin care 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.910
 I'll show you the routine. 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.960
 First of all , I would like to use Lip Iran and this make-up remover that I use frequently 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.080
 I'll build it. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 Soak plenty of cotton swabs and make them gently and carefully on the eye. 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:35.820
 Because the skin of the eye is sensitive, please do not rub it too tightly. 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.930
 After cleansing the hue make-up , the second skin 3, which is the point of cleansing 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.890
 Get in the gate. 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:46.260
 Recently launched Clinique Cleansing will use this device. 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.320
 Brush up your usual Friend Form, press the button, 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.879
 You can rub it on your face except your mouth. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:58.980
 I 've been using this product every day for over a week now , 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.020
 Cosmetic doeseo along much cleaner than other cleansing to remove dead skin cells 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.220
 He was eating well. 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.840
 It 's easy to collect waste from the first part of the nose. 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.790
 If you use a brush in such a place, it becomes much cleaner and cleansed. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.979
 As you know, if you have seen eye makeup before, your skin is sensitive to irritation 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.270
 It's a bit red, but the brush is soft and irritating to the skin. 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.250
 I think it's good. 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.159
 U 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:30.320
 give 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:34.820
 The glitter is good for skin troubles and the makeup is not good for the band. 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.090
 That's all. I do not have many such cases, letting their own managed three so I 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.570
 I'm more concerned with managing keratoses by myself . 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.160
 U 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.960
 In fact, the face is very sensitive, and the brush is a little more seedy. 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.090
 Those who worry might like iteusil being soaked in water to the seeds without the use 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.120
 I'll see. 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:01.050
 It's soft enough to brush the tissue so that it does not sag at all . 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:06.090
 But again, it's too soft to worry that oxy-detergency will fall. 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.460
 So there I am on the foundation that you can see yourself out in snow, huh Larsson 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.850
 I'll erase it from the mix. 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.320
 Xu 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:19.420
 You can use skins that have a keratinous management effect. 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:24.820
 Clinique skin care skins are soaked in cotton swabs and along the recovery bones, 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:29.410
 This year I will wipe away any waste and make up the texture of the skin . 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.240
 The back of my ears helped me to the nail, 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.400
 That's how you use it. 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:39.000
 Next, skin food bokbunja eye cream is applied to my eyes and absorbed 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.000
 I can not do it. 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 we 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:58.720
 And then I'll want to write down to repair mistakes st 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.230
 If you apply essence after each body care, it is absorbed, 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.440
 good 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.440
 Oh rock me that dance 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:18.330
 Finally, apply Mamonde Rose Water Soothing Gel to face and neck to absorb 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:23.230
 To give the skin'll eat well in the morning tomorrow, moist makeup is ready 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:27.849
 So far the slip my skincare routine I find myself in the past 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:32.290
 I told you, but if you only work hard on keratinization, you will have a lot of blackheads and whiteheads. 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:35.620
 It's gone, the skin tone is bright, and the makeup is really good. 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:41.549
 News is a lot of people who are suffering from skin down. 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.549
