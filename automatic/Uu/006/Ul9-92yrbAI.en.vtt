 Good evening, I'm happy merry 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.070
 the creator of the Africans hankou this 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.920
 evening of I will go to show the stereotypes 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.660
 of couples because we say that man has 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.870
 always loved in every age 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.570
 but slowly it started over time 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:58.890
 overboard differently in a way 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:58.890
 particular paul 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:14.990
 predominant women no dinner is 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.990
 in other words, it is almost ready now 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:26.869
 something is wrong they just start the kitchen 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.700
 sweet afternoon that I'm there at the stove 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:35.420
 let's get the red photo you will 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.420
 positive 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.090
 misunderstandings 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.670
 then Mr. and Mrs. Paola is exposed 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.930
 fear your problems 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:21.570
 the problem is that I never understand 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:23.610
 what she says she says she doesn't understand 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.710
 right and this is reality 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.490
 but in my opinion he is wrong knowing why 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.480
 now i really background it when she 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.210
 says this thing is not real this is the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.100
 real in your opinion for me no 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:51.930
 or we are alone and all true 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:03:22.860
 yes that jumps it closed it sees it 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:04:00.810
 sees male defeatist laziness 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:04:03.709
 keep or it's bad then he looks head 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.709
 woman raised 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.060
 female bipolarity 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.420

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:23.900
 also because it was but how it is 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.370
 given that he cannot enlighten things 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.920
 in my kitchen it's like you thank him 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:34.730

 gala see Mr. and Mrs. Paolazzi the 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.000
 Today's problem is that couples 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.380
 modern couples are no longer 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.160
 that intimacy that affinity is 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.870
 necessary to carry forward a 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.990
 relationship ie I give you an example no 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.160
 because you have to try to take the 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.230
 little things 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.700

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.560
 things because otherwise we could not go 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.760

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.620
