00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
realistic and close to the anime series

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.950 
realistic and close to the anime series
so<00:01:26.110> when<00:01:26.500> we<00:01:26.650> knew<00:01:27.130> that<00:01:27.340> we<00:01:27.700> had<00:01:27.729> all<00:01:28.120> these

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
so when we knew that we had all these

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.230 
so when we knew that we had all these
possibilities<00:01:29.290> then<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.430> course<00:01:30.460> we<00:01:30.940> started

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
possibilities then of course we started

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.360 
possibilities then of course we started
five<00:01:31.420> years<00:01:31.450> ago<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:32.320> investigate<00:01:33.040> how<00:01:33.310> we

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
five years ago to investigate how we

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.770 
five years ago to investigate how we
could<00:01:33.690> effectively<00:01:35.370> display<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.570> best

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
could effectively display in the best

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.050 
could effectively display in the best
way<00:01:37.990> this<00:01:38.350> anime<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:38.979> this<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.580> what<00:01:39.820> where<00:01:39.970> it

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
way this anime and this is what where it

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.660 
way this anime and this is what where it
started<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.890> when<00:01:41.890> we're<00:01:42.040> fighting<00:01:42.400> in<00:01:42.490> these

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
started and when we're fighting in these

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.420 
started and when we're fighting in these
games<00:01:42.970> you<00:01:43.570> can<00:01:43.750> summon<00:01:44.049> another<00:01:44.740> character

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
games you can summon another character

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.520 
games you can summon another character
and<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:46.210> course<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.570> have<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.750> lot<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:46.990> fighting

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
and of course you have a lot of fighting

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.980 
and of course you have a lot of fighting
moves<00:01:47.950> can<00:01:48.400> you<00:01:48.490> tell<00:01:48.640> me<00:01:48.670> about<00:01:48.880> what<00:01:49.659> what

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
moves can you tell me about what what

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.730 
moves can you tell me about what what
makes<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.590> good<00:01:50.710> fight<00:01:51.010> in<00:01:51.310> this<00:01:51.430> game<00:01:51.640> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
makes a good fight in this game so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.280 
makes a good fight in this game so
basically<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:53.799> think<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.100> very<00:01:54.570> intuitive<00:01:55.570> way

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
basically I think a very intuitive way

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.920 
basically I think a very intuitive way
of<00:01:56.440> conferring<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.770> game<00:01:57.010> is<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.690> provide<00:01:58.690> for

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
of conferring the game is to provide for

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.430 
of conferring the game is to provide for
each<00:01:59.320> button<00:01:59.650> one<00:01:59.860> action<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.490> you'll<00:02:00.729> have

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
each button one action so you'll have

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.810 
each button one action so you'll have
one<00:02:02.440> button<00:02:02.890> for<00:02:03.040> jump<00:02:03.280> on<00:02:03.460> bottom<00:02:03.670> for<00:02:03.790> the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
one button for jump on bottom for the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.440 
one button for jump on bottom for the
chakra<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.540> forth<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.909> other<00:02:06.909> than<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.150> we

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
chakra and forth and other than that we

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.990 
chakra and forth and other than that we
have<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.840> very<00:02:08.229> high<00:02:08.920> quality<00:02:09.129> super

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
have the very high quality super

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.660 
have the very high quality super
techniques<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:11.200> are<00:02:11.409> used<00:02:11.530> with<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.280> chakra

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670
