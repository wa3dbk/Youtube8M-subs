butterflies are all over the place and
it's<00:01:19.140> nerve-racking<00:01:20.040> because<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.400> know<00:01:20.580> what

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it's nerve-racking because you know what

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.160 
it's nerve-racking because you know what
you're<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> go<00:01:21.330> through<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> next<00:01:21.840> day

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you're about to go through the next day

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.080 
you're about to go through the next day
the<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.920> guys<00:01:23.070> need<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.369> understand<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the thing you guys need to understand is

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.670 
the thing you guys need to understand is
that<00:01:24.119> every<00:01:24.540> muscle<00:01:24.750> group<00:01:24.930> has<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> greater

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that every muscle group has a greater

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.310 
that every muscle group has a greater
percentage<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.369> certain<00:01:27.030> fiber<00:01:27.299> types<00:01:27.720> than

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
percentage of certain fiber types than

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.100 
percentage of certain fiber types than
others<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.540> hamstrings

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
others so we know that the hamstrings

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.960 
others so we know that the hamstrings
have<00:01:31.259> more<00:01:31.560> fast<00:01:31.829> twitch<00:01:32.130> fibers<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> quads

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
have more fast twitch fibers the quads

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.179 
have more fast twitch fibers the quads
have<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.479> slow<00:01:33.780> twitch<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.530> biceps<00:01:35.009> have

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
have more slow twitch the biceps have

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.039 
have more slow twitch the biceps have
more<00:01:35.430> fast<00:01:35.729> twitch<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> triceps<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.840> more

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
more fast twitch the triceps have more

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.410 
more fast twitch the triceps have more
slow<00:01:37.320> twitch<00:01:37.590> pecs<00:01:38.280> are<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.090> mixture

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
slow twitch pecs are kind of a mixture

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.270 
slow twitch pecs are kind of a mixture
we<00:01:39.869> could<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.189> you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
we could go on and on so when you

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.630 
we could go on and on so when you
understand<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.130> when<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> understand

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
understand you know when you understand

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.370 
understand you know when you understand
that<00:01:44.820> you're<00:01:45.000> able<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> select<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.229> more

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that you're able to select the more

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.789 
that you're able to select the more
optimal<00:01:47.070> rep<00:01:47.340> range<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.930> specific<00:01:49.590> body

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
optimal rep range for that specific body

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.010

actually<00:03:49.669> in<00:03:49.880> something<00:03:50.389> you<00:03:50.900> know<00:03:50.989> something

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
actually in something you know something

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.190 
actually in something you know something
that<00:03:51.919> I<00:03:52.040> think<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.459> amazing<00:03:52.940> however<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.959> quad

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
that I think is amazing however the quad

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.129 
that I think is amazing however the quad
development<00:03:54.799> is<00:03:55.180> not<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:56.780> know<00:03:56.810> where<00:03:57.049> you

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
development is not you know where you

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.659 
development is not you know where you
think<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.590> would<00:03:57.680> be<00:03:57.829> considering<00:03:58.400> how<00:03:58.459> much

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
think it would be considering how much

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.030 
think it would be considering how much
the<00:03:58.879> weight<00:03:59.060> they're<00:03:59.269> using<00:03:59.629> so<00:03:59.900> keep<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.859> in

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
the weight they're using so keep that in

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.879 
the weight they're using so keep that in
mind<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.900> hope<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:03.590> helps<00:04:03.829> you
