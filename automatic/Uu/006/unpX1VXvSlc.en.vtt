00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.450
 but that's it again in the morning 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.160
 first morning trip yes you know 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.500
 she is well be beautiful as it had 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.720
 but hey I was under the deck of the bridge 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 to imagine we could almost say that 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.530
 it is a suspension bridge 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.949
 but upside down then the cable companies get 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.890
 found under the rug and to the files of 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.350
 big door and go back over the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.059
 doors and its transfers and lauranne in 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.590
 spicy flavors of the boats that get 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.510
 found inside there are others 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.879
 species then as you can imagine 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.170
 this crowd she is very protected that the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.220
 hunting is of course strictly 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.920
 prohibited 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.589
 we block the ballot box for you 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.560
 sworn with the railroad it's the big 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.930
 black headband the bourgeoisie arc dupont 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.549
 say 780 meters above the level of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.320
 the sea so we can say it's pretty much 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.390
 near our attitude right now on board 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.700
 of the boat so if and it has become 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.140
 then chabrières then needles 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.330
 of chabrières and we are very 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.229
 practices here since we serve as 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.460
 barometer 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.460
 then in patois 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.070
 nobody 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.960
 no and it is therefore dangerous to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.320
 approach since before the filling of the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.410
 lake 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.090
 eds leveled all the backgrounds done in 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.100
 are topped with barn with 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.360
 shelves called barrels 6.6 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.980
 in the region because the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.480
 farmers cut their cereals a 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.860
 little before she is ben no 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.200
 it's still a little weird 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.550
 to raise ladybugs not then 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.400
 what do we do with these ladybugs 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.530
 and a little altered on dry foot since 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.930
 the right bank from the campsite du rose 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.880
 everything for example until soliloquy 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.620
 natality at borloo have their is 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.760
 destroyed also to send in this 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.650
 moment and we boast a master 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.780
 of anthropologists be full and one 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.100
 already arrives at the level of the religious fart 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.050
 but to get there, it's still 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.640
 a pity especially since that 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.830
 week she came true 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.209
 jewel of the lake greenhouse ponçon fif then 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.540
 today she belongs to the municipality 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.540
 price 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.640
 why his relatives 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.290
 in Paris 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.460
 made 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.250
 because in times of flood it devastates everything 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.180
 on his way and in the summer when he had 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.160
 need them there was practically 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.959
 the more absolutely it was necessary 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.670
 ways to fix all that we did a 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.709
 dam of the spur of the show on the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.140
 mountain of finally this on the left one 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.330
 sees that it is a small village at 80 this 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.760
 famous urologist village and the brute 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.840
 she lies waiting we could 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.790
 ask is a connoisseur 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.790
 i'm sure didier must know his 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.350
 overalls he if this dam 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.060
 Come anyway EVIALIS enough to have 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.340
 deduced from their calculation that if this dam 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.350
 it's ugly or in its path 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.540
 by the way nothing but the call of air that 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.489
 would do this valve by moving 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.230
 would shatter the majority of 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.720
 windows of the city of gaffes cap 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.500
 important is 12 km from the weight 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.000
 more ready of France 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.769
 so that to tell you what 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.360
 disaster it would be it would really 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.390
 a global disaster without 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.390
 previous 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.180
 it's easy to calculate the volume of the 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.979
 pierre will quote you negra soon here and 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.910
 it happens quite quickly together you 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.620
 says it's very close 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.120
 you arrive at the foot of the young ladies 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.830
 Moreover there are large parking lots 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.180
 you leave your vehicles and you go 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.940
 see them quietly walk more 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.620
 near a view of the saint michel chapel 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.820
 another of the bands his life in the 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.810
 mountains of lans polish on 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.710
 mandates that they are in rebound phase 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.710
 barrel 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.800
 for information 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.979
 so 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.540
 for old drainers only 300 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.550
 millions of people during wake his 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.870
 inhabited module in the new face 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.530
 counter them with it was better 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.530
 thoracic 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.630
 that's one of the reasons 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.940
 but which is right next to the 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.140
 dams so here is the clay 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.730
 there we are in a plain 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.230
 alluvial so adults a 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.640
 stabilizer a who are actually from 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.230
 considerable that come against the 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.210
 elasticity of doing so besides if you 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.490
 do not agree and mac one meter 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.550
 exactly could 781 of 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.570
 trencavel of water inside the batteries 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.610
 in which little by little becomes 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.940
 residences in your road the good 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.940
 now
