ridge on the six of December and so yeah

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
ridge on the six of December and so yeah
I'd<00:01:02.070> pretty<00:01:02.280> much<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.579> expect<00:01:02.969> jaedong<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I'd pretty much just expect jaedong to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.200 
I'd pretty much just expect jaedong to
obviously<00:01:04.260> win<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:04.830> he<00:01:05.189> wins<00:01:05.460> like

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
obviously win this because he wins like

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.800 
obviously win this because he wins like
five<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.500> every<00:01:07.860> six<00:01:08.310> surge<00:01:09.150> matches<00:01:09.659> he

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
five out of every six surge matches he

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.990 
five out of every six surge matches he
plays<00:01:10.110> his<00:01:10.350> win<00:01:10.650> ratio<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.130> ridiculous<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
plays his win ratio is ridiculous I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000 
plays his win ratio is ridiculous I
think<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.540> season<00:01:12.869> he's<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.200> eight<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
think this season he's like eight and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.469 
think this season he's like eight and
one<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.369> something<00:01:14.640> looks<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.299> see<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
one or something looks like we see a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.350 
one or something looks like we see a
nine<00:01:15.840> pool<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.770> jaedong<00:01:17.250> though<00:01:17.520> does<00:01:18.210> not

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
nine pool from jaedong though does not

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.760 
nine pool from jaedong though does not
have<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.570> second<00:01:18.900> overload<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.530> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
have that second overload out so it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
have that second overload out so it
probably<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> nine<00:01:20.970> pool<00:01:21.590> oval<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:22.650> Scouts

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
probably was a nine pool oval or Scouts

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
probably was a nine pool oval or Scouts
going<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:23.970> direction<00:01:24.210> cross

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
going in the right direction cross

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.569 
going in the right direction cross
positions<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.150> still<00:01:27.150> no<00:01:27.479> pool<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.740> Hydra

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
positions and still no pool for Hydra

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.280 
positions and still no pool for Hydra
Hydra<00:01:29.700> might<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.360> 4-12<00:01:30.689> hatching<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
Hydra might be going 4-12 hatching that

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.550 
Hydra might be going 4-12 hatching that
is<00:01:31.409> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.860> absolutely<00:01:32.299> terrible

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
is going to be absolutely terrible

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.520 
is going to be absolutely terrible
against<00:01:34.560> j<00:01:35.159> dongs<00:01:35.340> 9<00:01:36.060> pool<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.780> he<00:01:37.200> still

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
against j dongs 9 pool and he still

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.770 
against j dongs 9 pool and he still
building<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.280> he<00:01:38.369> puts<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:39.000> 12<00:01:39.450> pool

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
building know so he puts down a 12 pool

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
building know so he puts down a 12 pool
it<00:01:39.990> looks<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.350> which<00:01:40.890> will<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:42.060> bit

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it looks like which will be a little bit

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.249 
it looks like which will be a little bit
better<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.810> he'll<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
better you know he'll have the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.810 
better you know he'll have the
Earthlings<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.920> little<00:01:44.250> bit<00:01:44.399> faster<00:01:44.579> than

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
Earthlings just a little bit faster than

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.460 
Earthlings just a little bit faster than
he<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.240> if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.079> put<00:01:46.170> down

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
he would have if you would have put down

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.780 
he would have if you would have put down
that<00:01:46.500> 12<00:01:46.890> hatch<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.460> put<00:01:47.520> down

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
that 12 hatch if you would have put down

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
that 12 hatch if you would have put down
that<00:01:47.820> 12<00:01:48.119> hatch<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.750> would<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:48.960> been<00:01:48.990> an

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that 12 hatch it would have been an

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.230 
that 12 hatch it would have been an
automatic<00:01:49.590> GG<00:01:49.890> looks<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.460> hydras<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:51.030> for

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
automatic GG looks like hydras going for

certain speed fairly early taking drone
off<00:02:12.990> gas<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.770> he's<00:02:13.890> only<00:02:13.980> got<00:02:14.190> two<00:02:14.370> drones<00:02:14.670> on

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910

off gas so he's only got two drones on
gas<00:02:15.210> now<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:16.950> did<00:02:17.100> go<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.580> very<00:02:17.850> very

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
gas now so we did go for that very very

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.480 
gas now so we did go for that very very
early<00:02:18.320> circling<00:02:19.320> speed<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:20.100> looks<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.400> an

early circling speed it looks like an

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
see him being able to break but it also

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.400 
see him being able to break but it also
is<00:03:11.280> jae<00:03:11.790> dong<00:03:11.910> ho<00:03:12.120> jae<00:03:12.300> dong<00:03:12.390> has<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:13.260> know<00:03:13.380> a

micro and macro and zvz play than Hydra

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.449 
micro and macro and zvz play than Hydra
does<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.410> I'm<00:03:19.500> assuming<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:20.070> he's<00:03:20.250> going<00:03:20.400> to

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
does so I'm assuming that he's going to

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.190 
does so I'm assuming that he's going to
be<00:03:20.580> able<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.880> do<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.209> lot<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.630> damage<00:03:21.870> here<00:03:22.140> he

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
be able to do a lot of damage here he

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.170 
be able to do a lot of damage here he
comes<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.560> almost<00:03:23.070> even<00:03:23.340> zerglings<00:03:23.700> getting

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
comes in almost even zerglings getting

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.120 
comes in almost even zerglings getting
kind<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.290> middle<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.680> both<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:25.890> those

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
kind of in the middle of both of those

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.410 
kind of in the middle of both of those
and<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.580> looks<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:26.820> he<00:03:26.940> might<00:03:27.060> lose<00:03:27.270> this

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
and it looks like he might lose this

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.479 
and it looks like he might lose this
battle<00:03:27.630> no<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:28.620> three<00:03:28.800> servings<00:03:29.160> 23

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
battle no but three servings 23

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.979 
battle no but three servings 23
zerglings<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.060> he<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.300> going<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.780> come<00:03:30.930> out

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
zerglings and he is going to come out

hydrogen base which is going to be a

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.839 
hydrogen base which is going to be a
little<00:04:36.509> disadvantageous<00:04:37.319> but<00:04:37.650> him<00:04:37.830> for<00:04:38.669> him

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
little disadvantageous but him for him

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.180 
little disadvantageous but him for him
and<00:04:39.090> we'll<00:04:40.020> see<00:04:40.139> how<00:04:40.259> this<00:04:40.379> plays<00:04:40.620> out<00:04:40.919> this

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
and we'll see how this plays out this

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.279 
and we'll see how this plays out this
spire<00:04:41.699> is<00:04:41.879> almost<00:04:42.240> done<00:04:42.509> and<00:04:42.720> not<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.960> lot<00:04:43.229> of

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
spire is almost done and not a lot of

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.110 
spire is almost done and not a lot of
mining<00:04:43.620> at<00:04:43.710> all<00:04:43.860> i<00:04:43.889> think<00:04:44.099> jaedong<00:04:44.610> would<00:04:45.000> be

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
mining at all i think jaedong would be

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.969 
mining at all i think jaedong would be
very<00:04:45.360> wise<00:04:45.599> to<00:04:45.810> drone<00:04:46.020> up<00:04:46.169> well<00:04:46.440> actually<00:04:46.620> it

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
very wise to drone up well actually it

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.200 
very wise to drone up well actually it
looks<00:04:47.190> like<00:04:47.310> they<00:04:47.400> might<00:04:47.550> be<00:04:47.729> at<00:04:47.819> the<00:04:47.970> same

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
looks like they might be at the same

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.860 
looks like they might be at the same
amount<00:04:48.479> of<00:04:48.539> drums<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:49.050> be<00:04:49.139> honest<00:04:49.550> although

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
amount of drums to be honest although

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.409 
amount of drums to be honest although
you<00:04:51.870> know<00:04:52.050> Jaedong<00:04:53.009> is<00:04:53.159> at<00:04:53.370> one<00:04:53.669> less<00:04:53.909> hatch<00:04:54.180> it

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
you know Jaedong is at one less hatch it

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.790 
you know Jaedong is at one less hatch it
looks<00:04:54.629> like<00:04:54.750> he<00:04:54.870> looks<00:04:55.110> like<00:04:55.169> he<00:04:55.289> still<00:04:55.530> hasn't

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
looks like he looks like he still hasn't

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.589
