00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 and now then only two all have 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.480
 separated in reality if I go to memory 59 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.940
 57 the two contenders for this final 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.830
 we did not say there is no travis diener 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.109
 but the two are not doing it 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.210
 regret like a hand absolutely 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.710
 bills now both clearly yes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.750
 present under a single basket 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.750
 the first to start carlton myers 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.880
 third player and among other things 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.120
 as well as for overall achievements 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.120
 just for triple signings 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.480
 let's see then the performance of carlton 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.300
 myers missed the first but is 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.190
 continuing with the others and riccardo 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.469
 pittis continues to shake his head 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.340
 next to me can make the first mistake but 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.469
 then he takes aim 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.449
 we saw the first basket as it has it 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.039
 ended coldly with the balloon that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.320
 the same is worth six points 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.149
 riccardo you managed to pull 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 with starting your own beer by pulling 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.970
 with one hand and to finish it by pulling with 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 the other one 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.740
 an extraordinary example of capacity of 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.780
 adaptation and desire to work 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.340
 what you've always given everything 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.549
 what is the most difficult position for a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 shooter from 3 according to me from the god corner 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.730
 now some nice guy 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.850
 you can say they were all for you 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.190
 but I say this to myself alone but beyond 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.260
 of all the hard part is 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.390
 undoubtedly the corner because of the many 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.490
 fewer points 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.170
 carlton myers evidently though not 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.110
 they are too much 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.570
 if this last ball I see maybe out 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.180
 maximum time 54 is a mental strength 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.280
 also found thanks to deaths 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.539
 of deep inner motivations and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.119
 here then camper noyes going to 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.990
 conquer so unexpectedly perhaps 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.560
 no this title borders three point 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.590
 all star game contest 2012 2013 all in 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.000
 standing in front of an ageless champion 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.450
 really big and once again 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.209
 great great caldon because 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.819
 really shows proves that the class 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.500
 did not have no time is not so much was 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.290
 really great 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.170
 the times when we play every day 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.000
 the championship is still a big one 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.150
 despite all these having passed 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.150
 years
