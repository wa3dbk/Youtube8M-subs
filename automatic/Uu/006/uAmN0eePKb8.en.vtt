all black so I guess this is just
another<00:01:39.240> configuration<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> monkey<00:01:40.829> bar

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
another configuration of the monkey bar

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.130 
another configuration of the monkey bar
rack<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.390> whatever<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.930> want

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.830 
rack and you can do whatever you want
like<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.680> build<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:44.729> upwards<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
like you can build it to go upwards and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
like you can build it to go upwards and
go<00:01:46.079> straight<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.920> build<00:01:47.189> different

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
go straight so you can build different

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.760 
go straight so you can build different
muscles<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.180> you're<00:01:48.329> climbing<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.020> there's

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
muscles as you're climbing and there's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.280 
muscles as you're climbing and there's
like<00:01:49.920> infinite<00:01:50.840> configurations<00:01:51.840> ours<00:01:52.079> is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
like infinite configurations ours is

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.450 
like infinite configurations ours is
gonna<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> little<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:53.009> different<00:01:53.369> than

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
gonna be a little bit different than

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
gonna be a little bit different than
this<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.880> now<00:01:54.000> ours<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.290> these

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
this and now ours is going to have these

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.469 
this and now ours is going to have these
two<00:01:55.950> things<00:01:56.130> called<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> flying<00:01:56.790> pull-up<00:01:57.329> bar

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
two things called the flying pull-up bar

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.209 
two things called the flying pull-up bar
where<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:57.869> attach<00:01:58.200> climbing<00:01:58.860> ropes<00:01:59.040> at

where you don't attach climbing ropes at
the<00:01:59.310> end<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.090> there's<00:02:00.240> gonna<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> 14-foot

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the end so there's gonna be a 14-foot

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.020 
the end so there's gonna be a 14-foot
climb<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.640> provide
