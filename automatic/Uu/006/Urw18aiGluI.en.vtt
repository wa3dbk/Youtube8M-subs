there<00:02:05.580> are<00:02:05.700> enough<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.000> us<00:02:06.119> within<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> forces

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
there are enough of us within the forces

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.930 
there are enough of us within the forces
that<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.280> what<00:02:08.280> he<00:02:08.399> said<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.729> there<00:02:08.880> were

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
that with what he said that there were

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.470 
that with what he said that there were
through<00:02:09.509> enough<00:02:09.780> versuri<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.619> side<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:12.330> over

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
through enough versuri on side I'm over

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.170 
through enough versuri on side I'm over
the<00:02:12.569> quotient<00:02:12.959> Goretti<00:02:13.170> but<00:02:13.440> right<00:02:13.709> right<00:02:14.180> so

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
the quotient Goretti but right right so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.960 
the quotient Goretti but right right so
they<00:02:15.300> get<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.170> they<00:02:16.319> get<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.730> though<00:02:17.730> that's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
they get it so they get it though that's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.050 
they get it so they get it though that's
what<00:02:18.060> he<00:02:18.150> said<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.480> about<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.230> yeah<00:02:20.060> wow

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060

what he said it about we get it yeah wow
yeah<00:02:22.190> she<00:02:23.190> said<00:02:23.370> we'll<00:02:23.519> check<00:02:23.730> we<00:02:23.850> get<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.269> and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
yeah she said we'll check we get it and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.590 
there's enough of us now wow I wonder so
I<00:02:27.780> was<00:02:28.019> like<00:02:28.820> but<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.940> one<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.269> still

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
I was like but that one I just still

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.290 
I was like but that one I just still
came<00:02:30.780> over<00:02:31.080> me<00:02:31.290> there's<00:02:31.800> no<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.850> circle<00:02:33.180> is

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
came over me there's no the circle is

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.820 
came over me there's no the circle is
already<00:02:33.540> complete<00:02:33.840> my<00:02:34.170> brother<00:02:34.380> mark<00:02:34.650> from

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
already complete my brother mark from

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.110 
already complete my brother mark from
the<00:02:34.890> rainbow<00:02:35.220> gathering<00:02:35.550> since<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> circle

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
the rainbow gathering since the circle

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.580 
the rainbow gathering since the circle
is<00:02:36.180> already<00:02:36.390> complete<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.019> we<00:02:37.080> already

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
is already complete and that we already

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.870 
is already complete and that we already
have<00:02:37.830> achieved<00:02:38.220> what<00:02:38.459> we<00:02:38.489> need<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.790> achieve

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
have achieved what we need to achieve

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.309 
have achieved what we need to achieve
it's<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.600> pieces<00:02:39.930> are<00:02:40.050> just<00:02:40.200> falling

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
it's just the pieces are just falling

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.080 
it's just the pieces are just falling
into<00:02:40.590> place<00:02:40.709> naturally<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.400> don't<00:02:41.610> need<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
into place naturally we don't need the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.910 
into place naturally we don't need the
more<00:02:42.300> we<00:02:42.600> get<00:02:42.720> stretched<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.410> trying<00:02:43.709> to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
more we get stretched and trying to

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.120 
more we get stretched and trying to
force<00:02:44.370> things<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> issue<00:02:45.150> all<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> time

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
force things on the issue all the time

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.070 
force things on the issue all the time
then<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:48.150> less<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.480> will<00:02:48.540> actually<00:02:48.690> come<00:02:48.959> to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
then the less it will actually come to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.020 
then the less it will actually come to
part<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.590> friction<00:02:50.010> will<00:02:50.100> occur<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:50.850> is

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
part is friction will occur so this is

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.490 
part is friction will occur so this is
the<00:02:51.180> land<00:02:51.390> things<00:02:51.660> happen<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.079> wheels<00:02:52.260> are<00:02:52.470> in

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
the land things happen the wheels are in

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500 
the land things happen the wheels are in
motion<00:02:52.590> already<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:54.000> all<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:54.450> is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
motion already and all we have to do is

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.710 
motion already and all we have to do is
just<00:02:54.540> stay<00:02:54.870> firm<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.410> our<00:02:55.530> beliefs<00:02:56.480> stay<00:02:57.480> true

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
just stay firm to our beliefs stay true

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.350 
just stay firm to our beliefs stay true
to<00:02:57.900> ourselves<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.920> what<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.220> right<00:02:59.400> in<00:03:00.269> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
to ourselves and do what is right in the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.850 
to ourselves and do what is right in the
light<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.570> everyone's<00:03:01.290> needs

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860
