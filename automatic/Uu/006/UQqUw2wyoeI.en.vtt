now we're gonna go ahead shutoff and
we're<00:00:43.050> gonna<00:00:43.170> go<00:00:43.650> ahead<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.130> swap<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.670> filter

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
we're gonna go ahead and swap the filter

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.370 
we're gonna go ahead and swap the filter
right<00:00:45.240> now<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:46.890> guys<00:00:47.160> gonna<00:00:47.550> change

okay<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.250> d'Arnaud<00:01:01.580> numbers<00:01:02.180> are<00:01:03.970> 288

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
okay so the d'Arnaud numbers are 288

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.090 
okay so the d'Arnaud numbers are 288

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.600 

go<00:01:52.930> ahead<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.200> run<00:01:53.290> it<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:54.160> we'll<00:01:54.340> show<00:01:54.580> you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
go ahead and run it and we'll show you

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:25.500 
go ahead and run it and we'll show you
the<00:01:54.730> same

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.940 

all<00:02:25.840> right<00:02:26.019> now<00:02:26.170> we<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.440> go<00:02:26.530> ahead<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.709> show

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
all right now we can go ahead and show

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.619 
all right now we can go ahead and show
you<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.129> difference<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:28.920> run<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.099> only<00:02:30.250> made

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
you the difference that run it only made

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.350 
you the difference that run it only made
231<00:02:31.629> horsepower<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.950> 240<00:02:33.879> foot-pounds<00:02:34.330> of

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
231 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.809 
231 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of
torque<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.989> lots<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:35.980> difference<00:02:36.459> right<00:02:36.640> there

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
torque so lots of difference right there

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.690 
torque so lots of difference right there
showing<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.330> 56<00:02:38.220> foot-pounds<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.280> torque

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
showing you a 56 foot-pounds of torque

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.440 
showing you a 56 foot-pounds of torque
difference

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
difference

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.600 
difference
and<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:41.990> this<00:02:42.170> one

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
and on this one

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.200 
and on this one
it's<00:02:44.120> 58<00:02:44.690> horsepower<00:02:45.530> difference<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.070> that<00:02:46.210> so

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
it's 58 horsepower difference on that so

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.300 
it's 58 horsepower difference on that so
just<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.570> filter<00:02:47.900> alone<00:02:48.140> you're<00:02:48.830> losing<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> lot

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
just a filter alone you're losing a lot

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.340 
just a filter alone you're losing a lot
of<00:02:49.490> horsepower<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.900> we're<00:02:51.020> trying<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.710> guys

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
of horsepower so we're trying you guys

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.870 
of horsepower so we're trying you guys
are<00:02:54.350> seeking<00:02:55.100> filter<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.510> way<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.660> go
