00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
under computer software my favorite

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.519 
under computer software my favorite
computer<00:00:23.180> software<00:00:23.390> is<00:00:23.630> millennium<00:00:24.199> harm

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
computer software is millennium harm

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.400 
computer software is millennium harm
software<00:00:25.210> basically<00:00:26.210> what<00:00:26.990> we're<00:00:27.080> gonna<00:00:27.170> do

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
software basically what we're gonna do

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.230 
software basically what we're gonna do
with<00:00:27.560> that<00:00:27.740> is<00:00:27.920> look<00:00:28.250> at<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.490> number<00:00:28.850> of<00:00:28.880> how

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
with that is look at the number of how

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.450 
with that is look at the number of how
many<00:00:29.480> visits<00:00:29.900> per<00:00:30.170> year<00:00:30.199> your<00:00:31.039> guest<00:00:31.250> is

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
many visits per year your guest is

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.059 
many visits per year your guest is
coming<00:00:31.670> in<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.359> industry<00:00:32.839> average<00:00:33.379> is<00:00:33.589> four

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:34.069 
coming in the industry average is four

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:36.219 
coming in the industry average is four
times<00:00:34.399> per<00:00:34.789> year<00:00:35.089> so<00:00:35.389> what<00:00:35.539> can<00:00:35.659> that<00:00:35.690> do<00:00:35.960> for

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:36.229 
times per year so what can that do for

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:39.219 
times per year so what can that do for
you<00:00:36.379> as<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.679> stylist<00:00:37.670> or<00:00:37.789> salon<00:00:38.210> owner<00:00:38.449> raising

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:39.229 
you as a stylist or salon owner raising

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:42.729 
you as a stylist or salon owner raising
that<00:00:39.319> number<00:00:39.739> if<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:40.309> look<00:00:40.489> at<00:00:41.499> the<00:00:42.499> first

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
that number if you look at the first

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.379 
that number if you look at the first
thing<00:00:42.889> is<00:00:42.979> your<00:00:43.100> average<00:00:43.309> client<00:00:43.909> so<00:00:44.210> if<00:00:44.299> the

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:44.389 
thing is your average client so if the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:46.750 
thing is your average client so if the
average<00:00:44.510> client<00:00:44.959> returns<00:00:45.440> every<00:00:45.709> 12<00:00:45.979> weeks<00:00:46.069> so

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
average client returns every 12 weeks so

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.329 
average client returns every 12 weeks so
that<00:00:47.209> would<00:00:47.299> be<00:00:47.389> four<00:00:47.600> times<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:48.019> year<00:00:48.190> that's<00:00:49.190> a

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
that would be four times a year that's a

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.759 
that would be four times a year that's a
$50<00:00:49.909> guest<00:00:50.239> let's<00:00:50.510> say<00:00:50.659> $50<00:00:51.229> average<00:00:51.530> ticket

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
$50 guest let's say $50 average ticket

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.090 
$50 guest let's say $50 average ticket
four<00:00:52.429> times<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.789> year<00:00:52.819> is<00:00:53.049> $200<00:00:54.049> so<00:00:54.379> very<00:00:54.679> simple

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
four times a year is $200 so very simple

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.239 
four times a year is $200 so very simple
math<00:00:55.309> we<00:00:56.269> just<00:00:56.449> take<00:00:56.629> that<00:00:56.659> same<00:00:57.170> guest<00:00:57.530> we<00:00:58.100> get

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
math we just take that same guest we get

00:00:58.249 --> 00:00:59.799 
math we just take that same guest we get
them<00:00:58.369> to<00:00:58.459> come<00:00:58.639> back<00:00:58.699> every<00:00:59.209> four<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.600> five

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
them to come back every four to five

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.899 
them to come back every four to five
weeks<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:00.829> that's<00:01:00.949> our<00:01:01.159> goal<00:01:01.190> four<00:01:01.670> or<00:01:01.760> five

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
weeks so that's our goal four or five

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:03.879 
weeks so that's our goal four or five
weeks<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:02.420> we<00:01:02.839> look<00:01:03.019> at<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.319> single<00:01:03.679> color

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:03.889 
weeks and we look at the single color

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:06.399 
weeks and we look at the single color
same<00:01:04.399> $50<00:01:05.119> clients<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:05.780> we<00:01:05.930> haven't<00:01:06.229> upgraded

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
same $50 clients so we haven't upgraded

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.459 
same $50 clients so we haven't upgraded
them<00:01:06.859> to<00:01:07.070> anything<00:01:07.539> they<00:01:08.539> now<00:01:08.750> come<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.170> 12

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469

back in quicker

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.600 
back in quicker
now<00:01:53.540> average<00:01:54.020> ticket<00:01:54.290> average<00:01:55.220> ticket<00:01:55.490> is

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
now average ticket average ticket is

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.280 
now average ticket average ticket is
very<00:01:55.760> simple<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.300> figure<00:01:56.479> out<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.900> basically

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
very simple to figure out you basically

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.260 
very simple to figure out you basically
take<00:01:57.500> your<00:01:57.650> total<00:01:58.010> services<00:01:58.550> for<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.820> day<00:01:59.000> and

take your total services for the day and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.210 
take your total services for the day and
you<00:01:59.780> divide<00:02:00.050> them<00:02:00.200> by<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.380> number<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.830> guests

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
you divide them by the number of guests

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.340 
you divide them by the number of guests
so<00:02:01.760> let's<00:02:01.940> say<00:02:02.060> we<00:02:02.210> have<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.479> $50<00:02:02.990> client

something that made me a whole bunch
more<00:05:03.090> money<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.660> wasn't<00:05:03.990> until<00:05:04.290> I<00:05:04.650> had

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
more money but it wasn't until I had

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
of the biggest ones for me was the

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.460 
of the biggest ones for me was the
rebooking<00:05:14.370> because<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.570> made<00:05:15.900> sure<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.410> I
