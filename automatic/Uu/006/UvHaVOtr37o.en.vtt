and follows a shank you get to the oil

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.900 
and follows a shank you get to the oil
like<00:01:49.410> that<00:01:49.679> I<00:01:50.750> like<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:52.280> leave<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> bit<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.670> tag

net<00:02:30.520> here<00:02:31.520> we<00:02:31.670> go<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.820> little<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:34.000> there<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.120> go

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
net here we go a little that there we go

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.500 
net here we go a little that there we go
folks<00:02:35.770> that's<00:02:36.770> what<00:02:36.980> we<00:02:37.100> came<00:02:37.280> here<00:02:37.340> for

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.880 

it's<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.630> pretty<00:02:41.840> small<00:02:42.019> morning<00:02:42.590> for<00:02:42.769> these

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
it's a pretty small morning for these

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.120 
it's a pretty small morning for these
areas<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:44.720> small<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.350> can't<00:02:45.860> wait<00:02:46.010> to

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
areas so this is small I can't wait to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.810 
areas so this is small I can't wait to
get<00:02:46.220> on<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.430> big<00:02:46.610> fellas<00:02:46.970> now<00:02:47.720> at<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:47.900> stage

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.670 

we've<00:02:52.820> set<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.150> benchmark<00:02:53.690> at<00:02:53.989> 34

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
we've set the benchmark at 34

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:29.560 
we've set the benchmark at 34
centimeters<00:02:54.980> let's<00:02:55.760> see<00:02:55.910> if<00:02:56.000> we<00:02:56.120> can<00:02:56.300> better

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.450 

mostly<00:03:30.570> down<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.050> side<00:03:31.230> say<00:03:32.630> we<00:03:33.630> go<00:03:34.430> one<00:03:35.430> or

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
mostly down the side say we go one or

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.860 
mostly down the side say we go one or
another<00:03:35.640> fish<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:38.310> one<00:03:38.490> hasn't<00:03:38.670> got<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.030> quite

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
another fish this one hasn't got a quite

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.680 
another fish this one hasn't got a quite
the<00:03:40.020> same<00:03:40.260> sort<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.680> sharp<00:03:41.010> head<00:03:41.250> chases<00:03:41.850> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
the same sort of sharp head chases the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.180 
the same sort of sharp head chases the
fish<00:03:42.900> before<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:44.370> hopefully<00:03:45.920> it's<00:03:46.920> our

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
fish before so hopefully it's our

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.390 
fish before so hopefully it's our
warning<00:03:48.320> we'll<00:03:49.320> see<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.680> couple<00:03:49.710> of<00:03:50.040> seconds

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
warning we'll see in a couple of seconds

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:59.900 
warning we'll see in a couple of seconds
when<00:03:50.610> fish<00:03:51.390> pops<00:03:51.660> up<00:03:57.350> folks<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:59.400> second<00:03:59.760> one

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
when fish pops up folks the second one

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.020

but it's still a you and I'll still make
a<00:04:05.550> really<00:04:06.000> nice<00:04:06.120> fish<00:04:13.910> doing<00:04:14.910> these<00:04:15.060> two<00:04:15.270> rods

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
a really nice fish doing these two rods
