00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello friends how are you in this video os 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.920
 I bring two mini tutorials to do 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 diadem turbans like this that I wear 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.519
 I have put it you see here to me 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.470
 personally in summer I love 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.090
 carry this kind of accessories because they do not 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.800
 they are as bulky as a turban 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.539
 normal and are the perfect complement 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.980
 for any look for an event 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.080
 special or a day that we want 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.240
 dressed a little more so as I say 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.740
 let's make the first two minutes 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.140
 It will be much simpler with 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.180
 textile glue and the second one will be 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.620
 also quite easy but with machine 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.540
 of sewing that will be a little bit more 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.280
 professional so good I hope that you 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.280
 like the tutorials and let's start 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.200
 yes 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.059
 first headband we will need fabric 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.890
 Lycra print that is minimally 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.899
 thick so that the glue does not pass through 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.660
 and of course the textile glue as 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.790
 I already said let's cut a rectangle 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.369
 about 25 centimeters wide and the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.990
 long will be your head contour more 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.550
 about 5 or 6 centimeters 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.409
 this measure you have to see it in function 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.880
 obviously of your head contour 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.950
 but also the kind of fabric that 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.810
 use if it is a very elastic fabric 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.540
 it will have to be shorter if it is a fabric 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.950
 very stiff will have to be longer than 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.570
 all ways I recommend you to do 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.509
 this pretty long rectangle that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.770
 leave enough leftover cloth so that 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.869
 when you have your headband 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.170
 finished at the end you can adjust it 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.759
 well in the head and that on canvas the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.310
 first step that we are going to do is to double 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.140
 the rectangle in half and sew it 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.000
 in quotation marks with glue let's 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.710
 put a line of glue along 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.030
 around the bottom edge and we're going to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.479
 make sure it is all right 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.479
 glued 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.890
 to ensure that it is well 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.660
 stuck we have to let it dry for 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.310
 enough hours depending on the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.630
 glue I have let dry a whole 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.250
 night because the glue that I'm 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.660
 using is quite liquid but 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.700
 Well this you will see it seeing 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.800
 your type of glue what's important 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.990
 is that it is very dry and once it is 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.030
 ready we turn around and we have as 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.770
 the effect of a stance now 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.660
 we will fold the rectangle so that we 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.010
 the seam is completely in the center 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.140
 that this is going to be the inside part of 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.400
 the diadem and let's make a knot that 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.400
 is also centered 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.460
 and we already have our first headband 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.890
 turban almost ready we just have to 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.570
 join the two ends checking well 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.910
 which corresponds to your contour of 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.440
 head and with glue in this case yes 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.150
 it is very important to let it dry 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.190
 You can also use some kind of 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.140
 clamp so everything is fine 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.460
 pressed at the time of drying and that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.460
 the union is very strong 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.879
 Y 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.600
 to do in this video that is this that 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.610
 I'm taking a cost, we're going to need two 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.310
 rectangles 22 cm wide and about 57 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.110
 58 long the first thing we're going to do 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.520
 is going to be folding the rectangles by the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.230
 half and like we have done with the 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.090
 first headband we are going to join the two 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.740
 extremes but in this case instead of 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.290
 use glue let's use the 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.610
 sewing machine we passed a stitching to 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.610
 along the entire edge 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.450
 Once we have the seam done alone 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.520
 we have to turn it around and also 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.830
 we will fold the rectangle that we have 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.320
 created so that the stitching stays in 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.940
 the center of one of the faces now 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.980
 we fold this piece in half and 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.110
 we will take a 3 point very close to 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.530
 edge to a few millimeters leaving a 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.530
 space without sewing in the center 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.530
 ah 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.569
 Y 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.319
 i 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.560
 once we have this stitched we have to 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.030
 pass the other piece through the center 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.769
 hole and we will do the same as you 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.720
 we will make a stitching to a few millimeters 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.580
 from the edge leaving a hole in the 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.050
 center which is the part where 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.050
 they intertwine these two pieces here 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.540
 in this step it is very important that 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.980
 keep in mind that the coastal ones 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.009
 they have to stay inside the part 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.650
 from outside it has to be clean 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.659
 finally we try it on and we join the 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.400
 two ends facing the sides 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.979
 good as we always have a 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.979
 stitching and we have it almost almost ready 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.720
 so that the back is more 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.160
 pretty and we also got puckered what 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.410
 what we are going to do is with a rectangle 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.479
 of fabric that we are going to fold in half 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.000
 and to sew by the ends we will create 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.830
 a kind of strip with which we are going to 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.830
 produce the whole back 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.210
 with the stitching looking up 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:36.339
 towards us we are going to sew the two 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.599
 extremes I have passed as you see also a 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.610
 zig zag so that everything is fine 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.020
 topped but it's not necessary either 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.539
 this type of fabric because I do not know 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.580
 fray and once we have this piece 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.080
 closed around our headband 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.520
 we turn around so everything is 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.469
 inwards you can also give some 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.689
 stitches on the sides so you do not know 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.550
 move do not move in the headband and 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:56.379
 we have our turban headband ready 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.479
 I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.039
 subscribe to the channel that you already know 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.319
 I am constantly uploading videos 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.389
 from twitter sets and I hope to see you very 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.809
 soon in the next video see you 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.809
 bye 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.940
 and
