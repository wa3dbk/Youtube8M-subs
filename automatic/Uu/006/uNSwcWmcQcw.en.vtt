00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.250

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.339
 foot I do not know you but between the 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.979
 6-0 with chelsea and between 4 3 with

 also the 6 3 with liverpool 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.829
 also always begging in short a 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.290
 very nice football weekend are who 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.900
 announces itself and and what took place this 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.180
 last weekend so bah if you were 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.650
 not the beast pine you have to see again 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.210
 replays honestly it's true we 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.070
 really exploded honestly 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.089
 last week phase before the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.670
 soccer 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.490
 irl and ben here we see this team 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.560
 loïck peace now so that's right 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.600
 I'm a little disappointed he misses 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.280
 some small no I would say good by 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.780
 example that's wayne rooney who put a 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.170
 doubled with a goal 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.180
 enormously h at the hall of the line 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.130
 median is also lionel messi who has 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.300
 still put a triplet in a clasico 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.950
 it's not all players who are 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.290
 able to do that even if it's true 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.520
 that now good here are the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.250
 messi no longer needs to do his 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.060
 evidence in the face say concretely 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.800
 it is true that I was a little bit 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.300
 disappointed that these two players do not 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.980
 not present in this image yes 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.170
 but it's still a very beautiful 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.730
 thyroid should move to the presence at 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.720
 the presentation of the team then after 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.280
 we will do case by case as 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 so usually the team 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.580
 so she's composed to intense guys 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.380
 and benoît costil thief who made a 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.600
 good performance times i'm not going to say 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.250
 no more but did not do it either 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.960
 the match of his life here is the om 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.729
 it's true that the guards do not have 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.930
 been exceptional because I 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.270
 found I did not find he had 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.470
 a lot of exceptional goalkeeper this 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.330
 good weekend especially seen by the fact not 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.950
 to say obala had a lot of office 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.350
 anyway this weekend and it's true that 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.729
 here is a good guy at the sulky anyway 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.590
 makes a good match against the om sees the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.020
 reindeer victory 1 0 he made his taf 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.840
 defense while they were composing I 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.510
 not going to say that of unknown but that's it 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.280
 what finally duo I know no 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.600
 Coelho I absolutely do not know 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.400
 good after it is me maybe who is 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.540
 uneducated but I think I'm not 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.330
 the only one in this case against the door 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.770
 I knew I mean in the mouth 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.970
 pretty good French pensions 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.290
 the bilbao violist 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.180
 it is true that he made a very good 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.820
 match honestly this weekend in 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.950
 england but have not there it is 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.690
 there is not a huge here either 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.290
 match but now he's done a pretty good 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.060
 match after middle left we put 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.750
 bonaventure and rexel touré and fuego es10 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.850
 Officially missed the little fridge you go 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.980
 oscars in a word c is in left mis 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.790
 ronaldo iniesta and stopping we had sua 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.260
 is what is missing 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.930
 there were also real estate here 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.320
 who put a triplet with with with 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.299
 rather with the stat atalante finally yes 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.170
 this is the gata lanta it's true that 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.880
 I might have mini mobile is 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.709
 also personally but hey it 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.120
 after that, it remains the choice of life 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.890
 so are the guys now we're going 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.440
 go from case to case for me the most 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.760
 big toy in sight only to a players that 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.709
 I personally waited more 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.480
 it is obviously there in turn and 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.870
 here are the guys there and toured who are passing 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.989
 are 17 speed at 78 2 74 's striking at 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.709
 79 2 82 clamp at 81,2 that's nineteen of 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:35.350
 dribble at 82.83 defense at 85 and 84 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.540
 from head to 85 honestly huawei 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.129
 newspaper do you see you do not see my gesture 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.689
 there I think I mean honestly 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.269
 there's gone who's going I think cost a 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.590
 fucking blandin but he'll have to get 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.750
 have gone through this little day here is 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.459
 to try to test yves then there I 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.950
 think in 400 miles more than 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.930
 pour zola when he would go out the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.430
 contribution the 900 miles et cetera there 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.989
 will go down I think he'll turn to 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.310
 around 400 500 miles around 16h in 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.959
 anyway and it's true that there is always 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.310
 and will I think maybe lemay middle 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.659
 defensive finally with regards to the game in 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.359
 booster course of course even if in 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.180
 regular personally irl this is the 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.760
 better I think it's a 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.019
 best and permissions I think 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.840
 he knows how to do everything 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.579
 Menes stone is that it's true 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.109
 here is cheer up and it's been since I 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.120
 do not know how many weeks that deserve 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.740
 to be in this in a team loïck and 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.169
 there is finally now with the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.210
 second is suarez who who who 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.810
 who is going out for the third time and well 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.590
 booster, which goes from 88 to 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.630
 81 11 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.060
 fucking no way into account guys 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.160
 since early fifa 14 anyway 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.349
 Suarez took easiest ago more 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.990
 five scenarios sims and like as Oscar 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.789
 that's who took the 82 basic cold state 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.430
 who took it now with flavor 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.990
 185 with took +3 it's enormously 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.169
 honestly in a fall to his son to 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.810
 a chair that already goes to 91.9 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:01.810
 general which goes from 90 speed to 85 from 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:05.620
 85 94.66 82.91 within striking to pass to 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.970
 dribbling at 94.57 defending to 72.15 from 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.710
 the head 1 82th here I have nothing to say 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.139
 but we will go we will go to whom 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.900
 win older at the robots it's iniesta 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.860
 having him go iniesta who did 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.840
 exquisite to offer the match 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.370
 honestly with the barca I think that 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.139
 it's at the man of the match honestly 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.400
 even though it's rick di maria did a 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.349
 excellent match with the real 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.370
 unfortunately I would say for the 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.280
 first 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.690
 half time iniesta here he helped everything done 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.380
 I would say here he scored the first 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.419
 goal he snapped the penalty kick from the 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.370
 victory if I can say that messi has 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.169
 obviously put in the bottom he 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.780
 maybe made a pass for messi 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.790
 that I do a plus anyway but 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.630
 it's true that iniesta of lancome that I 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.270
 do not think he made passes from 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.979
 for ants cif in all well it's 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.840
 true that iniesta I branch deserves this 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.720
 gartside harting formations that can 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.919
 are 15 speed to 76 212 of strike to 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:03.190
 114.91 to 93 2 91 dribble to 93 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:05.680
 66 h67 and five year firm 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.330
 from the head to 57 here and the last ones 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.710
 guys last because yes I have 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.380
 selected only four today 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.560
 sorry I'm avenging you I tell you that again 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.180
 but hey it's Oscar Ballhaus who has good 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.310
 his fiancee was obliged who is a blues 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.470
 a purpose there she rolled out that her prices and 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.320
 finally talk of opposing the rout here 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.470
 rather than these prizes pleasure it's 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.060
 come here to be more picky 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.320
 considering that yes it was his eleventh match and 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.599
 it is true that he had a very beautiful 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.060
 birthday gift with the 6-0 who 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.099
 are taken in full face manga chelsea 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.229
 that's a little bit 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:40.000
 that's who we played we're going to say who 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.750
 now scares more and more at 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.210
