notice<00:01:09.310> these<00:01:09.430> pockets<00:01:09.939> here<00:01:10.180> we're<00:01:10.570> going<00:01:10.689> to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
notice these pockets here we're going to

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.800 
notice these pockets here we're going to
use<00:01:10.899> those<00:01:11.080> later<00:01:12.450> we're<00:01:13.450> going<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.659> need<00:01:13.750> a

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
use those later we're going to need a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.130 
use those later we're going to need a
total<00:01:14.049> of<00:01:14.229> fourteen<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:14.950> these<00:01:15.040> pieces<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
total of fourteen of these pieces you

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.200 
total of fourteen of these pieces you
can<00:01:17.320> watch<00:01:17.530> as<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.860> make<00:01:17.890> another<00:01:18.280> one<00:01:18.490> or<00:01:18.820> skip

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
can watch as I make another one or skip

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:35.890 
can watch as I make another one or skip
ahead

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:02:09.410 

you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
so when you've got two of these hold

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.720 
so when you've got two of these hold
each<00:02:12.010> piece<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.520> exactly<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.120> same<00:02:13.150> direction

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
each piece in exactly the same direction

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.640 
each piece in exactly the same direction
slide<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.880> two<00:02:16.030> tips<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.480> one<00:02:16.690> piece<00:02:16.930> into<00:02:17.560> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
slide the two tips of one piece into the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.780 
slide the two tips of one piece into the
two<00:02:17.800> pockets<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.700> other<00:02:18.819> piece<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:21.610> like

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
two pockets of the other piece just like

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.400 
two pockets of the other piece just like
that<00:02:24.209> alright<00:02:25.209> let's<00:02:25.480> skip<00:02:25.720> ahead<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:26.020> bit<00:02:26.200> as

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
that alright let's skip ahead a bit as

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.740 
that alright let's skip ahead a bit as
you<00:02:27.190> start<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.730> get<00:02:27.850> five<00:02:28.150> or<00:02:28.360> more<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.570> these

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
you start to get five or more of these

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.330 
you start to get five or more of these
things<00:02:29.080> linked<00:02:29.440> together<00:02:29.560> you're<00:02:30.160> going<00:02:30.280> to

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
things linked together you're going to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.280 
things linked together you're going to
find<00:02:30.520> it's<00:02:30.730> much<00:02:30.880> easier<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.630> keep<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.990> links

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
find it's much easier to keep the links

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.729 
find it's much easier to keep the links
on<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> table<00:02:32.920> as<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.220> insert<00:02:33.520> them<00:02:39.450> and
