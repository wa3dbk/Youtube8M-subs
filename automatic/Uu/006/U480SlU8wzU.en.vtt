were<00:00:25.949> true<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.400> game<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.849> had<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> adapt

this<00:00:27.480> gem<00:00:27.750> slick<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.250> didn't<00:00:29.429> expect<00:00:29.670> them

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
this gem slick and we didn't expect them

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.759 
this gem slick and we didn't expect them
to<00:00:29.970> pick<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.480> PO<00:00:30.689> comp<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.410> i<00:00:31.470> think<00:00:31.679> we

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
only got six dragons during week one of

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.650 
only got six dragons during week one of
the<00:00:45.120> entire<00:00:45.649> super<00:00:46.649> weak<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.820> focus<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the entire super weak was it a focus to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.299 
the entire super weak was it a focus to
shut<00:00:48.960> down<00:00:48.989> dragons<00:00:49.559> from<00:00:49.680> rock<00:00:49.890> app<00:00:50.039> because

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
shut down dragons from rock app because

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.979 
shut down dragons from rock app because
they<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.850> good<00:00:51.059> at<00:00:51.180> them<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
they are pretty good at them or was it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.540 
they are pretty good at them or was it
just<00:00:52.020> compositional<00:00:52.800> based<00:00:52.980> why<00:00:53.190> were<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
just compositional based why were you so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.450 
just compositional based why were you so
focused<00:00:53.760> yeah<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.780> think<00:00:54.960> grandest<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.920> this

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
focused yeah I think grandest in this

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.250 
focused yeah I think grandest in this
matter<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.270> dragon<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.840> important<00:00:58.199> I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
matter the dragon is really important I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.930 
matter the dragon is really important I
think<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.680> team<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> gets<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.579> Dragons

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
think the team that gets the Dragons

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.479 
think the team that gets the Dragons
wins<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.590> drain<00:01:01.800> control<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.250> really

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
wins so drain control is really

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.399 
wins so drain control is really
important<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.879> since<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.750> had<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:03.960> much<00:01:04.080> pork

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
important and since I had so much pork

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.370 
important and since I had so much pork
they<00:01:05.360> like<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.659> couldn't<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:07.049> contest

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
they like they couldn't really contest

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.750 
they like they couldn't really contest
them<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.860> could<00:01:08.010> doesn't<00:01:08.280> flank<00:01:08.580> them

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
them because we could doesn't flank them

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.660 
them because we could doesn't flank them
engage<00:01:09.180> them<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.540> also<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.280> play<00:01:11.460> was

like<00:01:11.939> such<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> poor<00:01:12.510> calm<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.290> can't<00:01:13.530> really

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
like such a poor calm you can't really

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
something and then second of all I think

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.679 
something and then second of all I think
the<00:01:40.549> way<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.909> win<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.180> game<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.540> has

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the way you can win the game now has

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.240 
the way you can win the game now has
changed<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.140> before<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.799> could<00:01:44.040> just

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
changed because before you could just

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.520 
changed because before you could just
pick<00:01:44.399> nedeli<00:01:44.790> arrow<00:01:45.060> zigs<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.200> poke

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
pick nedeli arrow zigs and you poke

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050 
pick nedeli arrow zigs and you poke
really<00:01:46.950> hard<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.549> push<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:47.939> away

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
really hard and you just push them away

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.280 
really hard and you just push them away
from<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.420> tower<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.630> win<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.930> way<00:01:49.229> but

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
from the tower and win that way but

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
from the tower and win that way but
that's<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:50.340> hard<00:01:50.520> nowadays<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.450> think

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that's really hard nowadays and I think

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.120 
that's really hard nowadays and I think
that's<00:01:52.110> why<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> go<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.619> object<00:01:52.979> us

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
that's why you have to go for object us

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.219 
that's why you have to go for object us
much<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.390> objective<00:01:54.390> control<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.810> strategy

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
much more objective control and strategy

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
much more objective control and strategy

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
factor in taking down alliance oh I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.410 
factor in taking down alliance oh I
think<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> dragon<00:02:08.550> control<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.060> sure<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
think it's the dragon control for sure I

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.300 
think it's the dragon control for sure I
think<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.170> are<00:02:10.259> both<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.649> good<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.069> think

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
think we are both really good I think

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.130 
think we are both really good I think
actually<00:02:11.459> they're<00:02:11.879> like<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.750> best<00:02:12.780> team

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
actually they're like the best team

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.640 
actually they're like the best team
right<00:02:13.500> now

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
right now

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.460 
right now
on<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.860> LCS<00:02:14.250> he<00:02:14.790> wears<00:02:15.030> yes<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.230> will<00:02:16.379> be

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
on the LCS he wears yes so it will be

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.660 
on the LCS he wears yes so it will be
really<00:02:16.620> hard<00:02:16.860> much<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.489> definitely
