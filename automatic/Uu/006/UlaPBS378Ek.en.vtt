 my name is julien I'm new to 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 youtube and I'm going to make videos that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.690
 in the field of news 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.410
 technology 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.230
 So it can be quite large it will 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.050
 for example the last one 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 bluetooth speaker of the moment up to 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 try to present yourself also a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.810
 quality content and pretty videos 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.349
 regular I will try once 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.570
 two weeks 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.840
 we find ourselves immediately for the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.059
 first video on a test that will be the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.690
 test of a bluetouff speaker at home 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.879
 philips go to small we end up 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.629
 as I wanted to said previously on a 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.989
 little is a bluetouff speaker of the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.600
 philips brand given under the name of 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.609
 philips wireless speaker under the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 reference bt without them walk 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.290
 also using a handset mode 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.210
 free you can see here the microphone 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.920
 integrated 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.630
 we will go around the characteristics 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 using the box so we can see 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.170
 an autonomy of 8 hours which is 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.470
 pretty much for the price of this little 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.900
 pregnant that vary roughly in 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.619
 30 euros it is compatible with all 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:39.470
 these devices 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:39.470
 this is flying bluetooth 4.0 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.220
 so as you want said she has 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.420
 also an integrated microphone and she 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.420
 has a rechargeable battery 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:58.490
 now go around the little 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:00.649
 pregnant and if you can see so the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.520
 call button hands-free kit when one 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.100
 receives a call 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.759
 a little unhooked with this button 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.790
 then also sees a usb port here 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.940
 to charge your device 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.680
 we also see the command button 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.780
 so in off bluetouff mode or so 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.800
 Auxiliary and 3.5 jack 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:32.630
 so for you to plug in 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.250
 any device here is where 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.569
 I will now connect a 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.190
 smartphone on this little enclosure in 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.010
 bluetouff votes you just have to put 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:51.799
 the button on bluetooth mode as 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.470
 this break the words of the auxiliaries 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.040
 when the light is white and there in 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.120
 bluetooth mode 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.820
 you have to go audio it's not easy 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.820
 because it's going so fast we see there 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.959
 so we see that this one are flashing 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.390
 one thing is to go in the settings 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.730
 patterns of my smartphone one finds oneself 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.410
 right away for a little soundtrack 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.320
 so you can go a little bit 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.700
 account of the sound quality of this 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.700
 pregnant right now 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.900
 m 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.900
 and
