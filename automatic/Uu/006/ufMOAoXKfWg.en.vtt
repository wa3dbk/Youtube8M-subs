00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the actual motion we're going to start

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.729 
the actual motion we're going to start
we<00:00:36.600> could<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> right<00:00:37.440> side

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
we could do all go on the right side

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.340 
we could do all go on the right side
drag<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> left<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.719> dragging<00:00:40.230> on
