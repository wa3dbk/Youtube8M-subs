00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hello dear user, we are looking 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.030
 today the updated theory 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.300
 driving school per 20 13 safe and fast 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.059
 to the driver's license and just want to 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.560
 even our knowledge is still testing and you 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.779
 Show it all in the app 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220
 discover the fabian makes power equal 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.490
 a bit of let's look first 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.930
 time here the scope of the app 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.550
 this is almost the home screen and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.740
 you can see the different ones here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.740
 Select categories and ask questions 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 learn and how it was very short 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.120
 in traffic times inside and how to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.340
 looks have graduated two percent and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.930
 if we are here for example and that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.030
 want to look at traffic behavior 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.680
 and you want to practice a bit 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.120
 read through the question and the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.340
 just click on correct answers 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.289
 to make it a bit more exciting 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.360
 However, we directly into one 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.010
 test series that you can create here 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.770
 we'll just take a new one 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.960
 By the way, test will not exist 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.420
 our driving license live in front of the camera 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 that's what the shredder does 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.439
 so it's clear that you're okay 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.619
 also about what here , of course 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.460
 what do they have to expect if they do 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.780
 want to overtake 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.150
 It has also turned into a wintry picture 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.100
 now fits season with ours 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.630
 processed cyclist and suddenly 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.700
 on the oncoming traffic with slide 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.960
 Dangers of content for the strong 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.960
 it was suspected in the plants 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.290
 I'll think okay if an hour's time 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.509
 believe him 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.770
 it will probably only be evaluated if we 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.930
 I'm finished, I do not know anymore 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.380
 Ask ten questions in one test 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.590
 the existence 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.640
 i would say 30 the ship is 38 years old 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.229
 of course that makes sense she was after 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.880
 turn right to behave by 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.500
 Turn the cyclist because of the engine 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.630
 ran traffic theoretically year 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.590
 sure shame but 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.579
 how do you become nice and leave that 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.890
 drive straight ahead 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.090
 was down counters then it must always 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.860
 because you are not so good there silva 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.659
 and have to count 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.899
 pedestrians probably children come suddenly 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.390
 between vehicles in front of doors 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.549
 while people often know how to write 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.929
 to shear moving vehicles 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.119
 unexpectedly he is doing now 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.890
 without each other 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.510
 The graphics are actually pretty well done 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.950
 that everything retina optimizes the writing 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.750
 is very big here on the ipad on the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.890
 iphone is indeed worth some stock market 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.380
 everything a little bit smaller 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.870
 and as I said the graphics the pictures 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.610
 are definitely well done on 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.380
 In any case why is it possible 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.459
 a driver grant his own right of way 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.579
 not at the next coalition 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.440
 We perceive the dark picture 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.700
 Continuous lighting can be to the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.440
 Adoption of a crossroads 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.120
 having priority is still possible 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.410
 expand on the street 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.200
 impression of an incident road 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.209
 But cobblestones as far as is 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.980
 like this examining guy is 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.709
 that is how good we can be 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.510
 Solution not if now ask 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.690
 we all do not go through I know 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.870
 not many must be short 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.959
 interrupt and ask 25 again 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.400
 would rise exactly and I live my life 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.380
 we can try it for ourselves 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.049
 works and studies here too 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.310
 Take a short break and guess 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.680
 little further know so there we are 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.019
 Again there are three questions and then 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.370
 will show if we are ours 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.600
 driver's licenses live here in front of the camera 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.430
 have to shred or not even that 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.590
 answer next question what can on 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.579
 wet lane to act planing so 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.340
 smooth water 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.650
 that's probably too high 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.739
 speed crazy tires think 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.889
 I do not feel in the roadway yes 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.540
 but could actually be good what 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.069
 changes with the guidance of a 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.769
 two-axle trailer that behind one 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.419
 Car trailer drive always flows 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.340
 the acceleration capacity decreases yes 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.050
 the stability certainly does not increase 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.910
 when turning and 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.400
 somehow I would need more space 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.840
 then say last question it will be 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.030
 exciting I have my wallet 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.560
 sparing if not paid 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.240
 always said we shred like that 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.860
 license in which case we are allowed 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.920
 after 200 meters on the left 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.010
 Continue driving lanes 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.260
 all this increased to 20 because the whole 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.350
 people with their mirrors not 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.210
 it is good that you have something 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.180
 answer goal right when I first 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:24.590
 I am allowed to anticipate that is yes 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:25.310
 that will probably get 18 now 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.770
 error points 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.570
 her license goes now really 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.570
 wheels falls 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.740
 then you still need us but ask 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.300
 like what we did wrong in 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.970
 a residential area reuter on the ball from the foot 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.320
 have to rule missed long after 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.700
 should not dodge 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.360
 I stay so I do not brake on 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.310
 the market does matter courage so that's 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.150
 is required when the ball is so close 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.240
 no longer brake rich friends 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.040
 which daytime stephen rea well the 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.540
 should have been there and not so sure 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.910
 We suspected at dusk 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.700
 and at dawn then probably too 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:20.210
 well you can handle it i believe it 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:21.380
 is not so close to a cross now 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.270
 and you can not see what 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.660
 So you should generally do it yes 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.979
 you should make right before left but 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.750
 they do not want that, they just want it 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:34.460
 just watch and communicate 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.680
 well so we because I have the 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.050
 driver's license brought exactly the right thing to you 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.080
 Some of you liked it because of you 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.940
 of course less profile enough that is 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:51.860
 so clear stimulation of the driver's license 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:53.780
 Please, I have to drive there today 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.660
 evening we will practice again then 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.850
 seen what she thought was cool 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.120
 gave game center successes that I can do so 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:05.450
 from any other app I'd say for 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.039
 89 cent you can in any case to 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.110
 suggest there are apps him in any case 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.560
 more expensive and through the update has become 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.270
 here in the theory again that the 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.530
 graphic featuring also improves 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.570
 if it is not nine on the ipad now 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.130
 plus ultra is definitely absolute 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.430
 So there is enough of us 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.430
 buy recommendation
