community<00:01:59.149> but<00:02:00.149> yeah<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:01.350> excited

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
community but yeah I'm really excited

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
community but yeah I'm really excited
for<00:02:01.740> these<00:02:01.890> dynamic<00:02:02.340> maps<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:03.420> think<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.930> they

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
for these dynamic maps I think we they

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.410 
for these dynamic maps I think we they
kind<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.680> categorize<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.640> couple<00:02:06.030> maps<00:02:06.210> in

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
kind of categorize a couple maps in

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.440 
kind of categorize a couple maps in
black<00:02:06.600> ops<00:02:06.810> 2<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.380> dynamic<00:02:07.770> maps<00:02:08.250> we've<00:02:09.209> got

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
black ops 2 as dynamic maps we've got

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.350 
black ops 2 as dynamic maps we've got
hydro<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:11.129> one<00:02:11.370> because<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.670> water<00:02:12.060> like

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
hydro as one because that water like

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.780 
hydro as one because that water like
comes<00:02:12.629> through<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> middle

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
comes through the middle

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.400 
comes through the middle
we've<00:02:14.790> got<00:02:14.940> expressed<00:02:15.540> with<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> train<00:02:16.230> that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
we've got expressed with the train that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.050 
we've got expressed with the train that
comes<00:02:16.560> through<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.890> middle<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.730> think

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
comes through the middle and I think

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.330 
comes through the middle and I think
they<00:02:18.210> said<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:18.870> called<00:02:19.110> magma<00:02:19.470> dynamic<00:02:20.160> map

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
they said they called magma dynamic map

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.620 
they said they called magma dynamic map
even<00:02:20.640> though<00:02:20.700> it's<00:02:20.790> not<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.120> dynamic<00:02:21.270> you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
even though it's not really dynamic you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720 
even though it's not really dynamic you
just<00:02:21.810> don't<00:02:22.500> step<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> lava<00:02:23.160> because

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
just don't step in the lava because

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.870 
just don't step in the lava because
you'll<00:02:24.450> die<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:26.040> totally<00:02:26.610> forgot<00:02:26.820> about

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
you'll die and I I totally forgot about

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.490 
you'll die and I I totally forgot about
the<00:02:27.150> hydro<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.510> don't<00:02:27.630> even<00:02:27.690> know<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.080> hydro

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the hydro I don't even know that hydro

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.320 
the hydro I don't even know that hydro
had<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.310> water<00:02:29.550> thing<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.000> was<00:02:30.120> playing

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
had that water thing and I was playing

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330 
had that water thing and I was playing
it<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.690> yesterday<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.620> day<00:02:31.650> before<00:02:31.770> I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
it like yesterday or the day before I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.250 
it like yesterday or the day before I
died<00:02:32.850> like<00:02:33.000> six<00:02:33.330> times<00:02:33.480> from<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.020> so

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
died like six times from it and so

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.030 
died like six times from it and so
annoying<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:35.400> um<00:02:36.320> yeah<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> hope<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.890> it's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
annoying but um yeah I hope that it's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.740 
annoying but um yeah I hope that it's
it's<00:02:38.250> not<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> don't<00:02:39.330> think<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
it's not like that and I don't think the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.450 
it's not like that and I don't think the
new<00:02:39.870> dynamic<00:02:40.290> maps<00:02:40.470> are<00:02:40.680> gonna<00:02:40.770> be<00:02:41.070> like<00:02:41.280> that

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
new dynamic maps are gonna be like that

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.350 
new dynamic maps are gonna be like that
I<00:02:41.490> don't<00:02:41.640> think<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:41.970> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.120> be<00:02:42.180> like

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
I don't think it's going to be like

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.620 
I don't think it's going to be like
things<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.870> just<00:02:42.990> kill<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:44.510> randomly<00:02:45.510> I

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
things that just kill you randomly I

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.020 
things that just kill you randomly I
think<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.140> going<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.290> be<00:02:46.440> more<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:47.040> player

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
think it's going to be more like player

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.890 
think it's going to be more like player
activated<00:02:50.120> changes<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.330> game<00:02:51.510> like<00:02:51.750> in

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
activated changes in the game like in

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.780 
activated changes in the game like in
the<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.170> trailer<00:02:52.650> we<00:02:52.740> see<00:02:52.770> those<00:02:53.040> logs<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
the in the trailer we see those logs I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.160 
the in the trailer we see those logs I
think<00:02:54.300> there's<00:02:54.420> gonna<00:02:54.480> be<00:02:54.600> like<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.780> switch

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
think there's gonna be like a switch

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.810 
think there's gonna be like a switch
that<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.500> may<00:02:55.650> be<00:02:55.709> shoe<00:02:56.070> or<00:02:56.310> knife<00:02:56.520> or

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
that you may be shoe or knife or

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.370 
that you may be shoe or knife or
something<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.390> then<00:02:57.630> all<00:02:57.750> these<00:02:57.840> logs<00:02:58.080> fall

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
something and then all these logs fall

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.230 
something and then all these logs fall
and<00:02:58.530> they<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.800> kill<00:02:59.070> people<00:02:59.100> down<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
and they can kill people down on the

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.930 
and they can kill people down on the
hill<00:03:00.450> or<00:03:00.720> whatever<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.670> think<00:03:02.760> that's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
hill or whatever and so I think that's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.160 
hill or whatever and so I think that's
that's<00:03:03.240> going<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> cool<00:03:03.780> thing<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.110> think

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
that's going to be a cool thing I think

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.020 
that's going to be a cool thing I think
it's<00:03:04.350> gonna<00:03:04.470> be<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.740> fun<00:03:04.920> thing<00:03:05.400> everything<00:03:05.940> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
it's gonna be a fun thing everything is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.310 
it's gonna be a fun thing everything is
gonna<00:03:06.150> be<00:03:06.209> interesting<00:03:06.480> change<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.170> up<00:03:07.260> a

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
gonna be interesting change it up a

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.470 
gonna be interesting change it up a
little<00:03:07.350> bit<00:03:07.560> I'm<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.830> little<00:03:08.280> bit<00:03:08.550> worried<00:03:08.820> as

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
little bit I'm a little bit worried as

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.840 
little bit I'm a little bit worried as
far<00:03:10.020> as<00:03:10.170> competitive<00:03:10.800> goes<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.490> think<00:03:11.730> that

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
far as competitive goes I think that

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.670 
far as competitive goes I think that
that<00:03:11.880> could<00:03:13.520> maybe<00:03:14.750> be<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> little<00:03:15.840> bit<00:03:16.110> unfair

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that could maybe be a little bit unfair

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.320 
that could maybe be a little bit unfair
in<00:03:16.890> some<00:03:17.100> situations<00:03:17.640> too<00:03:17.790> competitive<00:03:18.060> call

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
in some situations too competitive call

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.300 
in some situations too competitive call
of<00:03:18.420> duty<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:18.720> I'm<00:03:18.840> sure<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.350> not<00:03:19.650> maybe<00:03:20.130> not

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
of duty but I'm sure that not maybe not
