my eyes actually see as possible and you
can<00:04:21.000> see<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.660> looks<00:04:22.110> pretty<00:04:22.200> good<00:04:22.620> now<00:04:22.680> look<00:04:23.640> at

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
can see it looks pretty good now look at

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.760 
can see it looks pretty good now look at
the<00:04:23.820> whiteness<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.510> my<00:04:24.720> headlights<00:04:25.260> compared

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
the whiteness of my headlights compared

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.010 
the whiteness of my headlights compared
with<00:04:25.950> sort<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.430> brown<00:04:26.730> this<00:04:27.090> some

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
with sort of the brown this some

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.840 
with sort of the brown this some
guessing<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.440> going<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.650> be<00:04:28.710> around<00:04:28.950> 3200

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
guessing is going to be around 3200

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.820 
guessing is going to be around 3200
Kelvin<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.510> those<00:04:30.720> halogen<00:04:31.230> headlights<00:04:31.710> a

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
Kelvin of those halogen headlights a

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.030 
Kelvin of those halogen headlights a
head<00:04:32.810> almost<00:04:33.810> looks<00:04:34.170> like<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.500> kind<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.830> blue

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
head almost looks like the kind of blue

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.030 
head almost looks like the kind of blue
but<00:04:35.280> they're<00:04:35.490> not<00:04:35.840> they're<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:36.870> pure<00:04:37.770> white<00:04:37.980> I

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
but they're not they're a pure white I

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.540 
but they're not they're a pure white I
have<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.700> go<00:04:38.820> on<00:04:38.910> autozone<00:04:39.540> walk<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.230> good<00:04:40.550> 40

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
have to go on autozone walk the good 40

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.390 
have to go on autozone walk the good 40
feet<00:04:41.790> away<00:04:41.910> from<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.600> works<00:04:43.230> out<00:04:43.470> pretty

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
feet away from it it works out pretty

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.460 
feet away from it it works out pretty
well<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:45.060> did<00:04:45.510> that<00:04:45.750> just<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.050> make<00:04:46.170> sure<00:04:46.350> it

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
well I did that just to make sure it

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.670 
well I did that just to make sure it
wasn't<00:04:46.650> blinding<00:04:47.250> me<00:04:47.370> or<00:04:47.460> anything<00:04:48.290> so<00:04:49.290> just

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
wasn't blinding me or anything so just

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.030 
wasn't blinding me or anything so just
going<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.400> get<00:04:50.520> on<00:04:50.640> eight<00:04:50.820> now<00:04:51.090> here<00:04:51.600> because

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
going to get on eight now here because

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.520 
going to get on eight now here because
it<00:04:53.040> will<00:04:53.190> show<00:04:53.430> more<00:04:53.670> Lane<00:04:54.000> coverage

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
it will show more Lane coverage

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.110 
it will show more Lane coverage
and<00:04:55.950> I<00:04:56.040> can<00:04:56.250> see<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:57.210> this<00:04:57.420> two-lane<00:04:57.930> road<00:04:59.120> but

I<00:05:54.479> can<00:05:55.050> see<00:05:55.199> ahead<00:05:55.650> quite<00:05:56.370> well<00:05:56.610> even<00:05:56.940> though<00:05:57.150> I

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
I can see ahead quite well even though I

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.930 
I can see ahead quite well even though I
don't<00:05:57.300> have<00:05:57.479> fog<00:05:57.930> lights<00:05:58.490> just<00:05:59.490> because<00:05:59.729> using

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
don't have fog lights just because using

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.020 
don't have fog lights just because using
55<00:06:00.479> watts<00:06:01.520> very<00:06:02.520> bright<00:06:03.050> and<00:06:04.050> I<00:06:04.919> have<00:06:05.820> been

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
55 watts very bright and I have been

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.450 
55 watts very bright and I have been
next<00:06:06.270> to<00:06:06.360> something<00:06:06.750> like<00:06:06.900> a

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
next to something like a

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.760 
next to something like a
like<00:06:09.000> an<00:06:09.150> expedition<00:06:09.540> which<00:06:10.050> had<00:06:10.290> you<00:06:10.620> know

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
like an expedition which had you know

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.340 
like an expedition which had you know
like<00:06:11.460> an<00:06:11.639> Eddie<00:06:11.790> Bauer<00:06:11.880> had<00:06:12.540> the<00:06:12.720> fog<00:06:12.960> lights

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
like an Eddie Bauer had the fog lights

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.610 
like an Eddie Bauer had the fog lights
at<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:13.710> headlights<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:15.259> even<00:06:16.259> though<00:06:16.320> I<00:06:16.350> just

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
at the headlights and even though I just

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.990 
at the headlights and even though I just
have<00:06:16.770> headlights<00:06:17.190> it<00:06:17.370> was<00:06:17.460> still<00:06:17.669> brighter

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
have headlights it was still brighter

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.110 
have headlights it was still brighter
than<00:06:18.240> those<00:06:18.449> standard<00:06:18.900> halogens<00:06:19.639> so<00:06:20.639> it

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
than those standard halogens so it

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.279 
than those standard halogens so it
worked<00:06:21.330> out<00:06:21.539> pretty<00:06:21.750> good<00:06:21.990> so<00:06:23.419> I<00:06:24.419> guess<00:06:25.050> this

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
worked out pretty good so I guess this

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.590 
worked out pretty good so I guess this
is<00:06:25.440> it<00:06:25.560> for<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:26.100> review<00:06:26.430> guys<00:06:26.639> I'm<00:06:27.060> definitely
