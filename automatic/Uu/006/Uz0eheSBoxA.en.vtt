00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
make sure it is charged because this

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.530 
make sure it is charged because this
case<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.710> does<00:01:25.890> need<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.310> charged<00:01:26.790> there's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
case it does need to be charged there's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.420 
case it does need to be charged there's
a<00:01:27.659> little<00:01:28.020> microUSB<00:01:28.530> port<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:28.979> end<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
a little microUSB port at the end of it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.310 
a little microUSB port at the end of it
so<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.850> can't<00:01:30.090> charge<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
so that we can't charge it up it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
so that we can't charge it up it
shouldn't<00:01:31.680> take<00:01:31.740> long<00:01:31.920> though<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
shouldn't take long though because this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.630 
shouldn't take long though because this
battery<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.780> small<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:35.070> also<00:01:35.220> says

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
battery is so small and it also says

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
battery is so small and it also says
that<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.150> last<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.689> five<00:01:37.170> months<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that it can last up to five months on a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.249 
that it can last up to five months on a
single<00:01:38.340> charge<00:01:38.579> which<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.090> really<00:01:39.299> cool<00:01:39.540> but

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
single charge which is really cool but

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.960 
single charge which is really cool but
to<00:01:40.439> pair<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.070> Nexus<00:01:41.369> 9<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.790> can

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
to pair it up with the Nexus 9 we can

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.789 
to pair it up with the Nexus 9 we can
just<00:01:42.150> touch<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> back<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> Nexus<00:01:43.350> 9<00:01:43.500> with

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
just touch the back of the Nexus 9 with

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.670 
just touch the back of the Nexus 9 with
the<00:01:43.829> keyboard<00:01:44.220> case<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the keyboard case just like so and the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.109 
the keyboard case just like so and the
little<00:01:46.920> message<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.310> pop<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.520> giving<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
little message will pop up giving you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.630 
little message will pop up giving you
the<00:01:48.240> option<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.689> pair<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.560> device<00:01:49.640> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the option to pair with this device you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.149 
the option to pair with this device you
click<00:01:50.880> yes<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.420> hopefully<00:01:52.170> it'll<00:01:52.710> connect

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
click yes and hopefully it'll connect

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.889 
click yes and hopefully it'll connect
with<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> first<00:01:54.030> time<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.450> had<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
with you the first time I had to do a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.300 
with you the first time I had to do a
lot<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.170> troubleshooting<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.950> actually<00:01:56.219> get

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
lot of troubleshooting to actually get

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
lot of troubleshooting to actually get
it<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> connect<00:01:56.790> though<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.240> thought<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:57.960> model

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it to connect though I thought my model

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.810 
it to connect though I thought my model
was<00:01:58.290> actually<00:01:58.439> faulty<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> finally

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
was actually faulty but it finally

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.969 
was actually faulty but it finally
connected<00:02:00.420> hopefully<00:02:01.290> now<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> is

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
connected hopefully now that it is

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.499 
connected hopefully now that it is
connected<00:02:02.219> though<00:02:02.549> it'll<00:02:02.880> stay<00:02:03.299> connected

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
connected though it'll stay connected

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.190 
connected though it'll stay connected
but<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.500> will<00:02:05.040> reflect<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.670> my<00:02:05.790> full<00:02:06.000> review<00:02:06.200> but

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
but I will reflect in my full review but

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
but I will reflect in my full review but
when<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.500> attached<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.280> will<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
when it is attached you will have a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.190 
when it is attached you will have a
couple<00:02:09.060> different<00:02:09.360> ways<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.690> position<00:02:09.869> your

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
couple different ways to position your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.839 
couple different ways to position your
Nexus<00:02:10.560> 9<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.129> put<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> most

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
Nexus 9 you can put it in the most

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.960 
Nexus 9 you can put it in the most
upright<00:02:12.239> position

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
upright position

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.240 
upright position
so<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:13.930> involves<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.530> triangular<00:02:15.070> base

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
so this involves the triangular base

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.550 
so this involves the triangular base
being<00:02:15.700> right<00:02:15.880> below<00:02:16.180> or<00:02:16.630> at<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.020> base<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
being right below or at the base of the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.760 
being right below or at the base of the
nexus<00:02:17.890> 9<00:02:17.920> when<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.090> in<00:02:19.300> landscape<00:02:19.780> mode<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
nexus 9 when it is in landscape mode the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.470 
nexus 9 when it is in landscape mode the
other<00:02:20.890> option<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.460> have<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.970> triangular

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
other option is to have the triangular

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.630 
other option is to have the triangular
base<00:02:22.840> more<00:02:23.230> towards<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.770> top<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.160> Nexus<00:02:24.490> 9

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
base more towards the top of the Nexus 9

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.880 
base more towards the top of the Nexus 9
allowing<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.720> lay<00:02:25.960> more<00:02:26.200> flat<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.860> a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
allowing it to lay more flat on a

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.950 
allowing it to lay more flat on a
surface<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:28.300> do<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.780> couple

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
surface so you do have a couple

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.630 
surface so you do have a couple
different<00:02:29.200> viewing<00:02:29.500> options<00:02:29.680> which<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.370> good

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
different viewing options which is good

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.820 
different viewing options which is good
and<00:02:30.880> as<00:02:31.600> for<00:02:31.840> how<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.960> keyboard<00:02:32.200> feels<00:02:32.650> and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
and as for how the keyboard feels and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.320 
and as for how the keyboard feels and
performs<00:02:33.220> once<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.790> actually<00:02:33.970> get<00:02:34.210> it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
performs once you actually get it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330 
performs once you actually get it
connected<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.990> works<00:02:35.410> pretty<00:02:35.680> well<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:36.160> mean

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
connected it works pretty well I mean

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.220 
connected it works pretty well I mean
the<00:02:36.400> keyboards<00:02:36.820> register<00:02:37.210> just<00:02:37.420> fine<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
the keyboards register just fine the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.810 
the keyboards register just fine the
issue<00:02:38.410> with<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:38.770> keyboard<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.550> size

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
issue with a keyboard of this size

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.900 
issue with a keyboard of this size
though<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.930> size<00:02:41.140> it's<00:02:41.830> small<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.550> feels<00:02:42.820> a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
though is the size it's small it feels a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.550 
though is the size it's small it feels a
little<00:02:42.970> bit<00:02:43.120> cramped<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:44.170> going<00:02:44.440> to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
little bit cramped and it's going to

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.650 
little bit cramped and it's going to
take<00:02:44.770> some<00:02:44.980> time<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.430> adjust<00:02:45.550> because<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.540> is

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
take some time to adjust because it is

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.930 
take some time to adjust because it is
so<00:02:46.870> small<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.470> can't<00:02:48.040> type<00:02:48.250> pretty<00:02:48.430> fast<00:02:48.730> with

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
so small I can't type pretty fast with

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.790 
so small I can't type pretty fast with
it<00:02:49.060> still<00:02:49.390> but<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.720> don't<00:02:50.080> have<00:02:50.320> much<00:02:50.590> wiggle

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
it still but I don't have much wiggle

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.640 
it still but I don't have much wiggle
room<00:02:50.980> when<00:02:51.580> typing<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:52.780> sure<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.410> I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
room when typing that is for sure so I

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.320 
room when typing that is for sure so I
do<00:02:53.980> really<00:02:54.280> like<00:02:54.460> the<00:02:54.610> fact<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.300> a

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
do really like the fact that it is a

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.120 
do really like the fact that it is a
mechanical<00:02:55.720> keyboard<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.710> mean<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.890> keys

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
mechanical keyboard I mean the keys

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.460 
mechanical keyboard I mean the keys
definitely<00:02:57.670> feel<00:02:57.880> really<00:02:58.180> responsive<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
definitely feel really responsive the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.230 
definitely feel really responsive the
case<00:02:59.710> as<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.920> whole<00:03:00.160> feels<00:03:00.490> like<00:03:00.640> it's<00:03:00.790> built<00:03:01.030> of

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
case as a whole feels like it's built of

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.180 
case as a whole feels like it's built of
premium<00:03:01.750> materials<00:03:02.440> its<00:03:02.680> lightweight<00:03:02.950> and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
premium materials its lightweight and

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.000 
premium materials its lightweight and
thin<00:03:03.820> one<00:03:04.510> problem<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:04.990> noticed<00:03:05.410> was<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:05.680> when

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
thin one problem I noticed was that when

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.920 
thin one problem I noticed was that when
it's<00:03:06.130> closed<00:03:06.520> it<00:03:06.760> kind<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.000> slides<00:03:07.300> open<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.750> bit

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
it's closed it kind of slides open a bit

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.600 
it's closed it kind of slides open a bit
like<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.440> exposing<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.130> front<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.520> the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
like this exposing the front of the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.430 
like this exposing the front of the
