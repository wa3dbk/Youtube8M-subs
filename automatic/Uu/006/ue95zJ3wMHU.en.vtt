okay<00:00:02.170> I've<00:00:02.350> been<00:00:02.470> asked<00:00:02.890> to<00:00:04.830> show

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.060 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.280 

how<00:00:08.660> I<00:00:08.690> modify<00:00:09.410> the<00:00:09.920> 1g<00:00:10.400> lifters<00:00:11.110> there's<00:00:12.110> many

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
how I modify the 1g lifters there's many

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.100 
how I modify the 1g lifters there's many
reasons<00:00:12.500> for<00:00:12.860> this<00:00:13.180> how<00:00:14.180> I<00:00:14.240> modified<00:00:14.750> and<00:00:15.020> how

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
reasons for this how I modified and how

modified and how it's clean you see the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.320 
modified and how it's clean you see the
difference<00:00:21.170> in<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:21.529> two<00:00:21.740> lifters<00:00:22.490> this<00:00:23.180> is<00:00:23.300> a

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.720 

so<00:04:05.270> this<00:04:06.050> modified<00:04:06.530> it's<00:04:07.130> done

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
so this modified it's done

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.770 
so this modified it's done
that<00:04:08.690> is<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.930> modified<00:04:09.610> 1g<00:04:10.610> lifter<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.600> you<00:04:11.660> may

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
that is a modified 1g lifter and you may

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.270 
that is a modified 1g lifter and you may
notice<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:13.100> chamfer<00:04:13.640> in<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:14.150> lifter<00:04:15.280> allows

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
notice the chamfer in that lifter allows

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.300 
notice the chamfer in that lifter allows
oil<00:04:16.609> to<00:04:16.940> puddle<00:04:17.329> up<00:04:17.530> in<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.769> lifter<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:19.220> it

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
oil to puddle up in the lifter so it

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.180 
oil to puddle up in the lifter so it
always<00:04:19.489> have<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.910> small<00:04:20.299> supply<00:04:21.230> of<00:04:21.260> oil<00:04:21.799> in

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
always have a small supply of oil in

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.810 
always have a small supply of oil in
between<00:04:23.230> the<00:04:24.230> lifter<00:04:24.980> head<00:04:25.220> in<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.580> rocker

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
between the lifter head in the rocker

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.870 
between the lifter head in the rocker
arm<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:27.110> eliminates<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.770> town<00:04:28.070> to

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
arm so that it eliminates the town to

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.440 
arm so that it eliminates the town to
town

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
town

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.610 
town
so<00:04:30.020> that's<00:04:30.200> brief<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:30.560> your<00:04:30.740> how<00:04:31.010> I<00:04:31.040> modify<00:04:31.669> 1g

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
so that's brief in your how I modify 1g

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.040 
so that's brief in your how I modify 1g
lifter<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.970> eliminate<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.510> need<00:04:35.660> for<00:04:35.720> a

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
lifter to eliminate the need for a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.240 
lifter to eliminate the need for a
revised<00:04:36.560> lifter

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
revised lifter

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.060
