00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.330 
ok
so<00:01:03.760> your<00:01:04.629> where<00:01:04.930> you<00:01:04.989> go<00:01:05.050> ahead<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.590> uh<00:01:05.620> you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
so your where you go ahead and uh you

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.100 
so your where you go ahead and uh you
could<00:01:06.490> say<00:01:06.520> allow<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:06.970> connection<00:01:07.300> but<00:01:07.810> if<00:01:08.020> we

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
could say allow the connection but if we

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.390 
could say allow the connection but if we
don't<00:01:08.229> want<00:01:08.409> them<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.740> connect<00:01:09.010> we<00:01:09.220> obviously

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
don't want them to connect we obviously

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.850 
don't want them to connect we obviously
will<00:01:10.030> block<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.630> connection<00:01:10.840> we<00:01:11.530> can<00:01:11.680> allow

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
will block the connection we can allow

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.850 
will block the connection we can allow
the<00:01:11.920> connection<00:01:12.430> if<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.760> secure<00:01:13.860> customize

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
the connection if it is secure customize

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.400 
the connection if it is secure customize
and<00:01:15.370> require<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.540> connections<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.229> be

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
and require that the connections to be

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.940 
and require that the connections to be
encrypted<00:01:17.830> um

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
encrypted um

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.340 
encrypted um
allow<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.010> connection<00:01:21.400> to<00:01:21.850> use<00:01:22.000> null

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
allow the connection to use null

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.130 
allow the connection to use null
encapsulation<00:01:24.960> override<00:01:25.960> block<00:01:26.320> rules<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
encapsulation override block rules so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140 
encapsulation override block rules so
but<00:01:29.140> note<00:01:29.410> we<00:01:29.710> want<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.160> block<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.520> user<00:01:30.700> so

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
but note we want to block the user so

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.450 
but note we want to block the user so
they<00:01:31.570> cannot<00:01:32.110> connect<00:01:32.470> it's<00:01:32.740> like<00:01:32.979> banning

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
they cannot connect it's like banning

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.779 
they cannot connect it's like banning
them<00:01:33.610> from<00:01:33.640> your<00:01:34.060> entire<00:01:34.360> server<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:35.649> you<00:01:35.950> do

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
them from your entire server so you do

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.359 
them from your entire server so you do

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
yep that's how you do it on Windows so

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.130 
yep that's how you do it on Windows so
I'm<00:02:21.610> gonna<00:02:22.000> go<00:02:22.180> ahead<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.329> delete<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.930> rule

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
though if you do 8 through it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.240 
though if you do 8 through it
automatically<00:02:25.329> is<00:02:25.600> it's<00:02:25.870> gone<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.560> disabled
