00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.849
 let's start with reading 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:34.149
 from I'll leave in the description of the video 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:38.149

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.430
 412 gigabytes this is a game of 4.6 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.879
 gigabyte system requirements 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.949
 they are the same and of resident evil 5 of 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.130
 access good graphics card 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.080
 graphic put video card 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.570
 installed address good I'm 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.490
 writing a file to mediafire for 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.480
 have no problem 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.940
 download it 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.019
 and after they have declined if I do not 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.280
 I am discharging because I would demarcate a lot 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.470
 depending on the speed is internet 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.000
 then I have here 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.290
 we open we extract 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.290
 but let's end 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.080
 sometimes this will take a few minutes 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.080
 and 3 to 4 gb 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.570
 then we hope they are downloaded 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.570
 is extracted is compressed in a rack 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.549
 but there it is 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.710
 usually if the student car 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:55.619
 why this file is your installation 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.930
 does not need any kind of good crack 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.440
 a long time there is no kind of 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.430
 track or anything like that or patch 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.180

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.180
