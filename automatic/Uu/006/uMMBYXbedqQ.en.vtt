00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.960
 back against massera who made us fall we told them that origami is a 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.170
 Japanese tradition of folding paper tells the story that here in double ni 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.550
 Luis Díaz will grant you a wish in reward for the effort and 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.100
 concentration that do to achieve it marta gallén is the center 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.030
 cultural event in fifth place of the international meeting will take place 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.119
 of polygamy marcela a few days 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.810
 and also make evident good morning you said it origami is an art 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.360
 millenary that now 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.730
 is in the equator because precisely because from today until Sunday 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.490
 the first international origami meeting is held, let's see a note 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.490
 about it and then pay for weaning 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.490
 origami is an art that has more than two thousand years of history 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.550
 is nothing more than the technique of folding the paper in order to create 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.000
 various figures that in the Buddhist monasteries of a China well some thousands 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.830
 of years 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.050
 back that town the role 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.809
 then japan from the one that really diffuses this art and then pole frame 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.060
 says the story arrived figures in napkins to the West 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.670
 the practice originated in Japan initially as a way of 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.340
 entertainment 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.130
 its particularity is the mattel transformation that in various forms and 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.880
 symbologies starting from an initial base because you work with 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.450
 a piece 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.049
 square of paper if color possible and everything has an unpopular logic 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.680
 symmetrically for example that we have a square and we fold we have a 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.479
 triangle but we can continue folding the paper according to the figure that 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.140
 We want or design creations can range from simple models to 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.480
 folded of great complexity and a square for example we have two 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.410
 triangles 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.689
 if then we can do for example one of these points 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.040
 fold from theater asia and then we double up 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040
 and for example we have already finished a basic figure 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.990
 the preferred figures for modeling are animals of other elements of the 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.790
 nature 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.890
 as flowers trees among other reasons that is achieved only through 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.890
 the magic of paper in origami 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.829
 marcela magín 24 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.969
 we are precisely in the cultural center itchimbia accompanies us 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.639
 santiago ponce the ex beatle belongs to the tribe of origami paper quito and 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.940
 he is also one of the people who is coordinating 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.560
 this international meeting santiago good morning comments first 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.030
 this practice basically is based on three successful principles that is not to cut 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.929
 a sticker or paint because 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:52.089
 good because the abs philosophy of uncertain oriental as we all know is 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.549
 very disciplined 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.349
 So what they tempt is only through the exercise of 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.759
 paper bender 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.279
 to be able to represent it more exactly nature 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:08.989
 then a cut vd used out there have a figure a kind of ornament 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.159
 extra 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.159
 Well, the only thing he does is give him a little 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:18.329
 let's say it decides in presence but the spirit of that of the extensive figure of 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.779
 dollar now tell us it is difficult to learn origami how long 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.339
 taking 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:29.629
 good is that they are memory processes as well as learning to mine here not these 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.580
 are you start walking first 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.189
 triggering 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.019
 then begins to take its first steps stumbles and in the end good because 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.039
 walk 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:41.319
 then the process of the table but one begins folding super figures 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.499
 simple three-four folds the requirement goes up to fold 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:51.529
 figures of more than 300 folds that are already how long it takes in the 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:53.229
 figure for example yes complex 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:58.129
 Well, let's talk about him, for example, about dicks, let's talk about dancers 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.669
 violinists 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.099
 there we have a dancer 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.709
 how long will you be present in this good figure in a love balerinas 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.519
 about eight hours 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.089
 aha in folding 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:12.499
 now adidas modalities the certain thing is that the one that is done only as a 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.499
 paper that since you can put several papers to achieve a figure 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:21.970
 yes the figure that they use to bequeath him in the basic simply 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.020
 be square 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.970
 I'll go to the biggest square you can get out of cotton success on your part 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.779
 it seems to you if it is that now it makes us a small sample 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.159
 and somehow they teach us to be origami also to give us which 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.750
 easy 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.210
 or how hard it is and here for us to start we go home 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.479
 walls 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.290
 we have here a square of complaint also endorses it 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.919
 we are going to be an extremely simple figure that is worth heart 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.159
 we start from the square and agreed with a diagonal we will achieve 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.499
 great goal 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.499
 then we fold this preamble in half 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.849
 and let's play with milk would lie noel the child to do origami learn a lot 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.809
 faster geometry than doing it in two at school we back the 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.430
 points down 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.889
 and I already lost a little bit we opened the paper 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.119
 and these two points are going to join with the tip of the rifle 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:21.339
 then we are going to turn the figure 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.949
 and here we have two to peace in the part here which are going to join 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.870
 with lower aim 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.559
 they are going to give us these two triangles 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:33.769
 rectangles the each of the bids in the account that came out 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.430
 he said last week to tell them that I love them the expert in the area 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.680
 however and we have given our first steps of this heart appointment in 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.510
 the one that we could have achieved and that really happened significant jorge 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.650
 taking into account that at least in my case I could not be even a 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.270
 remove paper so people say that better people this is what I got 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.910
 licitations of marcelo tenders to have points in 10 seconds dudik and 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.180
 the exhibition will be open its figures of paper and life 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.460
 if santiago that tells us about the tools in brief 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.939
 thank you very much flight the exhibition will be open on Saturday 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.479
 from 9 in the morning to 6 in the evening

 On Sunday, those who wish to attend will travel to half the world. 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.190
 another can go and fold with us and we want to make an invitation very

 we have not got here 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:24.559
 in fact in origami
