window<00:00:05.149> amplifier<00:00:05.779> for<00:00:06.200> your<00:00:06.259> 240sx<00:00:07.389> this<00:00:08.389> is

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
window amplifier for your 240sx this is

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.850 
window amplifier for your 240sx this is
out<00:00:08.690> of<00:00:08.719> my<00:00:08.870> 95<00:00:09.280> s<00:00:10.280> 14<00:00:11.710> winners<00:00:12.710> have<00:00:12.830> been

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
out of my 95 s 14 winners have been

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.070 
out of my 95 s 14 winners have been
working<00:00:13.219> ok<00:00:13.580> but<00:00:14.000> as<00:00:14.210> a<00:00:14.240> recent<00:00:14.780> they've<00:00:14.929> been

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
working ok but as a recent they've been

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.359 
working ok but as a recent they've been
a<00:00:15.110> little<00:00:15.320> bit<00:00:15.410> intermittent<00:00:15.919> and

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
a little bit intermittent and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.679 
a little bit intermittent and
unfortunately<00:00:17.210> they<00:00:17.270> stopped<00:00:17.510> working

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
unfortunately they stopped working

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.070 
unfortunately they stopped working
altogether<00:00:17.949> with<00:00:18.949> upcoming<00:00:19.730> storms<00:00:20.539> well<00:00:21.019> as

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
altogether with upcoming storms well as

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.609 
altogether with upcoming storms well as
much<00:00:21.289> fun<00:00:21.699> anyways<00:00:22.810> when<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:24.019> motor<00:00:24.199> tested

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
much fun anyways when the motor tested

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.259 
much fun anyways when the motor tested
out<00:00:24.740> okay<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:25.340> that<00:00:25.369> is<00:00:25.609> switch<00:00:25.880> and

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
out okay and so that is switch and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.750 
out okay and so that is switch and
usually<00:00:26.660> if<00:00:26.869> it's<00:00:27.109> this<00:00:27.410> you<00:00:27.590> are<00:00:27.710> okay<00:00:28.039> the

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
usually if it's this you are okay the

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.150 
usually if it's this you are okay the
only<00:00:28.820> thing<00:00:28.939> left<00:00:29.179> is<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:29.509> amplifier<00:00:30.039> so<00:00:31.039> it's

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
only thing left is the amplifier so it's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.220 
only thing left is the amplifier so it's
pretty<00:00:31.279> easy<00:00:31.429> I<00:00:31.759> need<00:00:32.390> to<00:00:32.450> do<00:00:32.570> is<00:00:32.810> remove<00:00:33.170> the

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
pretty easy I need to do is remove the

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.620 
pretty easy I need to do is remove the
amplifier<00:00:34.070> from<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.400> car<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.300> once<00:00:35.450> you<00:00:35.540> have

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
amplifier from the car and once you have

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.180 
amplifier from the car and once you have
removed<00:00:35.990> you<00:00:36.260> need<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.500> pry<00:00:36.740> out<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.040> inner

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
removed you need to pry out the inner

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.970 
removed you need to pry out the inner
black<00:00:37.430> piece<00:00:37.760> here<00:00:38.140> I've<00:00:39.140> already<00:00:39.380> removed<00:00:39.500> it

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
black piece here I've already removed it

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.850 
black piece here I've already removed it
from<00:00:40.310> this<00:00:40.520> car<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.780> it<00:00:42.380> comes<00:00:42.560> right<00:00:42.710> out

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
from this car so it comes right out

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.860 
from this car so it comes right out
you'll<00:00:43.790> see<00:00:44.030> if<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:44.210> look<00:00:44.360> on<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.570> inside

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
you'll see if you look on the inside

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.320 
you'll see if you look on the inside
there's<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.170> notch<00:00:45.320> here<00:00:45.680> in<00:00:45.860> here<00:00:46.190> as<00:00:46.880> well<00:00:47.210> as

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
there's a notch here in here as well as

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.180 
there's a notch here in here as well as
right<00:00:47.510> there<00:00:47.810> did<00:00:48.650> you<00:00:48.740> put<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:48.980> screwdriver

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
right there did you put the screwdriver

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.980 
right there did you put the screwdriver
at<00:00:49.670> this<00:00:49.820> point<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:50.240> they'll<00:00:50.360> come<00:00:50.540> out<00:00:50.660> very

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
at this point so they'll come out very

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.930 
at this point so they'll come out very
easily<00:00:51.670> so<00:00:52.670> see<00:00:53.450> we<00:00:53.570> can't<00:00:53.780> get<00:00:53.900> this<00:00:54.020> out

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.210 

alright<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.330> is<00:00:59.480> what<00:00:59.630> it<00:00:59.690> looks<00:00:59.840> like<00:01:00.220> it's

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
alright this is what it looks like it's

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.400 
alright this is what it looks like it's
pretty<00:01:01.490> simple<00:01:01.880> pretty<00:01:02.450> straightforward<00:01:02.570> has

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
pretty simple pretty straightforward has

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.800 
pretty simple pretty straightforward has
to<00:01:03.650> realize<00:01:04.010> on<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.340> one<00:01:05.180> controls<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.570> output

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
to realize on it one controls the output

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.780 
to realize on it one controls the output
motion<00:01:06.410> and<00:01:06.620> one<00:01:06.740> controls<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.070> down<00:01:07.280> and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
motion and one controls the down and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.760 
motion and one controls the down and
obviously<00:01:08.150> automatic<00:01:08.660> is<00:01:08.840> controlled<00:01:09.350> by<00:01:09.560> the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
obviously automatic is controlled by the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.030 
obviously automatic is controlled by the
on<00:01:09.950> both<00:01:10.130> circuitry<00:01:10.670> here<00:01:11.230> the<00:01:12.230> problem<00:01:12.620> is<00:01:12.740> is

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
on both circuitry here the problem is is

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.040 
on both circuitry here the problem is is
that<00:01:13.760> when<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.030> get<00:01:14.120> down<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:14.660> this<00:01:14.990> is

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
that when you get down to it this is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.610 
that when you get down to it this is
still<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.650> printed<00:01:16.040> circuit<00:01:16.160> board<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.620> it's

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
still a printed circuit board and it's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.350 
still a printed circuit board and it's
in<00:01:18.800> a<00:01:18.890> car<00:01:19.370> that<00:01:19.400> between<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:19.940> vibrating

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
in a car that between the vibrating

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.950 
in a car that between the vibrating
awful<00:01:20.720> lot<00:01:21.040> so<00:01:22.040> what<00:01:22.640> happens<00:01:22.970> over<00:01:23.090> time<00:01:23.240> I'm

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
awful lot so what happens over time I'm

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.180 
awful lot so what happens over time I'm
not<00:01:24.140> sure<00:01:24.260> if<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.410> really<00:01:24.620> see<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.010> in<00:01:25.100> the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
not sure if you really see it in the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.149 
not sure if you really see it in the
video<00:01:25.460> I'll<00:01:25.820> try<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.180> zoom<00:01:26.600> in<00:01:26.810> on<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:28.420> but

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
video I'll try to zoom in on it but

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.970 
video I'll try to zoom in on it but
maybe<00:01:31.159> it'll<00:01:31.460> make<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:32.060> out<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:33.500> pin<00:01:33.740> in<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
maybe it'll make it out the pin in the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.500 
maybe it'll make it out the pin in the
upper<00:01:34.280> right<00:01:34.460> hand<00:01:34.490> corner<00:01:34.940> is<00:01:35.270> actually

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
upper right hand corner is actually

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.590 
upper right hand corner is actually
cracked<00:01:36.260> on<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.560> solder<00:01:36.800> joint<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:38.330> pin

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
cracked on the solder joint and the pin

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.210 
cracked on the solder joint and the pin
in<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.780> bottom<00:01:38.990> right<00:01:39.380> hand<00:01:39.409> corner<00:01:39.620> is<00:01:40.040> on

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
in the bottom right hand corner is on

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.050 
in the bottom right hand corner is on
its<00:01:40.370> way<00:01:40.430> out<00:01:40.550> too<00:01:40.970> now<00:01:42.370> the<00:01:43.370> board<00:01:43.580> itself<00:01:43.880> is

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
its way out too now the board itself is

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.820 
its way out too now the board itself is
still<00:01:44.240> in<00:01:44.360> good<00:01:44.450> shape<00:01:44.510> it's<00:01:45.350> already<00:01:45.680> been

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
still in good shape it's already been

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.370 
still in good shape it's already been
cleaned<00:01:46.510> just<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.540> little<00:01:47.720> bit<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:47.870> acetone<00:01:48.200> or

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
cleaned just a little bit of acetone or

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.500 
cleaned just a little bit of acetone or
a<00:01:48.830> little<00:01:49.310> bit<00:01:49.400> paint<00:01:49.640> thinner<00:01:49.850> does<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.150> trick

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
a little bit paint thinner does a trick

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.960 
a little bit paint thinner does a trick
to<00:01:50.720> move<00:01:50.900> any<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.409> old<00:01:51.710> solder<00:01:52.100> flux<00:01:52.460> from

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
to move any of the old solder flux from

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.410 
to move any of the old solder flux from
production<00:01:54.310> but<00:01:55.310> you'll<00:01:55.460> see<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:56.299> know

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
production but you'll see you know

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.590 
production but you'll see you know
everything<00:01:56.930> looks<00:01:57.320> ok<00:01:57.620> otherwise<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:59.270> the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
everything looks ok otherwise so the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.240 
everything looks ok otherwise so the
simple<00:02:00.020> thing<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.290> do<00:02:00.440> is<00:02:00.650> just<00:02:01.070> get<00:02:01.190> a

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
simple thing to do is just get a

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.310 
simple thing to do is just get a
soldering<00:02:01.670> iron<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.840> little<00:02:03.110> bit<00:02:03.200> of

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
soldering iron and a little bit of

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.920 
soldering iron and a little bit of
solder<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.610> want<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.820> use<00:02:04.909> rosin<00:02:05.270> core<00:02:05.299> not

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
solder you want to use rosin core not

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.830 
solder you want to use rosin core not
acid<00:02:06.290> core<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.310> go<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.090> Radio<00:02:08.360> Shack<00:02:08.390> for<00:02:08.720> this

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
acid core so go to Radio Shack for this

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.390 
acid core so go to Radio Shack for this
project<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.500> go<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.009> Home<00:02:10.399> Depot

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
project that go to Home Depot

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.690 
project that go to Home Depot
and<00:02:11.659> just<00:02:12.659> simply<00:02:12.959> here<00:02:13.349> at<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:13.530> joints<00:02:13.890> where

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and just simply here at the joints where

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.059 
and just simply here at the joints where
we<00:02:14.819> see<00:02:14.970> cracks<00:02:15.439> but<00:02:16.439> in<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.650> case<00:02:16.860> would<00:02:17.040> be

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
we see cracks but in this case would be

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.460 
we see cracks but in this case would be
right<00:02:17.370> here<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.670> me<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.239> right<00:02:18.900> here<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.349> me

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
right here for me and right here for me

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.380 
right here for me and right here for me
and<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> might<00:02:20.579> also<00:02:20.730> want<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.000> suspect<00:02:21.299> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
and you might also want to suspect the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.240 
and you might also want to suspect the
joints<00:02:21.689> around<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.959> realized<00:02:22.319> as<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.890> arm

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
joints around the realized as this arm

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.850 
joints around the realized as this arm
electromechanical<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.019> reaction<00:02:25.680> may

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
electromechanical and the reaction may

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.500 
electromechanical and the reaction may
transmit<00:02:26.250> some<00:02:26.489> vibration<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.150> joints

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
transmit some vibration to the joints

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.410 
transmit some vibration to the joints
and<00:02:27.659> also<00:02:27.780> calls<00:02:28.109> in<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.349> break<00:02:28.530> as<00:02:28.739> well

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
and also calls in the break as well

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.390 
and also calls in the break as well
these<00:02:30.420> look<00:02:30.629> okay<00:02:31.049> but<00:02:31.799> I'll<00:02:31.890> probably<00:02:32.099> go

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
these look okay but I'll probably go

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.160 
these look okay but I'll probably go
ahead<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.670> reflow<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.150> solder<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.079> be

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
ahead and reflow the solder just to be

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.580 
ahead and reflow the solder just to be
sure<00:02:34.760> when<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.819> get<00:02:35.970> down<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.359> I<00:02:36.689> takes<00:02:37.409> is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
sure when you get down to it I takes is

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.050 
sure when you get down to it I takes is
about<00:02:37.620> five<00:02:38.159> minutes<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.730> you've<00:02:38.849> saved

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
about five minutes and you've saved

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.490 
about five minutes and you've saved
yourself<00:02:39.239> anywhere<00:02:39.840> from<00:02:40.079> well<00:02:41.150> free<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
yourself anywhere from well free to that

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.589 
yourself anywhere from well free to that
ninety<00:02:44.129> dollars<00:02:44.459> or<00:02:44.609> whatever<00:02:44.790> Nissan<00:02:45.269> wants
