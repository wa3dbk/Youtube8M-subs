00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
machines you know that is the kind of

cliched<00:00:37.440> image<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> digital<00:00:38.280> DJ<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.700> you

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
cliched image of a digital DJ if you

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.470 
cliched image of a digital DJ if you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
like actually if you are any kind of DJ

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.260 
like actually if you are any kind of DJ
at<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:42.870> if<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.110> play<00:00:43.290> any<00:00:43.590> kind<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.100> music

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
at all if you play any kind of music

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.069 
at all if you play any kind of music
digital<00:00:45.270> DJ<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:46.610> something<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:48.930> only

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
digital DJ is something that is not only

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.020 
digital DJ is something that is not only
being<00:00:49.350> done<00:00:49.649> by<00:00:49.860> DJs<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:50.910> it's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
being done by DJs like you but it's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.150 
being done by DJs like you but it's
actually<00:00:51.300> probably<00:00:51.510> easier<00:00:52.260> than<00:00:52.770> using

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
actually probably easier than using

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
actually probably easier than using
Oscar<00:00:53.879> old-style<00:00:54.270> equipment<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:55.289> DJ's<00:00:55.649> like

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
Oscar old-style equipment for DJ's like

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
Oscar old-style equipment for DJ's like
you<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.660> obviously<00:00:57.660> there's<00:00:57.899> DJ's<00:00:58.260> who<00:00:58.379> don't

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you now obviously there's DJ's who don't

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.950 
you now obviously there's DJ's who don't
play<00:00:58.829> an<00:00:58.890> EDM<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.940> who<00:01:00.059> are<00:01:00.210> contemporary<00:01:00.899> if

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
play an EDM but who are contemporary if

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.450 
play an EDM but who are contemporary if
you<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.410> you've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.680> indie<00:01:02.010> DJ's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

know there's no mixing involved in

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
know there's no mixing involved in
indeed<00:01:07.260> normally<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.700> case<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
indeed normally it's just a case of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
indeed normally it's just a case of
playing<00:01:09.330> tunes<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.990> programming<00:01:10.650> them

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
nicely digital gear they're very even

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.840 
nicely digital gear they're very even
the<00:01:13.049> simplicity<00:01:13.560> digital<00:01:14.220> gear<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.700> good

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the simplicity digital gear can be good

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.700 
the simplicity digital gear can be good
enough<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.150> any<00:01:15.390> DJ's<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> use<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.619> those

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
bit more of a leap into digital as

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.460 
bit more of a leap into digital as
certainly<00:01:26.700> into<00:01:27.030> controller<00:01:27.450> ism<00:01:27.810> because

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
certainly into controller ism because

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.770

the kind of tractor for that be gritted
but<00:04:35.230> munching<00:04:36.300> image<00:04:37.300> which<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.690> has<00:04:37.870> out

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
but munching image which it has out

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.730 
but munching image which it has out
there<00:04:38.290> so<00:04:39.220> if<00:04:39.280> you're<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.460> non<00:04:39.820> EDM<00:04:40.750> DJ<00:04:41.140> watching

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
this and you're thinking about digital

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.790 
this and you're thinking about digital
