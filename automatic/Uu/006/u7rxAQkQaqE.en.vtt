00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello everybody start now and flavia 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.990
 Answer, I am Lucas now I am here. 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.730
 with leonardo see these same plays me 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.410
 I will vote on the issue in the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.240
 video today we will respond to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.740
 doubt of eduardo sp 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.529
 he wants to know whether to prevent the battery 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.510
 reached 0% makes the service life of the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.610
 gadget increase and half that yes it is a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.510
 ideal for a lithium -ion â€‹â€‹battery is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.399
 you do not always recharge it 100% and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.030
 nor let it drop below zero for 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.579
 cent 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.399
 so much so that there we between 20 and 80 per 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.289
 one hundred and five - small loads is ideal 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.460
 understood why it is that less heat 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.110
 on a campus - strans on the battery but the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.149
 Anyway, I have here several systems 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.039
 make the device 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.629
 off before it reaches 0% 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.329
 exactly to avoid 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.920
 problems to be quiet for 2% it will already 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.920
 there and off so sometimes until before 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.479
 so it does happen but it's one thing 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.270
 It should be clear here that the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.770
 next time you do not recharge 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.210
 to load completely or 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.740
 completely your battery 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.590
 Are you going to spend a cycle on it? 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.200
 equal to 60% today 40% tomorrow you go 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.150
 pay san siro on a level but a little 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.890
 more will be more gradual not slower 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990
 who will continue to spend it will 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.729
 lose capacity in the same way yes but 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.220
 It will take a little longer. 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.470
 yes we commented in the program that are 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.799
 405 average recharge 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.659
 only there is not much consensus 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.659
 about what a circle is in return to 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.999
 Flamengo 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.920
 how do we know an ion battery 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:50.619
 lithium works on the basis of reactions 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.429
 net chemistry is the electron flux of 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.770
 A day between two electrodes is not 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.829
 whether there is a scientific consensus 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.709
 exactly one cycle begins and then 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.569
 the estimate was 10 or 100% you 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.119
 places the unit in areas and in 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:11.110
 general terms which is more or less this 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.500
 but this is exactly another thing that is 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.730
 a cycle exactly is not yet a 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:23.230
 consensus needed yes and there is also 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.819
 the issue of security is also the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.410
 following is also something that is 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.620
 legal to know that as we are 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.170
 speaking in the past program batteries of 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.239
 lithium ions and lose the ability to 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.799
 a number of reasons one of them is because 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.170
 such as during load cycles and 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.140
 recharge dendrites form structures 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.810
 between the electrode and decreases 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.980
 the active surface of it as 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.170
 happens in some situations 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.310
 mainly with metallic lithium instead of 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.680
 of and a delight is the blessed are so 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.780
 many that end up punching 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.269
 the separator they have between 14 year-round 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.489
 and caused a short circuit may lead to 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.349
 fire can lead to explosion is well 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.910
 complicated with much danger to the 32 but 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.099
 this type of battery is no longer suitable 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.950
 inside today's dealers is the name 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.380
 already the eyes of a greater margin of edson 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.049
 but it is in the 90s for example had 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.549
 some very worrying cases of this type 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.829
 of things and even today if you take a 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.959
 lithium ion battery and button fold 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:27.910
 it's already going with it, it's much safer 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.040
 Yes, there are some videos until the staff 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.340
 fire the phone or shoot the 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.950
 cell phone itself on a gun can not do 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.769
 without wasting time doing a business 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.450
 of these you broad able of money 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.360
 terrible burns like this 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.379
 It's quite complicated exactly so this is it. 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.060
 Guys, I hope we have 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.800
 Your life responded 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.420
 leave more doubts here than we 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.810
 respond next week until 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.810
 channels
