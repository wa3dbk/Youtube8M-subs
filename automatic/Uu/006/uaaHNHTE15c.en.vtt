00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
your hover mode and you want to just try

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
your hover mode and you want to just try
and<00:01:23.430> land<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.939> top<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.360> signpost<00:01:24.689> now

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and land on top of this signpost now

once you're down on top of this signpost

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.070 
once you're down on top of this signpost
there<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:26.970> actually<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> barrier<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> can

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
there is actually a barrier as you can

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.390 
there is actually a barrier as you can
see<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.710> lose<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> slight<00:01:29.189> this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
see if you just lose a slight this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.890 
see if you just lose a slight this
backward<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.780> are

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
backward and as you can see you are

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.990 
backward and as you can see you are
really<00:01:31.200> high<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.070> see<00:01:32.220> tons<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> areas

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
really high up you can see tons of areas

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.429 
really high up you can see tons of areas
in<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.150> map<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
in the map and I think that this is a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.050 
in the map and I think that this is a
really<00:01:34.770> awesome<00:01:34.799> trickshot<00:01:35.610> spot<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
really awesome trickshot spot and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.460 
really awesome trickshot spot and
definitely<00:01:36.450> worth<00:01:36.570> trying<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> do

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
definitely worth trying out if you do

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.410 
definitely worth trying out if you do
play<00:01:37.740> advanced<00:01:38.130> warfare<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.299> why

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
play advanced warfare and that is why

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
play advanced warfare and that is why
this<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.380> video<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.250> at

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
in the map and again just looking at

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.640 
in the map and again just looking at
this<00:02:59.450> spot<00:02:59.720> like<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.990> other<00:03:00.110> one<00:03:00.320> you're

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
really high up and it would make an

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.180 
really high up and it would make an
insane<00:03:02.330> trick<00:03:02.720> shotting<00:03:02.930> killcam<00:03:03.560> or<00:03:03.770> you
