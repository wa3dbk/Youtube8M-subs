00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 another drawback of our Chinese friends 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.140
 This is a soft Seats, in principle, the driver 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.219
 no problem no that is it has 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.740
 support softness but the passenger 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.870
 the problem is something guts sidushka gently 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.010
 so soft it just goes under 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.410
 the trunk and the second room is practically 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.830
 sits on these pipes under the seat itself 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.470
 below 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.070
 of course the Chinese were stingy to do the frame 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.309
 from steel to do difficult plastic from 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.800
 this fire she bends especially at 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.860
 passengers behind there is no then shackle 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.680
 just bends back and goes down 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.570
 To correct this nonsense I want 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.789
 start the frame from steel profile 2020 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.510
 so I cut this initially 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.510
 frame preparation 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:00.629
 17 centimeters width is about 50 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.020
 damn well there is such a thing that it is here 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.460
 frame 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.210
 she must follow the contours exactly 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.210
 the seats 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.740
 since I donâ€™t have any 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.440
 equipment. bend a little or 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.890
 pipes do not have to do such here 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.830
 cuts 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.130
 bend and then the whole thing is simple 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.729
 brew something I just get 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.410
 this morning and bent in the form of propyl here 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.110
 this part is not needed in some way 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.909
 connect this record so I looked 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.409
 me so thin and flimsy that I think 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.690
 even if I hear it connect them wrong 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.690
 there will be little so I want to replace it 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.480
 mount generally plan to make 30 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.640
 corner 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.540
 last pass percy 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.540
 extra cut 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.860
 now this business is necessary here so 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.860
 brick 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.729
 here 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.230
 I finished boil and grind 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.010
 this frame of what I finally got out 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.010
 such a frame 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:54.449
 which easily rises 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.710
 on the site to its rightful place and also easy 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.710
 gets on the taxi itself to 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.080
 the ear ring now became a legitimate pump 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:43.740
 the place is slightly higher than before 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.740
 now she has support 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.270
 disney is hitting now everything is fine
