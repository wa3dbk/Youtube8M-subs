00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:08.440
 Hello, my name is Felipe, and I'm nine years old. 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:12.190
 I will demonstrate how the nutrients 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.910
 absorbed by good manager system 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.539
 here to this right digestive system 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.180
 the boy is eating an apple and the 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.269
 piece of apple in an old mouth 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.670
 to give them the food that the 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.710
 I can not find it but the 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.890
 shreds the food that goes 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.070
 have it easier to go through a 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.030
 not scratch and can lead to 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.280
 to death to gain good food goes 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.510
 happens more or less when it arrives 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.079
 in this part 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.379
 the saliva that are produced in the 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.410
 olive groves of a little food and 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.110
 there they will stop and they will get smaller and 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.949
 will have flowers flavor by the game tatÃ¡ 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.100
 arrived on the stomach in the gallbladder 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.409
 bile will join a fungus called kilo 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.659
 that will hold a little more like this 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.740
 will form a little more of her with 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.920
 pastinha yes and then he is one and a 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.159
 little one goes through the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.000
 intestine and arrives in the small intestine 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:27.369
 good the son of the produsa bible who is 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.430
 other suquinho that helps to have and 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.100
 pancreas produces juice ready to 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:38.500
 Attic that helps even one more 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:45.310
 little out there one briefcase well we 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 of people detained there in the small intestine 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:53.270
 will move in is 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.610
 13 not for blood the blood in that 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.690
 nutrient for the cells they need 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:04.460
 nutrients and oxygen gas and the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.220
 some will not need pro debris and 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.160
 go into the intestine 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.150
 thick goes pro veto and the rest goes to 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:19.070
 Anji out there is good sometimes 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.690
 speaking of the fact that they need good 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.880
 the cells need in the stretch 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.540
 there are three types of nutrients 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.000
 energy sources containing carbohydrates and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.160
 they are the ones who gave the least 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.060
 nutrients that most must be absorbed 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.610
 by co 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.130
 and then also after regulators come 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.970
 which is the second type equal to the second 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.440
 level 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.330
 he just has to cry - absorbed in 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.060
 real time - it also knows what the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.350
 energy and in the third minute view 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.470
 consultants and nothing because she is not 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.380
 fourth level in candy sugars such 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.220
 things because although it can not be 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.769
 exchanged for a healthy food and there 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.510
 You can start from time to time I go 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:15.040
 give some examples of food 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.079
 Enough rice potato is ice cream 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.820
 spaghetti 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.299
 only here is to have a bit of 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:29.440
 sugar there you can not eat much and 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:32.390
 the good regulators are fruit salad 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.950
 vegetables are those foods that do not 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.890
 it can run a lot 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.610
 where to eat the drivers are the 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.610
 third level 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:49.319
 the tones sectors of food construction 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:52.860
 fish meat chicken is the booster jam esse 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.280
 It has to be the kind like every once in a while. 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.920
 then have the tip that are sugar salt 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.700
 stuffed wafers that can 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.900
 be eaten only from time to time and not 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:12.269
 can be exchanged for healthy food 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.560
 good finish so I hope you 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.079
 liked 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.079
 Have a good night, thank you.
