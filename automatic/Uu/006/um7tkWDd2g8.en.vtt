of MVP dream and the expansion of annual
prime<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.459> in<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:38.420> much<00:03:38.480> trouble<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.200> is<00:03:39.380> about

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
prime is in so much trouble it is about

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.819 
prime is in so much trouble it is about
to<00:03:40.099> die<00:03:40.310> if<00:03:40.579> not<00:03:40.880> for<00:03:41.150> some<00:03:41.359> miracle<00:03:42.290> recovery

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
to die if not for some miracle recovery

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.190 
to die if not for some miracle recovery
because<00:03:43.400> two<00:03:43.819> bunkers<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:44.419> eight<00:03:44.900> Marines

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
because two bunkers and eight Marines

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.559 
because two bunkers and eight Marines
that's<00:03:45.980> something<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.519> you<00:03:46.790> don't<00:03:47.120> kill

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
that's something that you don't kill

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.430 
that's something that you don't kill
easily<00:03:48.319> so<00:03:48.620> why<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.340> an<00:03:49.819> young<00:03:50.329> Prime<00:03:50.660> in<00:03:50.930> the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
easily so why is an young Prime in the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.009 
easily so why is an young Prime in the
position<00:03:51.919> to<00:03:52.130> counter<00:03:53.000> this<00:03:53.389> attack<00:03:53.810> it

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
position to counter this attack it

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.140 
position to counter this attack it
certainly<00:03:54.440> does<00:03:54.799> not<00:03:54.829> look<00:03:55.489> like<00:03:55.549> he's<00:03:55.940> going

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
certainly does not look like he's going

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.870 
certainly does not look like he's going
to<00:03:56.269> survive<00:03:56.720> as<00:03:56.959> two<00:03:57.709> bunkers<00:03:58.220> are<00:03:58.459> being<00:03:58.700> man

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
that an young can do right now is go for

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.970 
that an young can do right now is go for
some<00:04:29.300> kind<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:29.810> an<00:04:29.930> all-in<00:04:30.260> but<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:30.860> going

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
some kind of an all-in but this is going

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.890 
some kind of an all-in but this is going
to<00:04:31.100> be<00:04:31.220> pretty<00:04:31.730> difficult<00:04:32.090> as<00:04:32.540> he<00:04:32.630> doesn't

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
to be pretty difficult as he doesn't

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.280 
to be pretty difficult as he doesn't
even<00:04:33.169> have<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.470> gas<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:33.889> get<00:04:34.310> speed<00:04:35.139> well<00:04:36.139> he

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
even have the gas to get speed well he

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.170 
even have the gas to get speed well he
can't<00:04:37.010> even<00:04:37.130> get<00:04:37.310> speed<00:04:37.699> so<00:04:37.880> how<00:04:38.000> is<00:04:38.150> he

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
can't even get speed so how is he

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.850 
can't even get speed so how is he
supposed<00:04:38.389> to<00:04:38.690> go<00:04:38.810> for<00:04:38.990> some<00:04:39.080> kind<00:04:39.229> of<00:04:39.350> all<00:04:39.590> in
