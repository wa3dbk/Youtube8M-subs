00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.010
 a life 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.420
 Good day to all friends with you 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.240
 have peace today we will talk about one 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.360
 very extraordinary car it will be about 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.810
 google panda if in german and if 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.000
 simpler then the ball tanker video for this 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.900
 car suggested to make alexander 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.230
 Schulenin 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.830
 so friends what kind of unit 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.559
 This car was captured by the Soviet 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:43.059
 troops at the training ground skirt Mars darphin 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:45.850
 along with a tank mouse and another interesting 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.269
 I hit them on the back with a technique 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.119
 panzar no documents for this car 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.030
 was not found was only found 

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:57.400
 note that this car 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.769
 developed by the company of cereals armored 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.549
 was a cylinder with thickness 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.560
 beads 5 millimeters abortion which with 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.189
 a slight bias were two 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.830
 rotating hemispheres with simple 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.960
 lugs which were 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.570
 the propeller inside the tank was located 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.000
 instead of the driver and the only lookout 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.670
 the device is just a gap which 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.579
 located at eye level at the driver 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.579
 the rear of the motorcycle 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.890
 only 25 engine 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.259
 rear horsepower on the outside 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.749
 surface fly mounted bracket 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.579
 with a small metal tail wheel 

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:39.569
 diameters which 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:43.719
 and used to say so 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:46.329
 turns this unit above it 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:49.450
 there was a landing hatch using 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.060
 which our mechanic made his way into the tank 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.249
 the driver with whom it was most likely 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.069
 the only crew member whirling on 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.810
 this machine was not installed although 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.630
 some materials can be found 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.760
 information that was able to transport 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.810
 in laying it 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.050
 tanketki let's call it so one machine gun 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.020
 mg-42 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.810
 weight of the car was 800 ton 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.680
 kilogram maximum speed reached 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.080
 8 kilometers per hour no one has yet 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.050
 can give a precise definition of why 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.860
 needed this machine it was not 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.800
 combat since what is the weaponry on it 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.380
 there was most likely a conclusion 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.270
 that google panda could be used 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.580
 only as his armored 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.880
 observation post at landfills 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.010
 test any other machines so 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.870
 how to send it to the front was say 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.880
 so stupid idea 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.010
 in some materials can be found 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.620
 that this wedge used to 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.160
 artillery fire adjustments 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:00.730
 by the way, the very idea of ​​a tank ball is far from 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.140
 New in 1925 1935 in the USSR was 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.430
 submitted for consideration several 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.170
 interesting projects of armored tanks 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.390
 spherical shapes besides the project 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.330
 a similar machine was offered to the military 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.760
 UK Office in both cases 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.160
 from the realization of the tango ball in the metal you 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.739
 abandoned because their technical 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.209
 characteristics are quite inferior 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.750
 conventional tank 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.040
 these are the friends here this tank and 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.480
 bought a panda is now in Cuba and 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.540

 wonderful museum and let's say it personally 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.810
