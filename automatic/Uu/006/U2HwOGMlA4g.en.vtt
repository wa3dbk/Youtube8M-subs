10 and they are they came out at the
same<00:00:31.679> time<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.960> about

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
same time but this one just was about

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.569 
same time but this one just was about
$60<00:00:35.309> more<00:00:35.550> MSRP<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:37.020> has<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> few<00:00:38.280> nicer

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
$60 more MSRP it has a few nicer

$60 more MSRP it has a few nicer
features<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.050> display<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> little

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
features the display is a little

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.190 
features the display is a little
brighter<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.450> laid<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.260> neater<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
brighter and laid out neater you have a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.850 
brighter and laid out neater you have a
larger<00:00:48.680> peak<00:00:49.680> program<00:00:50.129> meter<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.860> it's

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
larger peak program meter and it's

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
larger peak program meter and it's
labeled<00:00:53.100> properly<00:00:54.020> for<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.199> over<00:00:55.289> here

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
labeled properly for the one over here

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.830 
labeled properly for the one over here
is<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.949> big<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:57.840> MDS<00:00:58.350> je5<00:00:59.070> 20<00:00:59.670> has<00:01:00.000> analog

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
is not so big the MDS je5 20 has analog

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080 
is not so big the MDS je5 20 has analog
and<00:01:01.199> digital<00:01:01.230> inputs<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.070> well<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.609> 510

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and digital inputs as well as the 510

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.200 
and digital inputs as well as the 510
but<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.589> gonna<00:01:04.830> probably<00:01:05.670> assume<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.030> used

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
but I'm gonna probably assume they used

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.670 
but I'm gonna probably assume they used
better<00:01:06.420> quality<00:01:06.990> hardware<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:08.060> making<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
better quality hardware in making this

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
better quality hardware in making this
but<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.220> optical<00:01:11.790> 1<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> 2

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
but there you have your optical 1 and 2

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.510 
but there you have your optical 1 and 2
input<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.350> has<00:01:13.500> an<00:01:13.650> output<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> can

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
input and it has an output so you can

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.880 
input and it has an output so you can
you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.689> optical<00:01:19.020> output

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.320 

and<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> recording<00:01:24.000> digital

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and you can do the recording digital

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.130 
and you can do the recording digital
recording<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.869> from<00:01:25.170> analog<00:01:25.590> recording<00:01:27.140> this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
recording and from analog recording this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.340 
recording and from analog recording this
is<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.409> August<00:01:28.950> 1998<00:01:29.579> same<00:01:30.570> date<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.140> one

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
is a August 1998 same date is that one

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.679 
is a August 1998 same date is that one
so<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.000> exactly<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.659> same

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so I know there are exactly the same

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.660 
so I know there are exactly the same
they<00:01:34.110> probably<00:01:34.350> sat<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> shelf<00:01:35.340> next<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
they probably sat on the shelf next to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.420 
they probably sat on the shelf next to
each<00:01:35.759> other<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.090> Costco<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:37.409> uh<00:01:37.470> yeah<00:01:38.189> I'm

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
each other at Costco but uh yeah I'm

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.010 
each other at Costco but uh yeah I'm
gonna<00:01:38.610> upgrade<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.390> right<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:39.750> I'm<00:01:39.900> just

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
gonna upgrade it and right now I'm just

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.660 
gonna upgrade it and right now I'm just
testing<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.560> player<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> put<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> disc<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.579> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
testing the player I put a disc and I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.230 
testing the player I put a disc and I
recorded<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.680> oh<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.310> mechanism<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
recorded and oh the mechanism is a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.850 
recorded and oh the mechanism is a
little<00:01:45.540> faster<00:01:48.049> see<00:01:49.049> how<00:01:49.140> quickly<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> just

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
little faster see how quickly it just

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490 
little faster see how quickly it just
went<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> reading<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.119> injecting<00:01:51.930> where<00:01:52.350> on

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
went to reading and injecting where on

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.600 
went to reading and injecting where on
this<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.820> bit<00:01:53.939> slower<00:01:58.100> I<00:01:59.100> also<00:01:59.399> have

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
this one a little bit slower I also have

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.770 
this one a little bit slower I also have
a<00:01:59.670> remote<00:01:59.909> control<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:01.430> this<00:02:02.430> says<00:02:02.780> mini

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
a remote control for this this says mini

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
a remote control for this this says mini
disc<00:02:03.990> deck<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.070> probably<00:02:05.219> will<00:02:05.369> work<00:02:05.520> on

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
disc deck and it probably will work on

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.029 
disc deck and it probably will work on
this<00:02:05.759> one<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.210> don't<00:02:06.600> think<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.780> got<00:02:07.039> batteries

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
this one I don't think I got batteries

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.790 
this one I don't think I got batteries
in<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.869> I'll<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.170> sell<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.590> with

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
in it but if not I'll just sell it with

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.559 
in it but if not I'll just sell it with
my<00:02:10.950> old<00:02:11.099> one<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.849> I'm<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.209> install<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
my old one but I'm going to install it

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.309 
my old one but I'm going to install it
right<00:02:12.629> now

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
all right let's try my test disc yeah

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.780 
all right let's try my test disc yeah
seems<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.049> work<00:02:25.140> good<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.530> got<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.459> one<00:02:26.640> for

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
seems to work good I got this one for

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.970 
seems to work good I got this one for
ten<00:02:26.939> dollars<00:02:27.090> today<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.599> quite<00:02:28.469> happy<00:02:28.799> with<00:02:28.920> my

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
but they don't sound that bad here's

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.660 
but they don't sound that bad here's
what<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> mini<00:02:36.390> disc<00:02:36.599> looks<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:37.549> you<00:02:38.549> got<00:02:38.609> a

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
what a mini disc looks like you got a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.580 
what a mini disc looks like you got a
little<00:02:38.879> container<00:02:39.090> here<00:02:39.389> with<00:02:39.590> different

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
little container here with different

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.039 
little container here with different
colors<00:02:41.299> and<00:02:43.370> remember<00:02:44.370> right<00:02:44.519> there<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
colors and remember right there like a

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.740 
colors and remember right there like a
magneto-optical<00:02:46.049> technology<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.819> they<00:02:48.689> are

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
magneto-optical technology so they are

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.780 
magneto-optical technology so they are
not<00:02:49.019> affected<00:02:49.500> by<00:02:49.530> magnets<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.579> they're<00:02:50.670> not

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
not affected by magnets and they're not

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.179 
not affected by magnets and they're not
affected<00:02:51.269> by<00:02:51.419> strong<00:02:52.260> lasers<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:53.010> need<00:02:53.159> a

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
affected by strong lasers you need a

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.240 
affected by strong lasers you need a
combination<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.939> the<00:02:54.030> two<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.510> record<00:02:55.159> one<00:02:56.159> of

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
combination of the two to record one of

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.619 
combination of the two to record one of
the<00:02:56.310> discs<00:02:56.669> so<00:02:56.819> once<00:02:57.000> they're<00:02:57.150> recorded

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
the discs so once they're recorded

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.520 
the discs so once they're recorded
they're<00:02:57.780> very<00:02:58.819> stable<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.269> reliable<00:03:00.530> let's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
they're very stable and reliable let's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.080 
they're very stable and reliable let's
see<00:03:01.709> if<00:03:01.859> anything<00:03:02.099> else<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.609> disc<00:03:02.909> it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
see if anything else on this disc it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.330 
see if anything else on this disc it
says<00:03:03.269> dubstep<00:03:03.840> I'm<00:03:04.139> not<00:03:04.319> sure<00:03:04.560> what<00:03:05.310> I

says dubstep I'm not sure what I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:32.880 
says dubstep I'm not sure what I
recorded<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.939> there<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:08.220> anything<00:03:08.459> good
