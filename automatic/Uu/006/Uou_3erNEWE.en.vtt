00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.470
 Talk to me, my beauty. 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.990
 hawass in the area and today a video 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.730
 we will go straight to the point without 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.190
 too much 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.210
 Come on, I have this video here on my 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.650
 channel focus Hot jewelry not 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 set up the pedals and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.359
 digital to analog 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 I thought the pedals and steering wheel this 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.320
 conversion oo olympique teaching 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.719
 vitamin inscription 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.440
 but these settings that teaching in the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.840
 video, it is suitable for several 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 like mine, for example if there was a 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.200
 others too but there are a lot of people 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.420
 even many people and asked 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.420
 comments there the boy 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.500
 how do you do to set the gt 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.170
 I do not shift to getting even 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.059
 procedure, how do you 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.430
 had more people or grandmothers how do 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.540
 The way to shift father father came people. 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.090
 asking and I always responded like this 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.020
 today i never used gt shift ever 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.729
 there were actually only pictures is is and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.040
 it was difficult to give an answer 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.710
 concrete inserts teacher 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.189
 Then what I did I put on and went 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 to search and see what it is 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.930
 I ran and went after it was a forum between 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.850
 manufacturer's website was to see other 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.170
 people who spoke research and others 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.680
 videos on youtube 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.290
 the river where there to see I got a 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.350
 Not very nice answer, and for you. 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.649
 that has the gt shift that happens 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.750
 gt shift it does not support the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.070
 analog host configuration not 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.000
 there is not what happens because 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.329
 analog 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.600
 I'll show you, it's logical that 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.790
 stepping on joel 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.020
 what the analog I can let the 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.600
 half throttle 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.030
 I can step on the senator's son 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.520
 or I control that the level of the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.960
 federation I want to joy what would be the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.890
 digital camera if you take care of a 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.830
 a little 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.530
 it's like you 've tightened up around 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.500
 but because it supports being digital 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.920
 because here within the tolls they have a 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.569
 I'll show you, I'll just 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.380
 I saw that there is a little bit, look at this one. 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:31.019
 bad here on behalf of that is the testinha 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:35.500
 tensiometer this little one here he turns 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.630
 the first one that he plays jewelry is him 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.610
 that rotates so it is to them to 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.819
 acceleration as strong as it will come 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.650
 is stronger is like if you have a 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.709
 volume of those radio stations that the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.200
 old turntables right after you 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.180
 turn increases the volume turned them 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.310
 increased as you spin 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.930
 volume goes up 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.330
 comparing it is as if the acceleration was 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.959
 going up is going up 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.110
 understood then so it is not certain 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.299
 I saw some users of gt schiff 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.820
 I repeat, not sure, I do not say with 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.940
 sure I never saw the steering wheel but I saw 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.760
 many eyes talking that the steering wheel has the 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.250
 gt shift shift hosting has this 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.030
 car in here then pot 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.519
 it was to work it did not work 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.280
 maybe some driver problem right 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.640
 driver is the June software. 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.670
 zin program that communicates between 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.100
 the hardware equipment and the system 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.750
 operating system installed on the pc 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.180
 he who does the communication then maybe 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.269
 is a drive that is not a reading 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.420
 where interpreting communication of this 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.510
 that with the operating system 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.830
 then that's it 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.680
 I only saw this video to warn because 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.689
 there are many gt shift users who 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.420
 one is that they do not have an answer 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.140
 if the cellphone is given then after much 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.650
 search 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.610
 looking a lot to find gt shift no 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.760
 have set to be analog 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.260
 Analog jewelry is hosting is one of the 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.979
 my last evidence that I found was 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:24.000
 here is only was in the complaint here I found 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:28.199
 that looks only from the digital on the steering wheel gt 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 beauty shift I'll leave it here 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:35.310
 have all a text here a customer 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.190
 the steering wheel and entered into a 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.169
 company to get an answer 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.440
 the jewel and looks like it's the ultimate solution 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.510
 this problem was that the company changed 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.740
 the steering wheel for the customer and I'm not sure 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.740
 of jewelry 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.440
 I'll leave this link in the video so that 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.380
 you and have possibly done 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.240
 shift can take a look at it text 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.610
 so I just wanted to say video 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.560

 that you are looking there how you do 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.300
 the configuration has a response because 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.400
 myself researching suffer enough 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.340
 to find all I found 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.300
 to come to this final conclusion 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:21.539
 beauty is this then this is a video 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.789
 Right there because really what to help 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.490
 personnel and who have difficulty in 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.650
 find the answer is there 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.599
 hope this for you that building 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.889
 I was looking for 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:37.080
 The answer I know is that in the
