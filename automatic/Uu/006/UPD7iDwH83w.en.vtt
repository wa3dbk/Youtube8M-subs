00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.000 

well<00:00:17.320> good<00:00:17.500> morning

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
well good morning

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.040 
well good morning
we're<00:00:18.280> on<00:00:18.370> lesson<00:00:18.730> 39<00:00:19.240> this<00:00:19.480> morning<00:00:19.900> and

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
we're on lesson 39 this morning and

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.400 
we're on lesson 39 this morning and
we're<00:00:20.770> working<00:00:21.220> with<00:00:21.430> proportions<00:00:22.180> and<00:00:22.450> it's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
we're working with proportions and it's

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.590 
we're working with proportions and it's
really<00:00:23.650> not<00:00:23.890> new<00:00:24.190> to<00:00:24.340> us<00:00:24.369> if<00:00:24.730> you<00:00:24.850> recall<00:00:25.240> back

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
really not new to us if you recall back

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.609 
really not new to us if you recall back
in<00:00:25.869> math<00:00:26.619> 76<00:00:27.310> we<00:00:27.490> did<00:00:27.670> proportions<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:28.619> later

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
in math 76 we did proportions and later

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.260 
in math 76 we did proportions and later
on<00:00:29.860> in<00:00:30.010> this<00:00:30.160> book<00:00:30.460> we're<00:00:30.670> going<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.880> see<00:00:31.090> them

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
on in this book we're going to see them

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.540 
on in this book we're going to see them
again<00:00:31.680> only<00:00:32.680> we're<00:00:32.829> going<00:00:32.859> to<00:00:33.100> call<00:00:33.309> them

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
again only we're going to call them

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.740 
again only we're going to call them
scale<00:00:33.970> factors<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.940> know<00:00:37.090> you<00:00:37.149> recall

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
scale factors and you know you recall

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.500 
scale factors and you know you recall
scale<00:00:38.410> models<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.370> doll<00:00:39.820> houses<00:00:40.329> are<00:00:40.480> in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
scale models and doll houses are in

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.130 
scale models and doll houses are in
proportion<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:41.850> trains<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.180> planes<00:00:43.239> scale

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.010 
models that's where it comes from and I
guess<00:00:48.309> what<00:00:48.520> we<00:00:48.640> need<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.910> do<00:00:49.090> is<00:00:49.360> define<00:00:49.750> what

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
guess what we need to do is define what

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.299 
guess what we need to do is define what
is<00:00:50.590> a<00:00:50.620> proportion<00:00:51.660> well<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.930> proportion<00:00:53.770> is<00:00:53.920> a

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
is a proportion well a proportion is a

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.590 
is a proportion well a proportion is a
statement<00:00:54.879> of<00:00:55.180> two<00:00:55.660> equal<00:00:56.230> ratios<00:00:56.770> equal

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
statement of two equal ratios equal

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.260 
statement of two equal ratios equal
ratios<00:00:58.600> they<00:00:58.899> can't<00:00:59.140> be<00:00:59.320> unequal<00:00:59.890> for<00:01:00.820> example

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
ratios they can't be unequal for example

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:10.050 
ratios they can't be unequal for example
3/9<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:05.619> equal<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.369> x<00:01:06.700> over<00:01:07.180> three<00:01:08.760> now<00:01:09.760> if

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
3/9 is equal to x over three now if

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.870 
3/9 is equal to x over three now if
those<00:01:10.420> are<00:01:10.659> equal<00:01:11.280> ratios<00:01:12.280> then<00:01:12.549> we<00:01:12.700> have<00:01:12.850> a

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
those are equal ratios then we have a

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.180 
those are equal ratios then we have a
valid<00:01:13.299> proportion<00:01:13.990> well<00:01:14.710> there's<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.950> very

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
valid proportion well there's a very

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.890 
valid proportion well there's a very
neat<00:01:16.320> property<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.590> proportions<00:01:18.340> if<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
neat property of proportions if the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.700 
neat property of proportions if the
ratios<00:01:20.290> are<00:01:20.470> equal<00:01:20.650> so<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:23.170> their<00:01:23.380> cross

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
ratios are equal so are their cross

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.359 
ratios are equal so are their cross
products<00:01:24.340> okay<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:26.320> I'm<00:01:26.500> going<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.710> take<00:01:27.010> nine

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
products okay so I'm going to take nine

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.149 
products okay so I'm going to take nine
X<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.330> set<00:01:28.540> it<00:01:28.659> equal<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:29.400> three<00:01:30.400> times<00:01:31.060> three

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
X and set it equal to three times three

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.249 
X and set it equal to three times three
now<00:01:33.159> what<00:01:33.369> undoes<00:01:33.759> multiplication<00:01:34.259> what's

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
now what undoes multiplication what's

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.130 
now what undoes multiplication what's
the<00:01:35.470> opposite<00:01:36.009> of<00:01:36.189> it<00:01:36.310> well<00:01:36.549> it's<00:01:37.420> division

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
the opposite of it well it's division

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.649 
the opposite of it well it's division
and<00:01:38.350> since<00:01:39.189> there's<00:01:39.490> an<00:01:39.640> equal<00:01:39.939> sign<00:01:40.210> we<00:01:40.479> have

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
and since there's an equal sign we have

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.560 
and since there's an equal sign we have
to<00:01:40.840> treat<00:01:41.080> them<00:01:41.200> alike<00:01:41.530> we<00:01:41.799> recall<00:01:42.220> that<00:01:42.570> that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
to treat them alike we recall that that

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.130 
to treat them alike we recall that that
will<00:01:43.750> cancel<00:01:44.080> leaving<00:01:44.320> X<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.130> equal<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:46.140> 9

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
will cancel leaving X is equal to 9

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.060 
will cancel leaving X is equal to 9
divided<00:01:48.130> by<00:01:48.159> 9<00:01:48.369> which<00:01:49.240> equals<00:01:49.270> 1<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.890> that

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
divided by 9 which equals 1 and that

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.499 
divided by 9 which equals 1 and that
makes<00:01:51.340> sense<00:01:51.579> because<00:01:51.960> 3/9<00:01:52.960> reduces<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:55.060> 1/3

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
makes sense because 3/9 reduces to 1/3

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.710 
makes sense because 3/9 reduces to 1/3
so<00:01:56.500> there's<00:01:56.710> nothing<00:01:56.860> magic<00:01:57.640> about

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
so there's nothing magic about

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.569 
so there's nothing magic about
proportions<00:01:58.720> we've<00:01:58.930> seen<00:01:59.200> them<00:01:59.320> before<00:01:59.579> we're

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
proportions we've seen them before we're

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:01.350 
proportions we've seen them before we're
going<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.759> see<00:02:00.939> them<00:02:01.060> again

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
going to see them again

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.870 
going to see them again
so<00:02:02.049> let's<00:02:02.290> use<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:02.770> characteristic<00:02:03.460> of

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
so let's use this characteristic of

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.859 
so let's use this characteristic of
cross<00:02:04.380> products<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:06.729> solve<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:07.180> few<00:02:07.420> see<00:02:07.810> how

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
cross products to solve a few see how

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.940 
cross products to solve a few see how
they<00:02:08.079> work<00:02:08.489> let's<00:02:09.489> try<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:09.759> one<00:02:10.680> X<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:12.010> 212

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
they work let's try this one X is 212

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.979 
they work let's try this one X is 212
fifteen<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:16.080> 20<00:02:17.450> now<00:02:18.450> there's<00:02:18.660> nothing

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
fifteen is to 20 now there's nothing

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.830 
fifteen is to 20 now there's nothing
wrong<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.819> reducing<00:02:20.819> before<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.450> work<00:02:21.690> it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
wrong with reducing before you work it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.199 
wrong with reducing before you work it
out<00:02:21.959> making<00:02:22.440> your<00:02:22.470> multiplications<00:02:23.370> easier

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
out making your multiplications easier

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.100 
out making your multiplications easier
so<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.170> would<00:02:25.379> reduce<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.800> x<00:02:26.370> over<00:02:26.670> 12<00:02:27.180> is

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
so this would reduce to x over 12 is

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.530 
so this would reduce to x over 12 is
equal<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.709> five<00:02:29.220> goes<00:02:29.550> into<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.940> three<00:02:30.269> times

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
equal to five goes into that three times

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.259 
equal to five goes into that three times
and<00:02:30.870> goes<00:02:30.989> into<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.410> four<00:02:31.739> times<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> it's

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
and goes into that four times so it's

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.140 
and goes into that four times so it's
equal<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.720> three-fourths<00:02:34.410> now<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.880> cross

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
equal to three-fourths now we can cross

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.339 
equal to three-fourths now we can cross
multiply<00:02:37.310> 4x<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:39.269> equal<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.780> 3<00:02:40.849> times<00:02:41.849> 12<00:02:42.349> again

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
multiply 4x is equal to 3 times 12 again

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.740 
multiply 4x is equal to 3 times 12 again
the<00:02:43.590> opposite<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.280> multiplication<00:02:45.180> is

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
the opposite of multiplication is

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.539 
the opposite of multiplication is
division<00:02:45.959> treating<00:02:46.769> both<00:02:46.980> sides<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.519> that

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
division treating both sides of that

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.690

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
that's 120 and 60 that's 180 so we got

you<00:03:53.850> don't<00:03:54.000> have<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.750> makes<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.049> easier

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
you don't have to but it makes it easier

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.660 
you don't have to but it makes it easier
to<00:03:56.639> work<00:03:56.790> with<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.359> that<00:03:57.630> equals<00:03:58.370> 8<00:03:59.370> times<00:04:00.170> 24

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
to work with and that equals 8 times 24

opposite<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:02.819> multiplication<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.989> division

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
opposite of multiplication is division

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.910 
opposite of multiplication is division
treating<00:04:05.130> both<00:04:05.310> sides<00:04:05.639> alike<00:04:06.049> so<00:04:07.049> G<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.560> equal

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
treating both sides alike so G is equal

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.150 
treating both sides alike so G is equal
to<00:04:08.599> 3<00:04:09.599> goes<00:04:09.780> into<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.169> once<00:04:10.470> goes<00:04:10.829> into<00:04:11.040> that

to 3 goes into that once goes into that

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.240 
to 3 goes into that once goes into that
8<00:04:11.220> times<00:04:12.019> it's<00:04:13.019> equal<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:13.500> 8<00:04:13.700> times<00:04:14.700> 8<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.930> G<00:04:16.349> is

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
8 times it's equal to 8 times 8 so G is

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.629 
8 times it's equal to 8 times 8 so G is
equal<00:04:17.789> to<00:04:18.000> 64<00:04:18.720> we<00:04:19.530> won't<00:04:19.709> check<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.310> but<00:04:20.519> if

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
equal to 64 we won't check that but if

equal to 64 we won't check that but if
we<00:04:20.789> did<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.419> can<00:04:21.870> tell<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.260> it's<00:04:22.409> correct<00:04:23.030> all

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
we did I can tell you it's correct all

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.220 
we did I can tell you it's correct all
right<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.539> last<00:04:24.720> one<00:04:25.220> not<00:04:26.220> difficult

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
right the last one not difficult

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.540 
right the last one not difficult
don't<00:04:29.230> panic<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:31.120> know<00:04:31.240> how<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.450> do<00:04:31.630> these<00:04:32.550> 63

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
don't panic you know how to do these 63

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.000 
don't panic you know how to do these 63
is<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:34.180> why<00:04:34.390> as<00:04:36.060> 24<00:04:37.060> is<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:38.070> 4.8<00:04:40.740> now<00:04:41.740> if<00:04:41.890> you

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
is to why as 24 is the 4.8 now if you

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.520 
is to why as 24 is the 4.8 now if you
looked<00:04:42.250> at<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.460> both<00:04:42.940> 24<00:04:43.420> and<00:04:43.810> 48<00:04:44.320> are

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
looked at that both 24 and 48 are

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.640 
looked at that both 24 and 48 are
divisible<00:04:44.830> by<00:04:45.130> 24<00:04:45.960> so<00:04:46.960> I'm<00:04:47.140> going<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.380> go<00:04:47.530> ahead

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
divisible by 24 so I'm going to go ahead

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.170 
divisible by 24 so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:47.950> divide<00:04:48.190> them<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.610> that's<00:04:48.760> going<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.060> be

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
and divide them and that's going to be

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.980 
and divide them and that's going to be
equal<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.810> 1<00:04:50.110> over<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:51.840> 24<00:04:53.430> into<00:04:54.430> 4.8<00:04:55.330> here's

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
equal to 1 over and 24 into 4.8 here's

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.060 
equal to 1 over and 24 into 4.8 here's
my<00:04:56.200> decimal<00:04:56.800> goes<00:04:57.760> 2<00:04:58.030> times<00:04:58.380> but<00:04:59.380> it's<00:04:59.560> decimal

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
my decimal goes 2 times but it's decimal

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.260 
my decimal goes 2 times but it's decimal
2<00:05:00.460> so<00:05:01.210> that's<00:05:01.770> 0.2

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
2 so that's 0.2

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.400 
2 so that's 0.2
all<00:05:04.270> right<00:05:04.600> so<00:05:04.870> 63<00:05:05.350> y<00:05:06.250> is<00:05:07.240> equal<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:07.840> 1<00:05:08.050> over<00:05:08.760> 0.2

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
all right so 63 y is equal to 1 over 0.2

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.040 
all right so 63 y is equal to 1 over 0.2
now<00:05:11.410> when<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.740> cross<00:05:12.010> multiply<00:05:12.670> I<00:05:13.060> really<00:05:13.840> get

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
now when I cross multiply I really get

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.090 
now when I cross multiply I really get
1y<00:05:14.620> right<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:16.960> since<00:05:17.230> it's<00:05:17.410> one<00:05:17.620> we<00:05:17.890> don't

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
1y right but since it's one we don't

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.240 
1y right but since it's one we don't
have<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.460> write<00:05:18.640> it<00:05:18.820> just<00:05:19.060> leave<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.390> Y<00:05:19.570> and

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
have to write it just leave the Y and

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:27.300 
have to write it just leave the Y and
that's<00:05:21.250> equal<00:05:21.700> to<00:05:22.350> 63<00:05:23.790> by<00:05:24.810> 0.2<00:05:25.920> now<00:05:26.920> you<00:05:26.980> recall

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
that's equal to 63 by 0.2 now you recall

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.340 
that's equal to 63 by 0.2 now you recall
when<00:05:27.760> we<00:05:27.790> multiply<00:05:28.480> you<00:05:28.840> can<00:05:28.990> take<00:05:29.170> the

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
when we multiply you can take the

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.240 
when we multiply you can take the
numbers<00:05:29.830> themselves<00:05:30.040> so<00:05:30.670> Y<00:05:30.880> is<00:05:30.970> equal<00:05:31.240> to<00:05:32.250> 63

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
numbers themselves so Y is equal to 63

numbers themselves so Y is equal to 63
times<00:05:33.820> 2<00:05:34.180> is<00:05:34.390> 126<00:05:35.700> but<00:05:36.700> I've<00:05:36.820> got<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.030> decimal

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
times 2 is 126 but I've got a decimal

we're<00:05:43.300> starting<00:05:43.780> to<00:05:43.810> put<00:05:44.080> things<00:05:44.320> together<00:05:44.580> we

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
we're starting to put things together we

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.760 
we're starting to put things together we
did<00:05:45.820> a<00:05:45.850> lot<00:05:46.060> of<00:05:46.090> this<00:05:46.330> in<00:05:46.540> math<00:05:46.720> 76<00:05:47.410> and<00:05:47.620> now

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
did a lot of this in math 76 and now

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.170 
did a lot of this in math 76 and now
we're<00:05:47.950> going<00:05:48.130> to<00:05:48.250> start<00:05:48.550> moving<00:05:48.790> a<00:05:49.030> little

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
we're going to start moving a little

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.990 
we're going to start moving a little
faster<00:05:49.750> because<00:05:50.170> we're<00:05:51.100> in<00:05:51.250> something<00:05:51.790> called

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
faster because we're in something called

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.070 
faster because we're in something called
pre-algebra<00:05:54.000> I'll<00:05:55.000> tell<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.450> tomorrow<00:05:55.630> what

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
pre-algebra I'll tell you tomorrow what

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.440 
pre-algebra I'll tell you tomorrow what
that<00:05:56.290> means<00:05:56.560> but<00:05:57.460> most<00:05:57.700> of<00:05:57.880> you<00:05:58.000> already<00:05:58.180> know

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
that means but most of you already know

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.550 
that means but most of you already know
ok<00:05:59.260> we'll<00:06:00.190> see<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:00.400> tomorrow
