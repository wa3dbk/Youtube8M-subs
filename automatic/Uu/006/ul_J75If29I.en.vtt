00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.169
 I think it's the year of the title 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.869
 the night I say because it's true that all these notes that year eyes 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.150
 there was beautiful game and at the same time we had a lot of things with them 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.090
 by winning we win this title the last day 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.110
 and she is the arrival% of her passes quantity neutral attitude all little as 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.260
 your friends the best 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.120
 but the river at the stage 4 21 euros 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.100
 people had been waiting for us since midnight 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.540
 it was then the 7th memories I think will remain engraved in all 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.490
 memories of the two young people were present on France 2 I do not 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.560
 corresponded% by weight 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.950
 now I have been targeted but I think we were wrong a little bit 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.240
 metro targets it was like that 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.630
 it is true that I was a little in the tri-nations euros more so necessarily 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.650
 I was responsible and croissants sometimes wax to now it's very 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.790
 although it's not a player who makes a team 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.890
 we can see the wallet that those set ature 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.070
 quick which brings the lÃ©geois to show in their quality 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.740
 and I think we want this year this contest will be much more 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.990
 and see or misleading 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.570
 certain qualities that made 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.920
 that below that I cried in the blur to detect the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.350
 six-party talks that was welcomed before the season here are five 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.020
 today 34 to win that speech was clear 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.330
 % for the sides of listened in emotion shattered at times 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.030
 given a bit of an internship in a little more chained regularly every 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.800
 matches 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.860
 so here I go I understand no worries but it's true it's always 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 difficult when we do not advance enough 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.270
 to the team because it has always been my mentor my common goal 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.930
 in my head this is the collective climate 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.460
 that makes me vibrate the heart we learned was to be there days sochaux on the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.130
 field and then hop so far that's going pretty well now 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.580
 that I never have too much of the coast and reporters his season is dead because 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.500
 that it's because I do not give them a lot for who gets caught up in the game a little 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.519
 in their own way 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.779
 I think that's good 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:22.089
 now for me I try to be independent to be free 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.499
 I always lived like that, yes 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:28.059
 cc what is really annoying them is that it's a little me who decides 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.129
 of what I want to do it is the site draws it's 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.129
 it may have helped me in my career it's done 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.120
 so I'm happy that I'm free no but in my head I'm 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.739
 say that the contract stops and that unemployment will reach the end of the season 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.779
 so 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:45.290
 for sure it's not obvious because we are provided we must stop 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.689
 but I'm lucky if the teacher takes you to 5% 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.599
 less than the key data of the seats because this speaker
