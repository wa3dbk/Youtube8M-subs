00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.310 

this<00:01:34.790> far<00:01:35.060> north<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.479> can<00:01:35.780> grow<00:01:35.960> them<00:01:36.110> in<00:01:36.229> the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
this far north you can grow them in the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.930 
this far north you can grow them in the
full<00:01:36.470> Sun<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:36.950> doesn't<00:01:37.250> bother<00:01:37.369> them<00:01:37.640> I

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
full Sun and it doesn't bother them I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.430 
full Sun and it doesn't bother them I
would<00:01:38.720> say<00:01:38.840> if<00:01:38.900> you're<00:01:38.960> going<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.170> grow<00:01:39.290> this

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
would say if you're going to grow this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.719 
would say if you're going to grow this
in<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.710> deep<00:01:39.830> south<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.310> probably<00:01:40.550> want<00:01:40.700> to

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
in the deep south you probably want to

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.580 
in the deep south you probably want to
go<00:01:40.850> into<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.060> shaded<00:01:41.390> location<00:01:41.540> probably<00:01:42.380> get

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
go into the shaded location probably get

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.230 
go into the shaded location probably get
more<00:01:42.860> water<00:01:43.070> I<00:01:43.369> don't<00:01:43.790> know<00:01:43.910> if<00:01:44.000> they'd<00:01:44.119> like

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
more water I don't know if they'd like

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.460 
more water I don't know if they'd like
