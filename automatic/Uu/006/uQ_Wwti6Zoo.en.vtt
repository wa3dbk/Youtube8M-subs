00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
mountain of huge distortion which is

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.740 
mountain of huge distortion which is
great<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:42.940> really<00:00:43.940> nice<00:00:44.059> thing<00:00:44.300> is<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:44.510> sounds

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
great clean too it's got a lot of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.640 
great clean too it's got a lot of
flexibility<00:00:47.269> and<00:00:47.510> so<00:00:48.110> let's<00:00:48.290> get<00:00:48.409> in<00:00:48.530> and

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
flexibility and so let's get in and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.290 
flexibility and so let's get in and
check<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:48.829> out<00:00:49.070> this<00:00:49.489> is<00:00:49.519> a<00:00:49.640> really<00:00:49.730> thick

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
check it out this is a really thick

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.450 
check it out this is a really thick
sound<00:00:50.570> in<00:00:50.720> all<00:00:50.900> analog<00:00:51.290> chorus<00:00:51.829> it's<00:00:52.309> got

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
sound in all analog chorus it's got

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.399 
sound in all analog chorus it's got
bucket-brigade<00:00:52.909> technology<00:00:53.750> in<00:00:53.870> it<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.199> it's

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
bucket-brigade technology in it so it's

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.979 
bucket-brigade technology in it so it's
got<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:54.829> classic<00:00:55.309> analog<00:00:55.970> chorus<00:00:56.390> sound<00:00:56.690> and

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
got that classic analog chorus sound and

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.899 
got that classic analog chorus sound and
but<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.769> nice<00:00:57.920> thing<00:00:57.949> is<00:00:58.339> you've<00:00:58.579> got<00:00:58.610> enough

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
but the nice thing is you've got enough

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.219 
but the nice thing is you've got enough
control<00:00:59.149> in<00:00:59.390> here<00:00:59.570> that<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.750> could<00:00:59.870> back<00:01:00.079> it

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
control in here that you could back it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:01.810 
control in here that you could back it
off<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:00.680> can<00:01:00.860> give<00:01:01.159> it<00:01:01.250> different<00:01:01.579> shades

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
off and you can give it different shades

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.610 
off and you can give it different shades
and<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:02.329> really<00:01:02.690> sounds<00:01:02.930> great<00:01:03.140> a<00:01:03.230> lot<00:01:03.469> of

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
and it really sounds great a lot of

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.950 
and it really sounds great a lot of
different<00:01:03.890> settings<00:01:04.100> for<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.210> unaffected

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
different settings for the unaffected

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.499 
different settings for the unaffected

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.060 

right<00:01:25.510> here<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.810> is<00:01:25.900> with<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.290> black<00:01:26.770> animal

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
right here it is with the black animal

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.090 
right here it is with the black animal
chorus<00:01:27.430> engaged

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.330 

you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.500 

and<00:01:36.340> that's<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.580> same<00:01:36.730> savings<00:01:36.970> they<00:01:37.210> use<00:01:37.360> in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
and that's the same savings they use in

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.750 
and that's the same savings they use in
the<00:01:37.600> intro<00:01:37.900> that's<00:01:38.140> actually<00:01:38.530> called<00:01:39.130> Zak's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
the intro that's actually called Zak's

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.400 
the intro that's actually called Zak's
setting<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.660> that's<00:01:40.870> his<00:01:41.080> favorite

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
setting so that's his favorite

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.350 
setting so that's his favorite
apparently<00:01:41.860> like<00:01:42.190> most<00:01:42.400> standard<00:01:42.730> courses<00:01:43.150> it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
apparently like most standard courses it

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.390 
apparently like most standard courses it
has<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.570> rate<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.230> a<00:01:44.260> depth<00:01:44.500> control<00:01:44.710> so<00:01:45.220> let's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
has a rate and a depth control so let's

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.990 
has a rate and a depth control so let's
check<00:01:45.580> that<00:01:45.700> out

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.469 

right

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:09.530 

and<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.259> depth<00:01:57.469> control

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.790 

another<00:02:10.540> feature<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.960> has<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.320> a<00:02:11.410> level

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
another feature it has is a level

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.590 
another feature it has is a level
control<00:02:12.220> which<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:12.550> great<00:02:12.940> because<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.360> blends

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
control which is great because it blends

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.870 
control which is great because it blends
in<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.020> original<00:02:14.440> signal<00:02:14.710> with<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.610> chorus

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
in the original signal with the chorus

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.900 
in the original signal with the chorus
signal

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.970 

right<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:20.750> there<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:20.990> is<00:02:21.080> blended<00:02:21.380> completely

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
right so there it is blended completely

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.600 
right so there it is blended completely
out

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.160 

you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.470 

and<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:28.950> all<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> way<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:30.060> EQ

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
and there it is all the way in the EQ

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.180 
and there it is all the way in the EQ
controls<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:31.170> really<00:02:31.380> help<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.620> dial<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.069> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
controls can really help you dial in the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.800 
controls can really help you dial in the
sound<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.790> fact<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.180> going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.360> add<00:02:33.510> some

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
sound in fact I'm going to add some

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.420 
sound in fact I'm going to add some
highs<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.560> you've<00:02:34.770> got<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> high<00:02:35.130> end<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
highs on this you've got a high end a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370 
highs on this you've got a high end a
low<00:02:35.580> control<00:02:35.940> I've<00:02:36.300> got<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.990> lows<00:02:37.200> just

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
low control I've got the lows just

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.660 
low control I've got the lows just
slightly<00:02:37.650> boosted<00:02:38.160> but<00:02:38.250> I'm<00:02:38.310> going<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.490> really

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
slightly boosted but I'm going to really

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.850 
slightly boosted but I'm going to really
boost<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.090> highs<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.569> for<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.200> clean<00:02:40.530> sound

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
boost the highs and for this clean sound

00:02:40.860 --> 00:03:01.240 
boost the highs and for this clean sound
here<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.250> we'll<00:02:41.340> check<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.670> out
