00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hey nice that you watch this video 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.810
 I explain you a very simple way 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.099
 how you can jailbreak your iphone 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.780
 The first thing to do is your 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.620
 password and possibly your toucher 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.820
 turn of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.719
 you do this by going to settings 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.250
 go to touch from that and access code 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.020
 if you have an iphone 5s or higher or 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.150
 that your iphone is unlocking 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.800
 and itunes and app seat out and like you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.800
 go there so turn off code 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.029

 up to your apple id and then you have it 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.469
 switched off 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.000
 Jan the last step before we go 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.890
 that's your phone in 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.629
 set airplane mode 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.430
 then grab your iphone and connect it 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.579
 on your laptop and then we can 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.579
 to start 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.399
 if you have connected iphone to ouch 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.680
 and trudged life that you own a copy 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.910
 makes is especially useful for yourself 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.469
 something goes wrong 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.090

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.890
 little chance come easily reset 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.440
 then go left in the description 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.820
 refers to the lakeman program 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.439
 to be able to download your iphone 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.729
 jailbreak this when it came to your food 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.200
 pangu 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.439

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.310
 done it is then you just bag it 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.310
 save and open the file 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.659
 then click on the app and if all goes well 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.399
 is yes i have to go once or even one 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.020
 clicking on that is not necessary either 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.119
 and then cut the program and dim 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.170
 all you have to do is on 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.170
 click chill week 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.770
 Is there any useful tips that have already 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.150
 taken by whether you do something with it 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.860
 and then you can click on all of this as 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.240
 what happens now is that your iphone should you 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.580
 soul simply gives it to us automatically 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.990
 done takes a few minutes and you wonder 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.350
 really nothing to do at all 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.350
 to wait 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.260
 and therefore count your iphone 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.750
 you have to go back to 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.160
 we had to do that 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.420
 as your waist saw, the iphone is cola 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.920
 with chill sermons 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.349

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.060
 iphone is restarted to the 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.010
