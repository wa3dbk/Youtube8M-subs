hi I'm Larry with absolute electric I'm
here<00:00:03.030> today<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:04.339> change<00:00:05.339> out<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> plug<00:00:05.850> outlet

on<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.480> exterior<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.140> building<00:00:07.589> here

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
on the exterior of this building here

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.459 
on the exterior of this building here
the<00:00:08.400> codes<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:09.000> changed<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:10.019> here

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
the codes have changed and we have here

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.339 
the codes have changed and we have here
is<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> standard<00:00:11.099> traditional<00:00:12.349> weatherproof

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
is a standard traditional weatherproof

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.890 
is a standard traditional weatherproof
outlet<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.820> got<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> cord<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:15.540> plugged

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
outlet and it's got a cord it's plugged

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.390 
outlet and it's got a cord it's plugged
into<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.770> looks<00:00:16.920> like<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.220> being

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
into it and it looks like it's being

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.240 
into it and it looks like it's being
done<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> continuous<00:00:18.660> basis<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
done on a continuous basis and so the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.620 
done on a continuous basis and so the
code<00:00:20.460> whether<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.090> anything<00:00:21.420> plugged

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
code whether you have anything plugged

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.599 
code whether you have anything plugged
in<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.680> requiring<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
in or not is requiring that you have a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.179 
in or not is requiring that you have a
bubble<00:00:24.000> cover<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.510> sort<00:00:25.199> could<00:00:25.619> protect<00:00:26.039> this

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
bubble cover a sort could protect this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.980 
bubble cover a sort could protect this
outlet<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.359> we're<00:00:27.480> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.869> we're

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
outlet so we're going to do is we're

outlet so we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> go<00:00:28.260> ahead<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.529> replace<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.980> put<00:00:29.550> it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
going to go ahead and replace it put it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.009 
going to go ahead and replace it put it
on<00:00:29.760> there<00:00:29.939> I'll<00:00:30.060> talk<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.570> little<00:00:30.810> bit<00:00:30.990> about

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
on there I'll talk a little bit about

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.720 
on there I'll talk a little bit about
what<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.410> doing<00:00:31.679> as<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> hopefully

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you'll get some good information out of

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190 
you'll get some good information out of
it<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.790> first<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:36.719> we're<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.020> do

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it so first thing what we're going to do

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.350 
it so first thing what we're going to do
is<00:00:37.559> we're<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.010> ahead<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.489> we're

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
is we're going to go ahead and we're

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.000 
is we're going to go ahead and we're
going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.690> make<00:00:39.989> sure<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.770> an

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
going to make sure that this is an

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.450 
going to make sure that this is an
outlet<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.790> GFI<00:00:42.450> protected<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.950> that

outlet that is GFI protected and that
GFI<00:00:45.500> protection<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.800> personal<00:00:47.250> safety<00:00:47.520> so

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
GFI protection is for personal safety so

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.510 
GFI protection is for personal safety so
if<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.809> event<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.230> water<00:00:49.500> touching<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
if in the event of water touching the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.970 
if in the event of water touching the
cord<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:51.030> getting<00:00:51.180> into<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.570> outlet<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
cord or getting into this outlet was to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
cord or getting into this outlet was to
be<00:00:53.129> touching<00:00:53.969> two<00:00:54.239> things<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> time<00:00:54.600> is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
be touching two things at a time is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:55.970 
be touching two things at a time is
going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.199> make<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.530> you're<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
going to make it so you're not going to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.330 
going to make it so you're not going to
get<00:00:56.129> shot<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.960> just<00:00:57.960> heard<00:00:58.109> something<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.770> trip

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
get shot I just heard something to trip

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.029 
get shot I just heard something to trip
inside<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> must<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> GFI<00:01:01.050> outlet<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
inside so it must be on a GFI outlet so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.110 
inside so it must be on a GFI outlet so
we're<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:02.489> ahead<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.910> when<00:01:03.000> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
we're going to go ahead and when it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.530 
we're going to go ahead and when it
replaces<00:01:03.690> cover<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.100> plug<00:01:05.309> outlet

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
replaces cover and the plug outlet

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
replaces cover and the plug outlet
getting<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.689> set<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> be

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
getting you set up this is going to be

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.969 
getting you set up this is going to be
our<00:01:14.760> old<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.200> now<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.259> seeing<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
our old one now I'm seeing on here that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.070 
our old one now I'm seeing on here that
we've<00:01:17.220> got<00:01:17.430> some<00:01:17.759> moisture<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.659> has<00:01:18.780> been<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
we've got some moisture that has been in

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.640 
we've got some moisture that has been in
there<00:01:19.259> before

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
there before

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.249 
there before
and<00:01:20.270> what<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.630> yet<00:01:21.840> we're<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.170> go

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
and what we're at yet we're going to go

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
and what we're at yet we're going to go
ahead<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> replace<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.360> adjusting<00:01:24.360> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
ahead and replace this adjusting to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.499 
ahead and replace this adjusting to
outlet<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> new<00:01:26.700> code<00:01:28.790> or<00:01:29.790> unit<00:01:30.119> plug<00:01:30.329> outlet

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
outlet to a new code or unit plug outlet

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.600 
outlet to a new code or unit plug outlet
that's<00:01:30.780> tamper<00:01:31.290> resistant<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> weather

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that's tamper resistant and weather

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.140 
that's tamper resistant and weather
resistant<00:01:33.829> so<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> double<00:01:35.970> check

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
resistant so it's going to double check

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.999 
resistant so it's going to double check
on<00:01:36.540> our<00:01:36.659> power<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.380> make<00:01:37.500> sure<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.799> we're

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
on our power and make sure that we're

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.889 
on our power and make sure that we're
off<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.390> we've<00:01:39.720> got<00:01:39.900> nothing<00:01:40.049> there

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.480 

so<00:01:44.899> whoever<00:01:45.170> did<00:01:45.320> this<00:01:45.469> before<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.100> must<00:01:46.369> be

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
so whoever did this before this must be

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.539 
so whoever did this before this must be
a<00:01:46.520> new<00:01:46.759> somewhat<00:01:47.270> newer<00:01:47.570> outlet<00:01:48.549> 12-gauge

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
a new somewhat newer outlet 12-gauge

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.459 
a new somewhat newer outlet 12-gauge
wire<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:50.180> on<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.299> toenail<00:01:50.570> circuit<00:01:51.170> most

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
wire so it's on a toenail circuit most

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.389 
wire so it's on a toenail circuit most
likely<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.219> they<00:01:52.759> use<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.179> side<00:01:53.450> screws

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
likely and they use the side screws

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.560 
likely and they use the side screws
because<00:01:55.399> you're<00:01:55.729> not<00:01:55.820> able<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.179> put<00:01:56.420> these

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
because you're not able to put these

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.350 
because you're not able to put these
into<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.990> back<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.500> outlet<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.759> then<00:01:59.329> a

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
into the back of the outlet and then a

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.649 
into the back of the outlet and then a
nice<00:01:59.630> firm<00:02:00.170> connection<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.329> whoever<00:02:02.329> did<00:02:02.509> this

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
nice firm connection so whoever did this

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.410 
nice firm connection so whoever did this
took<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.929> time<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.649> do<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:03.890> right<00:02:04.390> make<00:02:05.390> sure

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
took the time to do it right make sure

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.910 
took the time to do it right make sure
that<00:02:05.750> there's<00:02:05.960> not<00:02:06.079> going<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.319> be<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.439> potential

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
that there's not going to be a potential

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.639 
that there's not going to be a potential
of<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.069> short<00:02:08.110> you're<00:02:09.110> working<00:02:09.440> on<00:02:09.500> these

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
of the short you're working on these

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.110 
of the short you're working on these
outlets<00:02:11.500> you'll<00:02:12.500> see<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:12.860> white<00:02:13.280> wire<00:02:13.549> which<00:02:14.090> is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
outlets you'll see a white wire which is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.809 
outlets you'll see a white wire which is
your<00:02:14.420> neutral<00:02:15.069> your<00:02:16.069> black<00:02:16.280> wire<00:02:16.549> which<00:02:16.790> is

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
your neutral your black wire which is

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.970 
your neutral your black wire which is
your<00:02:17.060> hot<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:18.110> then<00:02:18.230> you'll<00:02:18.440> see<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> green

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
your hot and then you'll see a green

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.240 
your hot and then you'll see a green
screw<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:19.580> outlet<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.209> then<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.470> bare

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
screw on this outlet and then a bare

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.000 
screw on this outlet and then a bare
copper<00:02:22.870> conductor<00:02:23.870> go<00:02:24.019> into<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.829> that's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
copper conductor go into it and that's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.940 
copper conductor go into it and that's
your<00:02:25.190> ground<00:02:26.079> okay<00:02:27.079> so<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.799> old

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
your ground okay so this is the old

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.860 
your ground okay so this is the old
outlet<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.489> can<00:02:28.519> see<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.090> been<00:02:29.269> faded

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
outlet you can see that it's been faded

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.960 
outlet you can see that it's been faded
a<00:02:29.989> little<00:02:30.049> bit<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:31.010> little<00:02:31.430> bit<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.760> corrosion

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
a little bit a little bit of corrosion

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.880 
a little bit a little bit of corrosion
on<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:33.280> back<00:02:34.280> here<00:02:34.579> it's<00:02:35.000> dry<00:02:35.360> inside<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.230> it's

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
on it back here it's dry inside so it's

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.759 
on it back here it's dry inside so it's
just<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.250> natural<00:02:37.549> thing<00:02:38.000> moisture<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.140> metal

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
just a natural thing moisture and metal

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:40.900 
just a natural thing moisture and metal

so<00:02:41.540> we're<00:02:41.720> going<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.900> do<00:02:42.049> is<00:02:42.170> put<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:43.810> code

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
so we're going to do is put in a code

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.569 
so we're going to do is put in a code
new<00:02:45.200> code<00:02:45.440> requirement<00:02:46.160> it's<00:02:46.280> called<00:02:46.489> a

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
new code requirement it's called a

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.819 
new code requirement it's called a
tamper<00:02:46.970> resistant<00:02:47.540> weather<00:02:48.139> resistant

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
tamper resistant weather resistant

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.309 
tamper resistant weather resistant
outlet<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.670> what<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.269> is<00:02:50.540> these<00:02:51.109> new

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
outlet and what that is is these new

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.170 
outlet and what that is is these new
outlets<00:02:51.799> that<00:02:52.430> are<00:02:52.489> designed<00:02:52.880> for<00:02:53.060> the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
outlets that are designed for the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.750 
outlets that are designed for the
exterior<00:02:53.690> are<00:02:53.930> made<00:02:54.560> out<00:02:54.709> of<00:02:54.739> stainless<00:02:55.160> steel

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
exterior are made out of stainless steel

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.430 
exterior are made out of stainless steel
so<00:02:56.480> there's<00:02:56.660> not<00:02:56.810> going<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.989> be<00:02:57.049> any<00:02:57.200> corrosion

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
so there's not going to be any corrosion

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.890 
so there's not going to be any corrosion
on<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.069> as<00:02:58.220> well<00:02:58.760> as<00:02:58.970> they're<00:02:59.150> heavier<00:02:59.510> duty

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
on it as well as they're heavier duty

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.740 
on it as well as they're heavier duty
plastic<00:03:00.370> now<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.430> tamper<00:03:01.819> resistant<00:03:02.389> portion

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
plastic now the tamper resistant portion

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.960 
plastic now the tamper resistant portion
of<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.019> makes<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:03.889> that<00:03:04.069> no<00:03:04.549> one<00:03:04.579> could<00:03:04.790> put

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
of it makes it so that no one could put

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.160 
of it makes it so that no one could put
anything<00:03:05.209> into<00:03:05.600> this<00:03:05.870> device<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:07.989> allow<00:03:08.989> it

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
anything into this device and allow it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.629 
anything into this device and allow it
to<00:03:09.200> go<00:03:09.380> through<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.010> have<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.160> potentially

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
to go through and have a potentially

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.599 
to go through and have a potentially
giving<00:03:10.880> shock<00:03:11.120> when<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.780> plug<00:03:12.109> in<00:03:12.139> go<00:03:12.889> to<00:03:12.920> plug

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
giving shock when you plug in go to plug

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.420 
giving shock when you plug in go to plug
outlet<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:17.269> takes<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.840> whole<00:03:18.019> cord<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.310> make

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
outlet it takes the whole cord and make

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.080 
outlet it takes the whole cord and make
it<00:03:19.579> happen

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
it happen

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.220 
it happen
so<00:03:20.510> we're<00:03:20.630> going<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.780> do<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:20.989> we're<00:03:21.079> going<00:03:21.170> to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
so we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.629 
so we're going to do is we're going to
go<00:03:21.319> ahead<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:21.530> put<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.739> back<00:03:21.950> on<00:03:22.160> with<00:03:22.519> the

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
go ahead and put this back on with the

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.650 
go ahead and put this back on with the
new<00:03:22.760> outlet

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.280 

we're<00:03:27.660> going<00:03:27.990> to<00:03:29.600> get<00:03:30.600> us<00:03:30.750> back<00:03:31.020> up<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.590> live

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
we're going to get us back up and live

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.420 
we're going to get us back up and live
so<00:03:34.290> what<00:03:34.410> I've<00:03:34.530> done<00:03:34.710> is<00:03:34.920> I've<00:03:35.040> taken<00:03:35.070> that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
so what I've done is I've taken that

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.640 
so what I've done is I've taken that
wire<00:03:35.670> it's<00:03:36.210> bent<00:03:36.510> around<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.990> screws<00:03:37.290> and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
wire it's bent around the screws and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.190 
wire it's bent around the screws and
it's<00:03:38.490> a<00:03:38.990> 5/8<00:03:39.990> worth<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:41.450> seating<00:03:42.450> installation

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
it's a 5/8 worth of seating installation

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.920 
it's a 5/8 worth of seating installation
stripped<00:03:43.500> back<00:03:44.270> we're<00:03:45.270> going<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.450> screw<00:03:45.750> those

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
stripped back we're going to screw those

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.610 
stripped back we're going to screw those
down<00:03:46.200> nice<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.710> snug<00:03:47.040> there's<00:03:48.380> no<00:03:49.380> loose

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
down nice and snug there's no loose

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.730 
down nice and snug there's no loose
connections

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.050 

sometimes<00:03:58.740> it<00:03:58.920> takes<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.810> to<00:04:00.810> take<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.080> pair<00:04:01.530> of

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
sometimes it takes you to take a pair of

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.750 
sometimes it takes you to take a pair of
needlenose<00:04:03.060> or<00:04:03.630> pliers<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:05.160> get<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.459> there<00:04:05.670> and

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
needlenose or pliers to get in there and

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.550 
needlenose or pliers to get in there and
make<00:04:05.880> sure<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.240> the<00:04:06.360> wire<00:04:06.570> is<00:04:06.600> going<00:04:07.140> all<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
make sure that the wire is going all the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.150 
make sure that the wire is going all the
way<00:04:07.590> around<00:04:07.830> us<00:04:08.390> screw<00:04:09.770> so<00:04:10.770> that<00:04:10.860> way<00:04:11.010> you're

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
way around us screw so that way you're

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.360 
way around us screw so that way you're
able<00:04:11.190> when<00:04:11.430> playing<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.850> up<00:04:12.000> nice<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.240> firm

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.650 

now<00:04:17.370> this<00:04:17.609> was<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:19.519> 14<00:04:20.519> gauge<00:04:20.730> wire<00:04:20.760> we<00:04:21.540> would

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
now this was a 14 gauge wire we would

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.140 
now this was a 14 gauge wire we would
actually<00:04:21.840> pick<00:04:22.260> fill<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.710> out<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.340> make<00:04:24.030> it

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
actually pick fill this out and make it

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.460 
actually pick fill this out and make it
so<00:04:24.270> there's<00:04:24.420> only<00:04:24.510> one<00:04:24.630> set<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:24.990> wires<00:04:25.140> going

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
so there's only one set of wires going

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.250 
so there's only one set of wires going
through<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:26.220> outlet<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:27.080> then<00:04:28.080> if

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
through the this outlet and then if

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.560 
through the this outlet and then if
there<00:04:28.410> was<00:04:28.500> ever<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.770> problem<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:30.300> would<00:04:30.450> only

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
there was ever a problem it would only

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.510 
there was ever a problem it would only
be<00:04:30.810> here<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.350> not<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.650> whole<00:04:31.770> circuit<00:04:32.130> so

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
be here and not the whole circuit so

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.310 
be here and not the whole circuit so
we're<00:04:32.640> going<00:04:32.760> to<00:04:32.820> kind<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.480> gently<00:04:33.780> push<00:04:34.140> this

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
we're going to kind of gently push this

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:50.789 
we're going to kind of gently push this
all<00:04:35.280> back<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.090> this<00:04:36.210> box<00:04:36.540> here

do this here and pick our core and go
like<00:06:21.680> that<00:06:21.890> and<00:06:22.160> we<00:06:22.700> leave<00:06:22.880> this<00:06:23.000> plugged<00:06:23.540> in

like that and we leave this plugged in

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.420 
like that and we leave this plugged in
all<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:23.990> time<00:06:24.230> so<00:06:24.590> now<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.740> whole<00:06:24.860> outlet<00:06:25.280> is
