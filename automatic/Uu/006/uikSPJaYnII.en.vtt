00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
spare for your hot glue gun take a pin

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.380 
spare for your hot glue gun take a pin
and<00:02:28.110> stick<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.250> where<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.880> part<00:02:30.209> right<00:02:30.330> there

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
and stick it where that part right there

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.750 
and stick it where that part right there
goes<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.680> simply<00:02:31.980> just<00:02:32.010> pushes<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.640> in

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
goes and it simply just pushes it in

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.290 
goes and it simply just pushes it in
there<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.150> comes<00:02:33.810> right<00:02:33.959> out<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.470> simple

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.450 

here<00:02:40.300> you're<00:02:40.540> gonna<00:02:40.720> measure<00:02:40.990> six<00:02:41.770> inches<00:02:42.220> in

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
here you're gonna measure six inches in

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.150 
here you're gonna measure six inches in
because<00:02:42.850> these<00:02:43.060> dowels<00:02:43.390> are<00:02:43.810> one<00:02:44.440> foot<00:02:44.950> long

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
because these dowels are one foot long

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.150 
because these dowels are one foot long
so<00:02:46.120> after<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.540> measure<00:02:46.660> six<00:02:46.990> inches<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.500> you

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
so after you measure six inches in you

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.390 
so after you measure six inches in you
mark<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.270> that<00:02:49.960> is<00:02:50.140> exactly<00:02:50.380> right<00:02:51.130> where

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
mark it and that is exactly right where

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.580 
mark it and that is exactly right where
you're<00:02:51.550> going<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.850> put<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.300> your<00:02:52.690> crossbow

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590
