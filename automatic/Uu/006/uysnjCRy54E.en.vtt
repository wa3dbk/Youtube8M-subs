00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
believe will have of course you get the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.759 
believe will have of course you get the
code<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> factory<00:00:30.900> piece<00:00:31.140> which<00:00:31.470> gives

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
code here a factory piece which gives

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.190 
code here a factory piece which gives
you<00:00:31.920> 200<00:00:32.250> game<00:00:32.759> points<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.840> sure<00:00:34.020> what

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
you 200 game points not really sure what

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.620 
you 200 game points not really sure what
that<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.880> I<00:00:35.880> guess<00:00:36.090> we'll<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that is but I guess we'll see in a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.910 
that is but I guess we'll see in a
second<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.079> let's<00:00:37.260> go<00:00:37.380> ahead<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.530> build<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
second so let's go ahead and build it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.330 
second so let's go ahead and build it
never<00:00:38.550> built<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.000> these<00:00:39.210> before<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.340> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
never built one of these before so you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.310 
never built one of these before so you
put<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.730> stop<00:00:42.000> motion<00:00:42.360> anyways<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.989> then

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
put it in stop motion anyways and then

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:55.430 
put it in stop motion anyways and then
go<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> close<00:00:44.460> up

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
