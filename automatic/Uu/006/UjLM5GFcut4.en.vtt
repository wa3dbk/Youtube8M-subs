00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.230 
it's been combined on the screen it
means<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.280> trace<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> real<00:01:42.030> world

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
means you can trace it in the real world

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.749 
means you can trace it in the real world
and<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.490> now<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.610> is

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and I really like that now this is

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.480 
and I really like that now this is
similar<00:01:44.939> technology<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.049> HP<00:01:46.619> sprouts

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
similar technology to the HP sprouts

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.200 
similar technology to the HP sprouts
device<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.689> scanner<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> top<00:01:50.820> and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
device that has a scanner in the top and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940 
device that has a scanner in the top and
it<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.689> also<00:01:51.810> project<00:01:52.409> an<00:01:52.500> image<00:01:52.619> down

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it can also project an image down

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.530 
it can also project an image down
obviously<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> much<00:01:53.610> more<00:01:53.759> complex<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
obviously this is much more complex and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780 
obviously this is much more complex and
much<00:01:54.780> more<00:01:54.960> pricey<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> creates<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> same

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
much more pricey but it creates the same

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090 
much more pricey but it creates the same
sort<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.360> experience<00:01:57.990> although<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.710> you're

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
sort of experience although here you're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.709 
sort of experience although here you're
going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.369> paying<00:01:59.579> quite<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> lot<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.509> it

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
going to be paying quite a lot and is it

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.660 
going to be paying quite a lot and is it
really<00:02:00.990> quite<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> complex<00:02:01.770> technical

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
really quite a complex technical

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.819 
really quite a complex technical
solution<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.869> about<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.619> takes

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
solution what I like about also it takes

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.670 
solution what I like about also it takes
that<00:02:05.100> same<00:02:05.430> sort<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.820> style<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:07.170> interface

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
that same sort of style the interface

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.559 
that same sort of style the interface
the<00:02:07.890> interaction<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.879> desk<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:09.420> your

you'll<00:02:13.920> bring<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.190> things<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.580> you're

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
you'll bring in things in you're

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.940 
you'll bring in things in you're
scanning<00:02:14.940> them<00:02:15.240> but<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.170> course<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.560> Osmo

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.980 
scanning them but of course with Osmo
you<00:02:17.250> don't<00:02:17.460> have<00:02:17.730> all<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.210> expensive

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
you don't have all this expensive

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.930 
you don't have all this expensive
technology<00:02:19.560> all<00:02:19.770> you've<00:02:19.980> got<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.370> iPad

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
technology all you've got is your iPad

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.090 
technology all you've got is your iPad
sitting<00:02:21.120> there<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.720> your<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.500> mirror

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
sitting there and your the mirror

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.680 
sitting there and your the mirror
lozenge<00:02:23.550> at<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> top<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.390> creates

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
lozenge at the top and it creates

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.900 
lozenge at the top and it creates
actually<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.260> quite<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.530> similar<00:02:25.860> experience<00:02:26.460> I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
actually a quite a similar experience I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.300 
actually a quite a similar experience I
think<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.780> best<00:02:27.960> feature<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.500> Osmo<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.160> that

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
think the best feature of Osmo is that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.800 
think the best feature of Osmo is that
