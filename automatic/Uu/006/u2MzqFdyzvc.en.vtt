have homework to do and can't find a
pencil<00:00:27.800> weight<00:00:29.599> subtraction<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:31.349> easy<00:00:32.540> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
pencil weight subtraction it's easy you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.540 
pencil weight subtraction it's easy you
don't<00:00:33.780> need<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.560> pencil<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.880> work<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:37.550> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
don't need a pencil to work this out you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:50.950 
don't need a pencil to work this out you
can<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:39.060> them<00:00:39.329> mentally<00:00:41.930> let<00:00:42.930> me<00:00:43.200> show<00:00:43.470> you<00:00:43.530> how

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.680 

if<00:00:52.550> 2<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:54.050> subtracted<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.080> 5<00:00:56.060> how<00:00:57.060> much<00:00:57.390> is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
if 2 is subtracted from 5 how much is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.219 
if 2 is subtracted from 5 how much is
left<00:00:59.510> from<00:01:00.510> two<00:01:01.010> count<00:01:02.010> forward<00:01:03.000> till<00:01:03.960> you

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
left from two count forward till you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:14.600 
left from two count forward till you
reach<00:01:04.530> 5<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> 3<00:01:08.250> 4<00:01:09.860> 5<00:01:11.780> we<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.110> counted<00:01:13.740> three

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
reach 5 so 3 4 5 we have counted three

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:26.359 
reach 5 so 3 4 5 we have counted three
numbers<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:17.100> 5<00:01:17.490> minus<00:01:18.390> 2<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.499> 3<00:01:22.579> now<00:01:23.600> 5<00:01:24.770> minus<00:01:25.770> 4

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
numbers so 5 minus 2 is 3 now 5 minus 4

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:38.870 
numbers so 5 minus 2 is 3 now 5 minus 4
is<00:01:29.329> yes<00:01:30.560> 5<00:01:31.789> minus<00:01:32.789> 4<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.719> 1<00:01:34.520> star<00:01:35.520> II<00:01:36.829> now<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:38.159> one

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
is yes 5 minus 4 is 1 star II now if one

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.529 
is yes 5 minus 4 is 1 star II now if one
is<00:01:39.119> removed<00:01:39.780> from<00:01:40.259> 6<00:01:41.090> how<00:01:42.090> many<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:42.990> remain<00:01:44.539> 5

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
is removed from 6 how many will remain 5

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.139 
is removed from 6 how many will remain 5
star<00:01:46.139> II

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149

what<00:01:48.149> about<00:01:48.499> 7<00:01:49.499> minus<00:01:50.219> 3<00:01:51.679> let's<00:01:52.679> count<00:01:53.149> forward

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
what about 7 minus 3 let's count forward

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:04.389 
what about 7 minus 3 let's count forward
from<00:01:55.259> 3<00:01:55.649> till<00:01:56.369> 7<00:01:57.829> 4<00:01:59.299> 5<00:02:00.829> 6<00:02:02.299> 7

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
from 3 till 7 4 5 6 7

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.710 
from 3 till 7 4 5 6 7
that's<00:02:05.399> 4<00:02:06.029> numbers<00:02:06.679> right<00:02:07.679> study<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:10.400> 7<00:02:11.400> minus

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
that's 4 numbers right study so 7 minus

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.640 
that's 4 numbers right study so 7 minus
3<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:13.020> 4

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.910 

and<00:02:17.540> 6<00:02:18.650> minus<00:02:19.650> 6<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:23.180> zero

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
and 6 minus 6 is zero

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.259 
and 6 minus 6 is zero
sorry<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.239> why<00:02:28.579> when<00:02:29.579> we<00:02:29.819> take<00:02:30.239> away

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
sorry do you know why when we take away

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.030 
sorry do you know why when we take away
a<00:02:30.840> number<00:02:31.650> from<00:02:32.400> itself<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.439> nothing

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
a number from itself we have nothing

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.880 
a number from itself we have nothing
left<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.140> remainder<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:38.340> zero

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
left so the remainder is zero

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:49.000 
left so the remainder is zero
what<00:02:40.890> about<00:02:41.069> 8<00:02:42.079> minus<00:02:43.079> 5<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:44.280> equal<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:47.030> 8<00:02:48.030> minus

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
what about 8 minus 5 is equal to 8 minus

00:02:49.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
what about 8 minus 5 is equal to 8 minus
5<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.430> equal<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.840> 3<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:54.859> 3<00:02:56.450> minus<00:02:57.450> 0<00:02:58.139> is<00:03:00.709> 3<00:03:02.030> minus

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
5 is equal to 3 and 3 minus 0 is 3 minus

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.309 
5 is equal to 3 and 3 minus 0 is 3 minus
0<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:04.670> 3<00:03:06.769> that's<00:03:07.769> because<00:03:08.400> when<00:03:09.269> we<00:03:09.540> take<00:03:10.049> away

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
0 is 3 that's because when we take away

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.229 
0 is 3 that's because when we take away
0<00:03:11.159> from<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.329> number<00:03:13.069> we<00:03:14.069> do<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:14.519> take<00:03:14.970> away

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
0 from a number we do not take away

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.119 
0 from a number we do not take away
anything<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:18.420> still<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.769> same

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
anything so we still have the same

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.970 
anything so we still have the same
number<00:03:22.790> now<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.510> have<00:03:24.780> learnt<00:03:25.169> to

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
number now that you have learnt to

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.990
