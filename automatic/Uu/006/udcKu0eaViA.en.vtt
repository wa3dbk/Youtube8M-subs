00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.930 
make my way to the gold Mexico find a
boat<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.719> was

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
boat and I think it was

boat and I think it was
the<00:01:58.090> ignition<00:01:58.450> which<00:01:58.900> something<00:01:59.710> mission<00:01:59.980> is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
the ignition which something mission is

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.030 
the ignition which something mission is
where<00:02:00.220> you<00:02:00.310> attach<00:02:01.300> a<00:02:01.660> piece<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:01.960> meat<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.500> a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
where you attach a piece of meat to a

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.300 
where you attach a piece of meat to a
hook<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:03.730> then<00:02:04.480> you<00:02:04.900> through<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.770> machine

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
hook and then you through the machine

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:41.700 
hook and then you through the machine
