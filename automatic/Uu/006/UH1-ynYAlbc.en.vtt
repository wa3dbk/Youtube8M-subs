sign<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.099> a<00:02:58.629> Nike<00:02:59.629> SB<00:03:01.780> which<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:03.019> um<00:03:03.200> tongue

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
sign of a Nike SB which is um tongue

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.080 
sign of a Nike SB which is um tongue
like<00:03:04.879> a<00:03:04.909> skateboarding<00:03:05.540> company<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.340> you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
like a skateboarding company and you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.710 
like a skateboarding company and you
have<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.450> on<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:09.669> bottoms<00:03:10.669> as<00:03:10.849> well<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.269> like

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
have it on the bottoms as well I like

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.309 
have it on the bottoms as well I like
the<00:03:11.840> bottoms<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.290> lot<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:13.159> really<00:03:13.189> sets<00:03:13.609> it<00:03:13.730> off

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
the bottoms a lot it really sets it off

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.030 
the bottoms a lot it really sets it off
and<00:03:15.319> then<00:03:15.349> you<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:16.090> zoom<00:03:17.090> air<00:03:17.479> on<00:03:18.049> both<00:03:18.859> the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
and then you have zoom air on both the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.649 
and then you have zoom air on both the
insoles<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:19.699> that's<00:03:19.879> different<00:03:20.269> usually<00:03:20.569> you

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
insoles so that's different usually you

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.629 
insoles so that's different usually you
would<00:03:20.750> say<00:03:20.930> nike<00:03:21.260> SB<00:03:22.090> but<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.180> doesn't<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.639> the

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
would say nike SB but it doesn't so the

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.439 
would say nike SB but it doesn't so the
only<00:03:25.790> part<00:03:26.090> or<00:03:26.299> says<00:03:26.540> SB<00:03:26.930> underneath<00:03:27.709> is<00:03:27.919> the

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
only part or says SB underneath is the

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.860 
only part or says SB underneath is the
tongue<00:03:29.979> so<00:03:31.120> really<00:03:32.120> clean<00:03:32.389> and<00:03:32.629> simple

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
tongue so really clean and simple

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.719 
tongue so really clean and simple
sneaker<00:03:33.409> these<00:03:33.590> saw<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:34.099> can't<00:03:34.400> believe<00:03:34.519> they

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729 
sneaker these saw I can't believe they

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.170

sold<00:03:34.909> out<00:03:35.090> them<00:03:35.359> within<00:03:36.190> today<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.489> don't<00:03:38.150> think

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180
