00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and to all the boys of Italy over 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.309
 power I am atomic and today I bring you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.050
 nuclear on the map to be merged on ps3 but 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.120
 before starting the gameplay of 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.500
 explain the game a little thank you 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 paolo ex to give the opportunity a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.020
 youtuber who want to be known 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.220
 with this channel dedicated to the flows 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.490
 high on juice deco and therefore really a 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.490
 good start 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.790
 and it does very well then I initially have 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.190
 decided to give this gameplay without the 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.820
 comment but I wanted to say help 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.210
 paonessa because she finds herself commenting 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.269
 lots of videos not knowing what to say 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.500
 mq and therefore I have decided to condemn 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:54.079
 comment on it to comment on it then 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.350
 this as already mentioned to nuclear on 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.729
 downhill map on ps3 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.890
 I did it 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:08.110
 four days later the map came out for 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:12.080
 ps3 so March 4 I think it really is 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.340
 a work stuff especially because 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.320
 it is not campera on a much bought side 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.470
 I ran the spawn because it was a 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.950
 emotion I managed the spawn really 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.179
 very good in my opinion and then I didn't even have 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.200
 companions with whom I could talk and then 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:37.610
 and o the scene the beautiful game in my opinion 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.860
 then the class uses the pdv 57 with 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.509
 sensible king and adjustable soccer stock 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.969
 adjustable and a bit like a predator ie 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.170
 predators come so it is very useful 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.840
 because while you are shooting you can go to 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.430
 right and left then enemy it 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.219
 confusing a little me there 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.229
 recommend try this class like 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:02.750
 secondary I dared nothing or or a 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:07.250
 Lethal C4 tactical knife spins from 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.640
 sensor and then as a series of points or 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.980
 start counterattack and laughter 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.230
 in the most useful rewards to use to make 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.650
 a nuclear as there is then use it 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.300
 all to do nothing and then al 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.840
 place of the counterattack can be used 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.130
 also lamp my bike points on slam 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.750
 however, I don't know and right at the 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.530
 counterattack comes from the first then 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.060
 maybe it's better anyway I used the big one 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.030
 from sensors I want to talk a little about 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.820
 great sensor because nobody uses it 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.260
 I don't know why I use it in this one 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.430
 game but maybe it doesn't make us much 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.200
 but in other games though 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.760
 I have had very often because it is a lot 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.690
 useful in my opinion because it is a kind of TV 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:05.239
 of turbid muse which lasts 2 3 seconds 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:07.280
 perhaps even more is that it can be used in 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.290
 any time so it's really a lot 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.890
 useful in my opinion because before shooting 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.030
 a wall you can pull the grain sensor e 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.709
 see who's there and there and see how 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.620
 positioned the enemy so you can 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.010
 kill him very easily 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.340
 and you find it to something very useful maybe 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.220
 also in search and destroy here year 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.810
 very useful even if I don't play 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.670
 I do not know why not to look for studies 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:45.640
 the others are not the only girl 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:48.920
 flight view a few times to use and then and then 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.140
 the sensor after 5 seconds explodes 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.780
 so can also happy of the enemy e 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.380
 this is something very different 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.769
 very useful because you will fold three 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.019
 shots scenes will take 2 this thing 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.400
 very useful in my opinion there is one thing 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:09.049
 very useful guys and why that's enough 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.510
 a failed shot you can 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:17.479
 die then I will this video and have you 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.639
 of advice in using it gives it 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:25.460
 sensor then do as you wish try it 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:28.580
 advice devotion to try it and nothing 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:33.380
 the video is finished he made the series from 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.449
 34 in a row and nothing not only from a friend 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.169
 pass in my channel if you want if there is 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:44.479
 like dvd and video if you coming 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:47.770
 video subscribe only after the cuts 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.770
 beautiful word power
