00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
just prefer the finish - drawing a jean

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.190 
just prefer the finish - drawing a jean
gives<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.580> it's<00:02:46.850> less<00:02:47.180> harsh<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:47.900> not<00:02:48.050> as

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
gives you it's less harsh and not as

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.790 
gives you it's less harsh and not as
perfect<00:02:48.440> which<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.190> look<00:02:49.340> I'm<00:02:49.550> going<00:02:49.580> for

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
perfect which is the look I'm going for

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.170 
perfect which is the look I'm going for
once<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.950> start<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.340> blend<00:02:52.519> in<00:02:52.760> from<00:02:53.060> that

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
once you start to blend in from that

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.570 
once you start to blend in from that
line<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:54.080> want<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.410> take<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.890> eye<00:02:54.920> shadow<00:02:55.340> up

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
line you want to take the eye shadow up

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.759 
line you want to take the eye shadow up
into<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.030> crease<00:02:56.269> as<00:02:56.540> well<00:02:56.650> that'll<00:02:57.650> give

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
into the crease as well that'll give

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.310 
into the crease as well that'll give
some<00:02:57.980> definition<00:02:58.700> there<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.540> I'm<00:02:59.690> just<00:02:59.930> using

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
some definition there so I'm just using

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.530 
some definition there so I'm just using
sweeping<00:03:01.100> motions<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:01.820> pull<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.299> color

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
sweeping motions to pull the color

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.560 
sweeping motions to pull the color
across<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.230> crease<00:03:06.910> then<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> want<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.420> go

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
across the crease then you want to go

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.180 
across the crease then you want to go
back<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.989> with<00:03:09.170> your<00:03:09.320> blending<00:03:09.769> brush<00:03:09.799> and

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
going to be having your photo taken I'd

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.660 
going to be having your photo taken I'd
recommend<00:05:29.210> using<00:05:29.510> a<00:05:30.110> contour<00:05:30.710> shade<00:05:31.040> to<00:05:31.550> add

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
recommend using a contour shade to add

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.420 
recommend using a contour shade to add
some<00:05:31.970> definition<00:05:32.180> back<00:05:32.900> to<00:05:33.170> the<00:05:33.260> face<00:05:33.500> even<00:05:33.800> if

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
some definition back to the face even if

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.160 
some definition back to the face even if
you<00:05:34.550> don't<00:05:34.760> do<00:05:34.970> it<00:05:35.000> normally<00:05:35.660> when<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.050> have

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
you don't do it normally when you have

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.410 
you don't do it normally when you have
your<00:05:36.290> photo<00:05:36.500> taken<00:05:36.860> everything<00:05:37.790> seems<00:05:38.300> to

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
your photo taken everything seems to

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.840 
your photo taken everything seems to
appear<00:05:38.870> quite<00:05:39.110> flat<00:05:39.620> so<00:05:40.220> adding<00:05:40.490> a<00:05:40.580> bit<00:05:40.700> of

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
appear quite flat so adding a bit of

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.240 
appear quite flat so adding a bit of
structure<00:05:41.120> will<00:05:41.570> help<00:05:41.840> to<00:05:42.050> prevent<00:05:42.350> that<00:05:42.620> I'm

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
structure will help to prevent that I'm

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.790 
structure will help to prevent that I'm
applying<00:05:43.610> it<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.780> hollows<00:05:45.170> of<00:05:45.320> my<00:05:45.350> cheeks

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
applying it to the hollows of my cheeks

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.140
