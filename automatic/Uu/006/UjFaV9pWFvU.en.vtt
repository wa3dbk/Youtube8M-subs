00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
preposterous but the fact is it's based

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.270 
preposterous but the fact is it's based
on<00:00:41.899> a<00:00:41.960> on<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:43.090> graphic<00:00:44.090> novel<00:00:44.120> which<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:45.280> French

so but it's so it is kind of not real in
that<00:00:54.230> sense<00:00:54.559> but<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:54.890> creates<00:00:55.579> his<00:00:55.699> own

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
that sense but it creates his own

Tom<00:01:47.150> Hiddleston's<00:01:47.660> on<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.960> seriously<00:01:48.320> donor

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
Tom Hiddleston's on that seriously donor

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.380 
Tom Hiddleston's on that seriously donor
is<00:01:48.800> just<00:01:49.070> as<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.400> think<00:01:49.700> Jesus<00:01:49.910> at<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.210> height

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
is just as I think Jesus at the height

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.960 
is just as I think Jesus at the height
of<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.690> guru<00:01:50.900> I<00:01:51.260> think<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.040> absolutely<00:01:52.369> fabulous

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
of a guru I think is absolutely fabulous

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.969 
of a guru I think is absolutely fabulous
she'd<00:01:53.810> always<00:01:53.990> been<00:01:54.260> fabulous<00:01:54.710> which<00:01:54.830> is

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
she'd always been fabulous which is

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.280 
she'd always been fabulous which is
particularly<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:55.910> now<00:01:56.150> I<00:01:56.180> think<00:01:56.450> we<00:01:56.990> should

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290
