00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.299
 gave more than average results 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.830
 even dramatically mediocre in 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.510
 some cases and it is thought the course 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.890
 super mario movie but when the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.750
 developers are involved in 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.250
 project it changes everything and that's all 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.689
 that could be worth the license of one 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.300
 most famous platform games 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.890
 10 for excluded on ps3 I named 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 ratchet &amp; clank that will land at 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.000
 cinema indeed insomniac games 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100
 series developer announced this 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.760
 morning an adaptation 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.360
 cinematic of their game was in 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.370
 construction site 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.260
 the film will be released in 2015 and it will put 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 of course on stage our ratchet hero 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.309
 accompanied by his little assistant the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.559
 robot clank and a first trailer even 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.270
 was presented evolving for ten years 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.190
 on playstation ratchet &amp; clank offers itself 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.539
 so the switch to the big screen and the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 notoriety that goes with 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.140
 indeed if the title is well known to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.059
 players on ps3 he does not have the aura yet 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.070
 of our hero of this kind of mario game 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.660
 and if the film stages the plumber 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.039
 Italian remains to this day one of the most 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 big turnips in the history of 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.519

 video sony promises us that it will only 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.820
 not the case for his license so a 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.950
 sommier games will play a decisive role 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.990
 in production the development of 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.770
 scenario of animation and creation 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 characters 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.250
 the film script is currently 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.060
 written by the writer of the Ratchet games 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.009

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 according to the American website varieties the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.680
 actors who lend their voice to 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.540
 characters in the game will also be of 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.799
 the part in the movie is queen of 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.240
 hearts the production company that 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.799
 are working on the movie would be in the process 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.030
 to negotiate with big stars 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.130
 Hollywood that would come as well 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.820

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.040
 but will also be independent of the frame 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.930

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.620
 perhaps for soon in any case to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.329
 little vision would like to look 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.950
 on the issue and just talk 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.200

 immersive 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.389

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.169
 to keep the same spirit on a 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.449
