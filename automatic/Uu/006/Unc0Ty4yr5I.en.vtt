00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.440 
and the next step would be to insert
into<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.220> phone<00:02:40.460> or<00:02:40.580> non-accepted<00:02:41.120> sim<00:02:41.150> card

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
into the phone or non-accepted sim card

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.260 
into the phone or non-accepted sim card
so<00:02:41.690> for<00:02:42.680> example<00:02:43.040> if<00:02:43.220> your<00:02:43.430> phone<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.790> locked<00:02:43.970> -

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
so for example if your phone is locked -

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.060 
so for example if your phone is locked -
voila<00:02:44.750> phone<00:02:45.050> you're<00:02:45.470> going<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.770> have<00:02:45.920> to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
voila phone you're going to have to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.610 
voila phone you're going to have to
insert<00:02:46.700> any<00:02:47.030> SIM<00:02:47.360> card<00:02:47.540> bloody<00:02:47.960> Vodafone

insert any SIM card bloody Vodafone

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.040 
insert any SIM card bloody Vodafone
