00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.730 
to grow up around snakes her whole life
if<00:02:05.509> that's<00:02:05.570> her<00:02:05.750> father's<00:02:06.020> occupation<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.679> he

if that's her father's occupation and he

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.590 
if that's her father's occupation and he

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.940 
has pets in the house the only time
people<00:02:08.630> freaked<00:02:09.109> out<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.440> when<00:02:09.560> he<00:02:09.619> put<00:02:09.799> it<00:02:09.890> on

upfront I'm not a snake ologist so I

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.270 
upfront I'm not a snake ologist so I
can't<00:02:33.290> get<00:02:33.440> into<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.709> science<00:02:33.859> of<00:02:34.069> whether

this snake is going to choke or bite the
baby<00:02:36.019> but<00:02:36.859> I<00:02:36.890> basically<00:02:37.609> agree<00:02:37.850> with<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.389> look

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
baby but I basically agree with you look

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.809 
baby but I basically agree with you look
except<00:02:39.440> for<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.739> fact<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.100> when<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:40.430> snake

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
except for the fact that when that snake

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.129 
except for the fact that when that snake
first<00:02:41.090> up<00:02:41.239> it's<00:02:41.359> on<00:02:41.450> top<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.870> them<00:02:41.959> now<00:02:42.109> I

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
first up it's on top of them now I

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.449 
first up it's on top of them now I
assume<00:02:42.290> it's<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.680> boa<00:02:42.829> constrictor<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.310> some

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
assume it's a boa constrictor of some

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.949 
assume it's a boa constrictor of some
kind<00:02:43.609> of<00:02:43.639> like<00:02:43.760> don't<00:02:43.970> they<00:02:44.180> constrict<00:02:44.600> isn't

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
kind of like don't they constrict isn't

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.000 
kind of like don't they constrict isn't
that<00:02:45.049> there's<00:02:45.440> gonna<00:02:45.560> be<00:02:45.650> some<00:02:45.829> sort<00:02:45.920> of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
that there's gonna be some sort of

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.099 
that there's gonna be some sort of
constriction<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.519> also<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.750> know<00:02:47.870> when<00:02:48.019> the

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
constriction and also you know when the

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.960 
constriction and also you know when the
snake's<00:02:48.350> head<00:02:48.440> got<00:02:49.190> close<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.459> them<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.790> get

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
snake's head got close to them and I get

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.520 
snake's head got close to them and I get
maybe<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.330> was<00:02:50.450> defined<00:02:50.959> or<00:02:51.140> whatever<00:02:51.319> it's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
maybe it was defined or whatever it's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.830 
maybe it was defined or whatever it's
still<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:52.069> tiny<00:02:52.640> little<00:02:52.940> infant<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.510> get<00:02:53.720> it

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
viewed videos on The Young Turks the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.050 
viewed videos on The Young Turks the
woman's<00:03:23.130> entire<00:03:23.430> face<00:03:23.670> was<00:03:23.940> completely

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
woman's entire face was completely

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.570 
woman's entire face was completely
mutilated<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:25.800> might<00:03:26.130> think<00:03:26.190> that

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
mutilated and so you might think that

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.980 
mutilated and so you might think that
you're<00:03:26.760> an<00:03:26.850> absolute<00:03:26.970> expert<00:03:27.720> when<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.870> comes

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
you're an absolute expert when it comes

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.420 
you're an absolute expert when it comes
to<00:03:28.320> snakes<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.710> you<00:03:28.770> can<00:03:28.920> totally<00:03:29.220> handle

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
to snakes and you can totally handle

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.850 
to snakes and you can totally handle
them<00:03:29.700> appropriately<00:03:30.330> but<00:03:30.990> you<00:03:31.350> can<00:03:31.560> never<00:03:31.710> be

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
them appropriately but you can never be

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.650 
them appropriately but you can never be
safe<00:03:32.220> enough<00:03:32.490> especially<00:03:33.000> when<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.210> comes<00:03:33.360> to

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
safe enough especially when it comes to

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.590 
safe enough especially when it comes to
a<00:03:33.900> baby<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:35.280> here's<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.700> question<00:03:35.880> related<00:03:36.510> to

something<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.900> I've<00:03:42.990> been<00:03:43.020> thinking<00:03:43.110> about

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
something that I've been thinking about

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.420 
something that I've been thinking about
and<00:03:43.590> talking<00:03:43.770> about<00:03:43.800> on<00:03:43.980> my<00:03:44.040> show<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> lot

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
and talking about on my show a lot

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.100 
and talking about on my show a lot
lately<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.910> think<00:03:44.970> people<00:03:45.420> especially

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
lately is I think people especially

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.170 
lately is I think people especially
politically<00:03:46.890> everyone<00:03:47.640> thinks<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:47.910> they

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
politically everyone thinks that they

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.000 
politically everyone thinks that they
know<00:03:48.210> everything<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.260> their<00:03:49.410> side<00:03:49.740> is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
know everything and that their side is

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.620 
know everything and that their side is
always<00:03:50.280> right<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:50.640> I'm<00:03:50.760> sure<00:03:50.970> I'm<00:03:51.120> guilty<00:03:51.360> of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
always right and I'm sure I'm guilty of

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.600 
always right and I'm sure I'm guilty of
it<00:03:51.780> too<00:03:51.960> that<00:03:52.200> we<00:03:52.710> all<00:03:52.920> think<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.400> know<00:03:53.490> and

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
it too that we all think you know and

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.490 
it too that we all think you know and
this<00:03:53.670> is<00:03:53.730> partly<00:03:54.240> because<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:55.140> way<00:03:55.170> we<00:03:55.380> all

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
this is partly because of the way we all

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.780 
this is partly because of the way we all
get<00:03:55.650> our<00:03:55.800> news<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.100> we<00:03:56.190> cater<00:03:56.370> news<00:03:56.640> to

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
get our news and we cater news to

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.700 
get our news and we cater news to
ourself<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.300> all<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:58.320> we're<00:03:58.470> always

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
ourself and all that that we're always

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.440 
ourself and all that that we're always
so<00:03:59.040> convinced<00:03:59.490> that<00:03:59.520> we're<00:03:59.820> right<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.270> we're

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
so convinced that we're right and we're

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.570 
so convinced that we're right and we're
somehow<00:04:00.900> moral<00:04:01.710> and<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:01.950> other<00:04:02.100> people<00:04:02.460> are

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
somehow moral and the other people are

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.970 
somehow moral and the other people are
evil<00:04:02.970> or<00:04:03.120> disingenuous<00:04:03.870> or<00:04:03.960> dishonest<00:04:04.590> and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
evil or disingenuous or dishonest and

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.320 
evil or disingenuous or dishonest and
that's<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.400> that's<00:04:05.640> just<00:04:05.760> silly<00:04:06.090> and

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
that's just that's just silly and

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.700 
that's just that's just silly and
actually<00:04:06.720> doesn't<00:04:06.900> get<00:04:07.170> anything<00:04:07.470> anywhere

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
actually doesn't get anything anywhere

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.870 
actually doesn't get anything anywhere
so<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.010> think<00:04:08.130> everyone's<00:04:08.580> sort<00:04:08.760> of

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
so I think everyone's sort of

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.130 
so I think everyone's sort of
brainwashed<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.330> them<00:04:09.450> yeah<00:04:09.570> especially<00:04:09.840> when

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
brainwashed to them yeah especially when

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.750 
brainwashed to them yeah especially when
it<00:04:10.230> comes<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.470> political<00:04:10.680> affiliation<00:04:11.490> yeah

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
it comes to political affiliation yeah

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.610 
it comes to political affiliation yeah
well<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.510> know<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.630> initially<00:04:13.080> had<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.380> similar

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
well you know I initially had a similar

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.780 
well you know I initially had a similar
thought<00:04:13.920> when<00:04:14.070> you're<00:04:14.190> gonna<00:04:14.280> say<00:04:14.490> what<00:04:14.670> are

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
thought when you're gonna say what are

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.190 
thought when you're gonna say what are
we<00:04:14.880> brainwashed<00:04:15.300> about<00:04:15.570> I<00:04:15.600> was<00:04:15.870> gonna<00:04:15.990> say

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
we brainwashed about I was gonna say

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.539 
we brainwashed about I was gonna say
everything<00:04:16.830> okay<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.190> feel<00:04:17.310> like<00:04:17.430> we're

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
everything okay I feel like we're

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.010 
everything okay I feel like we're
practically<00:04:17.880> living<00:04:18.060> in<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.330> matrix<00:04:18.510> but<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
practically living in a matrix but the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.300 
practically living in a matrix but the
more<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.230> think<00:04:19.380> about<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.950> think<00:04:20.010> we're

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
more I think about it I think we're

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.130 
more I think about it I think we're
brainwashed<00:04:20.760> about<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.360> right<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.989> have

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
brainwashed about the right to have

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.620 
brainwashed about the right to have
outraged<00:04:22.770> everyone<00:04:23.730> feels<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.360> were

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
that we're pretty much to think that our

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.860 
that we're pretty much to think that our
opinion<00:04:35.580> matters<00:04:36.150> more<00:04:36.360> than<00:04:36.390> someone's

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
opinion matters more than someone's

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.450 
opinion matters more than someone's

everyone's outraged about something and
there's<00:04:44.400> usually<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.730> flavor<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.330> week

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
there's usually a flavor of the week

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.030 
there's usually a flavor of the week
right<00:04:45.750> like<00:04:45.930> what<00:04:46.140> does<00:04:46.230> everyone<00:04:46.500> outraged

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
right like what does everyone outraged

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.770 
right like what does everyone outraged
about<00:04:47.220> this<00:04:47.550> week<00:04:47.790> right<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.180> changes<00:04:48.570> the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
about this week right and it changes the

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.230 
about this week right and it changes the
following<00:04:49.200> week<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:50.130> think<00:04:50.490> people<00:04:51.150> are

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
following week I think people are

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.170 
following week I think people are
brainwashed<00:04:52.400> specifically<00:04:53.400> on<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.670> issue<00:04:53.820> of

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
brainwashed specifically on the issue of

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.450 
brainwashed specifically on the issue of
gender<00:04:54.360> equality<00:04:54.510> right<00:04:55.200> so<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:55.710> use<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.370> word

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
gender equality right so I use the word

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.860 
gender equality right so I use the word
gender<00:04:56.700> equality<00:04:57.030> because<00:04:57.390> if<00:04:57.480> I<00:04:57.540> started

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
gender equality because if I started

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.620 
gender equality because if I started
that<00:04:57.960> sentence<00:04:58.380> off<00:04:58.560> with<00:04:58.800> feminists<00:04:59.400> like

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
that sentence off with feminists like

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.180 
that sentence off with feminists like
have<00:05:00.630> their<00:05:00.810> heads<00:05:01.050> explode<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:02.010> don't

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
have their heads explode and I don't

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.630 
have their heads explode and I don't
want<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.370> get<00:05:02.490> into<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.820> but<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.810> think<00:05:04.110> that

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
want to get into that but I think that

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.340 
want to get into that but I think that
gender<00:05:05.640> equality<00:05:05.730> is<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.240> super<00:05:06.600> nuanced<00:05:07.140> issue

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
gender equality is a super nuanced issue

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.760 
gender equality is a super nuanced issue
and

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.140 
and
oftentimes<00:05:08.009> people<00:05:08.370> don't<00:05:08.639> see<00:05:08.849> it<00:05:08.970> as<00:05:09.120> a

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
oftentimes people don't see it as a

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.790 
oftentimes people don't see it as a
nuanced<00:05:09.599> issue<00:05:09.780> they're<00:05:10.080> brainwashed<00:05:10.560> into

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
nuanced issue they're brainwashed into

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.920 
nuanced issue they're brainwashed into
either<00:05:11.039> being<00:05:11.759> against<00:05:12.150> gender<00:05:12.419> equality<00:05:12.599> or

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
either being against gender equality or

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.290 
either being against gender equality or
hating<00:05:13.590> feminists<00:05:14.069> or<00:05:14.160> really<00:05:14.970> loving

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
hating feminists or really loving

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.670 
hating feminists or really loving
feminists<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:15.810> supporting<00:05:16.169> them<00:05:16.259> regardless

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
feminists and supporting them regardless

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.770 
feminists and supporting them regardless
of<00:05:16.770> what<00:05:16.949> they<00:05:17.069> do<00:05:17.129> and<00:05:17.520> so<00:05:18.090> you<00:05:18.180> kind<00:05:18.599> of<00:05:18.659> have

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
of what they do and so you kind of have

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.890 
of what they do and so you kind of have
to<00:05:18.900> take<00:05:19.080> cases<00:05:19.620> by<00:05:19.949> a<00:05:19.979> case<00:05:20.220> by<00:05:20.400> case<00:05:20.900> instance

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
to take cases by a case by case instance

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.420 
to take cases by a case by case instance
I<00:05:22.020> guess<00:05:22.199> and<00:05:22.409> make<00:05:22.530> a<00:05:22.560> decision<00:05:22.740> when<00:05:23.400> it

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
I guess and make a decision when it

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.119 
I guess and make a decision when it
comes<00:05:23.729> to<00:05:23.879> certain<00:05:24.150> stories<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:25.590> remember<00:05:25.800> we

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:26.129 
comes to certain stories I remember we

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:27.680 
comes to certain stories I remember we
did<00:05:26.159> that<00:05:26.310> story<00:05:26.669> about<00:05:26.789> that<00:05:26.879> scientist<00:05:27.539> who

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
did that story about that scientist who

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.930 
did that story about that scientist who
were<00:05:27.840> like<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.319> cartoon<00:05:28.919> naked<00:05:29.280> women<00:05:29.610> and

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940
