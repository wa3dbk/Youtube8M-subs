Victoria Knox orange band which is it's

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.149 
Victoria Knox orange band which is it's
a<00:02:51.489> nice<00:02:51.699> band<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:52.449> after<00:02:53.409> wearing<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.859> for<00:02:54.129> a

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
a nice band but after wearing it for a

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.009 
a nice band but after wearing it for a
couple<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.579> weeks<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:55.090> started<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.629> notice<00:02:55.750> with

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
couple of weeks I started to notice with

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.229 
couple of weeks I started to notice with
my<00:02:56.139> dark<00:02:56.409> clothing<00:02:56.829> that<00:02:57.010> my<00:02:57.519> dark<00:02:57.760> clothing

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
my dark clothing that my dark clothing

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.789 
my dark clothing that my dark clothing
colors<00:02:58.689> would<00:02:58.900> actually<00:02:59.260> bleach<00:02:59.500> into<00:02:59.650> the

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
colors would actually bleach into the

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.439 
colors would actually bleach into the
band<00:03:00.340> itself<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.620> unfortunately<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:03.579> gave<00:03:04.329> it

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:04.449 
band itself and unfortunately it gave it

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.439 
band itself and unfortunately it gave it
almost<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.870> darker<00:03:05.379> color<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:06.099> so<00:03:06.969> I<00:03:07.000> decided

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:07.449 
almost a darker color to it so I decided

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.259 
almost a darker color to it so I decided
to<00:03:07.810> change<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.230> out<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.430> actually<00:03:09.669> replaced

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
to change it out and I actually replaced

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.879 
to change it out and I actually replaced
it<00:03:10.449> with<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.659> Luminox<00:03:11.169> band<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.680> is

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
it with the Luminox band this is

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.599 
it with the Luminox band this is
actually<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.400> Luminox<00:03:13.709> band<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.949> I<00:03:14.979> took<00:03:15.069> off

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
actually a Luminox band that I took off

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.589 
actually a Luminox band that I took off
one<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.000> my<00:03:16.090> old<00:03:17.159> Luminox<00:03:18.159> watches<00:03:18.669> it<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.569> a

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
one of my old Luminox watches it is a

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.659 
one of my old Luminox watches it is a
nice<00:03:20.019> band<00:03:20.439> as<00:03:20.590> well<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:20.919> I<00:03:21.069> think<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.370> matches

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
nice band as well and I think it matches

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.539 
nice band as well and I think it matches
it<00:03:21.970> really<00:03:22.199> really<00:03:23.199> enhances<00:03:24.009> the<00:03:24.220> beauty<00:03:24.400> of

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
it really really enhances the beauty of

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.339 
it really really enhances the beauty of
the<00:03:24.819> PVD<00:03:25.329> coating<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:25.930> here<00:03:27.419> excuse<00:03:28.419> me<00:03:28.569> it

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
the PVD coating on here excuse me it

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.069 
the PVD coating on here excuse me it
does<00:03:29.650> have<00:03:30.009> the<00:03:30.419> see-through<00:03:31.419> case<00:03:31.689> back<00:03:32.049> to

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
does have the see-through case back to

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.949 
does have the see-through case back to
it<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.849> as<00:03:33.849> you<00:03:34.060> can<00:03:34.180> see<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.479> says<00:03:34.689> on<00:03:34.870> there

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
it and as you can see it says on there

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.740 
it and as you can see it says on there
sapphire<00:03:35.500> crystal<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.299> running<00:03:37.569> off<00:03:37.720> of

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
sapphire crystal it it is running off of

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.270 
sapphire crystal it it is running off of
the<00:03:37.989> ETA<00:03:38.709> 28<00:03:39.519> 90<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.329> a2<00:03:40.689> movement<00:03:41.650> which<00:03:42.040> is

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
the ETA 28 90 to a2 movement which is

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.490 
the ETA 28 90 to a2 movement which is
beautiful<00:03:43.150> as<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.329> can<00:03:43.479> see<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:43.840> rotor<00:03:44.229> on

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
beautiful as you can see the rotor on

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.020 
beautiful as you can see the rotor on
there<00:03:44.709> just<00:03:44.829> kind<00:03:45.099> of<00:03:45.159> spins<00:03:45.370> back<00:03:45.549> and<00:03:45.790> forth

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
there just kind of spins back and forth

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.199 
there just kind of spins back and forth
it's<00:03:46.720> 21<00:03:47.199> joules<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:48.009> it<00:03:48.519> does<00:03:48.729> have<00:03:48.939> a<00:03:48.970> power

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
it's 21 joules and it does have a power

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.020 
it's 21 joules and it does have a power
reserve<00:03:49.419> of<00:03:49.720> 42<00:03:50.290> hours<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:51.099> it<00:03:51.340> is<00:03:51.549> a<00:03:51.699> nice

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
reserve of 42 hours so it is a nice

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.300 
reserve of 42 hours so it is a nice
watch<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.599> it<00:03:52.689> does<00:03:52.900> hold<00:03:53.109> its<00:03:53.349> its<00:03:53.949> time

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
watch and it does hold its its time

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.610 
watch and it does hold its its time
really<00:03:54.849> really<00:03:55.090> well<00:03:55.329> when<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.049> set<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.319> and

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
really really well when you set it and

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.039 
really really well when you set it and
just<00:03:56.799> kind<00:03:57.009> of<00:03:57.069> leave<00:03:57.219> it<00:03:57.250> there<00:03:57.549> after<00:03:58.049> taking

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
just kind of leave it there after taking

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.789 
just kind of leave it there after taking
it<00:03:59.229> off<00:03:59.349> for<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> day<00:03:59.889> or<00:03:59.919> night<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:01.269> is<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.799> it

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
it off for a day or night it is that it

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.449 
it off for a day or night it is that it
is<00:04:02.979> an<00:04:03.189> actual<00:04:04.079> silicone<00:04:05.079> rubber<00:04:05.379> band<00:04:05.739> that

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
is an actual silicone rubber band that

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.050 
is an actual silicone rubber band that
that<00:04:06.759> that<00:04:07.509> the<00:04:07.689> Luminox<00:04:08.250> has<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.819> and<00:04:09.969> I

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
that that the Luminox has and and I

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.819 
that that the Luminox has and and I
actually<00:04:10.569> think<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.049> looks<00:04:11.199> better<00:04:11.409> with<00:04:11.650> this

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
actually think it looks better with this

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.009 
actually think it looks better with this
ban<00:04:12.099> on<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.609> it<00:04:12.699> does<00:04:12.879> with<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.659> original

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
ban on it and it does with the original

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.259 
ban on it and it does with the original
Orange<00:04:14.319> pan<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.739> came<00:04:14.889> with<00:04:14.919> it<00:04:15.669> is<00:04:15.879> Swiss

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
Orange pan that it came with it is Swiss

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.469 
Orange pan that it came with it is Swiss
Swiss<00:04:16.989> made<00:04:17.409> so<00:04:17.709> you<00:04:17.799> know<00:04:18.070> they<00:04:18.849> they<00:04:19.180> make<00:04:19.359> an

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
Swiss made so you know they they make an

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.810
