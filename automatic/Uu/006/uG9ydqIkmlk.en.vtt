00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
although we wanted a really modern

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
although we wanted a really modern
kitchen<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.080> inspiration<00:00:28.439> really<00:00:28.949> came

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
kitchen so the inspiration really came

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.999 
kitchen so the inspiration really came
from<00:00:29.760> British<00:00:30.240> interiors<00:00:30.929> where<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.679> really

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
from British interiors where you really

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.560 
from British interiors where you really
see<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> old<00:00:32.610> architecture<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> house

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
see the old architecture of the house

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.970 
see the old architecture of the house
and<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:33.930> there's<00:00:34.050> these<00:00:34.200> beautiful<00:00:34.469> modern

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
and then there's these beautiful modern

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.639 
and then there's these beautiful modern
spaces<00:00:35.309> within<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.780> sketch<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.350> calm

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
spaces within it the sketch is very calm

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.400 
spaces within it the sketch is very calm
and<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:39.030> peaceful<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.230> black

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and I think peaceful because it's black

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.040 
and I think peaceful because it's black
and<00:00:40.559> white<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:42.030> hits<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.450> color<00:00:42.690> are

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and white and the hits of color are

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.770 
and white and the hits of color are
really<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> natural<00:00:44.820> weave<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.329> chair

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
really in the natural weave of the chair

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360 
really in the natural weave of the chair
there's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> leather<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
there's a little bit of leather on the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.590 
there's a little bit of leather on the
light<00:00:47.489> fixture<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> course<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
light fixture and then of course the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.020 
light fixture and then of course the
brick<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.050> leads<00:00:49.260> into<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> mudroom<00:00:50.030> really

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
brick that leads into the mudroom really

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
brick that leads into the mudroom really
the<00:00:51.180> idea<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.050> keep<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.710> palette<00:00:53.070> really

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the idea was to keep the palette really

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.340 
the idea was to keep the palette really
light<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.789> crisp<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
light and crisp and then have the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.650 
light and crisp and then have the
accents<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> black<00:00:56.219> door<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.449> black

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
accents of the black door and the black

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830 
accents of the black door and the black
light<00:00:57.960> which<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.680> cb2<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.550> then<00:01:00.149> we

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
light which is from cb2 and then we

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
light which is from cb2 and then we
played<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.469> bringing<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> block<00:01:02.250> into

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
played with bringing in the block into

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.789 
played with bringing in the block into
the<00:01:02.760> pantry<00:01:03.149> space<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.409> really

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the pantry space as well and that really

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.700 
the pantry space as well and that really
created<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.549> great<00:01:05.850> crisp<00:01:06.659> feeling<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
created this great crisp feeling in the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.890 
created this great crisp feeling in the
room<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.729> starting<00:01:09.119> point<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> design

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
room the starting point in the design

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.080 
room the starting point in the design
was<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> actually<00:01:11.070> open<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.490> kitchen<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
was to actually open the kitchen up to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
was to actually open the kitchen up to
the<00:01:12.180> garden<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.840> started<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> French

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the garden so it started with the French

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
the garden so it started with the French
doors<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.430> wanted<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> make<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.299> big<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.479> we

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
doors we wanted to make it as big as we

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.179 
doors we wanted to make it as big as we
could<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.229> were<00:01:16.290> limited<00:01:16.950> by<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
could but we were limited by the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.859 
could but we were limited by the
structure<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> house<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.630> was

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
structure of the house but that was

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.899 
structure of the house but that was
really<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> element<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.920> leads<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
really the element that leads you

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.570 
really the element that leads you
through<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.360> house<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.840> into<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.409> garden<00:01:22.770> we

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
through the house and into the garden we

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.070 
through the house and into the garden we
went<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.909> Caesarstone<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> counter

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
went with Caesarstone on the counter

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.780 
went with Caesarstone on the counter
because<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> client<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.189> wanted<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
because the client really wanted the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.149 
because the client really wanted the
easiness<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.540> having<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.229> quartz<00:01:28.560> countertop

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
easiness of having a quartz countertop

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.160 
easiness of having a quartz countertop
and<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.640> floors<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.570> actually

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and the floors here are actually

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170 
and the floors here are actually
porcelain<00:01:31.860> statuary<00:01:32.610> open<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.060> they're

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
porcelain statuary open so they're

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.999 
porcelain statuary open so they're
really<00:01:33.450> durable<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.409> partnered<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
really durable then we partnered that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
really durable then we partnered that
with<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> real<00:01:35.640> slab<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.210> statuary<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
with a real slab of statuary on the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.649 
with a real slab of statuary on the
backsplash<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.759> theory<00:01:39.270> at

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
backsplash we have a theory at

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.690 
backsplash we have a theory at
Palmerston<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.369> only<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
Palmerston that you can only be a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.520 
Palmerston that you can only be a
minimalist<00:01:42.240> if<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.720> enough<00:01:42.960> storage<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
minimalist if you have enough storage to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.889 
minimalist if you have enough storage to
be<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> minimalist<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.729> incorporated<00:01:45.030> not

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
be a minimalist so we incorporated not

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
be a minimalist so we incorporated not
only<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.290> massive<00:01:47.009> fridge<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> space<00:01:47.759> but

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
only a massive fridge in the space but

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.899 
only a massive fridge in the space but
we<00:01:48.630> did<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> custom<00:01:49.320> pantry<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.670> we

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
we did a custom pantry and then we

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
we did a custom pantry and then we
enclosed<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.960> porch<00:01:52.290> off<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> side<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
enclosed the porch off the side of the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.490 
enclosed the porch off the side of the
house<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.549> created<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.149> mudroom<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.810> she

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
house and created a mudroom so she

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.830 
house and created a mudroom so she
really<00:01:55.710> has<00:01:56.009> loads<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.729> storage<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.540> very

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
really has loads of storage in this very

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.000 
really has loads of storage in this very
clean<00:01:58.229> kitchen

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
clean kitchen

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.460 
clean kitchen
when<00:02:00.010> you<00:02:00.640> take<00:02:01.030> away<00:02:01.299> all<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.990> details

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
when you take away all of the details

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.399 
when you take away all of the details
the<00:02:03.310> work<00:02:03.580> is<00:02:03.729> harder<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.360> slim<00:02:04.780> detail<00:02:05.200> of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
the work is harder the slim detail of

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.109 
the work is harder the slim detail of
the<00:02:05.560> doors<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.010> how<00:02:06.490> they<00:02:06.670> pivot<00:02:07.030> and

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
the doors and how they pivot and

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.029 
the doors and how they pivot and
flush-mount<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.960> drywall<00:02:08.200> when<00:02:08.770> all<00:02:08.920> the

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
flush-mount to the drywall when all the

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.250 
flush-mount to the drywall when all the
doors<00:02:09.220> are<00:02:09.399> closed<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:10.390> room<00:02:10.600> is<00:02:10.780> completely

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
doors are closed the room is completely

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.250 
doors are closed the room is completely
clean<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:12.310> just<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.209> detail<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.720> making<00:02:14.080> that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
clean so just the detail of making that

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.710 
clean so just the detail of making that
work<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.830> having<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.489> all<00:02:15.640> feel<00:02:16.560> precise

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.020 

I<00:02:20.780> think<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.040> timeless<00:02:22.460> because<00:02:22.670> when<00:02:22.940> you

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
I think it is timeless because when you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.940 
I think it is timeless because when you
respect<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.630> architecture<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.410> house<00:02:24.590> so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
respect the architecture of the house so

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.740 
respect the architecture of the house so
we<00:02:25.220> added<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> crown<00:02:26.120> molding<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.630> we

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
we added in the crown molding and we

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.720 
we added in the crown molding and we
added<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.260> some<00:02:27.500> architectural<00:02:28.040> detail<00:02:28.460> and

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
added in some architectural detail and

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.790 
added in some architectural detail and
then<00:02:28.910> everything<00:02:29.300> else<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:29.750> clean<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.320> think

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
then everything else is so clean I think

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.790 
then everything else is so clean I think
if<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.980> look<00:02:31.220> at<00:02:31.450> modern<00:02:32.450> interiors<00:02:32.960> in<00:02:33.260> Paris

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
if you look at modern interiors in Paris

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:45.520 
if you look at modern interiors in Paris
or<00:02:34.040> in<00:02:34.180> England<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.110> how<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.980> saves<00:02:37.220> time

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.590
