built-in you don't get that on the
earlier<00:00:44.340> series<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.520> 2005<00:00:47.840> what

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
earlier series so this is a 2005 what

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
earlier series so this is a 2005 what
also<00:00:48.989> makes<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> special<00:00:50.010> instead<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> two

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
also makes it special instead of a two

also makes it special instead of a two
and<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> half<00:00:51.750> liter<00:00:52.079> turbo<00:00:52.879> it's<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> famous

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and a half liter turbo it's the famous

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
a half liter motor which I reckon is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.400 
a half liter motor which I reckon is
better

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
better

I've just driven this around the block
it<00:01:04.680> absolutely<00:01:04.860> flies<00:01:05.580> loads<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:07.020> torque<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
it absolutely flies loads of torque and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.280 
it absolutely flies loads of torque and
grunt<00:01:08.850> from<00:01:09.119> low<00:01:09.360> revs<00:01:09.659> which<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.080> what's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
grunt from low revs which is what's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.520 
grunt from low revs which is what's
missing<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:12.150> 2.5<00:01:13.140> liter<00:01:13.200> turbo<00:01:13.950> v6<00:01:14.159> engine

don't get me wrong the two and a half
weight<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> very<00:01:18.270> nice<00:01:18.479> car<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.530> once

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
weight is a very nice car and once

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
weight is a very nice car and once
they're<00:01:19.950> spoiled<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.970> turbo<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
they're spoiled up and the turbo is

working they really are a nice
performance<00:01:23.700> wagon<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.930> thing<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
performance wagon but this thing I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.560 
performance wagon but this thing I
reckon<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.490> nicer<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
reckon is nicer because it's got that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
reckon is nicer because it's got that
lowdown<00:01:27.990> grunt<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> same<00:01:29.220> engine<00:01:29.610> as

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
lowdown grunt it's the same engine as
