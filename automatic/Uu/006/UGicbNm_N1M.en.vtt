00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
they could keep chasing with this yeah

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.720 
they could keep chasing with this yeah
they<00:02:18.300> could<00:02:18.630> maybe<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:20.160> know<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.610> a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
they could maybe but you know it's a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.309 
they could maybe but you know it's a
little<00:02:20.970> too<00:02:21.120> sad<00:02:21.330> room<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:21.840> well<00:02:21.989> so<00:02:22.170> it

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
little too sad room now as well so it

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.809 
little too sad room now as well so it
hurts<00:02:22.470> quite<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.860> bit<00:02:23.100> see<00:02:23.250> mark<00:02:23.459> have<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.730> be

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
hurts quite a bit see mark have to be

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.960 
hurts quite a bit see mark have to be
careful<00:02:24.209> around<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.600> Timbers<00:02:24.959> all<00:02:25.110> mid<00:02:25.530> tower

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
careful around the Timbers all mid tower

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.580 
careful around the Timbers all mid tower
this<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.150> risky<00:02:27.510> but<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.690> think<00:02:27.870> Alex<00:02:28.170> once<00:02:28.380> it's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
this is risky but I think Alex once it's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.860 
this is risky but I think Alex once it's
bad<00:02:28.830> enough<00:02:28.970> there's<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.030> rabbit<00:02:30.330> hole<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.690> your

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
bad enough there's a rabbit hole in your

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.809 
bad enough there's a rabbit hole in your
tryna<00:02:31.110> Stampede<00:02:31.590> no<00:02:31.890> deny<00:02:32.220> here<00:02:32.430> just<00:02:32.670> yet
