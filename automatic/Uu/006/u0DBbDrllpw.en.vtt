00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the video did not like it so much at all

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.060 
the video did not like it so much at all

reviewing<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.170> NYX<00:00:25.170> super<00:00:25.680> fat<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:28.230> next

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
reviewing is the NYX super fat the next

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.550 
reviewing is the NYX super fat the next
super<00:00:29.189> fat<00:00:29.460> eye<00:00:29.730> marker<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.960> whole<00:00:31.170> idea

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
super fat eye marker and the whole idea

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.620 
super fat eye marker and the whole idea
behind<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.099> isn't<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.730> liquid<00:00:33.180> liner<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
behind this isn't a liquid liner and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.260 
behind this isn't a liquid liner and
it's<00:00:33.809> got<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> felt<00:00:34.469> tip<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.460> fast<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.239> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it's got a felt tip but it's fast like a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.410 
it's got a felt tip but it's fast like a
sharpie<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.020> has<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.320> huge<00:00:37.380> tip<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
sharpie it has this huge tip and the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
sharpie it has this huge tip and the
whole<00:00:39.600> idea<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.680> could<00:00:40.860> easily<00:00:41.070> just

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
whole idea is that you could easily just

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.069 
whole idea is that you could easily just
hold<00:00:41.670> onto<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.390> would<00:00:42.570> hold<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
hold onto it like you would hold on to a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.200 
hold onto it like you would hold on to a
sharpie<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.620> draw<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:44.399> wing<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> not

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
sharpie and draw your wing out and not

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
sharpie and draw your wing out and not
have<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.510> deal<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.870> long<00:00:46.170> flimsy<00:00:46.770> brushes

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
have to deal with long flimsy brushes

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.670 
have to deal with long flimsy brushes
and<00:00:47.640> felt<00:00:48.420> tips<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.050> stuff<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and felt tips and stuff to make it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.540 
and felt tips and stuff to make it
easier<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> apply<00:00:50.640> um<00:00:51.949> does<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
easier to apply um does this make it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.119 
easier to apply um does this make it
easier<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.090> apply<00:00:54.329> maybe<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.649> someone<00:00:56.010> who

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
easier to apply maybe for someone who

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.540 
easier to apply maybe for someone who
does<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:57.120> liquid<00:00:57.480> liner<00:00:58.219> this<00:00:59.219> would<00:00:59.430> be

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
does not use liquid liner this would be

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
does not use liquid liner this would be
easier<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> apply<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.690> me<00:01:00.809> personally<00:01:01.350> this

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
easier to apply to me personally this

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.130 
easier to apply to me personally this
made<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.640> very<00:01:02.699> awkward<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.660> first<00:01:03.899> time<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
made it a very awkward the first time I

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.830 
made it a very awkward the first time I
used<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.769> felt<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.460> had<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.060> change<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
used it I felt like I had to change the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.429 
used it I felt like I had to change the
entire<00:01:07.110> way<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> applied<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.430> eyeliner<00:01:09.060> because

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
entire way I applied my eyeliner because

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.730 
entire way I applied my eyeliner because
this<00:01:10.439> fat<00:01:10.830> tip<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:12.240> fat<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.140> depth<00:01:13.500> it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
this fat tip is really fat and depth it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.670 
this fat tip is really fat and depth it
kind<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> stiff<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.450> actually<00:01:15.630> tugs<00:01:16.350> on

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
kind of stiff so it actually tugs on

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
kind of stiff so it actually tugs on
your<00:01:16.950> eye<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.580> eye<00:01:17.790> line<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.479> eyelid

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
your eye on your eye line on your eyelid

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
your eye on your eye line on your eyelid
and<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:20.009> can't<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.460> use<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> same<00:01:21.299> way

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and you can't just use it the same way

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.800 
and you can't just use it the same way
you<00:01:21.810> would<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:21.990> let's<00:01:22.710> say<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:24.180> linear

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you would use let's say the linear

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.179 
you would use let's say the linear
intense<00:01:25.170> carbon<00:01:25.560> black<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> absolutely

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
intense carbon black that I absolutely

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.810 
intense carbon black that I absolutely
adore<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.930> pulls<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.220> eyelid<00:01:29.640> so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
adore because it pulls on your eyelid so

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
adore because it pulls on your eyelid so
I<00:01:29.850> had<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.329> do<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.720> from<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> opposite

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
I had to do it from the opposite

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190 
I had to do it from the opposite
direction<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.880> had<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.780> use<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
direction and I just had to use a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.620 
direction and I just had to use a
completely<00:01:34.680> different<00:01:35.460> shape<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:36.360> wing

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
completely different shape for my wing

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.780 
completely different shape for my wing
with<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.170> than<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> did<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.460> others

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
with this than I did with my others

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.219 
with this than I did with my others
because<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.270> could<00:01:39.509> not<00:01:39.689> achieve<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
because I just could not achieve the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.730 
because I just could not achieve the
same<00:01:40.409> look<00:01:40.650> first<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.579> all<00:01:41.810> secondly<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.470> is

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
same look first of all secondly this is

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.249 
same look first of all secondly this is
extremely<00:01:44.399> watery<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> formula<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.079> it's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
extremely watery as a formula like it's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.350 
extremely watery as a formula like it's
not<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.920> mean<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> liquid<00:01:47.700> liner<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.030> gonna<00:01:48.210> be

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
not I mean a liquid liner is gonna be

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
not I mean a liquid liner is gonna be
liquid<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:48.990> most<00:01:49.259> sensors<00:01:49.680> thicker<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
liquid but most sensors thicker and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.300 
liquid but most sensors thicker and
darker<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.360> really<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.189> when<00:01:53.189> you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
darker this is really like when you

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.679 
darker this is really like when you
compare<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:55.100> this<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.299> oil

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
compare this to this this is like oil

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.920 
compare this to this this is like oil
paints<00:01:58.200> versus<00:01:58.860> water<00:01:59.640> color<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> is

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
paints versus water color like this is

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.499 
paints versus water color like this is
really<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.469> really<00:02:02.009> thin<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.299> was

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
really really really thin and it it was

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.080 
really really really thin and it it was
really<00:02:04.229> hard<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.799> build<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.369> mean<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.759> me<00:02:05.939> it

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
getting a very negative review from me

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.349 
getting a very negative review from me
so<00:03:18.160> if<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.340> were<00:03:18.549> thinking<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:19.000> trying<00:03:19.209> this

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
so if you were thinking of trying this

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.930 
so if you were thinking of trying this
out<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:20.049> you're<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.350> liquid<00:03:20.920> liner<00:03:21.130> lover<00:03:21.579> I

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
out and you're a liquid liner lover I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.610 
out and you're a liquid liner lover I
would<00:03:22.450> say<00:03:22.600> don't<00:03:22.840> bother<00:03:23.019> because<00:03:23.350> you're

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
would say don't bother because you're

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.990 
would say don't bother because you're
probably<00:03:23.799> gonna<00:03:24.040> be<00:03:24.130> disappointed<00:03:24.820> by<00:03:24.940> this

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
probably gonna be disappointed by this

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.840 
probably gonna be disappointed by this
so<00:03:25.930> again<00:03:26.410> my<00:03:26.650> opinion<00:03:26.859> is<00:03:27.160> my<00:03:27.340> own<00:03:27.549> some

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
so again my opinion is my own some

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.979 
so again my opinion is my own some
people<00:03:28.090> may<00:03:28.209> love<00:03:28.480> this<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.840> have<00:03:28.959> a

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
people may love this and have a

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.720 
people may love this and have a
completely<00:03:29.500> different<00:03:29.739> experience<00:03:29.980> with<00:03:30.579> it

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
completely different experience with it

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.910 
completely different experience with it
but<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.120> really<00:03:31.989> didn't<00:03:32.350> like<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:32.859> will

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
but I really didn't like it and I will

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.460 
but I really didn't like it and I will
not<00:03:33.370> report<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.870> gets<00:03:34.989> what<00:03:35.140> comes<00:03:35.350> down

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
not report it so it gets what comes down
