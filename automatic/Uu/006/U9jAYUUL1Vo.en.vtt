00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.240
(Director, Voice-over): Dear Chairman:

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.320
The Meta is nothing more than an entity seeking to increase its power

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.920
in these confusing days after the war.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.860
From my perspective, that seems to be a very common occurrence at the moment.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.260
(South): Delta. Report.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.300
(Delta): Your suit's energy reserves are nearly depleted.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.020
The shield will not-

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.920
(South): How much longer?!

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.480
(Delta): The Meta will breach our barrier within sixty seconds.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.180
I suggest that you prepare your grenades

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.800
while I divert power from your armor's non-essential systems.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.480
(South): No.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.380
(Delta): You have a better plan?

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.040
(South): Keep the shield up as long as you can.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.580
When it starts to falter, transfer yourself to the storage unit.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.500
(Delta): I think I would be more useful in my current state.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.840
(South): I'll dump my shield generator at the same time.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.400
There's no way that *thing* can resist the both of you.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.520
(Delta): You are... abandoning me?

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.520
(South): It's my best chance to get of this.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.540
(Delta): South. Protocol violations aside, this seems to be a very short term solution.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.200
The Meta will only grow more powerful by integrating me into-

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.500
(South): Program override. Acknowledge last directive.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.540
(Delta): Acknowledged. Preparing storage unit.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.220
(South): Get ready.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.680
(Delta): Shield failure in 5...

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.580
(Delta): 4
(South): Get ready to eject.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.040
(Delta): 3
(South): Transfer to storage.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.540
(Delta): 2
(South): On my mark!

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.820
(Delta): 1
(South): NOW!

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.400
[Explosion]

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.540
(Washington): There they are!

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.600
(Delta): New targets incoming.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.580
(Washington): Don't let it get near her!

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.940
Don't let her get away!

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.480
(Church): Her? Isn't she a Freelancer like you?

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.400
(Washington): Yes!

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.660
Just don't let her leave!

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.700
(Church): Okay! Caboose!

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.280
(Caboose): Hello!

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.500
(Church): Hey, see that purple one?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.160
She's on our team. You should help her.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.040
(Caboose): Okay!

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.500
(South):Uh! Son of a-!
(Delta): Friendly fire!

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.440
(Caboose): Uh. She got in the way when I was trying to help her.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.660
(Church): Okay, we're good.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.600
(Washington): Damn! It's gone invisible,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.060
keep an eye on your motion trackers, and watch your perimeters!

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.040
Look for a shimmer.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.300
(Church): It can turn invisible?

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.260
What is this thing?!

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.060
(Washington): It takes the equipment of other Freelancers,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.660
it must have picked up cloaking from Tex.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.160
(Church): Wait a second. Any equipment?

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.980
(Washington): Yes!

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.720
Why?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.100
(Church): Shit. Wyoming!

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.240
Cover me!

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.320
(Washington): What?

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.460
Wyoming?!

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.660
Caboose, cover him!

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.940
Grab those spike grenades.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.040
(Church): No! Don't let Caboose help me!

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.220
(Washington): There it is!

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.240
[Explosions]

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.960
(Church): Hey! How about a little help out here?!

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.440
(Washington): On it. Caboose, toss that grenade!

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.660
(Washington): That was the worst throw ever.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.300
Of all time.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.120
(Caboose): Not my fault.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.920
Someone put a wall in my way.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.020
(Washington): What?

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.560
Where did it go? What happened?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.620
(Caboose): You don't remember?

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.000
It threw a grenade that landed in between us.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.500
But don't worry! I saved you.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.920
(Church): It used Agent Wyoming's stupid time thing from the ship!

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.580
What's wrong with you, why didn't you tell us it could use equipment?!

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.300
(Washington): Why didn't you tell me that Wyoming was on the ship?!

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.960
(Caboose): AND WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE GIVE ME SOMETHING TO YELL ABOUT?!

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.720
[Grunting]

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.940
(Washington): Delta. Are you here?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.380
(Delta): Affirmative. I am undamaged.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.260
However, Agent South is seriously wounded.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.320
May I suggest moving me to a new host.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.700
(Washington): Roger that. I don't trust her anyway.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.000
One of you two take him.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.700
(Church): Um. I don't think that I can-

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.480
(Caboose): I'll do it!

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.180
I like meeting new people.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.500
(Washington): Delta, what happened?

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.460
(Delta): I agree with the simulation trooper.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.400
The Meta has most likely acquired both the temporal distortion unit,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.180
and an AI capable of running it.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.720
In this case, Gamma.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.980
(Washington): Well, why didn't it kill us, then?

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.060
(Delta): I am sorry, but I do not have enough data to formulate an answer.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.100
I think we should simply be happy it is gone.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.260
(Church): That makes sense to me.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.060
(Caboose): I also agree with the glowing person.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.680
Everyone else sees a glowing person, right?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.040
(Delta): It is possible the Meta has been injured in some way,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.660
and is retreating to repair itself.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.900
(Washington): So. If we can find it before it does,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.620
we may actually stand a chance at beating it.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.140
(Church): Either way, I don't think we should be hanging around here.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.240
(Washington): Then let's get moving.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.820
(South): I can't-

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.540
I can't walk on my own.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.140
(Washington): Well, I guess you'd better start crawling.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.120
If you think I'm leaving you here to escape, you've got another thing coming.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.420
(Delta): Agent Washington, if I may.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.460
Before you arrived, South attempted to turn me over to the Meta.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.740
To save herself.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.740
(Washington): Really.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.600
(Delta): Much like she wounded you to escape in our previous encounter with it.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.340
And as I have learned in our travels,

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.160
her brother, North, suffered a similar fate.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.660
(Washington): What a team player.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.740
(Delta): It is highly probable that she will turn on us again soon,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.560
and in her current physical state, she will only hamper our progress.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.580
(Washington): What are you suggesting?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.760
(Delta): That we do not allow her to hamper our progress.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.140
(Washington): Okay.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.020
(South): Oh come on, Wash.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.420
What are you gonna do?

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.420
Sh- [Gunshot]

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.560
(Washington): Yes.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.800
Good suggestion.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.600
(Delta): You're welcome.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.100
(Church): Dude.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.900
You guys are some cold motherfuckers.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.660
(Caboose): I just want everyone to know that I have no problems walking.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.620
And I take full responsibility for the grenade incident.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.320
(Simmons): Greetings, fellow web-surfer!

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.620
Be sure to subscribe to our channel before you go!

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.460
It'll be just like we're friends!

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.800
Not that I... need... friends.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.040
[Nervous laugh]

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.660
Please don't go.
