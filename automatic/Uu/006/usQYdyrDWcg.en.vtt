00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
trampled steams because that's the only

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.540 
trampled steams because that's the only
time<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.090> get<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.420> indicator<00:01:44.870> to<00:01:45.470> place<00:01:45.920> the

time you get the indicator to place the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.400 
time you get the indicator to place the
orb<00:01:47.020> it's<00:01:48.020> when<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.830> actual<00:01:50.320> trample<00:01:51.320> steam

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
orb it's when the actual trample steam

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.390 
orb it's when the actual trample steam
is<00:01:51.909> setting<00:01:52.909> into<00:01:53.210> place<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:55.040> got<00:01:55.250> that

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
is setting into place so you got that

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.280 
is setting into place so you got that
you<00:01:55.610> got<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.850> option<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.390> says<00:01:56.630> hit<00:01:56.870> X<00:01:57.080> to

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
you got the option it says hit X to
