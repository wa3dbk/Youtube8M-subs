00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
platformer games let's see this in

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.269 
platformer games let's see this in
action<00:00:16.550> moving<00:00:17.550> left<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.940> right<00:00:19.160> hitting<00:00:20.160> our

moving platform using wall jumps walking
on<00:00:48.300> sloped<00:00:48.690> platforms<00:00:52.430> we<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.579> interact<00:00:54.030> with

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
on sloped platforms we can interact with

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.439 
on sloped platforms we can interact with
any<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.899> Collider

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
any kind of Collider

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.950 
any kind of Collider
let's<00:00:57.449> add<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> casual<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> scene

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
let's add a casual to the scene

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:12.210 
let's add a casual to the scene
position<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> correctly

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:26.890 

and

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.840 

so<00:01:27.410> you<00:01:27.500> can<00:01:27.620> also<00:01:27.770> use<00:01:27.890> mesh<00:01:28.250> colliders<00:01:28.730> if

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
so you can also use mesh colliders if

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.960 
so you can also use mesh colliders if
you<00:01:28.970> want<00:01:29.120> curved<00:01:29.680> smoother<00:01:30.680> curves<00:01:30.970> as

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
you want curved smoother curves as

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.390 
you want curved smoother curves as
opposed<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.780> structure<00:01:33.500> of<00:01:33.650> cubes<00:01:34.160> I've

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
opposed to the structure of cubes I've

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.050 
opposed to the structure of cubes I've
built<00:01:34.670> over<00:01:34.790> here<00:01:36.490> now<00:01:37.490> let's<00:01:37.700> look<00:01:37.880> at

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
built over here now let's look at

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.020 
built over here now let's look at
setting<00:01:38.570> up<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:40.210> character<00:01:42.850> we're<00:01:43.850> going<00:01:43.970> to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
setting up a character we're going to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.920 
setting up a character we're going to
drop<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:45.100> 3d<00:01:46.100> model<00:01:47.800> now<00:01:48.800> character<00:01:49.930> control

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
drop a 3d model now character control

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.070 
drop a 3d model now character control
ozone<00:01:52.060> then<00:01:53.060> we're<00:01:53.180> going<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.360> position<00:01:53.540> him

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
ozone then we're going to position him

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.280 
ozone then we're going to position him
correctly<00:01:56.050> we're<00:01:57.050> going<00:01:57.260> to<00:01:57.410> use<00:01:59.260> some<00:02:00.260> of

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
correctly we're going to use some of

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.000 
correctly we're going to use some of
these<00:02:00.500> widgets<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:01.310> control<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:03.200> position<00:02:03.500> of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
these widgets to control the position of

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.970 
these widgets to control the position of
the<00:02:04.130> character<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:06.020> firstly<00:02:06.470> let's<00:02:06.770> reduce

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
the character so firstly let's reduce

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.910 
the character so firstly let's reduce
the<00:02:07.340> number<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.610> colliders<00:02:08.619> don't<00:02:09.619> really

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
the number of colliders don't really

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.820 
the number of colliders don't really
need<00:02:10.070> that<00:02:10.130> many

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
need that many

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.400 
need that many
no<00:02:13.360> that's<00:02:14.360> position<00:02:14.930> them<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.930> way<00:02:18.110> that's

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
no that's position them in a way that's

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.060 
no that's position them in a way that's
probably<00:02:19.630> closer<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.810> what<00:02:21.110> we<00:02:21.230> want<00:02:21.260> with

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
probably closer to what we want with

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
probably closer to what we want with
this<00:02:22.310> character

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
this character

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.720 
this character
I<00:02:24.160> won't<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.630> very<00:02:26.630> accurate<00:02:26.930> model<00:02:30.730> owner

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
I won't do very accurate model owner

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.020 
I won't do very accurate model owner
only<00:02:31.880> because<00:02:32.180> this<00:02:32.330> character<00:02:34.030> animations

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
only because this character animations

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:47.810 
only because this character animations
are<00:02:35.180> not<00:02:35.330> great<00:02:35.950> for<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:36.980> platformer<00:02:37.700> game

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.850 

we<00:02:48.820> need<00:02:48.970> some<00:02:49.270> some<00:02:49.840> room<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.410> swing<00:02:50.680> his<00:02:50.830> arms

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
we need some some room to swing his arms

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.690 
we need some some room to swing his arms
I<00:02:53.100> think<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:54.610> I'm<00:02:55.390> not<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.750> get<00:02:55.900> going<00:02:56.700> let

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
I think that we I'm not to get going let

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.800 
I think that we I'm not to get going let
me<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:58.060> do<00:02:58.240> that<00:03:00.330> you'll<00:03:01.330> see<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.540> little

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
me just do that you'll see a little

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.630 
me just do that you'll see a little
character<00:03:02.380> it's<00:03:02.890> capable<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.550> moving<00:03:04.300> around

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
character it's capable of moving around

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.950 
character it's capable of moving around
but<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.790> course<00:03:07.000> we<00:03:07.150> have<00:03:07.270> their<00:03:07.390> animations

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.170 

so<00:03:10.960> it's<00:03:11.580> dropping<00:03:12.580> in<00:03:12.760> one<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:13.000> these<00:03:13.120> groups

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
so it's dropping in one of these groups

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.300 
so it's dropping in one of these groups
so<00:03:16.350> animations<00:03:17.350> are<00:03:17.470> sent<00:03:17.680> as<00:03:17.770> events<00:03:18.160> and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
so animations are sent as events and

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:28.530 
so animations are sent as events and
there's<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.490> couple<00:03:18.670> of<00:03:18.850> sample<00:03:19.300> animators<00:03:27.540> so

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
there's a couple of sample animators so

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.420 
there's a couple of sample animators so
there's<00:03:28.720> an<00:03:28.810> animator<00:03:29.140> for<00:03:29.470> sprites<00:03:29.890> using

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
there's an animator for sprites using

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.000 
there's an animator for sprites using
sprite<00:03:31.090> manager<00:03:31.450> one<00:03:31.600> as<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.810> sample<00:03:32.320> it's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
sprite manager one as a sample it's

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.620 
sprite manager one as a sample it's
really<00:03:33.370> quite<00:03:33.610> easy<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:34.000> set<00:03:34.300> up<00:03:34.450> these

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
really quite easy to set up these

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.170 
really quite easy to set up these
animators<00:03:35.430> we<00:03:36.430> have<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.580> look<00:03:36.760> at<00:03:36.880> model

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
animators we have a look at model

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.920 
animators we have a look at model
animator<00:03:38.100> which<00:03:39.100> we're<00:03:39.310> about<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.580> use<00:03:39.930> it's

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
animator which we're about to use it's

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.750 
animator which we're about to use it's
really<00:03:41.260> only<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.500> few<00:03:41.800> lines<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.160> code<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:44.760> now

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
really only a few lines of code so now

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.310 
really only a few lines of code so now
that<00:03:45.820> we<00:03:46.030> connected<00:03:46.420> that<00:03:46.600> let's<00:03:47.080> hit<00:03:47.290> play

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
that we connected that let's hit play

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
that we connected that let's hit play
again<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:49.360> we'll<00:03:49.480> see<00:03:49.510> our<00:03:49.780> character<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:52.510> now

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
again and we'll see our character is now

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.120 
again and we'll see our character is now
animated<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.450> forms<00:03:57.450> just<00:03:58.450> like<00:03:59.130> the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
animated and it forms just like the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.690

I<00:04:18.510> said<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.540> bully<00:04:20.080> in<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.260> editor<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.970> for

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
I said a bully in the editor so for

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.500 
I said a bully in the editor so for
example<00:04:22.660> let's<00:04:23.290> turn<00:04:23.620> off<00:04:23.770> double<00:04:24.100> jumps<00:04:24.510> and

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
example let's turn off double jumps and

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.930 
example let's turn off double jumps and
let's<00:04:25.690> change<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.140> jumps<00:04:26.560> so<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.040> the

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
let's change the jumps so that the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.180 
let's change the jumps so that the
longer<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.330> hold<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.780> jump<00:04:29.260> button<00:04:29.680> the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
longer you hold the jump button the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.870 
longer you hold the jump button the
higher<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.760> character<00:04:31.180> jump<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:36.400> now<00:04:36.550> we<00:04:36.610> can

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
higher the character jump so now we can

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.450 
higher the character jump so now we can
do<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.330> little<00:04:37.690> jump<00:04:38.010> well<00:04:39.010> we<00:04:39.160> can<00:04:39.310> do<00:04:39.430> a

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
do a little jump well we can do a

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.680 
do a little jump well we can do a
picture

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.810 

of<00:04:45.690> course<00:04:45.900> without<00:04:46.170> Donald<00:04:46.410> Trump<00:04:46.820> can't

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
of course without Donald Trump can't

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.010 
of course without Donald Trump can't
actually<00:04:48.030> get<00:04:48.300> on<00:04:48.450> top<00:04:48.630> of<00:04:48.750> my<00:04:48.840> platforms

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
actually get on top of my platforms

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:58.000 
actually get on top of my platforms
let's<00:04:52.020> turn<00:04:52.230> double<00:04:52.590> jump<00:04:52.800> back<00:04:53.010> on<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.740> let's

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.380 

decrease<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.130> drag<00:04:59.550> so<00:04:59.880> that<00:04:59.910> he<00:05:00.090> slides

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
decrease the drag so that he slides

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.650 
decrease the drag so that he slides
around<00:05:00.720> it<00:05:00.900> more<00:05:01.080> increase<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.010> exhilaration

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
around it more increase the exhilaration

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.020 
around it more increase the exhilaration
increase<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.900> run<00:05:04.110> speed<00:05:04.580> so<00:05:05.580> now<00:05:05.730> we've<00:05:05.880> got

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
increase the run speed so now we've got

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.100 
increase the run speed so now we've got
a<00:05:06.060> much<00:05:06.350> faster<00:05:07.350> character
