00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 we find 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.800
 it is not in the interest of using the 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:12.390
 two at the same time since it's going to go 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.990
 as soon as apple declared that it was going 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.330
 clean 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.520
 so it only takes one but the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.740
 believers since you are crisis ticket 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.750
 and to those small is the little miss 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.570
 she who will put herself around the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.410
 soiling and that will allow to remove 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.390
 the stage scene finally stuck to the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.160
 air lepi so once it's done 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.690
 you have by a snack a big thing 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.890
 normally it's efficient enough 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:43.590
 to do mans here is exactly the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.649
 case it was lost so there I did not 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.120
 no opinion but I use both names 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.059
 but me, I use two nights on 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.800
 minimum with morning is under the shower 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.149
 with the know nothing against soap like 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.680
 a poor person, I'm fine, everything is fine 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.960
 well it could be a gel washing that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.910
 could be it could be you not 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.680
 do it in these cases to put some 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.049
 fat after that was really 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.760
 everyone works in you feel it 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.650
 no two but revenge you 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.570
 make the iman more scholarly no there it's 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.810
 too much you're really doing it 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.549
 too much 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.900
 there are people who say words 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.659
 I actually say the liniment 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.340
 hydrolate I lead after washing gel 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.869
 cetera says no it's not worth it 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.060
 Once upon a time you may not need 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.060
 to be more cafes than it danced 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.299
 we do not put a makeup remover 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.200
 it's a masks for those big one 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.670
 Soap removes soap is We had a 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.009
 conceded maquis of an oath he goes the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.840
 look for what choice they have 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.700
 solved hump too good did enough to 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.880
 your show me I used them as 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.009
 cleanser of course but we could also 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.390
 dense have a little bit not 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.159
 really what could have been to 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.179
 his place and a half for me for the complexion 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.789
 know where you could put a 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.289
 salon to remove makeup do not 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.869
 use soap for make-up removal 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:02.599
 just the level of blue city hall was enough 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:04.310
 maui and his service relationship to you the 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.380
 wilaya was also to it was also a 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.200
 same saponification process so got 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.200
 produced after llodra this is it 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.060
 absolutely not worth going re 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.769
 clean up on the contrary some 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.239
 share you do too much on vote 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.160
 it's not the end of the end does not have 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.380
 need to be handed in time to clean 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.540
 of course no need to help cap 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.050
 and borrowed from elsewhere I meant 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.210
 by then 125 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.300
 so I used it last night and 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.610
 it's amazing but true because I 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.370
 wonder if I was using a 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.810
 removing make-up that he was no longer 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.490
 milk and so suddenly I had taken a 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.020
 other bio but I want now that 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.790
 it's not why I find even 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.260
 pau for a month review button and there 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 I will use in one evening 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.910
 this morning I'm pretty sweet already 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.440
 I did not need to put a cream 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.730
 after then normally I skin 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.370
 dry and I feel I have more there I was 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.400
 any sore around the mouth in 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.050
 foam in one night I think to arm the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.960
 natural products gta on ds tell you 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.040
 once I'm blown away every day 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.060
 because it's mostly the way in which 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.120
 it cleans the coast 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.130
 yes I spent a cotton is fine 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.290
 far we say we see kindergarten 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.460
 so we understand why this is 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.050
 what I explained to you a little in 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.030
 the pass that it is going through a monkey 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.650
 the legacy wages we will see later 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.090
 it is simply an emulsion is 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.710
 there we are on something 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:32.989
 cleaners that really goes 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.989
 searches have changed for love
