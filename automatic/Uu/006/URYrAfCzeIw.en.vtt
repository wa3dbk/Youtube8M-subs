think<00:00:32.739> is<00:00:32.859> the<00:00:33.309> fact<00:00:33.670> that<00:00:33.729> it's<00:00:33.969> introducing

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
think is the fact that it's introducing

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.689 
think is the fact that it's introducing
children<00:00:34.960> you<00:00:35.559> know<00:00:35.679> as<00:00:35.800> a<00:00:35.829> really<00:00:36.190> early<00:00:36.339> age

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699

children you know as a really early age
to<00:00:37.059> gardening<00:00:37.539> I<00:00:37.719> think<00:00:38.319> it'd<00:00:38.409> just<00:00:38.499> be

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
to gardening I think it'd just be

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.799 
to gardening I think it'd just be
brilliant<00:00:39.039> if<00:00:39.219> every<00:00:39.819> school<00:00:40.089> could<00:00:40.600> to

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
brilliant if every school could to

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.379 
brilliant if every school could to
encourage<00:00:40.989> a<00:00:41.909> garden<00:00:42.909> of<00:00:43.059> some<00:00:43.239> description

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.389 
encourage a garden of some description

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:49.649 
encourage a garden of some description
it<00:00:43.870> doesn't<00:00:44.079> have<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.229> be<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.350> fancy<00:00:44.589> one<00:00:48.659> well

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
it doesn't have to be a fancy one well

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.329 
it doesn't have to be a fancy one well
that<00:00:49.780> have<00:00:49.929> been<00:00:50.109> caught<00:00:50.289> I<00:00:50.469> wanted<00:00:50.799> to<00:00:50.920> make<00:00:51.309> a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
that have been caught I wanted to make a

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.520 
that have been caught I wanted to make a
garden<00:00:51.639> that<00:00:51.789> felt<00:00:52.299> intimate<00:00:52.929> for<00:00:53.139> children

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
garden that felt intimate for children

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.439 
garden that felt intimate for children
because<00:00:54.159> I<00:00:54.219> think<00:00:54.399> children's<00:00:54.909> perception<00:00:55.389> of

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
because I think children's perception of

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.979 
because I think children's perception of
space<00:00:55.839> is<00:00:56.199> very<00:00:56.440> different<00:00:56.620> to<00:00:56.799> that<00:00:57.129> of<00:00:57.249> adult

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
space is very different to that of adult

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.149 
space is very different to that of adult
watching<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.079> children<00:00:59.289> actually<00:00:59.709> sort<00:01:00.129> of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
watching the children actually sort of

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.219 
watching the children actually sort of
putting<00:01:00.459> their<00:01:00.729> feet<00:01:00.909> on<00:01:01.179> the<00:01:01.420> footsteps<00:01:01.929> has

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
putting their feet on the footsteps has

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.449 
putting their feet on the footsteps has
been<00:01:02.469> really<00:01:02.739> fun<00:01:02.769> watching<00:01:03.309> them

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:03.459 
been really fun watching them

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:05.550 
been really fun watching them
religiously<00:01:04.239> going<00:01:04.540> round<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.020> round<00:01:05.080> and

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
religiously going round and round and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.030 
religiously going round and round and
round<00:01:05.620> and<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:08.170> think<00:01:08.380> it's<00:01:08.500> nice<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.920> feel

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
round and I think it's nice to feel

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.640 
round and I think it's nice to feel
hugged<00:01:09.460> by<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:10.150> plants<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.810> have<00:01:11.230> things<00:01:11.410> at

hugged by the plants and have things at

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.100 
hugged by the plants and have things at
a<00:01:11.770> low<00:01:12.610> level<00:01:12.640> where<00:01:13.330> they<00:01:13.450> can<00:01:13.480> really<00:01:13.810> sort

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
a low level where they can really sort

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.440 
a low level where they can really sort
of<00:01:14.200> getting<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.620> feel<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:14.890> touch<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.670> savor

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
of getting a feel and touch and savor

grazing<00:02:54.360> bar<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.870> idea<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.319> children<00:02:56.069> in

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
grazing bar the idea is that children in

a school might be able to pick and mix

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.530 
a school might be able to pick and mix
and<00:02:58.170> make<00:02:58.350> their<00:02:58.500> own<00:02:58.530> colorful<00:02:59.299> salads<00:03:00.299> a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
and make their own colorful salads a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.630 
and make their own colorful salads a
real<00:03:00.780> rainbow<00:03:01.019> effects<00:03:01.829> it's<00:03:02.100> having<00:03:02.220> that

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
real rainbow effects it's having that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.000 
real rainbow effects it's having that
sort<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.910> freedom<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.720> pop<00:03:04.200> things<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.709> here

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
sort of freedom to pop things in here

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.050
