into<00:05:24.840> a<00:05:24.990> plate<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.560> we're<00:05:25.920> going<00:05:26.040> to<00:05:26.070> do<00:05:26.220> the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
into a plate and we're going to do the

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.670 
into a plate and we're going to do the
same<00:05:26.400> thing<00:05:27.030> just<00:05:27.450> like<00:05:27.750> with<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.110> plate<00:05:28.440> um

same thing just like with a plate um
right<00:05:31.680> there<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.190> think<00:05:32.460> that's<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.880> scope<00:05:33.770> so

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
right there I think that's the scope so

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.950 
right there I think that's the scope so
I<00:05:35.100> think<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.520> omelet<00:05:36.000> just<00:05:36.420> like<00:05:36.570> we<00:05:36.810> did

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
I think the omelet just like we did

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.070 
I think the omelet just like we did
before<00:05:37.110> shaking<00:05:38.040> a<00:05:38.250> little<00:05:38.400> bit<00:05:38.610> maybe<00:05:39.510> stop

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
before shaking a little bit maybe stop

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.210 
before shaking a little bit maybe stop
and<00:05:40.440> just<00:05:40.470> slip<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.340> go<00:05:41.970> through<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.330> again<00:05:42.450> and

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
and just slip it go through it again and

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.290 
and just slip it go through it again and
there's<00:05:44.220> your<00:05:44.310> own<00:05:45.770> okay<00:05:46.820> you're<00:05:47.820> right<00:05:48.000> going

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
there's your own okay you're right going

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.100 
there's your own okay you're right going
I<00:05:49.550> think<00:05:50.550> that<00:05:50.670> after<00:05:50.790> training<00:05:51.360> it<00:05:51.660> you

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
I think that after training it you

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.870 
I think that after training it you
should<00:05:52.320> leave<00:05:52.470> it<00:05:52.530> for<00:05:52.800> like<00:05:52.950> seven<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.730> eight

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
should leave it for like seven to eight

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.150 
should leave it for like seven to eight
minutes<00:05:54.300> on<00:05:54.540> medium<00:05:55.110> low<00:05:55.320> high<00:05:55.650> heat<00:05:55.920> and

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160
