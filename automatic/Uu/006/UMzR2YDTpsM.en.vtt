sweet i'm not to and without doing this

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.940 
sweet i'm not to and without doing this
step<00:02:27.580> your<00:02:28.540> bars<00:02:28.780> would<00:02:29.019> come<00:02:29.230> right<00:02:29.440> off<00:02:29.470> and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
step your bars would come right off and

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.100 
step your bars would come right off and
it<00:02:30.370> would<00:02:30.640> not<00:02:30.670> work<00:02:32.459> so

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
it would not work so

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.530 
it would not work so
now<00:02:34.680> here<00:02:35.070> comes<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.520> step<00:02:35.820> where<00:02:36.300> you
