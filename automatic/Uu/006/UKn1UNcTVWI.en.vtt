00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
profit is going to be based on the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.430 
profit is going to be based on the
amount<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.300> capital<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.110> put<00:02:10.289> into

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
amount of capital that you put into

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320 
amount of capital that you put into
these<00:02:10.590> positions<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.430> all<00:02:11.640> positions<00:02:12.120> have

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
these positions now all positions have

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.850 
these positions now all positions have
risk<00:02:12.629> obviously<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.470> want<00:02:13.680> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
risk obviously and you want to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.590 
risk obviously and you want to
smart<00:02:14.190> allocation<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.820> capital<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.510> I'm

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
smart allocation of capital but I'm

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.440 
smart allocation of capital but I'm
beginning<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.990> build<00:02:16.260> my<00:02:16.470> positions<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:17.450> for

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
beginning to build my positions now for

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.170 
beginning to build my positions now for
the<00:02:18.720> June<00:02:18.900> expiration<00:02:19.680> every<00:02:19.980> month<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.700> just

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the June expiration every month I just

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.850 
the June expiration every month I just
closed<00:02:21.510> out<00:02:21.810> my<00:02:22.790> may<00:02:23.790> positions<00:02:24.630> now<00:02:25.590> we're

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
closed out my may positions now we're

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.550 
closed out my may positions now we're
rolling<00:02:26.040> those<00:02:26.460> into<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:26.970> June<00:02:27.840> positions

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
rolling those into the June positions

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.220 
rolling those into the June positions
and<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.940> every<00:02:30.300> month<00:02:30.630> you're<00:02:30.900> going<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.110> be

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
and so every month you're going to be

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.980 
and so every month you're going to be
doing<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.740> you're<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.160> be<00:02:32.990> investing

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
doing this you're going to be investing

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.350 
doing this you're going to be investing
you're<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.350> be<00:02:35.240> allocating<00:02:36.240> your

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
you're going to be allocating your

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.930 
you're going to be allocating your
capital<00:02:36.990> towards<00:02:37.530> some<00:02:37.860> initial<00:02:38.340> positions

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
capital towards some initial positions

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.380 
capital towards some initial positions
you<00:02:39.480> know<00:02:39.600> right<00:02:39.900> about<00:02:40.200> at<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.770> time<00:02:41.390> during

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
you know right about at this time during

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.890 
you know right about at this time during
that<00:02:42.720> week<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.290> expiration<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:45.330> it's<00:02:45.720> always

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
that week of expiration so it's always

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.930 
that week of expiration so it's always
good<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.350> know<00:02:46.620> exactly<00:02:46.800> when<00:02:47.400> your<00:02:47.550> options

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
good to know exactly when your options

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.730 
good to know exactly when your options
are<00:02:48.060> expiring<00:02:48.480> remember<00:02:48.930> they<00:02:49.050> expire<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
third Friday of each month so this is

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.360 
third Friday of each month so this is
the<00:02:53.640> time<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.450> put<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:54.780> positions<00:02:55.410> now<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.220> just

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
margin requirements and that is pretty

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.160 
margin requirements and that is pretty
low<00:03:25.049> right<00:03:25.320> now<00:03:25.470> i<00:03:25.680> will<00:03:26.720> eventually<00:03:27.720> bump

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
low right now i will eventually bump

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.259

additional positions but I stress

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.729 
additional positions but I stress
diversification<00:03:34.080> now<00:03:34.200> I've<00:03:34.320> got<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
diversification now I've got the

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.220 
diversification now I've got the
diamonds<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.430> IWM<00:03:36.330> attacks<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.870> spy

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
diamonds the IWM attacks and the spy

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.550 
diamonds the IWM attacks and the spy
which<00:03:37.560> are<00:03:37.709> all<00:03:37.890> indexes<00:03:38.840> okay<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:39.900> far

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
which are all indexes okay so far

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.470 
which are all indexes okay so far
because<00:03:40.920> those<00:03:41.430> are<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.730> options<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.180> i<00:03:42.299> can
