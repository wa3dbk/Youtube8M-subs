00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
 apply lightning face to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.730
 front side 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:10.759
 shelves and you see that I do not share 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.420
 lightning 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:17.160
 because right now it is very convenient 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.010
 fasten the zipper in such a way that 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.890
 picture we have with you match 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.880
 on the edge of the zipper i close attach it 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.199
 small pins 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:36.360
 and continue on exactly the same 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:39.320
 I follow this in order to draw on 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.789
 both shelves matched 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:49.730
 thus fastening all the zipper and how 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.730
 we always keep the product alive a little 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 so that when we can sew already 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:08.030
 the buckle we did not work that lightning 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:11.100
 there is no shaft after i connect 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:18.439
 lightning shelf 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:23.580
 I will definitely check if it matches 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:27.990
 drawing but I'll look at it on the face 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.680
 the side is not very comfortable to sew 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.439
 zipper if the edge of the product is decorated 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.799
 gum so in order to be comfortable 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.820
 It was sew on that everything was decided exactly I 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.909
 here now from koryu these two needles 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.750
 look I clearly once soared the whole 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.720
 rezinochka she will collect the product and 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.729
 the edge of the gum I very much inflamed 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.840
 to conveniently sew a zipper to 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:05.070
 everything was decided exactly and beautifully stabs 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.700
 stabbed back and looking at the front 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.819
 to the side 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.849
 Of course the lightning is not sewn yet, but you 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.970
 see that drawing 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.600
 coincide 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.900
 it remains the technical side to sew 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.730
 a zipper on a regular sewing machine for 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.820
 convenient to sew 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.450
 fastener I severed it and 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:31.020
 the dog took the fastener to the top 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.080
 so that it does not interfere with stitching for 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.400
 Sewing on the locks I use the usual 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.570
 sewing machine 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.860
 my case is one of the cheapest 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.270
 brother machines 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.300
 and I use the sewing foot 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:53.430
 lightning I got her position after 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.970
 how i sewed the first side and i 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:03.900
 I prefer to sew fasteners on top 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:10.550
 down the edge of the foot coincides with the edge 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.550
 zippers and lowering the foot and 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.750
 little by little neat simple straight 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:33.330
 line 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:35.930
 Sew this lock look to 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:49.760
 the canvas didn't leave me 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:49.760
 inward, if necessary, straighten it 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:05:23.640
 and neatly complete 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:26.820
 our operation is lifted as what 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.510
 powerful thread I often use threads 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.480
 for embroidery machines for the lower thread 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.700
 what to to because they are very thin and 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.680
 in this case, I used white 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.860
 a thread that is completely invisible on 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.010
 the canvas 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:49.020
 and now we tack 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:56.490
 and again on my canvas will be white 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:06:00.900
 thread change my foot is not my task 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:03.080
 just fasten the zipper with the purl 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.080
 parties 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:29.160
 and now our lightning is all sewn up 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:33.170
 from betting on and you see that even the difference 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:38.060
 in color already completely unnoticed because 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:41.730
 the tissues around for the screed are no longer visible and 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:45.540
 like this very quickly you can 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:48.810
 sew a zipper in the knitted fabric 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.440
 if you have bundled to your 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.700
 the car 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:58.320
 walking leg for knitwear such a foot 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:00.900
 make zippers even easier so 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.960
 how such legs hold well 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.690
 knitwear does not give him extra 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.200
 stretch and vice versa 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.200
 come to life
