00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.859 

the<00:01:14.310> church<00:01:14.610> has<00:01:14.790> become<00:01:15.119> far<00:01:15.330> more<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the church has become far more like the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.149 
the church has become far more like the
world<00:01:16.080> than<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> world's<00:01:16.650> become<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
world than the world's become like the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.820 
world than the world's become like the
church<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.540> life<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.470> gotten

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
church and so it's life that has gotten

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.850 
church and so it's life that has gotten
crazy<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.759> complex<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.990> has<00:01:22.320> moved<00:01:22.619> forward

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
crazy and complex and has moved forward

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.399 
crazy and complex and has moved forward
toward<00:01:23.580> complexity<00:01:24.299> we've<00:01:24.750> allowed<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
toward complexity we've allowed the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.990 
toward complexity we've allowed the
church<00:01:25.649> to<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> very<00:01:26.130> same<00:01:26.310> thing<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.880> have

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
church to do the very same thing we have

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210 
church to do the very same thing we have
followed<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.750> world<00:01:28.049> rather<00:01:28.680> than<00:01:28.890> saying

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
followed the world rather than saying

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.880 
followed the world rather than saying
you<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:29.610> there's<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> better<00:01:30.149> way<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
you know what there's a better way and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.130 
you know what there's a better way and
so<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.869> life<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.320> people<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.770> increasingly

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
so as life and people are increasingly

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.389 
so as life and people are increasingly
becoming<00:01:37.140> overwhelmed<00:01:37.799> by<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.159> things

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
becoming overwhelmed by all the things

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.090 
becoming overwhelmed by all the things
in<00:01:38.610> life<00:01:38.960> by<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> complexity<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.890> life

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
in life by the complexity that life

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.760 
in life by the complexity that life
faces<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> speed<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.509> changes<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
faces and the speed of changes as that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.649 
faces and the speed of changes as that
is<00:01:43.920> happening<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.789> to<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.090> someone<00:01:45.479> who

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
is happening we have to have someone who

00:01:45.659 --> 00:02:04.910 
is happening we have to have someone who
will<00:01:45.810> stand<00:01:46.050> up<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.470> simply<00:01:47.130> point

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.780 

I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
I

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.850 
I
