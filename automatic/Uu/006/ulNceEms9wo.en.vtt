00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
I should be about enough to get a scale

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.580 
I should be about enough to get a scale
I've<00:00:47.880> got<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> bottom<00:00:48.330> been<00:00:48.660> open<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.200> so

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
I've got the bottom been open here so

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.370

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.319 
that it's drawing properly and it's also
very<00:00:52.620> important<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.700> sure<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:54.180> your

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
very important to make sure that your

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.600 
very important to make sure that your
lids<00:00:54.510> off<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:55.260> rain<00:00:55.440> protector<00:00:55.980> otherwise<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
lids off the rain protector otherwise it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.710 
lids off the rain protector otherwise it

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
won't draw at all

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.620 
won't draw at all
I<00:00:58.190> prefer<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.460> matches<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.390> find

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
I prefer to use matches because I find

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.399 
I prefer to use matches because I find
that<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.400> most<00:01:02.400> painful<00:01:02.610> on<00:01:03.000> my<00:01:03.120> thumb<00:01:03.409> when

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that the most painful on my thumb when

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.120 
that the most painful on my thumb when
lighting<00:01:04.649> then<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.460> normal<00:01:06.000> lighter<00:01:07.070> also<00:01:08.070> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
lighting then a normal lighter also you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.440 
lighting then a normal lighter also you
have<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.520> advantage<00:01:08.759> of<00:01:09.030> being<00:01:09.180> able<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
have the advantage of being able to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.590 
have the advantage of being able to
throw<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> matches<00:01:10.259> where<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.590> need<00:01:10.770> them

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.109 

just<00:01:18.200> light<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:18.409> in<00:01:18.619> a<00:01:18.740> few<00:01:18.950> different<00:01:19.040> places

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.300 

gets<00:01:23.119> going<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:24.790> we'll<00:01:25.790> just<00:01:25.970> watch<00:01:26.180> that

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
gets going and we'll just watch that

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:48.469 
gets going and we'll just watch that
gradually<00:01:28.310> take

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.450 

see<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> fire<00:01:49.619> started<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:50.220> spread
