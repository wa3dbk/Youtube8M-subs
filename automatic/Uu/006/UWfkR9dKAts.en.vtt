00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:14.620
 tries with footprints saw frustrated 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:17.080
 new exploration of the reader we are going to 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.100
 I was educated here in England. 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.100
 How are you? 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.590
 reading 75 vote with history 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.890
 recent 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.419
 I was already launched by the site and 2006 may 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.230
 brag about having one of the best 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.450
 performances in having 600 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.280
 the difference of the aperture that she uses 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.270
 three-cylinder in-line engine to the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.370
 did in four 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.010
 how competitors make it have 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.020
 lots of history and one medium speeds 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.090
 motorcycle 600cc and four 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.879
 People need to take a spin. 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.020
 to 10 mm for quick response 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.430
 of the engine 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.800
 in this case you can not work 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.710
 in a more comfortable way by placing 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.030
 45 rpm if you already have a strength to have 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.030
 a satisfactory resumption 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.570
 it should be compacted is the change of 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.970
 reading is very fast. 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.520
 why motorcycle shineray in braking 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.010
 it slows down too easily you enter 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.720
 in a curve music of the assembly spent 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:27.130
 ball pleases 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.130
 imagine sports 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.750
 the reader well army r 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.820
 she has this pearly white look with 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.420
 green details and fiber finish 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.060
 carbon black already comes embedded in 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.020
 likes are lights captain all the time right 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.789
 to change gears 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:55.850
 I do not need to lose attention by looking 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:57.530
 the panel a lot more exchange with the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.009
 front suspension that has more 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.659
 with the brake caliper 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.549
 monoblock with much higher performance 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.830
 to the original models are here 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:13.610
 any pilot would like to have in his 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:15.380
 bike to turn more time on the track but 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.650
 I thought that only the energy part was left 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.769
 and with that the speed in the curve is greater 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.849
 the beast reader yes because only 160 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.819
 lightweight engine 125 develops kg 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.069
 horsepower with low weight in the 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.760
 track has a very quick response to it. 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.760
 quite surprised 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.769
 it's known outside 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.769
 Arrives in Brazil next year.
