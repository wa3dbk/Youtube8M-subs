00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
budget of this to $300 for a couple of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.030 
budget of this to $300 for a couple of
reasons<00:01:22.670> one<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.690> wanted<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.410> be<00:01:24.560> below<00:01:25.010> the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
reasons one I wanted it to be below the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.639 
reasons one I wanted it to be below the
price<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.759> console<00:01:26.390> because<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:26.990> was<00:01:27.320> going

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
price of a console because I was going

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.830 
price of a console because I was going
to<00:01:27.770> be<00:01:27.860> using<00:01:28.250> used<00:01:28.490> parts<00:01:28.940> so<00:01:29.180> I'd<00:01:29.509> imagine

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
to be using used parts so I'd imagine

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.469 
to be using used parts so I'd imagine
that<00:01:30.410> getting<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.890> used<00:01:31.130> console<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:32.060> did<00:01:32.270> some

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
that getting a used console I did some

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.090 
that getting a used console I did some
research<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:33.140> about<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.560> cheapest<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.070> can

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
research and about the cheapest you can

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.020 
research and about the cheapest you can
get<00:01:34.399> it<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.670> around<00:01:35.440> $325<00:01:36.440> so<00:01:36.729> $300<00:01:37.729> seemed

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
get it is around $325 so $300 seemed

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.090 
get it is around $325 so $300 seemed
like<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.420> good<00:01:38.660> price<00:01:38.960> point<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.560> parts<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:39.950> I

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
like a good price point the parts that I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.730 
like a good price point the parts that I
chose<00:01:40.460> were<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:40.820> combination<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.720> new<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.380> used

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.229 
RAM I went with six gigs of crucial Ram
it's<00:02:52.459> 1333<00:02:53.450> megahertz<00:02:53.930> ddr3<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:55.100> really<00:02:55.970> I

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
it's 1333 megahertz ddr3 and really I

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.390 
it's 1333 megahertz ddr3 and really I
skimmed<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.049> little<00:02:57.320> bit<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.650> could<00:02:57.739> have<00:02:58.250> went

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
skimmed a little bit I could have went

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.270 
skimmed a little bit I could have went
for<00:02:58.670> eight<00:02:58.940> gigs<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.630> skimped<00:03:00.200> se<00:03:00.650> spent<00:03:01.130> less

for eight gigs and skimped se spent less

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.890 
for eight gigs and skimped se spent less
money<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.760> case<00:03:02.090> which<00:03:02.329> probably<00:03:02.780> would

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
money in the case which probably would

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.210 
money in the case which probably would
have<00:03:02.989> been<00:03:03.169> better<00:03:03.230> giving<00:03:03.889> you<00:03:03.980> more

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
have been better giving you more

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.550 
have been better giving you more
performance<00:03:04.880> but<00:03:05.419> six<00:03:05.690> gigs<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:06.260> real

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
performance but six gigs is real

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.140 
performance but six gigs is real
gonna<00:03:06.739> be<00:03:06.920> enough<00:03:07.220> for<00:03:07.430> most<00:03:07.610> modern<00:03:08.090> games

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
gonna be enough for most modern games

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.330 
gonna be enough for most modern games
and<00:03:08.660> as<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:09.020> could<00:03:09.080> tell<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.680> really<00:03:09.890> didn't

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
and as I could tell it really didn't

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.940 
and as I could tell it really didn't
hold<00:03:10.640> me<00:03:10.849> back<00:03:11.060> at<00:03:11.239> all<00:03:11.390> during<00:03:11.690> my<00:03:12.020> gaming<00:03:12.770> I
