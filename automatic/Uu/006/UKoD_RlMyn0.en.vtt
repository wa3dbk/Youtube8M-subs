00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
binder so what I'm going to do is cut

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870 
binder so what I'm going to do is cut
out<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.899> binding<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:50.100> slice<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> paper

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
out the binding and then slice the paper

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.490 
out the binding and then slice the paper
down<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> middle<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:53.869> possibly<00:01:54.869> possibly

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
down the middle and possibly possibly

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.800 
down the middle and possibly possibly
trim<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> little<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.670> protrudes<00:01:57.570> past

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
trim it a little if it protrudes past

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170 
trim it a little if it protrudes past
the<00:01:58.170> edge<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.439> note<00:01:58.560> binder<00:01:59.149> obviously<00:02:00.149> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the edge of the note binder obviously I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.039 
the edge of the note binder obviously I
would<00:02:00.270> also<00:02:00.390> through<00:02:00.659> hell<00:02:00.780> punch<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:03.049> anyway

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
would also through hell punch it anyway

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.380 
would also through hell punch it anyway
that's<00:02:04.560> my<00:02:04.770> idea<00:02:05.070> how<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.369> refill<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that's my idea how to refill it up the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.380 
that's my idea how to refill it up the
nine<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> half<00:02:06.840> by<00:02:07.140> six<00:02:07.170> note<00:02:07.619> binder<00:02:08.390> but
