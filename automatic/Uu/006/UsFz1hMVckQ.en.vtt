where<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.760> breeds<00:00:45.030> at

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
where it you know because it breeds at

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.450 
where it you know because it breeds at
the<00:00:45.360> surface<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.989> comes<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.500> air<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.010> if

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the surface it comes up for air and if

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.630 
the surface it comes up for air and if
the<00:00:47.610> filter<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.090> moving<00:00:48.719> ripples<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.649> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the filter is moving ripples and it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
the filter is moving ripples and it
tries<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.879> come<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.360> wha<00:00:51.750> air<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.590> it's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
tries to come up for wha air and it's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.060 
tries to come up for wha air and it's
getting<00:00:53.340> all<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.699> wavy<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.870> water<00:00:55.199> that's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
getting all this wavy like water that's

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
getting all this wavy like water that's
got<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.460> knowing<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.420> know<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:57.899> I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
got to be knowing you know because I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.610 
got to be knowing you know because I
don't<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.309> if<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.440> what

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
don't know if if if you just think what

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
don't know if if if you just think what
actually<00:01:01.980> being<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> fish<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.969> kind

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
actually being the fish I know it's kind

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.210 
actually being the fish I know it's kind
of<00:01:03.180> weird<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.930> come<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.559> water<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
of weird but you come up for water and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.969 
of weird but you come up for water and
it's<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.519> wavy<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.150> uh<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.320> don't<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.920> just

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it's all wavy and uh I just don't I just

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.609 
it's all wavy and uh I just don't I just
think<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> betta<00:01:08.820> fish<00:01:08.939> prefers<00:01:09.689> still<00:01:10.290> water

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
think the betta fish prefers still water

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.380 
think the betta fish prefers still water
and<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.760> how<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and that's just how it is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
and that's just how it is
I've<00:01:12.479> always<00:01:12.780> had<00:01:12.990> great<00:01:13.470> luck<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.040> used<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I've always had great luck I used to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.940 
I've always had great luck I used to
have<00:01:14.400> filters<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.990> came<00:01:16.380> across<00:01:16.710> some

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
have filters and I I came across some

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.770 
have filters and I I came across some
great<00:01:17.280> information<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.330> day<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.689> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
great information on that one day and I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200 
great information on that one day and I
just<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.130> idea<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> filter<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> it's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
just I can the idea of a filter and it's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.469 
just I can the idea of a filter and it's
been<00:01:21.479> awesome<00:01:21.780> ever<00:01:22.140> since<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.680> uh<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.970> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
been awesome ever since so uh but if you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.760 
been awesome ever since so uh but if you
have<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> five<00:01:24.840> gallon<00:01:24.990> aquarium<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
have a five gallon aquarium and you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.679 
have a five gallon aquarium and you
don't<00:01:26.009> keep<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.340> water<00:01:26.759> changes<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.420> most

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
don't keep up water changes like most

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.859 
don't keep up water changes like most
people<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.229> um<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:30.270> need<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.659> need<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
people don't um you need you need a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.069 
people don't um you need you need a
filter<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.619> uh<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.210> some<00:01:33.210> ideas<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.689> cut<00:01:33.869> down

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
filter so uh and some ideas to cut down

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.230 
filter so uh and some ideas to cut down
on<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.320> water<00:01:34.710> movement<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> surface

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
on that water movement of the surface

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.390 
on that water movement of the surface
water<00:01:36.420> movement<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.990> would<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.350> maybe<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
water movement I would just maybe you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.660 
water movement I would just maybe you
can<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.960> create<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> little<00:01:40.799> path<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.549> where

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
can put up create a little path to where

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.310 
can put up create a little path to where
the<00:01:41.820> water<00:01:42.000> comes<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> filter<00:01:43.079> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the water comes out of the filter and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
the water comes out of the filter and
kind<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.070> runs<00:01:44.369> onto<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> pad<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.270> kind

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
kind of just runs onto the pad and kind

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.319 
kind of just runs onto the pad and kind
of<00:01:45.720> dilutes<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> current<00:01:46.799> sort<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.250> say<00:01:47.399> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
of dilutes the current sort of say so
