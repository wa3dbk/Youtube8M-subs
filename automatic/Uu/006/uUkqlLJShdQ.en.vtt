00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 all right 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.480
 Welcome to online drawing today 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.639
 we will draw a figure walking in 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.280
 view of caterpillars or when the camera is 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.139
 came from below this class is like a 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.689
 combination of various classes that before 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.790
 we have seen the drawing of the figure in 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.800
 caterpillar view the body turning and 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.380
 walking and the drawing of the figure 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.529
 female with posture if you check these 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.059
 classes you will understand today's class better 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.610
 to begin remember a simple 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.920
 principle the figure of total front as 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.829
 it is constituted by forms and 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.629
 fundamental measures in this case is 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.449
 visible that the body of the figure has 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.660
 as the shape of a blender to which 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.309
 the head and limbs are added 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.859
 the part of the head plus the neck 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.659
 They have a similar extent to the body and 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.269
 the body measures something similar to the 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.300
 pelvic box as seen in the measurements 1 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.449
 2 and 3 in each of these measures 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 we draw an ellipse a wide one for 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.609
 hips almost round a vertical ellipse 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.020
 for the entire second section and the ellipse 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.969
 of the head with the neck 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.250
 now we draw the girl in view of 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.920
 caterpillar we draw for it a circle 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.570
 for the part of the hips 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.390
 then we draw as before an ellipse 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.149
 vertical for the body but this ellipse 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.219
 invades the first ellipse measures less 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.500
 that the first ellipse as seen in 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.579
 Measure 2 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.890
 finally we draw the head and the 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.500
 neck its size is smaller than the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.200
 measure 2 how can you see the ellipses of 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.520
 the right have very different sizes 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.440
 while the ellipses on the left 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.810
 they have very similar sizes 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.750
 now we will tilt a bit the ellipse of 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.870
 body as the arrows mark 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.700
 after 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.740
 we tilt the box ellipse a bit 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.230
 pelvic in the direction again of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.450
 the arrows as you can see we look for 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.760
 this side of the body is very marked 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.680
 waist as marked by the arrow and 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.170
 another side of the body the waist is almost 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.060
 common straight is also marked by the arrow or 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.150
 be that the hip is thrown towards this 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.580
 side in green we mark the turn of 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.680
 the rib cage to the left the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.890
 turn of the pelvic box to the right 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.450
 that is to say in the opposite direction also 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.950
 we turn our heads a little 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.410
 opposite direction the body as 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.270
 mark the date if we follow the lines 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.110
 central ellipses you get a 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.090
 aesthetic line with curves 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.310
 we return to the figure in caterpillar view 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.770
 we place inclined arrows on the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.690
 body in pink as we did 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.090
 in the other figure and arrows in 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.800
 opposite inclination for the hip 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.390
 again we seek that on this side the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.760
 waist is marked as marked by 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.500
 arrow and this other side does not mark the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.840
 waist but follow the shape almost 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.030
 straight arrow 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.160
 we draw a green centerline to 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.930
 the body to the left a line 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.330
 central to the pelvis to the right 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.120
 and an address for the head towards the 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.980
 right as we did before so 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.780
 that the directions change the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.340
 difference of the normal figure each 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.680
 of these ellipses you can see the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.230
 bottom part like the shaded ones in 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.819
 red this is very important to have it in 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.920
 mind 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.510
 the inclined dotted lines and the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.370
 green center lines serve as 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.950
 reference to place correctly 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.019
 the elements of the body under the ellipse 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.410
 of the body we put a curved line that 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.420
 it is the hollow of the rib cage 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.160
 the curved line at the top of the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.860
 hip circle is the line 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.590
 abdominal that is below the navel the 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.840
 line that we commonly call tummy like 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.700
 it looks to the right when joining these two 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.920
 curved lines we will get the limits 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.720
 of the abdomen the inclined lines we 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.520
 they also serve to draw the principle 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.640
 of the legs and help us to place 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.520
 correctly the chest so we finish what 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.830
 most important of the body we return to 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.270
 the drug sight to do the same in 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.250
 the lower part of the rib cage 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.380
 we draw a curved line for the hole 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.940
 of the rib cage and another curved line 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.430
 for the top of the box 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.470
 pelvic when joining them we have the area 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.090
 abdominal using the lines of 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.650
 reference roses we draw lines 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.930
 dotted for the beginning of the legs 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.390
 and a dotted reference line for 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.160
 draw the chest the top part of the 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.710
 chest reaches to the top of 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.740
 the rib cage this is very different to 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.600
 the figure on the left 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.070
 in red we draw the base 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.920
 skeleton for the arms and 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.989
 legs the hip leg that is 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.060
 raised is drawn in front of the other 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.680
 indicating that it takes a step forward 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.590
 finally in blue we fill in the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.420
 arms and only remains to detail this figure 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.670
 front is easier to draw than the 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.790
 that has a doubt but how can you 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.080
 see is drawn in a very similar way 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.120
 we return to the figure in sight draws and 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.430
 we draw the inclined clavicles towards 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.380
 down from the end of the 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.270
 clavicles we trace in dotted form 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.610
 the arms using the inclined lines 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.490
 of the body as a reference for drawing 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.380
 the point of the elbows we double the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.090
 arms for which we use again the 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.529
 tilt of the reference lines 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.599
 of the body 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.849
 we draw the right leg in front of the 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.149
 left is the leg that is 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.469
 taking the step and the other leg from behind 

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:03.149
 fill the arms looking for the 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.639
 arm that comes to us be more 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:07.679
 wide we add this small section of the 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.539
 body that is a muscle of the back and 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:11.400
 we trace this part of the body in shape 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.110
 stepped 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.120
 and we draw the abdominal muscles 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.979
 following the reference lines 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.020
 we draw the details of the face 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.460
 which we do not explain because we saw them in 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.860
 a previous class as seen in 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.599
 screen and in the description 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.310
 we also detail the hands a little 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.770
 noting that the hand that is in 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.539
 foreground is bigger and thicker and the 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.980
 hand in the background is smaller and 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.620
 thin 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.500
 we have already finished this figure so 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.600
 we started to draw clothes the part of 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.150
 down the skirt originates something like 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.710
 the shape of a palette of an armchair by 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.290
 Because of the leg that about 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.000
 we also draw some 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.070
 folds in the waist by the turn of the 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.070
 body and other folds that follow the 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.720
 shape of the legs on the skirt 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.000
 then we redefined the folds of the 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.820
 making them more casual and so 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.320
 we finish this drawing we started it to 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.750
 clean in order to get a very line 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.610
 thin and clean as we used to and 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.620
 we started to color procuring now 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.600
 yes do everything with cleanliness and patience 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.580
 well in the forest when we can give the 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.380
 luxury of plotting something quickly and 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.750
 even with dirt, it's just the 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.670
 sketch and we can make mistakes 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.920
 correct change a limb and so on 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.170
 but in detail we look for cleaning 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.940
 detail and patience in the time of 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.580
 change the drawing but leave it as 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.990
 awesome possible we hope as 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.760
 always this class helps you understand 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.070
 better the human figure and the drawing in 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.140
 general if you liked the video do not stop 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.550
 comment it like and share it with 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.600
 your friends who like to draw 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.600
 until next time
