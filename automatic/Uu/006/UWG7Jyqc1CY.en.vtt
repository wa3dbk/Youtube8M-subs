the answer is Voyager one a probe that
was<00:00:14.580> sent<00:00:14.880> away<00:00:15.059> from<00:00:15.599> Earth

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
was sent away from Earth

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.290 
was sent away from Earth
34<00:00:16.800> years<00:00:17.070> ago<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.609> has<00:00:17.730> been<00:00:17.910> traveling

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
34 years ago and it has been traveling

34 years ago and it has been traveling
away<00:00:18.390> from<00:00:18.539> us<00:00:18.869> ever<00:00:19.109> since<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.160> fact<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.910> is

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
away from us ever since in fact it is

from the Sun now I did a video on Vsauce
a<00:00:27.029> while<00:00:27.330> back<00:00:27.570> about<00:00:27.810> what<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.320> put<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
a while back about what we put on that

fantastic question if you were to build
a<00:01:08.220> giant<00:01:08.790> mirror<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:09.960> fly<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.350> into

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
a giant mirror and then fly it into

a giant mirror and then fly it into
outer<00:01:10.770> space<00:01:11.150> light-years<00:01:12.150> away<00:01:12.330> would<00:01:13.140> you

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
outer space light-years away would you

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.770 
outer space light-years away would you
be<00:01:13.409> able<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> take<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> giant<00:01:14.460> telescope<00:01:14.760> aim<00:01:15.509> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
be able to take a giant telescope aim it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.530 
be able to take a giant telescope aim it
at<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> mirror<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:17.280> yourself<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
at the mirror and see yourself in the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.200 
at the mirror and see yourself in the
past<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.170> order<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.130> something<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:20.729> small

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
past in order to see something as small

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.780 
past in order to see something as small
as<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.720> flag<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.290> moon<00:01:22.409> from<00:01:23.009> Earth<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
as the flag on the moon from Earth you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.120 
as the flag on the moon from Earth you
would<00:01:23.909> need<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.210> an<00:01:24.420> optical<00:01:24.930> telescope

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
would need to have an optical telescope

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.700 
would need to have an optical telescope
more<00:01:26.130> than<00:01:26.280> three<00:01:26.759> miles<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.869> diameter

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
more than three miles in diameter

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.850 
more than three miles in diameter
now<00:01:29.189> that's<00:01:30.049> implausibly<00:01:31.049> huge<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.710> let's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
now that's implausibly huge but let's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.230 
now that's implausibly huge but let's
just<00:01:31.979> go<00:01:32.100> ahead<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> imagine<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.119> were

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
just go ahead and imagine that we were

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.080 
just go ahead and imagine that we were
able<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> make<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.900> telescope<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:35.460> size<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
able to make a telescope the size of the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.990 
able to make a telescope the size of the
solar<00:01:36.390> system<00:01:36.960> okay<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.950> let's<00:01:38.520> take<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> look

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
solar system okay now let's take a look

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.940 
solar system okay now let's take a look
at<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> mirror<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:39.900> two<00:01:40.259> light-years<00:01:40.560> away

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
at a mirror that's two light-years away

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.780 
at a mirror that's two light-years away
and<00:01:41.250> try<00:01:41.820> our<00:01:41.970> best<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.360> resolve<00:01:42.840> its<00:01:43.049> picture

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
and try our best to resolve its picture

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
and try our best to resolve its picture
this<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.970> where<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.180> run<00:01:45.329> into<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> problem<00:01:46.200> from

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
this is where we run into a problem from

this is where we run into a problem from
light-years<00:01:47.280> away<00:01:47.490> earth<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.270> appear

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
light-years away earth would appear

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.539 
light-years away earth would appear
incredibly<00:01:49.110> dim<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.860> instance<00:01:50.159> this

Bear<00:02:39.820> Grylls<00:02:39.900> would<00:02:40.900> survive<00:02:41.380> in<00:02:41.590> space<00:02:41.920> while

Bear Grylls would survive in space while

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.330 
Bear Grylls would survive in space while
there<00:02:43.000> would<00:02:43.600> he<00:02:43.750> be<00:02:43.900> able<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.320> drink<00:02:44.709> his<00:02:45.190> own

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
there would he be able to drink his own

there would he be able to drink his own
urine<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.630> where<00:02:46.780> things<00:02:46.930> get

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
urine this is where things get

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.260 
urine this is where things get
interesting<00:02:47.260> because<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.430> space<00:02:48.760> there's<00:02:49.209> a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
interesting because in space there's a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.390 
interesting because in space there's a
lack<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.510> air<00:02:49.990> pressure<00:02:50.440> which<00:02:50.980> means<00:02:51.010> that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
lack of air pressure which means that

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.000 
lack of air pressure which means that
liquids<00:02:51.820> are<00:02:51.970> gonna<00:02:52.150> vaporize<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:53.800> also

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
liquids are gonna vaporize but it's also

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.550 
liquids are gonna vaporize but it's also
really<00:02:54.610> really<00:02:54.820> cold<00:02:55.480> which<00:02:56.080> means<00:02:56.350> that

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
really really cold which means that

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.770 
really really cold which means that
liquid<00:02:57.100> water<00:02:57.430> or<00:02:57.550> urine<00:02:58.090> should<00:02:58.120> turn<00:02:58.540> into<00:02:58.690> a

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
liquid water or urine should turn into a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.860 
liquid water or urine should turn into a
solid<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.830> what<00:03:00.190> happens<00:03:00.580> when<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.150> take<00:03:01.840> a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
solid so what happens when you take a

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.620 
solid so what happens when you take a
leak<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.380> space<00:03:02.739> would<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.520> paper<00:03:04.060> eyes<00:03:04.330> or

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
leak in space would it paper eyes or

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.410 
leak in space would it paper eyes or
turn<00:03:04.690> into<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.200> solid<00:03:05.500> well<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.920> turns<00:03:06.190> out<00:03:06.430> it

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
turn into a solid well it turns out it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.990 
turn into a solid well it turns out it
does<00:03:07.690> both<00:03:07.930> that's<00:03:08.709> right<00:03:08.950> when<00:03:09.580> astronauts

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
does both that's right when astronauts

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.640 
does both that's right when astronauts
had<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.360> do<00:03:10.480> urine<00:03:10.870> dumps<00:03:11.170> out<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.500> their

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
had to do urine dumps out of their

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.880 
had to do urine dumps out of their
vehicles<00:03:12.100> while<00:03:12.670> traveling<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.600> urine<00:03:14.590> would

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
vehicles while traveling the urine would

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.670 
vehicles while traveling the urine would
leave<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.459> ship<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.940> immediately<00:03:16.720> vaporize

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
leave the ship and immediately vaporize

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.910 
leave the ship and immediately vaporize
but<00:03:18.310> then<00:03:18.549> almost<00:03:19.110> immediately<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.530> would<00:03:20.739> do

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
but then almost immediately it would do

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.400 
but then almost immediately it would do
what<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.190> called<00:03:21.430> d<00:03:21.850> sublimate<00:03:22.660> which<00:03:23.049> is<00:03:23.200> when

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
what is called d sublimate which is when

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.770 
what is called d sublimate which is when
a<00:03:23.560> gas<00:03:23.920> turns<00:03:24.549> directly<00:03:24.850> into<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.269> solid
