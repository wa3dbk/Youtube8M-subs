00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 good evening good morning or good 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.750
 noon depending on when you use this 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.139
 Battlefield 3 comments in the team 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.940
 Deathmatch on island taxis have fun with 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.469
 The gameplay is not very good 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.099
 just like I play like that when I play 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.020
 games 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.330
 But it should not be about that today either 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.400
 go gameplay but facebook 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.189
 he is such a thing on facebook 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.130
 Actually everyone knows that everyone knows 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.359
 what is meant by that and everyone has that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.949
 also determined sometime 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.320
 used the question is now natural 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.969
 it still really uses more and who else 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.430
 really does not use it anymore 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.770
 At least that's how it is with me 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.870
 Most of my friends with those 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.940
 I have much to do and so the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 actually no longer use and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.899
 somehow never used correctly 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.879
 that was cool but that was more after 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.670
 SchÃ¼lervz with us at least again 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.579
 over and all the pages there 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.770
 always post fantastic and so is too 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.809
 Cool for distraction if you have nothing 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.940
 better to do but actually see 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.469
 I do not really like that for facebook anymore 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.910
 you can look forward to a future in 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.360
 to write the comments 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.420
 what you think about it but if facebook 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.010
 do it now as it is then 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.650
 you just realize that it is not anymore 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.600
 people no longer interested in clear 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.930
 Anyone interested will still see because 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.310
 at least facebook keeps opening up 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.500
 you hear that over and over again 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.689
 know what in the media what facebook then 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.299
 has done so bad but I believe 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.189
 the time has come slowly that has yes 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.750
 facebook even recognized where you are 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.890
 have to change something around 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.630
 to be able to keep up 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.850
 the new video platform now 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.950
 was announced is slowly starting 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.170
 I'm curious how it will be there then 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.700
 if then youtube and facebook so 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.930
 little bit of competition 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.579
 deliver or not 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.829
 I will maybe try it 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.079
 but honestly on facebook 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.520
 not really the people you are 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.829
 can reach on youtube 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.990
 at least for the content that I do 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.030
 with my channel of course I have too 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.159
 the facebook page where I go now and then 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.770
 what poste and still see that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.899
 so and so many thousand people but everything 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.939
 has become a bit inactive 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.280
 in that facebook now whats app 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.709
 has bought is indeed something again 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.569
 You also have to say the company 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.950
 on facebook 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.409
 will not go broke but the website 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.549
 facebook.com in the next few years 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.680
 actually almost dead for me 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.519
 there are a few now 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.230
 revival experiments as I said 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.219
 but yes, but what do they want? 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.829
 make it big 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.469
 on the contrary, I think google does 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.480
 somehow much right in the moment too 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.340
 with google + and so they have become 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.680
 dare to try it out everyone has 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.209
 said that it shit because what the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.079
 Chancellor not just something people 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.209
 imposition 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.500
 even if she's good or not me 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.340
 I do not know if it's good or not 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.730
 never used 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.609
 but google is therefore of the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.049
 Intermediate has said okay 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.810
 we solve that a bit again 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.030
 youtube with the google + link 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.430
 I wonder how that will be if that 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.019
 All then in the end but better again 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.989
 But I will know again from 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.449
 I actually wanted to talk about 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.590
 facebook talk yes facebook there you can 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.569
 not much to say 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.909
 actually everything was said writes 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.389
 again in the comments what you to it 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.220
 still have or what you think of it 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.829
 you still use facebook and i use it 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.590
 stop as I said only to things 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.299
 post for youtube and if i look 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.829
 really nothing better comes up 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.900
 what I could do 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.159
 then maybe I'll go there again 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.439
 it or 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.479
 I do not want to be there so soon 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:38.239
 the actual topic of talking over 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:41.269
 you know what i mean facebook death yes 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.220
 no in my eyes just so again 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.220
 try somehow to break in 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.530
 but if the work will see 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.840
 We then went to the next one I think 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.090
 the next two years I'm not two 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.090
 I'm curious if this video in two 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.129
 three years still there is here so that 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.739
 Nothing is or will not become one today 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:04.479
 then see and yes we will hear each other 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.479
 next video until next time
