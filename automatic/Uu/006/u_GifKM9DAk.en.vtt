that linebacker can jump in the throwing

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.659 
that linebacker can jump in the throwing
lane<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.380> he<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.799> quarterback<00:04:22.250> won't<00:04:22.460> take<00:04:22.639> a

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
lane so he the quarterback won't take a

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.950 
lane so he the quarterback won't take a
cross<00:04:23.000> over<00:04:23.210> he's<00:04:23.449> going<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.660> throw<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.900> a

cross over he's going to throw it a

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.480 
cross over he's going to throw it a
little<00:04:24.080> bit<00:04:24.259> early<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.740> need<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.039> catch<00:04:25.250> that

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
little bit early you need to catch that

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.670 
little bit early you need to catch that
ball<00:04:25.729> at<00:04:25.970> about<00:04:26.300> eight<00:04:26.539> yards<00:04:26.870> not<00:04:27.259> 12<00:04:29.680> now

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
ball at about eight yards not 12 now

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.839 
ball at about eight yards not 12 now
let's<00:04:30.860> see<00:04:30.979> what<00:04:31.099> it<00:04:31.190> looks<00:04:31.220> like<00:04:31.520> from<00:04:31.729> the

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
let's see what it looks like from the

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.560 
let's see what it looks like from the
quarterbacks<00:04:32.389> view<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.940> linebackers

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
quarterbacks view that linebackers

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.240 
quarterbacks view that linebackers
inside<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.229> number<00:04:36.500> two<00:04:36.650> receiver<00:04:36.830> so

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
inside the number two receiver so

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.150 
inside the number two receiver so
automatically<00:04:37.820> he's<00:04:38.030> going<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.240> go<00:04:38.360> outside

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
automatically he's going to go outside

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.939 
automatically he's going to go outside
see<00:04:40.160> if<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.400> don't<00:04:40.610> throw<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.360> early<00:04:41.949> that

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
see if you don't throw it early that

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.710 
see if you don't throw it early that
linebacker<00:04:43.220> can<00:04:43.729> still<00:04:43.970> get<00:04:44.120> in<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.270> passing

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
linebacker can still get in the passing

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.510 
linebacker can still get in the passing
lane<00:04:44.870> that's<00:04:45.169> why<00:04:45.440> it's<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.680> 3-step<00:04:46.099> drop<00:04:46.130> but

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
lane that's why it's a 3-step drop but

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.420 
lane that's why it's a 3-step drop but
we're<00:04:46.639> not<00:04:46.729> crossing<00:04:47.030> over<00:04:48.130> here's<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.190> picture

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430

scrimmage when our back goes in motion

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.070 
scrimmage when our back goes in motion
it<00:05:34.699> might<00:05:34.849> give<00:05:35.000> us<00:05:35.030> a<00:05:35.210> better<00:05:35.240> idea<00:05:35.449> what<00:05:35.960> he's

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
it might give us a better idea what he's

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.520 
it might give us a better idea what he's
going<00:05:36.199> to<00:05:36.259> do

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.370

you see how he starts to kick out and

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.170 
you see how he starts to kick out and

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
then our stick routes open now our

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.670 
then our stick routes open now our
receiver<00:05:47.690> didn't<00:05:48.020> run<00:05:48.140> the<00:05:48.170> stick<00:05:48.470> route

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.230 
receiver didn't run the stick route
right<00:05:48.890> that's<00:05:49.370> going<00:05:49.550> to<00:05:49.610> be<00:05:49.730> a<00:05:49.760> four<00:05:50.120> to<00:05:50.210> six

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240

right that's going to be a four to six
yard<00:05:50.750> route<00:05:50.990> but<00:05:51.710> this<00:05:51.860> is<00:05:52.010> early<00:05:52.280> in<00:05:52.310> the

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
yard route but this is early in the

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.040 
yard route but this is early in the
season<00:05:52.520> and<00:05:53.150> he's<00:05:53.300> not<00:05:53.480> really<00:05:53.780> used<00:05:53.960> to

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.680 
season and he's not really used to
playing<00:05:57.700> but<00:05:58.700> it<00:05:58.790> was<00:05:58.910> an<00:05:59.000> excellent<00:05:59.270> read<00:05:59.540> by

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
playing but it was an excellent read by

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.970 
playing but it was an excellent read by
the<00:05:59.750> quarterback

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.170
