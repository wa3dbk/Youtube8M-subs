00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
that's not actually the main reason

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.260 
that's not actually the main reason
people<00:00:34.630> really<00:00:35.079> kill<00:00:35.530> them<00:00:35.680> a<00:00:36.060> lot<00:00:37.060> of<00:00:37.120> people

chance<00:00:39.579> but<00:00:39.790> I<00:00:39.820> think<00:00:40.000> these<00:00:40.090> are<00:00:40.149> actually

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
chance but I think these are actually

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.170 
chance but I think these are actually
even<00:00:41.110> faster<00:00:41.530> dope<00:00:42.460> probably<00:00:42.910> don't<00:00:43.030> want<00:00:43.150> to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
even faster dope probably don't want to

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.520 
even faster dope probably don't want to

Crimson's<00:00:46.720> in<00:00:46.870> game<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:47.500> you<00:00:48.160> know<00:00:48.250> I'm

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
Crimson's in game so you know I'm

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.210

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.470 
running with that I'm going for it and
just<00:00:51.220> out<00:00:51.340> of<00:00:51.460> sheer<00:00:51.580> laziness<00:00:51.790> really<00:00:52.360> I

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
just out of sheer laziness really I

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.850

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
blades and although they are actually

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.999

untradeable<00:01:07.479> you<00:01:08.140> get<00:01:08.320> loads<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.740> loads<00:01:08.799> of

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
untradeable you get loads and loads of

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.410 
untradeable you get loads and loads of
them<00:01:09.159> and<00:01:09.310> so<00:01:09.369> I<00:01:09.400> started<00:01:09.909> telling<00:01:10.090> them<00:01:10.390> to

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420

them and so I started telling them to
the<00:01:10.570> bank<00:01:10.750> because<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.110> thought<00:01:11.259> hey<00:01:11.470> there

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
the bank because the thought hey there

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.020 
the bank because the thought hey there

probably<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:24.159> don't<00:01:24.280> know<00:01:24.429> probably<00:01:24.670> very

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
probably I don't know probably very

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.399 
probably I don't know probably very
conservative<00:01:25.539> estimate<00:01:25.929> if<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.079> get<00:01:26.229> about

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
conservative estimate if you get about

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.789 
conservative estimate if you get about
no<00:01:27.249> 100<00:01:27.700> an<00:01:27.789> hour<00:01:27.880> maybe<00:01:28.569> even<00:01:28.749> 150<00:01:29.259> I've<00:01:29.590> no

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799
