00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.830 

and<00:03:46.960> what<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.230> then<00:03:47.410> do<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:48.400> jump<00:03:48.810> or<00:03:49.810> not

jump you walk off the edge of the
building<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:53.050> try<00:03:53.770> and<00:03:54.130> land<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.270> top<00:03:55.510> of

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
building to try and land on the top of

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.830 
building to try and land on the top of
this<00:03:59.100> phone<00:04:00.100> line

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:14.300

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
then well now out of the map on

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:59.360 
then well now out of the map on
crossfire<00:04:36.110> as<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:38.070> can<00:04:38.280> see
