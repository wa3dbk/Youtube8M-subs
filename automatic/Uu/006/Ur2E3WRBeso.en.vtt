00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
pretty cool we'll go on to the sampler

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.780 
pretty cool we'll go on to the sampler
and<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:55.670> sampler<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.530> interesting<00:02:57.700> what<00:02:58.700> you

a<00:04:00.260> beat<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:01.450> I'll<00:04:02.450> just<00:04:02.630> make<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.840> simple<00:04:03.049> view

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
a beat so I'll just make a simple view

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:22.740 
a beat so I'll just make a simple view
right<00:04:03.470> here

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.750 

you<00:04:23.750> can<00:04:23.870> change<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.200> kit<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:25.340> get<00:04:25.460> some<00:04:25.670> more

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
you can change the kit you get some more

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.930 
you can change the kit you get some more
interesting<00:04:25.970> instance<00:04:26.420> with<00:04:26.570> different<00:04:26.840> kits

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
interesting instance with different kits

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.320 
interesting instance with different kits
try<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.000> make<00:04:29.120> another<00:04:29.360> beat<00:04:30.050> here<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:32.060> makes<00:04:32.210> a

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
try to make another beat here it makes a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.640 
try to make another beat here it makes a
really<00:04:32.450> good<00:04:32.600> beat<00:04:32.810> every<00:04:33.260> time<00:04:33.410> I'm<00:04:33.470> pretty

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
really good beat every time I'm pretty

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.790 
really good beat every time I'm pretty
much<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.070> yeah<00:04:34.280> that's<00:04:35.060> really<00:04:35.180> cool<00:04:35.800> the

much so yeah that's really cool the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.160 
much so yeah that's really cool the
smart<00:04:37.130> string<00:04:37.310> just<00:04:37.580> like<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.730> smart<00:04:38.060> drone<00:04:38.240> but

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
smart string just like a smart drone but

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.970 
smart string just like a smart drone but
strings<00:04:40.810> so<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:41.870> get<00:04:42.050> all<00:04:42.200> your<00:04:42.320> violins<00:04:42.800> you

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
instrument along with the sustain as you

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.820 
instrument along with the sustain as you
