00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.880
 The deadline is good for the summit 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.249
 Grafting agreement 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.289
 I should do this recently 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.309
 Bar type 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.219
 Disagreeable 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.679
 Interesting 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.630
 By Kawasaki with strange face in Yue 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.630
 If you can always cut fresh round and cut 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.579
 I can not finish Tokushima 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.579
 Can be processed reliably 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.050
 It looks good this week 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.900
 Destroy at extra charge 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.220
 I will go further than this 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.080
 I'm posting 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.140
 And then 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.920
 I feel like this 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.620
 Gasoline 2 weeks ago 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.660
 The committee is equivalent to about once every 20 days 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.760
 A few years ago 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.490
 1727 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.950
 At that time I am ready 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.760
 Liguean 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.750
 In anti-military political demo 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.090
 As always, I've been wearing it very quickly in recent times 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.150
 on the other hand 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.870
 More taxes than usual 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.160
 Very happy 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.730
 Feeling broken 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.860
 Then in the morning of January 9 morning 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.560
 Beginning of the year 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.900
 same number 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 Get on 2 aircraft 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.950
 And this 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.160
 Hayama 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.320
 Something was wrong 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 It is because there is a long time ago- 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
 Anyway 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.440
 I can not fly 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.020
 The grid of those days 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.020
 If you don't like it 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.470
 Humanity 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.510
 It was wood 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.250
 More than it has come out from the 1st century 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.410
 We could have introduced 322% if there were 8
