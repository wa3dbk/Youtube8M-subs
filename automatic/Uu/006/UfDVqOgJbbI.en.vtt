00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
before it was installed so when I

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.429 
I had minimal to no shedding and the
thing<00:01:19.760> that<00:01:19.939> I<00:01:20.119> realized<00:01:20.540> about<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:20.960> here<00:01:21.200> is

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
thing that I realized about this here is

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.550 
thing that I realized about this here is
if<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:22.520> straighten<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.180> hair<00:01:23.360> any<00:01:23.840> at<00:01:24.080> all<00:01:24.290> as

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
if you straighten the hair any at all as

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.160 
if you straighten the hair any at all as
soon<00:01:24.799> as<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.070> wash<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.580> it<00:01:25.760> is<00:01:25.970> really<00:01:26.900> really

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
soon as you wash it it is really really

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.649 
soon as you wash it it is really really
wavy<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.520> kind<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:28.909> like<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.540> if

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
wavy so I kind of like that and if

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.240 
wavy so I kind of like that and if
you're<00:01:29.810> going<00:01:30.049> for<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.350> way<00:01:30.560> if<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.770> look<00:01:30.979> you

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
you're going for the way if you look you

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.030 
you're going for the way if you look you
can<00:01:31.430> just<00:01:31.670> wash<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:31.939> leave<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.170> air<00:01:33.320> dry<00:01:33.350> and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
can just wash it leave it to air dry and

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.300 
can just wash it leave it to air dry and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.330 
and I think that also is really cute
I<00:01:40.930> did<00:01:41.930> not<00:01:42.170> steal<00:01:42.470> my<00:01:42.530> wax<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:45.280> should<00:01:46.280> have

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.870 
caught my West so bad especially at the
front<00:02:23.340> because<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.670> wanted<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.810> full<00:02:25.580> look<00:02:26.580> on

front because I wanted this full look on
this<00:02:27.390> side<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.230> had<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.950> cut<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.150> tracks

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
this side so I had to cut the tracks

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.690 
this side so I had to cut the tracks
just<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.170> layer<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.680> really<00:02:32.160> really<00:02:32.400> close

waist and do not cut your tracks it is
better<00:02:44.790> if<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.320> fold<00:02:46.320> them<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.280> west<00:02:47.520> aren't

better if you fold them the west aren't
really<00:02:48.210> thick<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.900> could<00:02:49.080> have<00:02:49.170> been

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
really thick so it could have been

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.500 
really thick so it could have been
folded<00:02:49.740> but<00:02:49.920> because<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.460> was<00:02:50.640> making<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> 3/4

easier<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:53.880> me<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.150> cut<00:02:54.600> my<00:02:54.960> waist<00:02:55.740> but<00:02:56.400> other
