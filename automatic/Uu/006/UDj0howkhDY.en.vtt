00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.190 

I've<00:00:00.930> removed<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.500> plastic<00:00:02.300> fender<00:00:03.300> well<00:00:03.480> so

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
I've removed the plastic fender well so

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.550 
I've removed the plastic fender well so
I<00:00:04.230> can<00:00:04.470> access<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:06.200> crankshaft<00:00:07.200> pulley

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
I can access the crankshaft pulley

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.930 
I can access the crankshaft pulley
because<00:00:08.010> that's<00:00:08.220> what<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.400> need<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.610> remove

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
because that's what I need to remove

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.410 
because that's what I need to remove
next<00:00:09.290> it's<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.500> 3/4<00:00:11.130> inch<00:00:11.160> socket<00:00:11.940> it's

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
next it's a 3/4 inch socket it's

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.169 
next it's a 3/4 inch socket it's
probably<00:00:12.750> some<00:00:12.980> millimeter<00:00:13.980> size<00:00:14.250> 2<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:14.580> 3/4

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
probably some millimeter size 2 but 3/4

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.310 
probably some millimeter size 2 but 3/4
works<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.920> I'm<00:00:16.980> going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.960> place<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
works what I'm going to do is place the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.950 
works what I'm going to do is place the
socket<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.609> my<00:00:20.760> breaker<00:00:21.029> bar<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.400> and

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
socket with my breaker bar like this and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.570 
socket with my breaker bar like this and
it's<00:00:24.960> wedged<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.590> here<00:00:25.859> against<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> frame

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it's wedged in here against the frame

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.720 
it's wedged in here against the frame
and<00:00:26.990> then<00:00:27.990> I'm<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and then I'm just going to going to the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.910 
and then I'm just going to going to the
car<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.240> bump<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> starter<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.679> touch<00:00:31.890> it

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
car and bump the starter just touch it

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:43.100 
car and bump the starter just touch it
and<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.820> should<00:00:33.059> break<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.450> bolt<00:00:33.660> free<00:00:42.110> well

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and that should break the bolt free well

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.290 
and that should break the bolt free well
as<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.980> didn't<00:00:44.309> work<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.760> my

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
as you can see that didn't work so my

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.720 
as you can see that didn't work so my
next<00:00:45.570> brilliant<00:00:45.780> idea<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.160> put<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> wheel

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
next brilliant idea is to put the wheel

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.670 
next brilliant idea is to put the wheel
back<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.250> place<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.600> breaker<00:00:51.870> bar<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
back on and place the breaker bar on the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.490 
back on and place the breaker bar on the
pulley<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.460> had<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> before<00:00:54.140> but<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.289> time

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
pulley as I had it before but this time

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.910 
pulley as I had it before but this time
I'm<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.370> roll<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> car<00:00:57.620> down<00:00:58.620> my

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
I'm just going to roll the car down my

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.450 
I'm just going to roll the car down my
driveway<00:00:59.789> I've<00:01:00.090> been<00:01:00.300> blessed<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.690> a

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
driveway I've been blessed with a

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
driveway I've been blessed with a
driveway<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.640> has<00:01:02.879> an<00:01:03.030> incline<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.799> just

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
driveway that has an incline and just

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.039 
driveway that has an incline and just
pop<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> clutch<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.150> gear<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.659> I'm<00:01:06.780> bump

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
pop the clutch in gear like I'm bump

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.620 
pop the clutch in gear like I'm bump
starting<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> car<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.240> hopefully<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.420> will

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
starting the car and hopefully that will

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:36.560 
starting the car and hopefully that will
break<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.500> bolt<00:01:10.860> free

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.300 

well<00:01:37.570> that<00:01:37.750> did<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.110> trick<00:01:38.290> I<00:01:38.620> put<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.160> in

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
well that did the trick I put it in

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.960 
well that did the trick I put it in
fifth<00:01:39.610> gear<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.180> started<00:01:41.170> rolling<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.970> pop

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
fifth gear and started rolling and pop

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.890 
fifth gear and started rolling and pop
the<00:01:43.180> clutch<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.450> almost<00:01:44.080> immediately<00:01:44.350> the

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
the clutch and almost immediately the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:55.710 
the clutch and almost immediately the
bolt<00:01:46.900> came<00:01:47.230> loose<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:51.220> in<00:01:51.400> here<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:55.390> loose

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
bolt came loose see in here it's loose

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.940 
bolt came loose see in here it's loose
now<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.550> can<00:01:57.820> remove<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.150> and<00:01:58.660> remove<00:01:59.530> the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
now so I can remove that and remove the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.300 
now so I can remove that and remove the
pulley<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.750> first<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.110> need<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.320> drag<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.130> car

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
pulley but first I need to drag the car

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:28.830 
pulley but first I need to drag the car
back<00:02:03.580> up<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:04.030> its<00:02:04.560> workstation

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
and that's how to remove a difficult

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.070 
and that's how to remove a difficult
