00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
to c5 was played here and now here it

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.670 
to c5 was played here and now here it
looks<00:00:59.000> as<00:00:59.630> if<00:00:59.900> white<00:01:00.500> can<00:01:00.739> win<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.070> game<00:01:01.300> fast

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
looks as if white can win the game fast

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.920 
looks as if white can win the game fast
by<00:01:03.680> taking<00:01:04.129> on<00:01:04.280> h7<00:01:04.879> group<00:01:05.030> takes<00:01:05.269> h7

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
by taking on h7 group takes h7

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.710 
by taking on h7 group takes h7
but<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.770> would<00:01:06.920> be<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.100> terrible<00:01:07.369> mistake

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
but it would be a terrible mistake

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.450 
but it would be a terrible mistake
because<00:01:08.720> black<00:01:09.140> has<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> defense<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.220> that's

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
because black has a defense and that's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.090 
because black has a defense and that's
the<00:01:10.820> combination<00:01:11.479> of<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.900> power<00:01:12.680> of<00:01:12.950> the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
the combination of the power of the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.580 
the combination of the power of the
Queen<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.330> bishop<00:01:15.160> both<00:01:16.160> attacking<00:01:16.550> f2

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
Queen and the bishop both attacking f2

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.469 
Queen and the bishop both attacking f2
let's<00:01:18.590> say<00:01:18.710> if<00:01:20.110> rook<00:01:21.110> takes<00:01:21.290> h7<00:01:22.190> here<00:01:22.479> then

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
let's say if rook takes h7 here then

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.920 
let's say if rook takes h7 here then
black<00:01:23.810> doesn't<00:01:24.110> take<00:01:24.440> with<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.920> bishop

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
black doesn't take with the bishop

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.540 
black doesn't take with the bishop
because<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.050> that<00:01:27.140> case<00:01:27.380> there<00:01:28.100> is<00:01:28.160> Queen

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
because in that case there is Queen

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.090 
because in that case there is Queen
clicking<00:01:29.149> -<00:01:29.300> eh-eh<00:01:29.540> one<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.229> then<00:01:30.830> there<00:01:31.040> is

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
clicking - eh-eh one and then there is

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.499 
clicking - eh-eh one and then there is
no<00:01:31.340> defense<00:01:32.030> against<00:01:32.450> this<00:01:33.009> threat<00:01:34.270> but<00:01:35.270> what

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
no defense against this threat but what

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.359 
no defense against this threat but what
black<00:01:35.840> could<00:01:36.020> do<00:01:37.420> rook<00:01:38.420> takes<00:01:38.600> a7<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.369> Queen

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
black could do rook takes a7 is Queen

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.999 
black could do rook takes a7 is Queen
takes<00:01:40.580> after<00:01:41.350> forcing<00:01:42.350> white<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.740> trade

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
takes after forcing white to trade

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.279 
takes after forcing white to trade
Queens<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.720> here<00:01:44.720> if<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:46.610> Huizar<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:47.720> the

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
Queens and here if this Huizar of the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.830 
Queens and here if this Huizar of the
board<00:01:48.530> then<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.640> rook<00:01:49.789> on<00:01:49.910> itself<00:01:50.240> falls<00:01:50.539> and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
board then the rook on itself falls and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.219 
board then the rook on itself falls and
suddenly<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:52.070> black<00:01:52.280> winning<00:01:53.080> so<00:01:54.080> that

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
suddenly it's black winning so that

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.859 
suddenly it's black winning so that
means<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.560> why<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:54.920> must<00:01:55.130> be<00:01:55.250> careful<00:01:55.869> when

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
means that why it must be careful when

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.550 
means that why it must be careful when
we<00:01:57.020> are<00:01:57.140> attacking<00:01:58.180> always<00:01:59.180> will<00:01:59.390> have<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.689> in

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
we are attacking always will have to in

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.050 
we are attacking always will have to in
this<00:02:00.740> kind<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:00.979> position<00:02:01.159> make<00:02:01.549> really<00:02:01.939> good

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
this kind of position make really good

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.570 
this kind of position make really good
calculations<00:02:02.780> it's<00:02:03.229> really<00:02:03.710> winning<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.960> if

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
calculations it's really winning and if

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.199 
calculations it's really winning and if
we<00:02:07.580> cannot<00:02:07.820> win<00:02:08.030> in<00:02:08.830> just<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:10.009> few<00:02:10.160> moves<00:02:10.489> we

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
we cannot win in just a few moves we

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.479 
we cannot win in just a few moves we
need<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.450> be<00:02:11.540> patient<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.080> that's<00:02:12.290> what<00:02:12.500> MUX

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
need to be patient and that's what MUX

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.509 
need to be patient and that's what MUX
over<00:02:13.760> did<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.209> this<00:02:14.390> position<00:02:15.290> he<00:02:15.620> played<00:02:15.799> rook

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
over did in this position he played rook

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.569 
over did in this position he played rook
26<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.480> keeps<00:02:17.660> up<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.049> rook<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.459> edge

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
26 so it keeps up the rook on the edge

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:25.240 
26 so it keeps up the rook on the edge
file<00:02:20.079> but<00:02:21.079> just<00:02:21.290> places<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:22.430> on<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.810> safe<00:02:24.250> Square

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
file but just places it on a safe Square

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.100 
file but just places it on a safe Square
a<00:02:25.660> fine<00:02:26.660> was<00:02:26.870> played<00:02:27.110> black<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.590> trying<00:02:27.980> to

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
a fine was played black is trying to

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.900 
a fine was played black is trying to
bring<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.290> attention<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:30.920> Queen<00:02:31.130> side<00:02:31.400> by

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
bring the attention to the Queen side by

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.690 
bring the attention to the Queen side by
advancing<00:02:32.390> spawns

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
advancing spawns

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.830 
advancing spawns
but<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:34.880> what<00:02:35.630> happens<00:02:35.959> is<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.220> white<00:02:37.840> tries

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
but now what happens is that white tries

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.160 
but now what happens is that white tries
to<00:02:39.019> defend<00:02:39.579> f2<00:02:40.660> because<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:41.900> variation

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
to defend f2 because of this variation

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
to defend f2 because of this variation
that<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:42.739> showed<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
that I just showed you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.910 
that I just showed you
he<00:02:43.549> plays<00:02:43.790> rook<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.360> d3<00:02:44.810> with<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> idea<00:02:45.799> of

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
he plays rook to d3 with the idea of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.250 
he plays rook to d3 with the idea of
bringing<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.310> root<00:02:46.549> to<00:02:46.730> f3<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.299> after<00:02:48.079> that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
bringing the root to f3 and after that

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.479 
bringing the root to f3 and after that
there<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.280> no<00:02:49.549> defense<00:02:49.880> against<00:02:50.299> rook<00:02:50.989> takes

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
there is no defense against rook takes

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.240 
there is no defense against rook takes
h7<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.630> here<00:02:53.810> black<00:02:54.049> took<00:02:54.320> don't<00:02:54.920> have<00:02:55.040> to

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
h7 so here black took don't have to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.470 
h7 so here black took don't have to
sacrifice<00:02:56.239> in<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.780> piece<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:58.030> forcing<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
sacrifice in a piece and forcing the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.770 
sacrifice in a piece and forcing the
trade<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.870> Queens

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
trade of Queens

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.430 
trade of Queens
Queen<00:03:02.780> takes<00:03:04.510> Queen<00:03:05.510> takes<00:03:06.970> King<00:03:07.970> takes<00:03:08.410> now<00:03:09.410> a

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
Queen takes Queen takes King takes now a

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.570 
Queen takes Queen takes King takes now a
four<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:13.090> why<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.360> piece<00:03:14.629> up<00:03:14.870> now<00:03:15.580> but

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
four so why it is a piece up now but

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.580 
four so why it is a piece up now but
black<00:03:17.030> has<00:03:17.269> three<00:03:18.170> passports<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:21.410> might

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
black has three passports and you might

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.320 
black has three passports and you might
think<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:22.069> now<00:03:22.430> we<00:03:22.489> are<00:03:22.790> reaching<00:03:23.030> an

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
think that now we are reaching an

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.339 
think that now we are reaching an
endgame<00:03:23.980> but<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:26.239> beauty<00:03:26.599> here<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:26.900> that

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
endgame but the beauty here is that

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.150 
endgame but the beauty here is that
white<00:03:28.099> doesn't<00:03:28.849> give<00:03:29.000> up<00:03:29.150> his<00:03:29.299> attack<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.980> is

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
white doesn't give up his attack this is

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.289 
white doesn't give up his attack this is
still<00:03:32.019> playing<00:03:33.019> with<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.590> idea<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:34.220> taking<00:03:34.970> on

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
still playing with the idea of taking on

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.470 
still playing with the idea of taking on
h7<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.079> bring<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:37.099> rope<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.459> h8<00:03:38.060> with

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
h7 and bring the rope to h8 with

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.839 
h7 and bring the rope to h8 with
checkmate

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
checkmate

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.490 
checkmate
the<00:03:40.849> idea<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.299> play<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.510> root<00:03:41.750> 2<00:03:41.870> H<00:03:41.989> 3<00:03:42.019> and

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
the idea is to play a root 2 H 3 and

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.789 
the idea is to play a root 2 H 3 and
then<00:03:42.620> threaten<00:03:43.010> group<00:03:43.430> takes<00:03:43.700> h7<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.650> there

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
then threaten group takes h7 but there

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.229 
then threaten group takes h7 but there
is<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:45.920> problem<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.579> that<00:03:47.120> is<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:49.519> dark

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
is a problem and that is that the dark

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.059 
is a problem and that is that the dark
Bishop<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:51.370> defending<00:03:52.370> h3<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.500> here<00:03:54.769> white

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
Bishop is defending h3 so here white

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.780 
Bishop is defending h3 so here white
plays<00:03:55.370> G<00:03:55.610> for<00:03:55.879> blocking<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:57.680> diagonal<00:03:58.579> and

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
plays G for blocking this diagonal and

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.740 
plays G for blocking this diagonal and
now<00:03:59.920> there<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:00.950> no<00:04:01.910> defense<00:04:02.180> against<00:04:02.569> this

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
now there is no defense against this

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.770 
now there is no defense against this
threat<00:04:02.930> group<00:04:03.500> 2<00:04:03.709> H<00:04:03.829> 3<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.940> taking<00:04:05.299> life<00:04:05.480> 7

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
threat group 2 H 3 and the taking life 7

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.180 
threat group 2 H 3 and the taking life 7
so<00:04:06.010> desperately<00:04:07.010> sorrow<00:04:07.639> floor<00:04:07.970> took<00:04:08.180> on<00:04:08.359> e5

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
so desperately sorrow floor took on e5

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.650 
so desperately sorrow floor took on e5
sacrificing<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.280> rope<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.730> then<00:04:11.209> bring<00:04:11.450> his

enjoyed<00:04:54.470> this<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:55.490> example<00:04:55.880> and<00:04:56.240> that<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.229> it

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
enjoyed this this example and that is it

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.620 
enjoyed this this example and that is it
has<00:04:58.070> actually<00:04:58.460> two<00:04:58.669> interesting<00:04:59.240> things<00:04:59.479> I

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
has actually two interesting things I

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.650 
has actually two interesting things I
think<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.530> one<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:00.889> them<00:05:01.039> is<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:01.880> idea<00:05:02.330> of

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
think and one of them is this idea of

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.050 
think and one of them is this idea of
bringing<00:05:02.960> more<00:05:03.380> pieces<00:05:03.680> in<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.070> attack<00:05:04.370> with

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
bringing more pieces in the attack with

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.379 
bringing more pieces in the attack with
rook<00:05:05.810> to<00:05:05.960> c5<00:05:06.380> placing<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.340> black<00:05:07.669> Queen<00:05:08.120> out

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
rook to c5 placing the black Queen out

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.020 
rook to c5 placing the black Queen out
of<00:05:08.570> play<00:05:08.810> than<00:05:09.110> bringing<00:05:09.349> this<00:05:09.800> group<00:05:10.729> to<00:05:10.909> the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
of play than bringing this group to the

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.540 
of play than bringing this group to the
edge<00:05:11.180> file<00:05:11.590> all<00:05:12.590> combined

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
edge file all combined

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.630 
edge file all combined
with<00:05:13.840> Sakura<00:05:14.840> calculation<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.890> another

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
with Sakura calculation and another

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.680 
with Sakura calculation and another
interesting<00:05:16.970> moment<00:05:17.630> is<00:05:17.840> much<00:05:18.770> later<00:05:19.150> when<00:05:20.150> we

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
interesting moment is much later when we

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.710 
interesting moment is much later when we
think<00:05:21.080> that<00:05:21.710> we<00:05:22.310> have<00:05:22.550> reached<00:05:23.120> an<00:05:23.390> endgame

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
think that we have reached an endgame

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.900 
think that we have reached an endgame
but<00:05:24.470> then<00:05:24.710> this<00:05:24.950> g4<00:05:25.820> move<00:05:26.090> comes<00:05:26.420> and<00:05:26.750> suddenly

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
but then this g4 move comes and suddenly

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.200 
but then this g4 move comes and suddenly
still<00:05:28.910> a<00:05:29.210> king<00:05:29.870> attack<00:05:30.850> towards<00:05:31.850> the<00:05:32.000> the

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210
