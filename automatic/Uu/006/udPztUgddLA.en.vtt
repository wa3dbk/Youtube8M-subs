00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.060
 how is the scenario there where this 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.250
 boy ended up dying 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.730
 the scenario is that he was in a cell 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.030
 separate a wing that is already separated 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.289
 within the world of the underworld of crime 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.660
 and the prison system 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.270
 there is a kind of code of honor 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.340
 then this code honors these people 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.949
 who commit sex crimes 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.480
 they are really stigmatized are 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.670
 postponed right 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.270
 and they are always in danger 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.010
 constant within the system itself in a 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.450
 in a pact that has among the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.910
 prisoners 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.070
 and that guy got the crime gave him 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.980
 very large repercussion then it was 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.800
 placed inside a wing that 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.760
 was already isolated and now in the morning when 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.579
 the defendants of the prison officers 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.129
 were checking the access to the cafe 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.280
 morning came across it focused 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.350
 so probably it climbed on the grid is 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.520
 a site to slap on time but he 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.749
 was able to tear off the wiring and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.819
 neck and committed suicide he committed 

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:16.069
 hanging 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:16.849
 This is the scene that is the portrait that we 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.459
 we found 

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:22.369
 with this enlargement of the torÃ© is exposed 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:24.229
 was easily accessible to him 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.139
 knew of this nature and ends up taking 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.499
 film was not a 

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:34.849
 was not a very diffuse place of much 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:37.310
 easy access but they went up on the grid and 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.289
 could start this membership that 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.929
 usually the students themselves do 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.369
 some gambiarras within the 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.659
 own cell 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.639
 what are the steps to be taken 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.619
 taken from now on in relation to 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:52.310
 this case since it is suicide 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.959
 probably see, it 's the police 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.899
 scientist has been here in the 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.090
 place has already carried out the expert 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.689
 We will wait for the coming of this 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.840
 Indeed the local division of the report is 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.759
 we are also going to wait for the exam report 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.879
 body that will demonstrate 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.280
 It really was hanging right. 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.450
 and we're introducing inquiry 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.390
 police officer to investigate 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.580
 instances where this occurred but for 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.650
 from the initial information everything indicates 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.170
 that it was really a suicide 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.440
 time that this prisoner was in a 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.470
 suitcase on the block for the prisoners 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.239
 committed sexual offenses and moreover 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.650
 to the question of security itself 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.650
 I was in an isolated cell
