00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
animations in the tweak as of now that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.729 
animations in the tweak as of now that
the<00:00:36.000> developer<00:00:36.420> has<00:00:36.600> said<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.140> he<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.590> going

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the developer has said that he is going

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.720 
the developer has said that he is going
to<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.920> releasing<00:00:38.190> more<00:00:38.809> animation<00:00:39.809> soon<00:00:40.110> um

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
to be releasing more animation soon um

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.680 
to be releasing more animation soon um
so<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> first<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.660> called

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
so this is the first one it's called

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
so this is the first one it's called
turn<00:00:43.530> page<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.890> unlock<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.579> actually

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
turn page to unlock and it's actually

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.090 
turn page to unlock and it's actually
fold<00:00:45.390> your<00:00:45.570> lock<00:00:45.780> screen<00:00:45.809> away<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.980> my

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
fold your lock screen away and in my

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
fold your lock screen away and in my
opinion<00:00:47.250> looks<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:48.480> very<00:00:48.539> nice<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> can

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
opinion looks very very nice you can

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
opinion looks very very nice you can
actually<00:00:49.260> change<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:50.340> direction<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
actually change which direction you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.549 
actually change which direction you
wanted<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> start<00:00:51.600> from<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> button<00:00:52.379> can

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
wanted to start from so the button can

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.139 
wanted to start from so the button can
actually<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.890> moved<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:54.000> can

actually be moved there and you can

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.200 
actually be moved there and you can
actually<00:00:54.360> fold<00:00:55.260> from<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.920> right<00:00:56.850> side<00:00:57.090> of

band-aid actually says peel a way to
unlock<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.310> too<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.869> movable

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
unlock on this too and it's all movable

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.590 
unlock on this too and it's all movable
and<00:01:28.860> stuff<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.220> looks<00:01:29.490> very<00:01:29.820> realistic<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and stuff and looks very realistic I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 
and stuff and looks very realistic I
really<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.290> how<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.560> developer<00:01:32.100> has<00:01:32.340> put<00:01:32.670> in

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
really like how the developer has put in

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.420 
really like how the developer has put in
the<00:01:32.970> amount<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.299> detail<00:01:33.689> into<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.110> tweak<00:01:34.430> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the amount of detail into this tweak the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.039 
the amount of detail into this tweak the
final<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.030> called<00:01:36.060> plastic<00:01:36.630> tab<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
final one here is called plastic tab and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.870 
final one here is called plastic tab and
this<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.560> when<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.829> open<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.430> new

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
this is just like when you open a new

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210 
this is just like when you open a new
roll<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> scotch<00:01:40.110> tape<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.740> something<00:01:40.979> like

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
roll of scotch tape or something like

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
roll of scotch tape or something like
