I'm just for this video I'm just going

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.380 
I'm just for this video I'm just going
to<00:02:20.340> wash<00:02:20.810> surface<00:02:21.810> first<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:23.210> then<00:02:24.210> you're

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
to wash surface first and then you're

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.300 
to wash surface first and then you're
just<00:02:24.480> gonna<00:02:25.910> kind<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.060> push<00:02:27.390> down<00:02:29.480> way<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.540> this
