00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
full body suits for swimmers at about

full body suits for swimmers at about
that<00:00:09.210> time<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.540> had<00:00:09.870> published<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.559> couple<00:00:10.830> of

that time I had published a couple of

that time I had published a couple of
research<00:00:11.550> papers<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:12.300> things<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:12.750> the

research papers on things like the

effects of Shaving body hair and whether
that<00:00:15.809> would<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> physical<00:00:16.940> measurable

asked me to join the team in helping to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.060 
asked me to join the team in helping to
develop<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.630> suit<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.230> 2008<00:00:26.039> Olympics

there's<00:00:26.939> been<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> good<00:00:27.420> three<00:00:27.750> years<00:00:27.779> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
parts of the swimmers body where we had

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740 
parts of the swimmers body where we had
measured<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> highest<00:01:12.060> amount<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.479> drag

measured the highest amount of drag
these<00:01:13.439> seams<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.310> were<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.700> two<00:01:15.360> ends<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
these seams here were the two ends of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.210 
these seams here were the two ends of
the<00:01:15.869> fabric<00:01:16.110> come<00:01:16.560> together<00:01:16.740> our

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the fabric come together our

the fabric come together our
ultrasonically<00:01:18.119> welded<00:01:18.240> rather<00:01:18.960> than

ultrasonically welded rather than

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.039 
ultrasonically welded rather than
stitched<00:01:19.909> because<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.240> found<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.810> when

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
stitched because what we found is when

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.530 
stitched because what we found is when
we<00:01:22.259> stitched<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.950> seams<00:01:23.250> which<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
we stitched the seams which is the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.450 
we stitched the seams which is the
traditional<00:01:25.170> way<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.979> creates<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
traditional way to do it it creates a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.640 
traditional way to do it it creates a
little<00:01:26.610> bump<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:28.080> put<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
little bump on there we put it in the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.270 
little bump on there we put it in the
wind<00:01:28.860> tunnel<00:01:29.340> out<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> NASA<00:01:30.450> lab<00:01:30.869> and

wind tunnel out at the NASA lab and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
wind tunnel out at the NASA lab and
found<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.119> reduction<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.140> drag

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
found out that the reduction in drag

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.580 
found out that the reduction in drag
across<00:01:34.950> these<00:01:35.250> seams<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.939> about<00:01:36.240> 14%<00:01:36.780> lower

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
across these seams was about 14% lower

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.340 
across these seams was about 14% lower
than<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> regular<00:01:38.310> stitch<00:01:38.909> seam<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.810> inside

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
than a regular stitch seam but inside

around the mid torso area of the swimmer

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.679 
around the mid torso area of the swimmer
we've<00:01:45.030> built<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.899> corset<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:47.689> additional

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
we've built in a corset like additional

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.469 
we've built in a corset like additional
layer<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.290> provides<00:01:49.829> an<00:01:50.250> extra<00:01:50.939> level<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
layer that provides an extra level of

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.859 
layer that provides an extra level of
support<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.860> core<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> body

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
support for the core of the body

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.060 
support for the core of the body
particularly<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:55.409> start<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> fatigue

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
particularly when they start to fatigue

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.450 
particularly when they start to fatigue
and<00:01:56.810> these<00:01:57.810> muscles<00:01:58.350> around<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.860> core<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and these muscles around the core of the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
and these muscles around the core of the
body<00:01:59.670> start<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> fatigue<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.049> little<00:02:01.320> bit<00:02:01.500> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
body start to fatigue a little bit and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.480 
body start to fatigue a little bit and
relax

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
relax

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.060 
relax
