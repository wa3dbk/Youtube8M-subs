00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.470 

right<00:00:01.079> more<00:00:01.290> on<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.530> transit<00:00:02.010> project<00:00:02.610> I'm

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
right more on the transit project I'm

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.780 
right more on the transit project I'm
just<00:00:03.929> fitting<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.560> new<00:00:04.770> pump<00:00:05.190> with<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> new

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
just fitting the new pump with a new

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.370 
just fitting the new pump with a new
camp<00:00:06.089> Leighton<00:00:06.540> etc<00:00:08.450> you<00:00:09.450> can<00:00:09.750> see<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.230> in

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
camp Leighton etc you can see it in

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.589 
camp Leighton etc you can see it in
there<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:11.190> probably<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.580> bit<00:00:11.790> easier<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.269> see

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
there it's probably a bit easier to see

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.220 
there it's probably a bit easier to see
now<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.080> then<00:00:13.170> what<00:00:13.259> other<00:00:13.380> clutter<00:00:13.740> removed

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
now and then what other clutter removed

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.140 
now and then what other clutter removed
basically<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.590> bolts<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.340> fits<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.670> exactly

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
basically it bolts and fits on exactly

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.929 
basically it bolts and fits on exactly
the<00:00:18.270> same<00:00:18.480> as<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> VP<00:00:18.869> 30<00:00:19.580> the<00:00:20.580> support

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the same as the VP 30 the support

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.609 
the same as the VP 30 the support
brackets<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.449> backs<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:21.869> pig<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
brackets at the backs are pig to get a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.179 
brackets at the backs are pig to get a
and<00:00:23.600> I've<00:00:24.600> dropped<00:00:24.990> one<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.410> my<00:00:25.529> sockets<00:00:26.010> down

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and I've dropped one of my sockets down

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.950 
and I've dropped one of my sockets down
the<00:00:26.340> back<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> starter<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.539> don't

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
the back of the starter but I don't

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.450 
the back of the starter but I don't
think<00:00:28.170> I'll<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.410> pulling<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.859> off<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.099> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
think I'll be pulling that off just to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.920 
think I'll be pulling that off just to
retrieve<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.060> those<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:31.800> we'll<00:00:32.219> get<00:00:32.399> on

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
retrieve one of those so we'll get on

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.260 
retrieve one of those so we'll get on
I've<00:00:33.930> got<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> injector<00:00:34.649> pipes<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.270> they're

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
I've got the injector pipes are they're

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.049 
I've got the injector pipes are they're
no<00:00:36.510> different<00:00:36.719> than<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> VP<00:00:38.190> 30<00:00:38.489> because

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
no different than on the VP 30 because

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.229 
no different than on the VP 30 because
basically<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:39.989> exactly<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.620> same<00:00:40.770> pump<00:00:41.239> but

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
basically it's exactly the same pump but

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.740 
basically it's exactly the same pump but
with<00:00:42.360> mechanical<00:00:42.930> control<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:46.219> was<00:00:47.219> easy

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
with mechanical control so that was easy

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.450 
with mechanical control so that was easy
I've<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:48.989> left<00:00:49.200> them<00:00:49.379> loose<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> top<00:00:50.160> so

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
I've just left them loose on the top so

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.850 
I've just left them loose on the top so
when<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.600> come<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> start<00:00:52.170> it'll<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.620> bleed

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
when we come to start it'll just bleed

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
when we come to start it'll just bleed
the<00:00:53.010> fuel<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.719> it's<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> bit<00:00:54.899> frosty<00:00:55.140> this

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the fuel out it's a bit frosty this

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.750 
the fuel out it's a bit frosty this
morning<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:57.859> had<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> transit<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.609> last

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
morning I had the transit going last

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.149 
morning I had the transit going last
night<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.489> seemed<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.730> run<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.149> right<00:01:03.329> so

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
night and it seemed to run all right so

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.590 
night and it seemed to run all right so
so<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.309> we'll<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.670> try<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> cold<00:01:06.210> start

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
so what we'll do is try a cold start

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.980 
so what we'll do is try a cold start
this<00:01:06.689> morning<00:01:06.810> see<00:01:07.530> how<00:01:07.650> well<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> fires<00:01:08.310> up

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
this morning see how well it fires up

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.240 
this morning see how well it fires up
all<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.470> now<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.710> put<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:10.979> front

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
all I'm going to do now is put the front

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.910 
all I'm going to do now is put the front
back<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:12.390> everything<00:01:12.780> goes<00:01:12.960> right<00:01:13.260> from

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
back on if everything goes right from

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:54.470 
back on if everything goes right from
now<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.720> let's<00:01:15.720> see

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.760 

a<00:01:54.510> bit<00:01:54.900> of<00:01:54.990> an<00:01:55.080> airlock<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.680> Italy

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.910 

welcome<00:02:00.770> back

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:18.490 

oh<00:02:09.970> well<00:02:14.530> well<00:02:15.530> front<00:02:15.860> back<00:02:16.160> um<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.200> I'm<00:02:18.200> just

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
oh well well front back um so I'm just

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.430 
oh well well front back um so I'm just
gonna<00:02:18.650> have<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.720> retard<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> timing<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:21.410> bit

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
gonna have to retard the timing a bit

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.070 
gonna have to retard the timing a bit
because<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:22.790> advanced<00:02:23.420> at<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.630> moment<00:02:23.959> it

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
because it's advanced at the moment it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.640 
because it's advanced at the moment it
sounds<00:02:24.470> like<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> tractor<00:02:26.440> okay

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
sounds like a tractor okay

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.820 
sounds like a tractor okay
I<00:02:27.680> don't<00:02:28.310> didn't<00:02:28.760> have<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.970> dial-up<00:02:29.420> figure<00:02:29.840> for

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
I don't didn't have a dial-up figure for

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.850 
I don't didn't have a dial-up figure for
the<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.130> play<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:32.440> because<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.709> non

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
the can play so because it's a non

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.220 
the can play so because it's a non
standard<00:02:34.190> fitment<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.420> just<00:02:35.720> had<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.020> guess

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
standard fitment so I just had to guess

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.620 
standard fitment so I just had to guess
and<00:02:36.440> what<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.650> timing<00:02:37.100> was<00:02:37.280> I've<00:02:38.209> got<00:02:38.510> it

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
and what the timing was I've got it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.910 
and what the timing was I've got it
pretty<00:02:38.989> good<00:02:39.140> actually<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.830> think<00:02:40.989> it's<00:02:41.989> it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
pretty good actually I think it's it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.460 
pretty good actually I think it's it
runs<00:02:43.250> fully<00:02:43.790> advanced<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.570> fully<00:02:44.810> retarded

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
runs fully advanced and fully retarded

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.290 
runs fully advanced and fully retarded
so<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.160> sweet<00:02:46.340> spot<00:02:46.670> hopefully<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.209> the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
so the sweet spot hopefully in the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.509 
so the sweet spot hopefully in the
middle<00:02:47.540> we'll<00:02:47.870> see<00:02:50.800> well<00:02:51.800> I've<00:02:52.010> just<00:02:52.070> been<00:02:52.280> for

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
middle we'll see well I've just been for

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.390 
middle we'll see well I've just been for
a<00:02:52.580> test<00:02:52.880> drive<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.540> I'm<00:02:54.140> really<00:02:54.709> pleased<00:02:55.010> it's

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
a test drive and I'm really pleased it's

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.949 
a test drive and I'm really pleased it's
got<00:02:55.670> loads<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.120> more<00:02:56.239> power<00:02:56.540> than<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.840> had

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
got loads of more power than it had

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:57.580 
got loads of more power than it had
before

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
before

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.940 
before
I<00:02:57.620> would<00:02:58.280> guess<00:02:58.870> another<00:02:59.870> 20<00:03:00.350> or<00:03:00.440> spare<00:03:00.800> at

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
I would guess another 20 or spare at

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.750 
I would guess another 20 or spare at
least<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:03.110> also<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.250> turn<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.610> main

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
least and it also if you turn the main

fueling<00:03:05.209> up<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.540> makes<00:03:05.810> lots<00:03:06.080> of<00:03:06.260> smoke<00:03:06.560> which

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
fueling up it makes lots of smoke which

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.790 
fueling up it makes lots of smoke which
means<00:03:07.660> there's<00:03:08.660> plenty<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.050> potential<00:03:09.380> where

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
means there's plenty of potential where

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.850 
means there's plenty of potential where
so<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:11.840> we're<00:03:12.019> going<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.200> do<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:12.440> go<00:03:12.620> for<00:03:12.829> a

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
so what we're going to do is go for a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.759 
so what we're going to do is go for a
bigger<00:03:13.130> turbo<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:14.090> an<00:03:14.239> intercooler<00:03:14.769> which

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
bigger turbo and an intercooler which

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.900 
bigger turbo and an intercooler which
should<00:03:15.980> be<00:03:16.130> able<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.430> use<00:03:16.880> some<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.299> fuel

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
should be able to use some of the fuel

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.930 
should be able to use some of the fuel
well<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.690> next<00:03:20.989> thing<00:03:21.049> a<00:03:21.440> nice<00:03:22.370> VN

that<00:03:37.549> can't<00:03:37.820> be<00:03:37.910> bad<00:03:41.350> we've<00:03:42.350> worked<00:03:42.590> out<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.799> way

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
that can't be bad we've worked out a way

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.470 
that can't be bad we've worked out a way
of<00:03:43.190> controlling<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.450> mechanically<00:03:46.299> you<00:03:47.299> can

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
of controlling it mechanically you can

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.920 
of controlling it mechanically you can
vary<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.989> position<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.860> veins

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
vary the position of the veins

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.910 
vary the position of the veins
according<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.370> fuel<00:03:52.370> demand<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:54.579> that's<00:03:55.579> next

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
according to fuel demand so that's next

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.850
