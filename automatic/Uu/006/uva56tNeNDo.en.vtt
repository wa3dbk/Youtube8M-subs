00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.790
 complement of the same one that I brought yesterday 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.980
 de kay sm was doing enough 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.500
 add-ons in the forum and good took out 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.210
 this is called advanced hood and we 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.349
 allows to change the buttons in a plane 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.910
 they are has many people 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.830
 lately he tells me that he sage the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.869
 wii 9 was saying be I get the 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.279
 very young boots and good is a 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.780
 complement that installs as the one that 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.760
 I brought the last two of them 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.180
 suits the 3d blocks and like the one 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.100
 I brought them from the commandos install it 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.870
 balances what clown you have to have the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.820
 complements activated and ready then 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.280
 Once installed it is activated 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.710
 are going to see this adjustment here that says 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.440
 advanced hummer down and they have four 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.570
 options is that I think had 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.610
 by default I have this one that is like 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.890
 more for like for phones so I'm 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.450
 see the game in wii I like to 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.280
 nothing then use are here so that 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.870
 be smaller authors because without the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.699
 chule solved the giant buttons 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.200
 Many people complain that they have been 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.610
 given to have very small my brother 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.240
 loved it because this phone is seen 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.240
 the buttons like 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.820
 I really liked how it looks 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.190
 have more space to see everything then 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.260
 we have the first option that is the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.820
 basket the one that I have by default and this one 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.800
 it's what for bigger or tablet 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.150
 something like this this is also very 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.030
 interesting let's go in playing with 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.400
 I like it a lot because we're going to see 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.950
 because if you see this bear I like it a lot 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.690
 for the aspect that in my case as 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.250
 I'm a tablet and it looks very comfortable to me 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.080
 lets see the whole scenario to like 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.790
 are you who think but more 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.010
 that nothing this complement was for the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.750
 people who were seen in their 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.400
 phones on the day very small and for 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.530
 example the stacks the numbers are 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.780
 They looked crowded and looked bad and did not 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.670
 could then play this add-on 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.900
 It is for you the truth that almost 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 mss and falls are showcased with this we will go to 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.220
 Other options 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.570
 to put it so it's the one that many 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.369
 they would like to have on their phones 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.390
 this is the one that I usually have in 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.239
 annexes in the suite and this and in the sub-18 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.649
 naturist even bigger and I do not like 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.900
 for nothing then the file install it 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.130
 to have everything smaller but you 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.510
 they have problems with that they can 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.770
 change then want I wanted to tell you 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.300
 also that the speedy launcher has not 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.739
 updated is still the same me 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.270
 they ask that the united ones do not have 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.640
 sounds manage to be for the time being 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.030
 some strange reason this ibook with 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.100
 sounds then let's leave it like that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.780
 loved this one of you comment what 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.190
 they are going to use I really liked this one and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.690
 good on my part to everything for this video 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.370
 anyone doubt that they have 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.080
 your answer would obviously be 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.880
 add-ons are compatible with 0.2 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.230
 of any guild the problem is expected 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.330
 update the launcher when 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.250
 leave wheel 10 11 or 12 depends on faults 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.840
 william but the complement is going to be 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.440
 compatible with all versions of 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.610
 0.2 that come out this and now if 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.050
 they put everything in this video 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.870
 comment if you liked it or have 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.340
 what a study thinks the truth to me 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.840
 I really liked the buttons 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.760
 it did not bother me but there were cases that 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.110
 if they looked very bad and can not play 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.000
 then I hope this helps you 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.560
 and everything else that they have to iron 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.300
