00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and how about youtube friends today 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.850
 I bring the second part of the pirates of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.280
 Caribbean this is the part of the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.500
 accompaniment we already have the riff of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.870
 start and this is going to be all the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.130
 base of what is the song that they do 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.080
 who also have the video demonstration 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.090
 on this side so that when 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.910
 learn all the chords you can 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.820
 do together with this so well let's 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.039
 to start perfect standard tuning 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.900
 on the guitar and well let's occupy the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.880
 following chords for the part that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.880
 would be from the beginning they will be 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.260
 re minor 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.260
 Y 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:46.559
 the sustained the normally is 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:52.870
 so I prefer to do it as power short 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.760
 that nothing else we remove this finger we 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.790
 we press these two you can 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.020
 do as they agree we will use 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.410
 two 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.410
 D minor again fa 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.700
 G minor 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.009
 the minor and the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.140
 perfect the radio really does not have 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.659
 great science nothing more than sagarra rhythm 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.450
 since nothing else the radio is down 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.360
 and up all the time only 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.310
 we have to respect a time and everything 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.149
 others is down and up is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.149
 a time 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.770
 Y 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.130
 and again down up up down 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.560
 i 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.640
 see how it would be fast and right now 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.640
 we are slowing it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.850
 there is for example in nothing else is a 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.190
 downward trait 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.780
 this would be the first shot we're going to 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.820
 make it slow so that they go grabbing 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.920
 the strum and then we're going 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.920
 making the whole song more dynamic ok 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.120
 practice this speed first so 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
 that they are grasping speed of all 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.750
 forms here I'm going to do all the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.820
 show a little bit slower than 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.320
 which is the real time already when 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.390
 learn the chords because they can already 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.090
 do with the demonstration video ok 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.980
 then then repeat the river again 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.180
 this is from the number one part of the riff 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.180
 to teach them another this 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.129
 no no 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.170
 that is the second part of the end where 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.450
 I tell them that it changes and at the end instead of 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.890
 the first one nothing more in the way they are given 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.989
 account is a trait down and here 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.939
 change ok 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.939
 then we continue 30 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.250
 ok this radio nothing is one down 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.579
 ok then the next part is coming 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.890
 that I'm between 3 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.719
 within that support base 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.640
 it would be like this 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.090
 3 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.680
 d 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.629
 feel 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.299
 as they realize is the trait towards 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.300
 down and when we change you are born one towards 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.630
 up or you're going to do another one is slow 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.630
 d 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.480
 and 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.790
 the other time 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.419
 and here we do 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.580
 from what would be minor sun after 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.020
 for me and re minor but check I know how 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.680
 is the slip so that you do not 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.680
 cost work 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.699
 They put these two fingers never mind 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.930
 take them off even for him the 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.930
 I did everything 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.260
 ok, what would it be then? 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.120
 example the part already as more intermediate 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.070
 where they see the three videos where they come 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.700
 the three guitars the base of 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.270
 Accompaniment would be this 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.270
 to have 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.690
 and 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.979
 okay 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.979
 and the end of the train enters 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.960
 ok that's the same with hits as well as 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.960
 I taught them I thought 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.710
 and we repeat 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.940
 t 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.789
 well they go practicing it and when I already 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.130
 have perfectly everything do with the 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.350
 video demonstration ok whether that yes 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.479
 have doubts comment do not forget to give 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.759
 like to the video and subscribe to my channel 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.449
 so that in this way the videos that 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.850
 I am going up 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.360

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.360
