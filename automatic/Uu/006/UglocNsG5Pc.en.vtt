all<00:02:40.040> they<00:02:40.130> had<00:02:40.280> back<00:02:40.489> then<00:02:41.320> from<00:02:42.320> my

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
all they had back then from my

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
all they had back then from my
understanding<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:45.260> light<00:02:45.530> again<00:02:46.220> is

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
understanding this this light again is

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.880 
understanding this this light again is
probably<00:02:46.730> from<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.120> 60s<00:02:49.450> roughly<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:51.680> still

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
probably from the 60s roughly it still

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.820 
probably from the 60s roughly it still
works<00:02:52.660> if<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.900> notice<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.410> fireball

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
works if you notice in the fireball

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.240 
works if you notice in the fireball
video<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.970> didn't<00:02:56.570> turn<00:02:56.690> them<00:02:56.840> on<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.290> mean<00:02:58.160> I

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
video I didn't turn them on I mean I

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.220 
video I didn't turn them on I mean I
could<00:02:58.489> have<00:02:58.610> it's<00:02:59.510> no<00:02:59.720> big<00:02:59.870> deal<00:02:59.930> it's<00:03:00.170> not

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
could have it's no big deal it's not

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.229 
could have it's no big deal it's not
going<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.470> hurt<00:03:00.650> them<00:03:00.769> I<00:03:01.550> just<00:03:01.970> don't<00:03:02.090> want<00:03:02.209> to

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
going to hurt them I just don't want to

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.410 
going to hurt them I just don't want to
do<00:03:02.360> anything<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:04.280> know<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.459> damage<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.239> or

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
do anything to you know to damage it or

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.170 
do anything to you know to damage it or
whatever<00:03:06.230> they're<00:03:06.650> they're<00:03:07.040> really<00:03:07.550> in<00:03:07.790> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
whatever they're they're really in the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.290 
whatever they're they're really in the
showroom<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:09.700> collecting<00:03:10.700> collectors

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
showroom for collecting collectors

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.000 
showroom for collecting collectors
purposes<00:03:11.950> just<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.010> add<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.220> little<00:03:15.010> nostalgia

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
purposes just to add a little nostalgia

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.050 
purposes just to add a little nostalgia
to<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.250> showroom<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:17.140> that's<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:19.060> same

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
to the showroom and that's the same

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.580 
to the showroom and that's the same
concept<00:03:20.300> behind<00:03:20.660> keeping<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.140> deputy<00:03:21.500> in

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
concept behind keeping the deputy in

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.170 
concept behind keeping the deputy in
here<00:03:21.799> I'm<00:03:21.950> not<00:03:22.100> a<00:03:22.130> collector<00:03:22.340> I'm<00:03:22.820> not<00:03:23.090> an

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
here I'm not a collector I'm not an

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.199 
here I'm not a collector I'm not an
expert<00:03:23.420> on<00:03:23.660> these<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:25.340> know<00:03:25.820> very<00:03:26.090> little

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
expert on these and I know very little

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.530 
expert on these and I know very little
about<00:03:26.420> them<00:03:26.750> enough<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.260> be<00:03:27.350> dangerous<00:03:28.120> but<00:03:29.120> it

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
about them enough to be dangerous but it

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.080 
about them enough to be dangerous but it
still<00:03:29.750> works<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.739> works<00:03:31.130> fine<00:03:31.370> it's<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.730> the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
still works and it works fine it's a the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.250 
still works and it works fine it's a the
motors<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.510> little<00:03:32.840> bit<00:03:32.959> noisy<00:03:33.110> on<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:34.959> but<00:03:35.959> it

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
motors a little bit noisy on it but it

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.350 
motors a little bit noisy on it but it
still<00:03:36.470> works

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
still works

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.630 
still works
kind<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:37.930> weird<00:03:39.810> design<00:03:41.100> see<00:03:42.100> I'll<00:03:42.250> take<00:03:42.460> this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
kind of weird design see I'll take this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:52.720 
kind of weird design see I'll take this
off<00:03:42.880> here

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.390 

so<00:03:53.330> what<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.989> have<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:56.920> bulb<00:03:57.920> that's<00:03:58.220> hanging

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
so what you have is bulb that's hanging

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.350 
so what you have is bulb that's hanging
down<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.910> then<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.510> have<00:03:59.540> these<00:03:59.870> huge<00:04:01.360> like

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
down and then you have these huge like

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.520 
down and then you have these huge like
concave<00:04:02.959> mirrors<00:04:05.050> that<00:04:06.050> are<00:04:06.200> all<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.440> way

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
concave mirrors that are all the way

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.850 
concave mirrors that are all the way
around<00:04:06.860> that's<00:04:07.370> three<00:04:07.670> of<00:04:07.700> them<00:04:07.879> and<00:04:08.769> when<00:04:09.769> the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
around that's three of them and when the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.030 
around that's three of them and when the
light<00:04:10.010> comes<00:04:10.190> on<00:04:10.459> these<00:04:11.360> amplify<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.830> light

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
light comes on these amplify the light

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.699 
light comes on these amplify the light
and<00:04:13.310> kind<00:04:14.269> of<00:04:14.330> throws<00:04:14.540> out<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:17.380> like<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> small

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
and kind of throws out a like a small

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:28.360 
and kind of throws out a like a small
beam<00:04:19.150> three<00:04:20.150> small<00:04:20.389> beams<00:04:20.600> really

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.050 

so<00:04:28.940> a<00:04:28.970> pretty<00:04:29.150> cool<00:04:29.360> light<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:31.490> don't<00:04:31.910> know<00:04:31.970> how

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
so a pretty cool light I don't know how

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.090 
so a pretty cool light I don't know how
many<00:04:32.120> people<00:04:32.449> have<00:04:32.570> these<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:33.169> don't<00:04:33.889> know<00:04:33.980> how

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
many people have these I don't know how

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.070 
many people have these I don't know how
collectible<00:04:34.669> they<00:04:34.790> are<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.970> know<00:04:38.090> again<00:04:39.050> I

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
collectible they are you know again I

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.320 
collectible they are you know again I
don't<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.470> don't<00:04:39.530> know<00:04:39.680> much<00:04:39.860> about<00:04:39.889> them<00:04:43.270> but<00:04:44.270> I

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
don't I don't know much about them but I

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.180 
don't I don't know much about them but I
thought<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:45.020> would<00:04:45.139> be<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.320> cool<00:04:45.889> video<00:04:46.160> to

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
thought it would be a cool video to

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.860 
thought it would be a cool video to
share<00:04:46.460> with<00:04:46.639> you<00:04:46.820> some<00:04:47.360> people<00:04:47.510> have<00:04:47.690> never

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
share with you some people have never

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.689 
share with you some people have never
seen<00:04:48.110> these<00:04:48.229> some<00:04:48.650> people<00:04:48.919> may<00:04:49.100> never<00:04:49.370> ever

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
seen these some people may never ever

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.790 
seen these some people may never ever
see<00:04:50.120> them<00:04:50.270> again<00:04:50.360> obviously<00:04:51.020> they're<00:04:51.650> no

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
see them again obviously they're no

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.409 
see them again obviously they're no
longer<00:04:51.949> in<00:04:52.220> production<00:04:52.780> but<00:04:55.000> it<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.180> pretty

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
longer in production but it is a pretty

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.450 
longer in production but it is a pretty
cool<00:04:56.570> light<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:59.800> cannot<00:05:00.800> tell<00:05:01.010> you<00:05:01.070> what<00:05:01.310> they

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
cool light I cannot tell you what they

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.190 
cool light I cannot tell you what they
were<00:05:01.520> used<00:05:01.790> for<00:05:01.940> I'm<00:05:02.540> assuming<00:05:02.990> with<00:05:03.110> the

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
were used for I'm assuming with the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.969 
were used for I'm assuming with the
magnets<00:05:03.650> they<00:05:03.889> were<00:05:05.500> they<00:05:06.500> were<00:05:06.560> meant<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:06.889> be

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
magnets they were they were meant to be

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.409 
magnets they were they were meant to be
put<00:05:07.280> on<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.460> roof<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:07.820> mean<00:05:07.970> that's<00:05:08.120> that's<00:05:08.300> an

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
put on the roof I mean that's that's an

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.250 
put on the roof I mean that's that's an
obvious<00:05:08.570> assumption<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:10.310> light<00:05:10.520> seems<00:05:11.260> seems

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
obvious assumption the light seems seems

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.430 
obvious assumption the light seems seems
like<00:05:12.410> it's<00:05:12.530> kind<00:05:12.710> of<00:05:12.740> heavy<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:14.870> be<00:05:15.260> on<00:05:15.380> the

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
like it's kind of heavy to be on the

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.900 
like it's kind of heavy to be on the
roof<00:05:15.620> with<00:05:15.800> those<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.250> know<00:05:16.370> there's<00:05:16.580> three

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
roof with those you know there's three

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.790 
roof with those you know there's three
small<00:05:17.660> little<00:05:17.900> magnets<00:05:18.290> but<00:05:19.419> but<00:05:20.419> hey<00:05:20.800> you

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
small little magnets but but hey you

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.890 
small little magnets but but hey you
know<00:05:21.919> they<00:05:22.850> did<00:05:23.030> stuff<00:05:23.270> back<00:05:23.450> then<00:05:23.660> that<00:05:23.840> we

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
know they did stuff back then that we

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.360 
know they did stuff back then that we
don't<00:05:24.080> do<00:05:24.169> now<00:05:24.350> and<00:05:24.590> we<00:05:24.740> do<00:05:24.919> things<00:05:25.160> now<00:05:25.250> that

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
don't do now and we do things now that

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.930 
don't do now and we do things now that
they<00:05:25.700> didn't<00:05:25.940> do<00:05:26.030> back<00:05:26.210> then<00:05:26.479> and<00:05:26.690> I<00:05:27.940> don't

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
they didn't do back then and I don't

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.520 
they didn't do back then and I don't
know<00:05:29.000> but<00:05:29.780> I<00:05:29.840> thought<00:05:29.960> this<00:05:30.080> would<00:05:30.199> be<00:05:30.289> a<00:05:30.320> cool

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
know but I thought this would be a cool

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.770 
know but I thought this would be a cool
little<00:05:30.729> quick<00:05:31.729> video<00:05:32.030> just<00:05:32.090> to<00:05:32.360> show<00:05:32.450> you<00:05:32.630> what

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
little quick video just to show you what

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.050 
little quick video just to show you what
a<00:05:32.810> whale<00:05:33.020> and<00:05:33.200> deputy<00:05:33.560> looks<00:05:33.770> like<00:05:34.030> there<00:05:35.030> are

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
a whale and deputy looks like there are

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.620 
a whale and deputy looks like there are
also<00:05:35.330> other<00:05:36.490> versions<00:05:37.490> that<00:05:38.200> are<00:05:40.630> very

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
also other versions that are very

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.760 
also other versions that are very
similar<00:05:41.870> this<00:05:42.110> light<00:05:42.320> I<00:05:42.350> think<00:05:42.560> they<00:05:42.620> have<00:05:42.740> a

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
similar this light I think they have a

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.080 
similar this light I think they have a
smaller<00:05:43.039> dome

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:53.050 

probably<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.270> same<00:05:48.729> mirrored<00:05:50.830> deal<00:05:51.830> on<00:05:52.460> the

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
probably the same mirrored deal on the

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.350 
probably the same mirrored deal on the
inside<00:05:53.330> I<00:05:53.630> know<00:05:54.349> one<00:05:54.740> is<00:05:54.889> called<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.400> whale

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
inside I know one is called the whale

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.029 
inside I know one is called the whale
and<00:05:56.539> corporal<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:58.389> I<00:05:59.389> believe<00:05:59.750> the<00:06:00.020> the<00:06:00.050> roto

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
and corporal and I believe the the roto

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.270 
and corporal and I believe the the roto
beam<00:06:01.310> is<00:06:01.639> also<00:06:02.479> a<00:06:02.510> similar<00:06:03.200> derivative<00:06:04.070> of

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
beam is also a similar derivative of

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.920 
beam is also a similar derivative of
this<00:06:04.460> this<00:06:04.760> they're<00:06:05.000> on<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.210> same<00:06:05.389> family<00:06:05.900> I

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
this this they're on the same family I

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.270 
this this they're on the same family I
from<00:06:06.349> my<00:06:06.470> understanding<00:06:06.650> so<00:06:09.190> anyway<00:06:10.190> I<00:06:10.220> just

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
from my understanding so anyway I just

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.490 
from my understanding so anyway I just
want<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.639> make<00:06:10.729> a<00:06:10.789> short<00:06:11.090> little<00:06:11.210> video

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
want to make a short little video

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.980 
want to make a short little video
showing<00:06:12.500> you<00:06:12.770> my<00:06:13.460> Weyland<00:06:13.880> deputy<00:06:14.210> let<00:06:14.900> me

showing you my Weyland deputy let me
show<00:06:15.139> you<00:06:15.229> the<00:06:15.349> other<00:06:15.440> thing<00:06:15.800> that<00:06:15.830> I<00:06:16.250> guess

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
show you the other thing that I guess

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.230 
show you the other thing that I guess
you<00:06:16.789> would<00:06:17.030> say<00:06:17.180> is<00:06:17.300> wrong<00:06:17.479> with<00:06:17.720> the<00:06:17.870> light

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
you would say is wrong with the light

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.520 
you would say is wrong with the light
and<00:06:20.470> that<00:06:21.470> would<00:06:21.590> be<00:06:21.740> the<00:06:22.190> crack<00:06:22.460> in<00:06:22.669> the<00:06:22.760> base

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
and that would be the crack in the base

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.969 
and that would be the crack in the base
which<00:06:24.530> is<00:06:24.560> right<00:06:24.889> there<00:06:25.750> so<00:06:26.750> it<00:06:27.620> goes<00:06:27.800> up

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
which is right there so it goes up

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.320 
which is right there so it goes up
pretty<00:06:28.190> high<00:06:28.370> it<00:06:28.430> goes<00:06:28.639> up<00:06:28.820> to<00:06:28.940> like<00:06:28.970> right

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
pretty high it goes up to like right

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.530 
pretty high it goes up to like right
here<00:06:31.000> but<00:06:32.000> there<00:06:32.210> is<00:06:32.240> a<00:06:32.360> crack<00:06:32.690> in<00:06:32.870> it

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
here but there is a crack in it

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.850 
here but there is a crack in it
don't<00:06:35.540> know<00:06:35.630> if<00:06:35.720> that's<00:06:35.840> a<00:06:35.900> big<00:06:36.050> deal<00:06:36.290> don't

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
don't know if that's a big deal don't

don't know if that's a big deal don't
know<00:06:37.009> if<00:06:37.100> it<00:06:37.190> takes<00:06:37.340> away<00:06:37.580> from<00:06:37.610> the<00:06:38.199> value<00:06:39.199> I'm

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440
