00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.130
 dv 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.310
 yes 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.050
 increases things 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.050
 and if they do not give it to you it's supposed 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.430
 but death helps give you a 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.430
 trophy 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.890
 and that's how it goes to you 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.899
 We are here and this takes everything now you're going 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.140
 you risk but have given the head 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.250
 mine renga to see if you have another 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.820
 evolution yes if you kill me 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.820
 perhaps 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.620
 and how and where you see that does not become a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.620
 mission now the truth 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.760
 but only 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.229
 how handsome we have seen you as a fact and 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.229
 another hour someone crappy 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:24.330
 I'm going to kill you has my head 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.330
 and where you should invent 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.830
 anyway I kill you it 's real not 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.830
 come 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.530
 very good when warning speaks and today I'm going 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.010
 to talk about one of the secrets that 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.510
 there are in vigo flayers with the last two 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.650
 new characters that have just come out 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.560
 that one was come, it's worth up to here 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.230
 purple team and another is cacique who is 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.900
 around here the blue team around the 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.800
 minute 25 a thing like this activates a 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.550
 search usually comes out here below 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.390
 the deaths and so on that is like that 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.540
 has opened the hunt, and then the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.000
 first who gets killed or taken away 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.200
 an aid by killing the team champion 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.390
 otherwise a bonus is carried 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.220
 This is a game that you play with 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.060
 my friends 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.819
 and as you will see now come 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.360
 get kill almost 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.610
 take a bonus 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.290
 and it takes the help and how you have seen 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.700
 here 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.920
 the object that has to reign to see 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.040
 default 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.459
 changes becomes the head of 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.250
 castings and gives the two 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.260
 passive that you can read here that the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.410
 jump of queen of the gain 150 of reach 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.630
 additional and the duration of emotion by 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.550
 the hunt increases in three seconds 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.230
 also the next skill that 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.060
 watch back active of emotion for the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.260
 hunting generates an additional speed 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.750
 and as you can see is a similarity 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.890
 the inverse predator in this game is a 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.120
 simple that they have wanted to put the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.360
 river there they have a flare murdered their 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.280
 enemy of another world that would be the alien 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.739
 almost and has shown the whole world 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.819
 which is the ultimate hunter as in the 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:40.120
 saga of movies so well this is 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.879
 what happens there is not nothing else is 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.000
 just an anecdote to anime his 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:50.320
 dish yes instead of 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.260
 if instead of coming from the subject it is here 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.930
 if it were the other way around 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.420
 say what you have is an evolution 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.640
 additional for your skills that 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.879
 can have 3 out of 4 because I could have 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.460
 four if I get another video for in 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.290
 the one that comes out 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.230
 the four evolutions of cÃ¡ceres what 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.710
 I will try then the most and you see it is worth and 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.710
 nothing else 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:22.870
 no longer but yes yes 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.870
 like if you show
