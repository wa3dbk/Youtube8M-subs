00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.910
 today you will learn a little about 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.130
 camouflage and mimicry the camouflage nothing 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.200
 more is than important characteristic 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
 which has been shaped over several 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.180
 evolutionary processes together with the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.550
 mimicry but the camouflage it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.250
 related to the shape of the organism or 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 with its colors its ambient morphology 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.849
 where he lives 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.519
 already mimicry is a characteristic of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.529
 urban 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.960
 already invernista the same way is a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.180
 characteristic of organisms but are 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.280
 characteristics that are similar to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.559
 other non-environmentally friendly organisms 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 they live for this reason in reverse 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.510
 of what many people think camouflage is not 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.190
 only coloring actually exist 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.289
 various types of camouflage as per 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.690
 camouflage related to 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.250
 morphology of the animal with camouflage 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 also related to the type of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.329
 behavior is that it has several 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.410
 other specific characteristics of 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.180
 each species 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.100
 so when we talk about camouflage 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.059
 there are basically two types of 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.670
 camouflage 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.200
 the camouflage that through the color that we 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.290
 we call it an economy 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.110
 the one with the critical color and finished 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.360
 scourge of the bdp is with the organism has 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.580
 similar to the environment in which 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.189
 he lives at an economy or color 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.280
 critical is the type of camouflage most 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.140
 that there is for example a polar 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.490
 arctic fox are well camouflaged in the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.350
 environment in which they find themselves 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.939
 the lion on the African savanna is then 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 very calm fado you can see in this 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.810
 urutau image is a very 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.030
 interesting because it has a kind of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.650
 camouflage related to its coloring and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.700
 also the behavior that it is there 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.560
 stop setting up a place and people 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.000
 you can even touch it 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.549
 you will not get involved because you believe 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.409
 faithfully camouflaged 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.509
 so chrome is the type of camouflage 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.020
 related to the body color and 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.700
 environment in which he lives already is 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.649
 the shape of the organism or some 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.740
 changes in your body because they are 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.930
 related to the environment 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.659
 for example fish stone and livingsocial 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.270
 several coral barriers is a great 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.120
 predator and it is there that those 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.950
 corals is very noticeable. 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.390
 well adapted to the environment in which he lives 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.610
 in addition we also have some 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.280
 other organisms including insects or 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.920
 even the leaf bug has a fame 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.090
 very interesting and looks very much like 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.640
 mimicry flowers as I had already spoken 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.769
 it is nothing more than a set of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.290
 characteristics of a particular organism 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.250
 which do so is very similar to other 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.200
 organisms 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.470
 there are basically three types of 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.319
 mimicry 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.450
 day tac mimicry of production obtained 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.630
 base year that is an example of mimicry 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.360
 defense occurs for example when a 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.239
 cone body copy in the body model 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.640
 which in a way unduly improperly 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.549
 their predators, for example some 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.980
 moths possess the heavens are those 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.319
 eyes to the nasa and when they are houses 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.320
 open they end up appearing the other 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.959
 animal the big eye such that a simple 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.630
 moth and because of this a bird 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.180
 feels much more intimidated in risking 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.890
 an attack on that moth than on the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.750
 another brand that has not put 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.500
 a coloring is a characteristic as 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.870
 That 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.030
 the immediacy miley year which is another 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.670
 type of defense mimic occurs 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.049
 when the copy organism resembles 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.820
 another model organism that is 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.709
 toxic palatable 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.989
 the also poisonous we can cite by 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.480
 example a species of butterfly 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.870
 notable that it can be consumed 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.640
 by various types of organisms and shots and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.819
 she is very like the butterfly 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.340
 Monarch is an unpalatable butterfly or 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.079
 whether insectivorous organisms avoid 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.090
 treat these butterflies and palatable 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.950
 even if they do not know if they are 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.440
 words or not because it resembles 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.200
 to a butterfly they already know and 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.100
 which are in palatable young even of 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.140
 attack is when the body copies and 6 1 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.210
 another model organism to get some 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.180
 advantage of obtaining a particular 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.190
 resource for example we have many 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.530
 species of spiders that mimic 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.120
 families and the news not so 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.070
 perfectly these families 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.440
 they are able to infiltrate 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.300
 ants and within the anthills 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.500
 they are able to obtain several 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.660
 resources 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.820
 we still have reproductive mimicry 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.730
 some plants have several 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.070
 very different characteristics and 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.480
 some have these characteristics 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.510
 that we call mimicry 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.130
 because they look like insects 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.840
 so when it looks like insects 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.730
 they tend to attract more insects 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.040
 including some insects that 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.110
 similar is this type of morphology of 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.660
 flower or other insects end up 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.660
 feeding there or even visiting 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.980
 that by these visits and movements 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.930
 they end up loading big 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.750
 quantities of bridge to several other 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.180
 flowers and only very evolutionary strategy 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.880
 important is directly related to 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.290
 with the reproductive success of this species 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.180
 but it's not just a plant that exists 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.980
 mechanism is productive there is no 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.010
 mollusc species that mimic her 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.560
 by the fish and so when several others 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.720
 fish are not attacks on her 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.000
 ends up eliminating several ponds 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.500
 these areas will remain within the ranges of 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.500
 fish and does not develop 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:35.510
 alencar showing cuts were 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:39.140
 coming from esmal base isna close the news 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:43.230
 explorer weak and debut 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:47.450
 drogba made the europe slayer of
