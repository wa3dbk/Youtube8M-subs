as<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:32.750> can<00:01:32.900> see<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.800> great<00:01:34.040> erosion<00:01:34.580> plate

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
as you can see the great erosion plate

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.870 
as you can see the great erosion plate
meets<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.300> African<00:01:35.780> plate<00:01:35.990> at<00:01:36.230> that<00:01:36.380> location

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
meets the African plate at that location

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.940 
meets the African plate at that location
during<00:01:37.880> such<00:01:38.240> confrontations<00:01:39.140> one<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.890> the

plates has to give the Mediterranean has

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.970 
plates has to give the Mediterranean has
dropped<00:01:43.610> over<00:01:43.850> time<00:01:44.210> in<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:45.080> past<00:01:45.290> being<00:01:45.800> a
