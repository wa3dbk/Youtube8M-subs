00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.060 

okay<00:00:01.199> in<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.380> video<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:01.740> going<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.949> do<00:00:02.040> a

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
okay in this video I'm going to do a

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.539 
okay in this video I'm going to do a
triple<00:00:02.550> integral<00:00:02.700> in<00:00:03.030> spherical<00:00:03.540> coordinates

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
triple integral in spherical coordinates

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.120 
triple integral in spherical coordinates
basically<00:00:05.549> it<00:00:05.640> says<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.000> go<00:00:06.120> from<00:00:06.450> regular

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.130 
basically it says to go from regular

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.839 
basically it says to go from regular
Cartesian<00:00:08.130> coordinates<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.790> spherical

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
Cartesian coordinates to spherical

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.180 
Cartesian coordinates to spherical
coordinates<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.840> replace<00:00:10.170> X<00:00:10.500> with<00:00:10.679> it's

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
coordinates you replace X with it's

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.339 
coordinates you replace X with it's
normally<00:00:11.969> two<00:00:12.150> row<00:00:12.330> I'm<00:00:12.660> going<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.840> call<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.110> P

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
normally two row I'm going to call it P

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.340 
normally two row I'm going to call it P
so<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.889> replace<00:00:14.219> X<00:00:14.519> with<00:00:14.610> P<00:00:14.990> sine<00:00:15.990> Phi<00:00:16.320> cosine

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
so we replace X with P sine Phi cosine

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.439 
so we replace X with P sine Phi cosine
theta<00:00:17.160> Y<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:17.970> P<00:00:18.270> sine<00:00:18.750> V<00:00:19.199> sine<00:00:19.800> theta<00:00:20.119> Z<00:00:21.119> we'll

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
theta Y with P sine V sine theta Z we'll

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.910 
theta Y with P sine V sine theta Z we'll
replace<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:22.109> P<00:00:22.350> cosine<00:00:22.740> V<00:00:24.439> and<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.800> have

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
replace that with P cosine V and we have

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
replace that with P cosine V and we have
to<00:00:26.070> multiply<00:00:26.250> all<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> ran<00:00:27.240> out<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.390> room

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
to multiply all that I ran out of room

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.350 
to multiply all that I ran out of room
by<00:00:27.990> P<00:00:28.050> squared<00:00:28.880> sine<00:00:29.880> V<00:00:30.320> DP<00:00:31.320> D<00:00:31.769> theta<00:00:32.009> DV<00:00:32.430> so

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
by P squared sine V DP D theta DV so

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.150 
by P squared sine V DP D theta DV so
again<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.809> spherical<00:00:34.500> coordinates<00:00:34.980> we

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
again in spherical coordinates we

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.780 
again in spherical coordinates we
describe<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.700> point<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:37.530> first<00:00:37.800> coordinate<00:00:38.190> P

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
describe a point the first coordinate P

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.240 
describe a point the first coordinate P
or<00:00:39.120> Rho<00:00:39.390> again<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.200> call<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.379> P<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
or Rho again I'm going to call it P that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.760 
or Rho again I'm going to call it P that
represents<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> link<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.750> okay<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.440> we

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
represents the link to go out okay so we

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.010 
represents the link to go out okay so we
go<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:43.980> some<00:00:44.190> distance<00:00:44.730> theta<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> angle

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
go out some distance theta is the angle

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.180 
go out some distance theta is the angle
made<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> XY<00:00:47.309> plane<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.890> this<00:00:49.890> angle

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
made in the XY plane and then this angle

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.090 
made in the XY plane and then this angle
Rho<00:00:50.820> or<00:00:51.539> excuse<00:00:51.780> me<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.050> angle<00:00:52.440> fee<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.980> going

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
Rho or excuse me this angle fee is going

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100 
Rho or excuse me this angle fee is going
to<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> angle<00:00:53.879> made<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> positive<00:00:54.899> z

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to be the angle made with the positive z

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.630 
to be the angle made with the positive z
axis<00:00:56.239> okay<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.329> let's<00:00:57.629> do<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> problem<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.640> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
axis okay so let's do a problem here so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.680 
axis okay so let's do a problem here so
in<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.820> case<00:01:00.030> we're<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> evaluate

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
in this case we're going to evaluate

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.380 
in this case we're going to evaluate
this<00:01:01.170> triple<00:01:01.710> integral<00:01:01.800> x<00:01:02.430> squared<00:01:02.940> plus<00:01:03.180> y

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
this triple integral x squared plus y

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.899 
this triple integral x squared plus y
squared<00:01:03.420> plus<00:01:03.960> Z<00:01:04.170> squared<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.519> region

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
squared plus Z squared and the region

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.460 
squared plus Z squared and the region
we're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> integrate<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.810> over<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
we're going to integrate it over is the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
we're going to integrate it over is the
unit<00:01:07.770> ball<00:01:07.920> x<00:01:08.280> squared<00:01:08.580> plus<00:01:08.790> y<00:01:09.000> squared<00:01:09.030> plus

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
unit ball x squared plus y squared plus

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.789 
unit ball x squared plus y squared plus
Z<00:01:09.750> squared<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.030> simply<00:01:12.770> basically<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
Z squared and that is simply basically a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.830 
Z squared and that is simply basically a
sphere<00:01:13.979> centered<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.820> origin<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.479> radius

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
sphere centered at the origin of radius

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.520 
sphere centered at the origin of radius
1<00:01:16.970> one<00:01:17.970> thing<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> notice<00:01:18.479> that's<00:01:18.840> useful<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
1 one thing to notice that's useful is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.109 
1 one thing to notice that's useful is
that<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.009> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> turn<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
that it's going to turn out that if you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.609 
that it's going to turn out that if you
take<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.830> justify<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.490> x<00:01:24.000> squared

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
take and you can justify this x squared

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.120 
take and you can justify this x squared
plus<00:01:25.619> y<00:01:25.920> squared<00:01:25.950> plus<00:01:26.790> Z<00:01:27.420> squared<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.950> can

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
plus y squared plus Z squared we can

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.260 
plus y squared plus Z squared we can
actually<00:01:29.340> show<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.360> equals<00:01:30.689> P<00:01:31.350> squared

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
actually show that that equals P squared

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
actually show that that equals P squared
so<00:01:33.270> we're<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.600> use<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.259> our

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
so we're going to use that to our

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.980 
so we're going to use that to our
advantage<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:35.159> sure<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
advantage for sure and this is one of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.550 
advantage for sure and this is one of
the<00:01:37.049> reasons<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> simplifies<00:01:38.159> integrals<00:01:39.560> this

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the reasons it simplifies integrals this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.780 
the reasons it simplifies integrals this
is<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> whole<00:01:41.009> reason<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.640> use

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
is the whole reason that we use

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.700 
is the whole reason that we use
spherical<00:01:42.240> coordinates<00:01:43.020> over<00:01:43.290> certain

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
spherical coordinates over certain

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.810 
spherical coordinates over certain
regions

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
regions

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.370 
regions
okay<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:48.909> so<00:01:49.909> again<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.570> integrate<00:01:50.899> x<00:01:51.110> squared

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
okay so so again to integrate x squared

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.959 
okay so so again to integrate x squared
plus<00:01:51.590> y<00:01:51.770> squared<00:01:51.799> plus<00:01:52.310> Z<00:01:52.340> squared<00:01:52.820> that's

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
plus y squared plus Z squared that's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.120 
plus y squared plus Z squared that's
going<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.240> be<00:01:53.360> equivalent<00:01:53.659> to<00:01:53.960> our<00:01:53.990> P<00:01:54.740> squared

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
going to be equivalent to our P squared

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.639 
going to be equivalent to our P squared
and<00:01:55.460> then<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.360> says<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:57.110> have<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.439> tack<00:01:57.619> on

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
and then it says you have to tack on

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.480 
and then it says you have to tack on
this<00:01:58.039> extra<00:01:58.520> little<00:01:58.759> bit<00:01:58.970> this<00:01:59.329> P<00:01:59.869> squared

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
this extra little bit this P squared

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:12.040 
this extra little bit this P squared
times<00:02:01.490> sine<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.450> P<00:02:04.149> DP<00:02:05.979> D<00:02:06.979> theta<00:02:08.380> DV<00:02:10.599> okay<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:11.660> my

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
times sine of P DP D theta DV okay so my

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.979 
times sine of P DP D theta DV okay so my
outside<00:02:12.800> limits<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.459> integration<00:02:13.930> well<00:02:14.930> I

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
outside limits of integration well I

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.270 
outside limits of integration well I
guess<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.290> doesn't<00:02:15.380> matter<00:02:15.680> let's<00:02:16.130> think

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
guess it doesn't matter let's think

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.850 
guess it doesn't matter let's think
about<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.640> inside<00:02:17.000> one<00:02:17.209> first<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:17.870> he's<00:02:18.620> going

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
about the inside one first so he's going

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.220 
about the inside one first so he's going
to<00:02:18.920> be<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.730> link<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.569> go<00:02:20.840> out<00:02:20.870> from<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
to be the link that you go out from the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.530 
to be the link that you go out from the
origin<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:22.040> we'll<00:02:22.549> start<00:02:22.849> at<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.030> distance<00:02:23.420> of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
origin so we'll start at a distance of

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.080 
origin so we'll start at a distance of
zero<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.680> go<00:02:24.799> out<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.130> edge<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.670> sphere

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
zero to go out to the edge of the sphere

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.640 
zero to go out to the edge of the sphere
we<00:02:26.299> would<00:02:26.420> have<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.660> go<00:02:26.780> out<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.019> a<00:02:27.049> distance<00:02:27.290> of

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
we would have to go out to a distance of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.270 
we would have to go out to a distance of
one<00:02:28.750> theta<00:02:29.750> that's<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.440> angle<00:02:30.799> made<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
one theta that's the angle made in the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.850 
one theta that's the angle made in the
XY<00:02:31.790> plane<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:33.140> if<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.319> think<00:02:33.440> about<00:02:33.590> the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
XY plane so if you think about the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.650 
XY plane so if you think about the
sphere<00:02:34.370> it's<00:02:34.640> certainly<00:02:35.000> going<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.180> go<00:02:35.330> all

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
sphere it's certainly going to go all

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.410 
sphere it's certainly going to go all
the<00:02:35.810> way<00:02:35.840> around<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.349> XY<00:02:36.769> plane<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.430> theta<00:02:38.299> is

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
the way around the XY plane so theta is

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.410 
the way around the XY plane so theta is
going<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.630> have<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.959> range<00:02:39.230> from<00:02:39.709> zero<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:41.180> two

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
going to have to range from zero to two

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.190 
going to have to range from zero to two
pi<00:02:41.709> if<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:44.180> were<00:02:44.329> to<00:02:44.480> imagine<00:02:44.870> kind<00:02:45.049> of

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
pi if you were to imagine kind of

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.410 
pi if you were to imagine kind of
tilting<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:45.890> three-dimensional<00:02:46.760> region<00:02:47.180> so

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
tilting this three-dimensional region so

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.930 
tilting this three-dimensional region so
that<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.590> x<00:02:48.769> axis<00:02:49.250> was<00:02:49.430> kind<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.700> looking

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
that the the x axis was kind of looking

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.300 
that the the x axis was kind of looking
right<00:02:50.120> at<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:51.350> would<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:51.769> you'd

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
right at you you would get you'd

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.099 
right at you you would get you'd
basically<00:02:52.489> be<00:02:52.730> looking<00:02:53.120> at<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.359> ball<00:02:53.750> kind<00:02:54.019> of

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
basically be looking at the ball kind of

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.059 
basically be looking at the ball kind of
exactly<00:02:54.590> from<00:02:54.739> its<00:02:54.920> side<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.799> would<00:02:57.980> be

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
exactly from its side so this would be

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.009 
exactly from its side so this would be
now<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.280> y<00:02:58.579> axis<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.329> this<00:02:59.420> would<00:02:59.569> be<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.810> z

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
now the y axis and this would be the z

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.900 
now the y axis and this would be the z
axis<00:03:00.470> so<00:03:00.500> there's<00:03:00.799> my<00:03:00.920> bad<00:03:01.160> little<00:03:01.519> ball

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
axis so there's my bad little ball

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.460 
axis so there's my bad little ball
looking<00:03:02.299> at<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.510> from<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.720> side<00:03:02.930> not<00:03:02.959> very

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
looking at it from the side not very

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.539 
looking at it from the side not very
centered<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.130> whatever<00:03:04.430> if<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.780> think<00:03:06.019> about

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
centered but whatever if you think about

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.190 
centered but whatever if you think about
fee<00:03:07.549> fees<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.299> angle<00:03:08.630> made<00:03:08.840> with<00:03:09.079> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
fee fees the angle made with the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.890 
fee fees the angle made with the
positive<00:03:09.739> z<00:03:09.950> axis<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.000> go<00:03:11.480> around<00:03:11.780> the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
positive z axis so to go around the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.729 
positive z axis so to go around the
circle<00:03:12.350> we<00:03:12.530> could<00:03:12.799> go<00:03:12.950> from<00:03:13.190> zero<00:03:13.519> down<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.239> pi

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
circle we could go from zero down to pi

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.110 
circle we could go from zero down to pi
notice<00:03:15.739> we<00:03:15.889> don't<00:03:16.100> have<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.400> go<00:03:16.519> all<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.090> way

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
notice we don't have to go all the way

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.280 
notice we don't have to go all the way
to<00:03:17.299> 2<00:03:17.600> pi<00:03:17.840> because<00:03:18.829> as<00:03:19.250> fee<00:03:20.060> ranges<00:03:20.420> from<00:03:20.900> zero

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
to 2 pi because as fee ranges from zero

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.190 
to 2 pi because as fee ranges from zero
to<00:03:21.440> pi<00:03:21.650> as<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:23.150> angle<00:03:23.690> gets<00:03:23.959> basically

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
to pi as that angle gets basically

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.479 
to pi as that angle gets basically
twisted<00:03:25.160> around<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.750> XY<00:03:27.200> plane<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.950> is<00:03:28.280> going

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
twisted around the XY plane it is going

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.170 
twisted around the XY plane it is going
to<00:03:28.579> account<00:03:28.940> for<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.359> entire<00:03:29.720> sphere<00:03:30.370> okay<00:03:31.370> so

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
to account for the entire sphere okay so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.449 
to account for the entire sphere okay so
this<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:33.019> kind<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.380> trickiest<00:03:33.799> part<00:03:34.220> I

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
this is kind of the trickiest part I

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.009 
this is kind of the trickiest part I
think<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.850> just<00:03:35.060> setting<00:03:35.359> up<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.600> regions

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
think is just setting up the regions

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.080 
think is just setting up the regions
correctly<00:03:36.590> okay<00:03:37.130> once<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:37.519> get<00:03:37.639> to<00:03:37.760> here<00:03:37.790> it's

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
correctly okay once you get to here it's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.580 
correctly okay once you get to here it's
not<00:03:38.269> too<00:03:38.450> bad

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
not too bad

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.380 
not too bad
so<00:03:40.590> now<00:03:40.740> to<00:03:40.800> integrate<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.520> we're<00:03:42.240> going<00:03:42.330> to

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
so now to integrate this we're going to

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.540 
so now to integrate this we're going to
use<00:03:42.599> a<00:03:42.630> little<00:03:42.930> trick<00:03:43.110> from<00:03:43.470> fubini's<00:03:44.280> theorem

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
use a little trick from fubini's theorem

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.880 
use a little trick from fubini's theorem
that<00:03:44.760> basically<00:03:45.270> says<00:03:45.709> if<00:03:46.709> you're

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
that basically says if you're

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.309 
that basically says if you're
integrating<00:03:47.130> over<00:03:47.730> at<00:03:48.270> least<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.690> one<00:03:48.840> case<00:03:48.870> if

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
integrating over at least in one case if

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.839 
integrating over at least in one case if
you're<00:03:49.440> integrating<00:03:49.980> over<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.250> rectangular

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
you're integrating over a rectangular

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.320 
you're integrating over a rectangular
region<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:52.010> your<00:03:53.010> integrand<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.180> all

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
region and your integrand is all

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330 
region and your integrand is all
factored<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.110> can<00:03:55.260> basically<00:03:55.440> bust<00:03:55.980> up<00:03:56.190> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
factored you can basically bust up the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.050 
factored you can basically bust up the
integral<00:03:57.739> so<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.860> says<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.220> were<00:03:59.310> going<00:03:59.580> from<00:03:59.700> 0

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
integral so it says we were going from 0

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.610 
integral so it says we were going from 0
to<00:04:00.180> PI<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.850> stuff<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:03.840> went<00:04:04.140> with<00:04:04.260> 0<00:04:04.560> to

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
to PI and the stuff that went with 0 to

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.240 
to PI and the stuff that went with 0 to
pi<00:04:04.860> was<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.340> DV<00:04:05.930> well<00:04:06.930> notice<00:04:07.290> here's<00:04:07.530> my<00:04:07.709> sign

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
pi was the DV well notice here's my sign

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.110 
pi was the DV well notice here's my sign
fee<00:04:08.580> term<00:04:08.819> so<00:04:09.209> I'm<00:04:09.360> going<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.540> get<00:04:09.690> sign<00:04:09.959> fee<00:04:11.120> D

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
fee term so I'm going to get sign fee D

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.640 
fee term so I'm going to get sign fee D
fee<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.470> takes<00:04:13.620> care<00:04:13.769> of<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:14.220> part<00:04:14.519> and

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
fee so that takes care of that part and

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.140 
fee so that takes care of that part and
then<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.769> says<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.430> next<00:04:17.609> limits<00:04:18.060> of

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
then it says the next limits of

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.180 
then it says the next limits of
integration<00:04:18.269> 0<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.049> 2pi<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.680> one<00:04:19.799> with<00:04:19.919> theta

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
integration 0 to 2pi that one with theta

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.300 
integration 0 to 2pi that one with theta
notice<00:04:21.090> there's<00:04:21.299> no<00:04:21.450> theta<00:04:22.049> inside<00:04:22.740> there<00:04:23.070> so

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
notice there's no theta inside there so

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.909 
notice there's no theta inside there so
I'm<00:04:23.400> just<00:04:23.520> going<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.700> write<00:04:23.880> 0<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.330> 2pi<00:04:24.720> times<00:04:25.530> 1

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
I'm just going to write 0 to 2pi times 1

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.320 
I'm just going to write 0 to 2pi times 1
d<00:04:26.820> theta<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:28.580> then<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.729> only<00:04:29.940> thing<00:04:30.150> that

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
d theta and then the only thing that

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.360 
d theta and then the only thing that
we're<00:04:30.450> left<00:04:30.630> with<00:04:30.870> after<00:04:31.229> that<00:04:31.260> is<00:04:31.740> basically

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
we're left with after that is basically

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.570 
we're left with after that is basically
P<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.940> fourth<00:04:34.880> DP<00:04:35.880> from<00:04:36.600> 0<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.169> 1<00:04:37.380> so<00:04:37.620> now

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
P to the fourth DP from 0 to 1 so now

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.830 
P to the fourth DP from 0 to 1 so now
I'm<00:04:38.700> just<00:04:38.820> going<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.060> calculate<00:04:39.330> these

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
I'm just going to calculate these

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.640 
I'm just going to calculate these
individually<00:04:40.710> ok<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:41.940> if<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.090> integrate<00:04:42.650> sine

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
individually ok so if you integrate sine

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.760 
individually ok so if you integrate sine
fee<00:04:43.979> we'll<00:04:44.340> get<00:04:44.490> negative<00:04:44.669> cosine<00:04:45.360> fee<00:04:45.990> this

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
fee we'll get negative cosine fee this

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.300 
fee we'll get negative cosine fee this
has<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.130> be<00:04:47.250> evaluated<00:04:47.520> from<00:04:48.030> 0<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.479> PI<00:04:49.190> if<00:04:50.190> you

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
has to be evaluated from 0 to PI if you

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.790 
has to be evaluated from 0 to PI if you
integrate<00:04:50.490> 1<00:04:51.030> with<00:04:51.780> respect<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.289> theta

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
integrate 1 with respect to theta

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.279 
integrate 1 with respect to theta
we'll<00:04:52.919> just<00:04:53.070> get<00:04:53.250> theta<00:04:53.490> again<00:04:54.270> from<00:04:54.660> 0<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.050> 2pi

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
we'll just get theta again from 0 to 2pi

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.730 
we'll just get theta again from 0 to 2pi
and<00:04:55.880> then<00:04:56.880> if<00:04:56.970> we<00:04:57.090> integrate<00:04:57.450> P<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.289> fourth

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
and then if we integrate P to the fourth

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.120 
and then if we integrate P to the fourth
we'll<00:04:59.490> get<00:04:59.640> P<00:04:59.880> to<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.120> fifth<00:05:00.360> over<00:05:00.539> 5<00:05:01.100> from<00:05:02.100> 0

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
we'll get P to the fifth over 5 from 0

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.090 
we'll get P to the fifth over 5 from 0
to<00:05:02.490> 1<00:05:03.200> ok<00:05:04.200> so<00:05:04.260> now<00:05:04.500> it's<00:05:04.590> just<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.800> matter<00:05:04.919> of

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
to 1 ok so now it's just a matter of

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.590 
to 1 ok so now it's just a matter of
plugging<00:05:05.340> everything<00:05:05.580> in<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.180> being<00:05:06.270> careful

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
plugging everything in and being careful

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.460 
plugging everything in and being careful
so<00:05:07.440> we'll<00:05:07.560> get<00:05:07.680> negative<00:05:07.740> cosine<00:05:08.669> of<00:05:08.700> PI<00:05:09.470> minus

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
so we'll get negative cosine of PI minus

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.610 
so we'll get negative cosine of PI minus
negative<00:05:10.970> cosine<00:05:11.970> of<00:05:12.000> 0

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
negative cosine of 0

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.860 
negative cosine of 0
times<00:05:15.620> if<00:05:16.010> we<00:05:16.130> plug<00:05:16.340> in<00:05:16.370> 2<00:05:16.760> pi<00:05:17.030> we'll<00:05:17.510> just<00:05:17.720> get

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
times if we plug in 2 pi we'll just get

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.570 
times if we plug in 2 pi we'll just get
2<00:05:18.110> pi<00:05:18.320> minus<00:05:19.030> 0<00:05:20.030> for<00:05:20.390> our<00:05:20.450> theta<00:05:20.720> term<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:21.580> if

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
2 pi minus 0 for our theta term and if

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.880 
2 pi minus 0 for our theta term and if
we<00:05:22.730> plug<00:05:22.910> in<00:05:23.120> 1<00:05:23.150> we'll<00:05:23.600> get<00:05:23.750> 1<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.140> the<00:05:24.260> fifth<00:05:24.530> or

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
we plug in 1 we'll get 1 to the fifth or

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.010 
we plug in 1 we'll get 1 to the fifth or
1/5<00:05:25.640> minus<00:05:26.240> 0<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:28.340> we<00:05:28.610> know<00:05:28.730> that<00:05:28.910> cosine<00:05:29.300> of<00:05:29.600> pi

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
1/5 minus 0 so we know that cosine of pi

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.190 
1/5 minus 0 so we know that cosine of pi
cosine<00:05:30.590> of<00:05:30.890> pi<00:05:31.160> is<00:05:31.220> equal<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.640> negative<00:05:31.940> 1<00:05:32.390> with

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
cosine of pi is equal to negative 1 with

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.440 
cosine of pi is equal to negative 1 with
a<00:05:33.230> negative<00:05:33.500> we'll<00:05:33.800> get<00:05:33.920> a<00:05:33.950> positive<00:05:34.190> 1<00:05:34.550> cosine

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
a negative we'll get a positive 1 cosine

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.390 
a negative we'll get a positive 1 cosine
of<00:05:35.510> 0<00:05:35.870> is<00:05:35.990> also<00:05:36.200> 1<00:05:36.410> so<00:05:36.950> we're<00:05:37.070> going<00:05:37.160> to<00:05:37.220> get

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
of 0 is also 1 so we're going to get

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.960 
of 0 is also 1 so we're going to get
positive<00:05:37.970> 1<00:05:38.300> from<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.780> first<00:05:38.930> part<00:05:39.290> plus<00:05:39.770> 1<00:05:40.130> or

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
positive 1 from the first part plus 1 or

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.700 
positive 1 from the first part plus 1 or
2<00:05:41.450> times<00:05:41.750> 2<00:05:42.350> pi<00:05:42.590> times<00:05:43.520> 1/5<00:05:44.180> or<00:05:45.110> it<00:05:45.350> says<00:05:45.530> our

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
2 times 2 pi times 1/5 or it says our

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.560 
2 times 2 pi times 1/5 or it says our
final<00:05:46.160> solution<00:05:46.730> will<00:05:46.940> be<00:05:46.970> 4<00:05:47.390> PI<00:05:47.600> over<00:05:48.250> 5<00:05:49.570> all

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
final solution will be 4 PI over 5 all

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.030 
final solution will be 4 PI over 5 all
