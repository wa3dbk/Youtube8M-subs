you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.270> showcasing<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you know showcasing this it's one of the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
you know showcasing this it's one of the
world's<00:00:50.610> first<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.969> guess<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
world's first I guess because it's the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680 
world's first I guess because it's the
first<00:00:51.960> MIDI<00:00:52.829> integrated<00:00:53.520> turntable<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.539> we've

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
first MIDI integrated turntable so we've

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.930 
first MIDI integrated turntable so we've
now<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> MIDI<00:00:55.800> sitting<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
now got the MIDI sitting on the on the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.299 
now got the MIDI sitting on the on the
side<00:00:57.090> over<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.800> basically<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.920> plug<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
side over here basically it's plug and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.760 
side over here basically it's plug and
play<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.699> Serato<00:01:00.180> Scratch<00:01:00.329> Live<00:01:00.899> where

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
play into Serato Scratch Live where

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.260 
play into Serato Scratch Live where
you've<00:01:01.859> got<00:01:02.039> four<00:01:02.309> main<00:01:02.550> modes<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.969> you've<00:01:03.090> got

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you've got four main modes so you've got

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.800 
you've got four main modes so you've got
Q<00:01:03.629> loop<00:01:04.580> sample<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> user<00:01:06.180> mode<00:01:06.420> which<00:01:06.630> we've

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
Q loop sample and user mode which we've

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
Q loop sample and user mode which we've
actually<00:01:06.990> set<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> slicer<00:01:08.130> mode<00:01:08.460> or

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
actually set to like a slicer mode or

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.940 
actually set to like a slicer mode or
like<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> roll<00:01:09.479> mode<00:01:09.720> basically<00:01:10.260> so

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
like a like a roll mode basically so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.020 
like a like a roll mode basically so
it's<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> first<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> world<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's the first in the world to do that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.969 
it's the first in the world to do that
one<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> big<00:01:13.140> questions<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.619> has<00:01:13.770> come

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
one of the big questions that has come

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
one of the big questions that has come
up<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:14.880> using<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> this

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
up with it as if I'm using it is this

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.090 
up with it as if I'm using it is this
gonna<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.990> knocking<00:01:16.170> needle<00:01:16.680> around<00:01:16.799> or

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
gonna be knocking needle around or

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.560 
gonna be knocking needle around or
anything<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:18.060> spend<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.360> lot<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
anything like that we spend a lot of

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.910 
anything like that we spend a lot of
time<00:01:18.810> actually<00:01:18.960> setting<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.619> shock

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
time actually setting up the shock

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.700 
time actually setting up the shock
absorption<00:01:20.460> underneath<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
absorption underneath so you get it this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.499 
absorption underneath so you get it this
very<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:23.670> play<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.119> you're<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.390> be

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
very little play that you're going to be

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.660 
very little play that you're going to be
having<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:26.189> terms<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
having there at all in terms of the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.330 
having there at all in terms of the
build<00:01:27.000> quality<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> RP<00:01:27.960> 8000<00:01:28.560> we've

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
build quality of the RP 8000 we've

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399 
build quality of the RP 8000 we've
actually<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:30.060> four<00:01:30.420> times<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.170> amount

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
actually now have four times the amount

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.660 
actually now have four times the amount
of<00:01:31.560> torque<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.159> would<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.400> from<00:01:32.520> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
of torque that you would have from a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
of torque that you would have from a
classic<00:01:33.150> turntable<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.290> we've<00:01:34.470> looked<00:01:34.740> at

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
classic turntable so we've looked at

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.100 
classic turntable so we've looked at
what<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> classic<00:01:35.460> turntable<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.689> we've

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
what the classic turntable was and we've

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.690 
what the classic turntable was and we've
really<00:01:37.350> pumped<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.950> steroids<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
really pumped it up on steroids so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.580 
really pumped it up on steroids so
everything<00:01:39.119> about<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.600> much<00:01:39.930> more<00:01:40.170> robust

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
everything about it is much more robust

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.350 
everything about it is much more robust
much<00:01:40.920> stronger<00:01:41.310> build<00:01:41.700> qualities<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> lot

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
much stronger build qualities a lot

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.960 
much stronger build qualities a lot
tougher<00:01:42.680> in<00:01:43.680> terms<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.399> talk<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.820> can

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
tougher in terms of your talk you can

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
tougher in terms of your talk you can
actually<00:01:45.270> set<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.509> from<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> classic<00:01:46.409> talked

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
actually set it from a classic talked

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
actually set it from a classic talked
over<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> far<00:01:48.689> left<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
over on the you know the far left and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
over on the you know the far left and
swing<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.710> right<00:01:49.829> around<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> full<00:01:50.850> talk<00:01:51.149> or

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
swing it right around to a full talk or

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.940 
swing it right around to a full talk or
maybe<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.140> want<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> call<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> real<00:01:52.770> loop

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
maybe what you want to call a real loop

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.560 
maybe what you want to call a real loop
talk<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.369> something<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.479> that's

talk or something like that so that's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.990 
talk or something like that so that's
really<00:01:54.810> exciting<00:01:55.009> in<00:01:56.009> terms<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.369> your<00:01:56.579> pitch

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
really exciting in terms of your pitch

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.149 
really exciting in terms of your pitch
control<00:01:57.450> you've<00:01:57.659> got<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.110> eight<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.649> sixteen

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159

press it together and you've got the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.780 
press it together and you've got the
fifty<00:02:01.320> percent<00:02:01.619> there<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> full<00:02:02.579> digital

fifty percent there with a full digital

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.330 
fifty percent there with a full digital
display<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.930> actually<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.920> highest

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

the<00:02:09.330> st.<00:02:09.540> pitch<00:02:09.869> resolution<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.710> think<00:02:11.070> that's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the st. pitch resolution I think that's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.750 
the st. pitch resolution I think that's

scratch live you can actually run in

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.400 
scratch live you can actually run in
series<00:02:38.910> as<00:02:39.210> sorry<00:02:39.780> series<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.260> can

actually link across and just have one
USB<00:02:42.570> going<00:02:42.990> into<00:02:43.200> your<00:02:43.320> computer<00:02:44.030> really<00:02:45.030> nice

and simple yeah so that's really
exciting<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.310> think<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.610> other<00:02:47.760> couple<00:02:48.090> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
exciting I think the other couple of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.280 
exciting I think the other couple of
things<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.450> we've<00:02:48.540> managed<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.959> do<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.170> we

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
things that we've managed to do is we

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.530 
things that we've managed to do is we
now<00:02:49.410> have<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.800> stop<00:02:50.100> stop<00:02:50.400> buttons<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:51.330> that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
now have to stop stop buttons like that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.570 
now have to stop stop buttons like that
for<00:02:51.840> hamster<00:02:52.440> control<00:02:52.770> or<00:02:52.950> normal<00:02:53.250> control

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
for hamster control or normal control

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.180 
for hamster control or normal control
and<00:02:54.000> there's<00:02:54.720> no<00:02:54.900> earth<00:02:55.140> wire<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.830> back<00:02:55.980> so

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
and there's no earth wire in the back so

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.680 
and there's no earth wire in the back so
you<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:56.490> plug<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.880> play<00:02:57.030> straight<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
you just plug and play straight in and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.000 
you just plug and play straight in and
away<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.900> go<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.440> don't<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:58.830> worry

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
away you go so you don't have to worry

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.500 
away you go so you don't have to worry
about<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.280> extra<00:02:59.580> third<00:02:59.820> wire<00:03:00.030> getting

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
about that extra third wire getting

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.420 
about that extra third wire getting
around<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.380> know<00:03:01.500> not<00:03:01.680> working<00:03:02.160> or
