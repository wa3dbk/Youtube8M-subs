business<00:01:46.590> card<00:01:46.829> we'll<00:01:47.310> we'll<00:01:48.090> work<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.389> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
business card we'll we'll work on the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.999 
business card we'll we'll work on the
bleeds<00:01:48.719> here<00:01:49.079> I'll<00:01:49.319> show<00:01:49.469> you<00:01:49.530> how<00:01:49.649> those<00:01:49.799> work

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
bleeds here I'll show you how those work

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.889 
bleeds here I'll show you how those work
so<00:01:50.729> say<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:50.999> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.359> a<00:01:51.389> business<00:01:51.569> card

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
so say you want to do a business card

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.889 
so say you want to do a business card
with<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.439> title<00:01:53.069> brick<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.819> top<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.270> full

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
with a title brick on the top a full

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.840 
with a title brick on the top a full
color<00:01:55.109> something<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.889> and<00:01:56.189> we'll<00:01:56.639> put

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
color something like that and we'll put

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.879 
color something like that and we'll put
you<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.569> business<00:01:57.869> name<00:01:58.020> probably<00:01:58.709> goes

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:58.889 
you know the business name probably goes

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:04.489 
you know the business name probably goes
here<00:01:59.630> something<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:02.240> it's<00:02:03.499> stretched

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
here something like that it's stretched

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.719 
here something like that it's stretched
out<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:04.829> bit<00:02:06.829> there<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:07.859> go<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.610> right

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
out a little bit there we go all right

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660 
out a little bit there we go all right
Center<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.360> okay<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.710> now<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.220> looks<00:02:11.490> fine

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
Center it okay and now this looks fine

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.310 
Center it okay and now this looks fine
this<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.570> trim<00:02:12.810> line<00:02:12.990> but<00:02:13.230> we

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
this is up to the trim line but we

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.870 
this is up to the trim line but we
actually<00:02:13.440> need<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.830> utilize<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> bleeds<00:02:14.580> for

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
actually need to utilize the bleeds for

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.760 
actually need to utilize the bleeds for
the<00:02:14.970> printing<00:02:15.270> company<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.020> prints<00:02:16.350> correct

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
the printing company so prints correct

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.280 
the printing company so prints correct
so<00:02:17.010> drag<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.910> background<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.140> way<00:02:19.230> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
so drag the background all the way to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.530 
so drag the background all the way to
the<00:02:19.560> bleed<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.820> how<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.030> bleed<00:02:21.300> works

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the bleed and that's how the bleed works

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.930 
the bleed and that's how the bleed works
so<00:02:22.110> now<00:02:22.230> it'll<00:02:22.560> trim<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.100> perfect<00:02:23.460> line<00:02:23.580> instead

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
so now it'll trim a perfect line instead

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.070 
so now it'll trim a perfect line instead
of<00:02:24.000> having<00:02:24.300> white<00:02:24.420> spaces<00:02:24.690> around<00:02:25.020> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
of having white spaces around the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.980 
of having white spaces around the
business<00:02:25.200> garden<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.340> now<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.210> want<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.600> just

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
we go and now usually with the safe line

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.440 
we go and now usually with the safe line
means<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.110> want<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.290> drag<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.860> text<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:12.300> that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
to put them up to the trim line because

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.390 
to put them up to the trim line because
the<00:03:18.810> trim<00:03:19.020> can<00:03:19.230> either<00:03:19.380> go<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:20.070> bit<00:03:20.160> more

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
the trim can either go a little bit more

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.450 
the trim can either go a little bit more
or<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.000> little<00:03:21.210> bit<00:03:21.330> less<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.680> that's<00:03:23.130> just<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
or a little bit less so that's just the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.350 
or a little bit less so that's just the
safe<00:03:23.640> one<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.330> now<00:03:24.450> we're<00:03:24.870> actually<00:03:24.960> going<00:03:25.320> to

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
safe one so now we're actually going to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.910 
safe one so now we're actually going to
there<00:03:27.360> we<00:03:27.450> go<00:03:27.570> cut<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.930> vision<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.650> bleeds

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
there we go cut the vision of the bleeds

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.570 
there we go cut the vision of the bleeds
and<00:03:29.130> then<00:03:29.850> we're<00:03:30.090> going<00:03:30.210> to<00:03:30.390> export<00:03:30.840> now

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
and then we're going to export now

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.670 
and then we're going to export now

CMYK<00:03:44.430> color<00:03:45.560> baselines<00:03:46.560> fine<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.130> then<00:03:47.550> we're

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
CMYK color baselines fine and then we're

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.220 
CMYK color baselines fine and then we're
going<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.880> change<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.270> resolution<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.900> high

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
going to change the resolution to a high

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.730 
going to change the resolution to a high
depth<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.720> entail<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> eyes<00:03:52.080> should<00:03:52.350> stay<00:03:52.710> on
