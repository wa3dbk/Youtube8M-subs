00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
the others because of the gravity swipe

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.560 
the others because of the gravity swipe
to<00:00:22.800> play<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.189> game<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.820> green<00:00:24.090> dotted<00:00:24.300> line

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
to play the game the green dotted line

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.900 
to play the game the green dotted line
is<00:00:24.750> important<00:00:25.380> for<00:00:25.800> your<00:00:25.949> spinning<00:00:26.490> now<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
is important for your spinning now the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.279 
is important for your spinning now the
way<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.240> works<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.779> move<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.140> ball

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
way this works is you move the ball

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.929 
way this works is you move the ball
horizontally<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.340> finger<00:00:29.699> swipe

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
horizontally with your finger swipe

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.749 
horizontally with your finger swipe
forward<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:31.050> throw<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.650> down<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> lane<00:00:32.250> now

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
forward to throw it down the lane now

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.000 
forward to throw it down the lane now
the<00:00:32.820> green<00:00:33.180> dotted<00:00:33.390> line<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.930> important<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the green dotted line is important you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010 
the green dotted line is important you
can<00:00:35.040> spin<00:00:35.520> using<00:00:35.790> swipe<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
can spin using swipe or the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.959 
can spin using swipe or the
accelerometer<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.010> combination<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.879> both

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
accelerometer or a combination of both

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.330 
accelerometer or a combination of both
but<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.440> before<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.040> green

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
but you have to do it before the green

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.000 
but you have to do it before the green
dotted<00:00:41.820> line<00:00:42.059> also<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.260> space<00:00:43.559> mode<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
dotted line also in the space mode is a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.619 
dotted line also in the space mode is a
little<00:00:44.219> harder<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.059> ball<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
little harder because the ball is in the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.569 
little harder because the ball is in the
air<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.320> gravity<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.129> ball<00:00:47.309> does

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
air because of gravity the ball does

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
air because of gravity the ball does
have<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> lane<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.170> spin<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
have to be on the lane to spin so you

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.740 
have to be on the lane to spin so you
can<00:00:50.280> experiment<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.449> how<00:00:51.690> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
can experiment with that to see how you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.350 
can experiment with that to see how you
can<00:00:52.199> spin<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.710> get<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.340> most<00:00:53.579> strikes<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
