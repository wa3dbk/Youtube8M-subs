00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
this one is that it does have a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.800 
this one is that it does have a
removable<00:00:28.529> back<00:00:29.130> plate<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.689> can

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
removable back plate here and you can

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.720 
removable back plate here and you can
actually<00:00:30.929> remove<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.800> battery<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.369> comes

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
actually remove the battery that comes

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.819 
actually remove the battery that comes
with<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:33.989> actually<00:00:34.410> get<00:00:34.559> two

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
with it so you do actually get two

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.470 
mid-february and that is going to retail
at<00:00:48.180> about<00:00:48.480> 80<00:00:48.719> 999<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.000> another<00:00:51.000> thing<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
at about 80 999 and another thing is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779 
at about 80 999 and another thing is
that<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.960> showed<00:00:52.260> off<00:00:52.500> another<00:00:53.010> case<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
that they showed off another case and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.880 
that they showed off another case and
this<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.510> actually<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> iPhone<00:00:55.379> 4<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.710> 4s

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this is actually for the iPhone 4 and 4s

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
this is actually for the iPhone 4 and 4s
I<00:00:56.550> believe<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.660> available<00:00:57.840> already

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
I believe this one is available already

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.529 
I believe this one is available already
but<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.609> kind<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.030> found<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.300> interesting

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
but I kind of found it interesting

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.349 
but I kind of found it interesting
because<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> heavy-duty<00:01:02.180> type<00:01:03.180> of

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
because it's like a heavy-duty type of

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.090 
because it's like a heavy-duty type of
case<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.309> meant<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.850> take<00:01:06.210> damage

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
case so it's it's meant to take damage

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
case so it's it's meant to take damage
all<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.340> good<00:01:08.520> stuff<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.810> drop<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.260> in

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
all that good stuff so if you drop it in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
all that good stuff so if you drop it in
things<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.770> well<00:01:11.220> you're<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.820> hiking

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
things like that well you're like hiking

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.710 
things like that well you're like hiking
or<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.500> doing<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:14.159> extreme<00:01:14.580> stuff<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.270> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
or just doing some extreme stuff and it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.710 
or just doing some extreme stuff and it
does<00:01:16.020> fall<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.770> battery<00:01:17.310> case<00:01:17.549> will<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.060> get

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
does fall that battery case will not get

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240 
does fall that battery case will not get
affected<00:01:18.840> any<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.619> phone<00:01:19.920> will<00:01:20.100> stay

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
affected any your phone will stay

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.120

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
protected and all that good stuff and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.149 
protected and all that good stuff and
finally<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.729> these<00:01:23.939> heavy-duty

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
finally they have these heavy-duty

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.640 
finally they have these heavy-duty
beastly<00:01:26.270> power<00:01:27.270> banks<00:01:27.720> now<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.380> saw<00:01:28.619> there

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
beastly power banks now as you saw there

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.819 
beastly power banks now as you saw there
that's<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.159> 7200<00:01:30.000> milliamp<00:01:30.390> battery<00:01:30.500> bank<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that's a 7200 milliamp battery bank and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.539 
that's a 7200 milliamp battery bank and
that<00:01:32.630> 12,000<00:01:33.630> milliamp<00:01:34.110> battery<00:01:34.259> bank<00:01:34.890> so

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that 12,000 milliamp battery bank so

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.520 
that 12,000 milliamp battery bank so
that<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:36.240> probably<00:01:36.479> charge<00:01:36.869> your<00:01:37.110> phone<00:01:37.290> for

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that can probably charge your phone for

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.069 
that can probably charge your phone for
like<00:01:37.560> six<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.250> eight<00:01:38.400> times<00:01:38.720> iphone<00:01:39.720> 4<00:01:39.930> iphone

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
like six to eight times iphone 4 iphone

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.770 
like six to eight times iphone 4 iphone
4s<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> stuff<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.390> pretty<00:01:42.659> cool

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
4s all that stuff and it's pretty cool

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.530 
4s all that stuff and it's pretty cool
because<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.200> has<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.619> USB<00:01:44.240> outages<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.479> you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
because it has two USB outages so you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.219 
because it has two USB outages so you
can<00:01:45.720> actually<00:01:46.009> plug<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:47.369> ipad<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.420> or

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
can actually plug in your ipad and or

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
can actually plug in your ipad and or
your<00:01:49.409> iphone<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> same<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.970> you'll

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
your iphone at the same time and you'll

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.539 
your iphone at the same time and you'll
get<00:01:51.450> most<00:01:52.110> likely<00:01:52.470> full<00:01:52.710> battery<00:01:53.040> charge<00:01:53.310> out

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
get most likely full battery charge out

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.060 
get most likely full battery charge out
of<00:01:53.579> both<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.880> them<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.329> that's<00:01:54.990> basically<00:01:55.619> what

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
of both of them so that's basically what

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.020 
of both of them so that's basically what
