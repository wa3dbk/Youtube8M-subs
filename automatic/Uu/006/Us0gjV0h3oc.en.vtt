00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.519
 who have 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.380
 it concerns, among other things, the temporary conditions for the moment not experienced 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
 playmaker of internazionale 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.690
 I know the answer 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.180
 we have been making it there for around twenty years you can do it alone 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.180
 Aerts are let alone the experienced in IJmuiden 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.090
 tapping inside 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.570
 read more 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.770
 than last year 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.790
 we are the best 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.310
 they were dragged through the water 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.530
 less frequent end of the season starting with players from within 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.020
 lifeboats in the private sector came in third 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.020
 the share I knew in advance something for everyone 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
 and now closed in 2005 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 I think it's mustache 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.440
 well what can you learn 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.410
 can be jalaiepour 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.410
 yes i'm ready 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.770
 what a mess 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.430
 I still have an explanation 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.050
 the walking street 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.110
 turnover for two years 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.220
 must always target yourself 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.030
 I think it will happen if Ireland turned out to be the country 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.350
 the employers 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 yeah i know i think martin jol 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.790
 but the team 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 it is curious it varies per family 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.829
 but call a bit unibet
