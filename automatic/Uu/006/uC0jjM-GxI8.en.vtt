00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.219 
is the lucky ores these ones in the
middle<00:01:38.310> are<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> Chancellor's<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.450> those

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
middle are the Chancellor's and those

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
middle are the Chancellor's and those
ones<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.130> mystical<00:01:41.610> ores<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
ones are the mystical ores so this is a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510 
ones are the mystical ores so this is a
great<00:01:43.110> mod<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.560> people<00:01:43.829> who<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.490> don't

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
great mod for people who you don't

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.039 
great mod for people who you don't
necessarily<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> change<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
necessarily like to change up that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
necessarily like to change up that
vanilla<00:01:46.290> experience<00:01:46.920> too<00:01:47.189> much<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.610> would

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
vanilla experience too much but would

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.700 
vanilla experience too much but would
like<00:01:47.970> something<00:01:48.270> slightly<00:01:48.869> different<00:01:49.110> not

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
like something slightly different not

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.020 
like something slightly different not
very<00:01:49.920> game-changing<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.939> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
very game-changing I think this is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.700 
very game-changing I think this is
absolutely<00:01:51.180> perfect<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.439> could<00:01:52.560> work

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
absolutely perfect or it could work

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.990 
absolutely perfect or it could work
really<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.130> well<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.610> kind<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
really really well in kind of like a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.060 
really really well in kind of like a
bigger<00:01:54.270> mod<00:01:54.509> pack<00:01:54.750> type<00:01:54.930> thing<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.320> via<00:01:55.890> let's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
bigger mod pack type thing a via let's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.190 
bigger mod pack type thing a via let's
get<00:01:56.189> started<00:01:56.579> over<00:01:57.030> from<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.420> side<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:58.049> you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
get started over from this side as you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.969 
get started over from this side as you
can<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.469> here<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:59.299> coal<00:02:00.299> iron<00:02:00.930> gold<00:02:01.320> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
can see here we have coal iron gold and

diamond

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.240 
diamond
now<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.450> lucky<00:02:04.079> or<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.380> essentially<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.100> an

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
now the lucky or is essentially like an

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
now the lucky or is essentially like an
upgraded<00:02:05.759> vanilla<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> one<00:02:06.869> thing

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
upgraded vanilla or so the one thing

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.389 
upgraded vanilla or so the one thing
you'll<00:02:07.170> notice<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.649> when<00:02:07.799> you're<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.039> in

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you'll notice is when you're actually in

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.010 
you'll notice is when you're actually in
the<00:02:08.459> dark<00:02:08.910> or<00:02:09.090> whatever<00:02:09.149> you'll<00:02:09.569> notice<00:02:09.869> these

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the dark or whatever you'll notice these

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.630 
the dark or whatever you'll notice these
things<00:02:10.229> flashing<00:02:10.739> because<00:02:11.069> they're<00:02:11.220> pretty

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
things flashing because they're pretty

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.980 
things flashing because they're pretty
easy<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.300> not

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
easy like not

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.510 
easy like not
so<00:02:13.230> they're<00:02:13.590> quite<00:02:13.770> colorful<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.430> an

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
so they're quite colorful it's like an

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.450 
so they're quite colorful it's like an
underground<00:02:14.730> pie<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.800> yeah<00:02:16.800> what<00:02:17.340> will

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
underground pie and yeah what will

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.670 
underground pie and yeah what will
happen<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.880> you'll<00:02:18.030> effectively<00:02:18.540> get<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
happen is you'll effectively get the the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.430 
happen is you'll effectively get the the
or<00:02:19.860> version<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.580> in<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:21.240> random<00:02:21.900> number<00:02:22.080> of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
or version of it in a random number of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.740 
or version of it in a random number of
chances<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.580> how<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.940> demonstrate<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.510> if<00:02:24.660> we

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
chances so how to demonstrate that if we

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.940 
chances so how to demonstrate that if we
just<00:02:24.960> I've<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:25.200> got<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.350> normal<00:02:25.680> pic<00:02:25.800> here

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
just I've just got a normal pic here

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.320 
just I've just got a normal pic here
I've<00:02:26.100> not<00:02:26.250> got<00:02:26.370> any<00:02:26.490> fortune<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.180> anything

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
but it gets better so these ones down

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.570 
but it gets better so these ones down
here<00:03:09.000> are<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:10.080> mystical<00:03:10.680> ores<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.250> these<00:03:11.340> are

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
here are the mystical ores so these are

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.520 
here are the mystical ores so these are
just<00:03:11.670> random<00:03:12.090> drop<00:03:12.480> ones<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.050> these<00:03:13.170> will<00:03:13.350> drop

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
just random drop ones so these will drop

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.680 
just random drop ones so these will drop
kind<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.250> different<00:03:14.670> materials<00:03:15.180> depending<00:03:15.330> on

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
kind of different materials depending on

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.930 
kind of different materials depending on
on<00:03:15.930> what<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.290> get<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.800> it's<00:03:17.190> much<00:03:17.460> to<00:03:17.670> do<00:03:17.790> to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
on what you get so it's much to do to

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
can see nice colors and we break this

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.430 
can see nice colors and we break this
and<00:04:02.370> it's<00:04:02.610> another<00:04:02.790> sly<00:04:03.000> ball<00:04:03.210> so<00:04:04.080> that's<00:04:04.170> kind

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
of cool but this is kind of the main

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.860 
of cool but this is kind of the main
thing<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.030> these<00:04:06.210> are<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.360> ones<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.690> like

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
thing and these are the ones that I like

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.150 
thing and these are the ones that I like
the<00:04:07.020> most<00:04:07.050> let's<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:07.620> make<00:04:07.710> it<00:04:07.740> pay<00:04:07.950> time

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
the most let's just make it pay time

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.690 
the most let's just make it pay time
because<00:04:09.120> these<00:04:09.300> are<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.140> chances<00:04:10.800> so<00:04:11.490> these

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
because these are the chances so these

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.280 
because these are the chances so these
randomly<00:04:12.209> drop<00:04:12.450> materials<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.050> you<00:04:13.170> can

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
randomly drop materials that you can

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.440 
randomly drop materials that you can
find<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.709> mining<00:04:14.070> besides<00:04:14.490> lapis<00:04:14.970> however

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
find in mining besides lapis however

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.260 
find in mining besides lapis however
there<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.900> 10%<00:04:16.590> chance<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:17.040> if<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.459> get<00:04:18.150> it

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
there is a 10% chance that if you get it

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.660 
there is a 10% chance that if you get it
wrong<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.930> will<00:04:19.049> trigger<00:04:19.350> an<00:04:19.620> almost<00:04:20.190> lethal

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
wrong you will trigger an almost lethal

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.430 
wrong you will trigger an almost lethal
explosive<00:04:21.359> taking<00:04:21.840> damage<00:04:21.989> from<00:04:22.290> it

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
explosive taking damage from it

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.810 
explosive taking damage from it
depending<00:04:22.830> on<00:04:22.919> how<00:04:23.040> far<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.310> are<00:04:23.430> away<00:04:23.490> from

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
depending on how far you are away from

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.710 
depending on how far you are away from
it<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:23.970> it's<00:04:24.210> kind<00:04:24.360> of<00:04:24.390> like<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.570> little

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
it so it's kind of like a little

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.480 
it so it's kind of like a little
gambling<00:04:25.140> thing<00:04:25.290> so<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.620> picture<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.340> scene

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
gambling thing so you picture the scene

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
you looked for diamonds you've not got

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.980 
you looked for diamonds you've not got
much<00:04:28.970> health<00:04:29.210> left<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.570> see<00:04:29.750> one<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:29.900> these

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
much health left you see one of these

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.590 
much health left you see one of these
you're<00:04:30.380> thinking<00:04:30.680> mmm<00:04:31.250> this<00:04:31.790> could<00:04:32.060> be<00:04:32.180> payday

you're thinking mmm this could be payday

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.680 
you're thinking mmm this could be payday
or<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.410> could<00:04:33.560> be<00:04:33.650> death<00:04:33.860> so<00:04:34.820> let's<00:04:35.300> see<00:04:35.420> if<00:04:35.600> we

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
or it could be death so let's see if we

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.080 
or it could be death so let's see if we
can<00:04:35.840> actually<00:04:35.960> get<00:04:36.350> no<00:04:37.070> explosions<00:04:37.670> here

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
can actually get no explosions here

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.000 
can actually get no explosions here
so<00:04:38.750> that's<00:04:38.930> thing<00:04:39.830> II<00:04:40.240> got<00:04:41.530> scared<00:04:42.530> me

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
so that's thing II got scared me

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.960 
so that's thing II got scared me
I<00:04:43.180> didn't<00:04:44.180> even<00:04:44.420> jump<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:44.990> yeah<00:04:45.800> we<00:04:46.790> didn't

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
I didn't even jump that yeah we didn't

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.330 
I didn't even jump that yeah we didn't
do<00:04:47.030> very<00:04:47.060> well<00:04:47.770> let's<00:04:48.770> heal<00:04:48.890> ourselves<00:04:48.980> though

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
do very well let's heal ourselves though

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.400 
do very well let's heal ourselves though
so<00:04:49.520> we<00:04:49.640> got<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.910> what<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:50.930> be<00:04:51.050> getting<00:04:51.230> there<00:04:51.320> it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
so we got a what to be getting there it

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.110 
so we got a what to be getting there it
got<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.560> ruby<00:04:51.800> let's<00:04:52.550> see<00:04:52.670> what<00:04:52.760> else<00:04:52.880> you<00:04:53.030> get

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
got a ruby let's see what else you get

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.390 
got a ruby let's see what else you get
another<00:04:53.390> ruby<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:54.070> diamond<00:04:56.020> anion<00:04:57.400> another

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
another ruby a diamond anion another

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.320 
another ruby a diamond anion another
diamond<00:04:59.050> another<00:05:00.050> diamond<00:05:01.090> what<00:05:02.090> was<00:05:02.180> that

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
diamond another diamond what was that

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.600 
diamond another diamond what was that
there's<00:05:03.230> thing<00:05:03.350> is<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.560> sapphire<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.190> finally

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
there's thing is a sapphire and finally

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.870 
there's thing is a sapphire and finally
Oh<00:05:04.760> another<00:05:05.750> sapphire<00:05:06.140> hmm<00:05:06.830> so<00:05:07.460> yeah<00:05:07.640> as<00:05:07.790> you

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
Oh another sapphire hmm so yeah as you

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.340 
Oh another sapphire hmm so yeah as you
can<00:05:07.910> see<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.240> really<00:05:08.630> really<00:05:08.810> cool<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:09.200> it's

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
can see that really really cool so it's

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.560 
can see that really really cool so it's
kind<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.530> like<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:09.890> run<00:05:10.190> type<00:05:10.670> chance<00:05:11.060> thing<00:05:11.420> of

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
kind of like a run type chance thing of

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.650 
kind of like a run type chance thing of
what's<00:05:12.440> gonna<00:05:12.590> happen<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.340> it's<00:05:14.150> kind<00:05:14.360> of<00:05:14.480> fun

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
what's gonna happen and it's kind of fun

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.080 
what's gonna happen and it's kind of fun
it<00:05:14.810> makes<00:05:14.960> you<00:05:15.380> like<00:05:15.560> sort<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:16.220> don't<00:05:16.940> know

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
it makes you like sort of I don't know

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.670 
it makes you like sort of I don't know
tense<00:05:17.390> a<00:05:17.600> little<00:05:17.840> bit<00:05:17.990> because<00:05:18.350> you<00:05:18.500> don't

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
tense a little bit because you don't

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.950 
tense a little bit because you don't
know<00:05:18.770> what's<00:05:19.340> gonna<00:05:19.550> happen<00:05:19.640> when<00:05:20.480> you<00:05:20.600> break

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
know what's gonna happen when you break

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.310 
know what's gonna happen when you break
it<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:23.510> know<00:05:23.600> you<00:05:23.660> could<00:05:23.900> get<00:05:24.020> lucky<00:05:24.140> you

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
it and you know you could get lucky you

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.360 
it and you know you could get lucky you
could<00:05:24.440> get<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.590> lot<00:05:24.770> of<00:05:24.830> diamonds<00:05:25.220> I<00:05:25.310> do

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
could get a lot of diamonds I do

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.400 
could get a lot of diamonds I do
actually<00:05:25.760> think<00:05:25.790> that<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.900> chance<00:05:27.170> odds

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
actually think that the the chance odds

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.200 
actually think that the the chance odds
are<00:05:27.710> much<00:05:27.980> higher<00:05:28.250> yielding<00:05:28.790> in<00:05:28.940> high-level

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
are much higher yielding in high-level

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.870 
are much higher yielding in high-level
ones<00:05:29.780> than<00:05:30.320> for<00:05:30.620> example<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.520> mythical

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
ones than for example the the mythical

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.250 
ones than for example the the mythical
ones<00:05:32.060> which<00:05:32.270> kind<00:05:32.480> of<00:05:32.540> gave<00:05:32.690> your<00:05:32.870> last<00:05:33.020> slime

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
ones which kind of gave your last slime

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.050 
ones which kind of gave your last slime
balls<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:33.710> stuff<00:05:33.860> these<00:05:34.100> ones<00:05:34.310> seem<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:34.910> give

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
balls and stuff these ones seem to give

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.000 
balls and stuff these ones seem to give
you<00:05:35.240> a<00:05:35.390> bit<00:05:35.930> more<00:05:35.960> diamond<00:05:36.590> and<00:05:36.710> stuff<00:05:36.890> like

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
you a bit more diamond and stuff like

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.700 
you a bit more diamond and stuff like
that<00:05:37.250> but<00:05:37.520> no<00:05:38.360> it<00:05:38.690> might<00:05:38.840> be<00:05:38.960> that<00:05:39.110> big<00:05:39.350> I<00:05:39.500> guess

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
that but no it might be that big I guess

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.120 
that but no it might be that big I guess
it's<00:05:39.860> all<00:05:39.980> about<00:05:40.130> a<00:05:40.160> chance<00:05:41.470> right<00:05:42.470> now<00:05:42.770> the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
it's all about a chance right now the

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.800 
it's all about a chance right now the
one<00:05:43.430> final<00:05:43.940> thing<00:05:44.120> I've<00:05:44.300> got<00:05:44.510> to<00:05:44.600> show<00:05:44.780> you

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
one final thing I've got to show you

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.930 
one final thing I've got to show you
which<00:05:45.020> is<00:05:45.050> nothing<00:05:45.590> really<00:05:45.770> to<00:05:46.010> do<00:05:46.190> with<00:05:46.220> Oz

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
which is nothing really to do with Oz

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.460 
which is nothing really to do with Oz
which<00:05:47.480> is<00:05:47.600> kind<00:05:47.780> of<00:05:47.840> strange<00:05:48.050> but<00:05:48.170> it's<00:05:48.320> in<00:05:48.380> the

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
which is kind of strange but it's in the

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.690 
which is kind of strange but it's in the
mod<00:05:48.590> pack<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:48.950> it's<00:05:49.040> actually<00:05:49.310> really<00:05:49.580> really

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
mod pack and it's actually really really

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.510 
mod pack and it's actually really really
good<00:05:49.820> is<00:05:50.540> this<00:05:51.350> final<00:05:51.770> item<00:05:52.040> here<00:05:52.190> which<00:05:52.220> is

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
good is this final item here which is

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.630 
good is this final item here which is
called<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:53.560> grappling<00:05:54.560> hook<00:05:54.620> so<00:05:55.280> I<00:05:55.310> guess

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
called the grappling hook so I guess

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.060 
called the grappling hook so I guess
this<00:05:55.730> kind<00:05:55.970> of<00:05:56.120> ties<00:05:56.720> into<00:05:57.050> going<00:05:57.470> down<00:05:57.800> and

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
this kind of ties into going down and

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.380 
this kind of ties into going down and
mining<00:05:58.400> for<00:05:58.520> others<00:05:58.790> and<00:05:58.880> stuff<00:05:59.090> which<00:05:59.240> is

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
mining for others and stuff which is

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.180 
mining for others and stuff which is
sort<00:05:59.630> of<00:05:59.660> what's<00:05:59.930> encouraged<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.680> this<00:06:01.070> is

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
sort of what's encouraged and this is

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.500 
sort of what's encouraged and this is
really<00:06:01.400> good<00:06:01.550> it's<00:06:01.700> pretty<00:06:01.880> cheap<00:06:02.210> to<00:06:02.390> make

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
really good it's pretty cheap to make

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.150 
really good it's pretty cheap to make
you<00:06:02.630> just<00:06:02.810> need<00:06:02.930> three<00:06:03.140> iron<00:06:03.320> ingots<00:06:03.710> and<00:06:03.920> two

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
you just need three iron ingots and two

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.770 
you just need three iron ingots and two
sticks<00:06:04.460> so<00:06:04.640> those<00:06:04.760> three<00:06:05.060> iron<00:06:05.270> ingots<00:06:05.630> could

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
sticks so those three iron ingots could

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.900 
sticks so those three iron ingots could
potentially<00:06:06.260> be<00:06:06.350> one<00:06:06.680> lucky<00:06:07.190> iron<00:06:07.520> ore<00:06:07.670> so

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
potentially be one lucky iron ore so

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.280 
potentially be one lucky iron ore so
that's<00:06:08.030> pretty<00:06:08.210> cool<00:06:08.450> now<00:06:08.660> once<00:06:09.140> you've<00:06:09.260> got

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
that's pretty cool now once you've got

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.780 
that's pretty cool now once you've got
it<00:06:09.470> it<00:06:09.620> doesn't<00:06:09.800> actually<00:06:10.100> fire<00:06:10.340> anything<00:06:10.550> and

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
it it doesn't actually fire anything and

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.710 
it it doesn't actually fire anything and
I<00:06:10.820> was<00:06:10.940> playing<00:06:11.150> around<00:06:11.240> with<00:06:11.390> this<00:06:11.540> for<00:06:11.630> ages

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
I was playing around with this for ages

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.260 
I was playing around with this for ages
like<00:06:12.020> what<00:06:12.170> the<00:06:12.350> hell<00:06:12.530> is<00:06:12.560> going<00:06:12.920> on<00:06:13.040> the<00:06:14.030> thing

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
like what the hell is going on the thing

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.450

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
way so as you can see I mean I'm in a

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.160 
way so as you can see I mean I'm in a
survival<00:06:38.060> mode<00:06:38.180> now<00:06:38.360> so<00:06:38.540> I'm<00:06:38.600> not<00:06:38.630> flying<00:06:38.930> or

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
survival mode now so I'm not flying or

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.679 
survival mode now so I'm not flying or
anything<00:06:39.320> but<00:06:39.770> it's<00:06:39.920> a<00:06:39.950> really<00:06:40.100> good<00:06:40.280> way<00:06:40.430> of

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:40.689 
anything but it's a really good way of

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:42.359 
anything but it's a really good way of
hang<00:06:40.779> up<00:06:40.869> these<00:06:40.989> like<00:06:41.199> 1x1<00:06:41.709> pillars<00:06:42.129> so<00:06:42.309> you

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:42.369 
hang up these like 1x1 pillars so you

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:43.799 
hang up these like 1x1 pillars so you
could<00:06:42.669> literally<00:06:42.909> dig<00:06:43.179> straight<00:06:43.389> down<00:06:43.479> and

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:43.809 
could literally dig straight down and

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:45.539 
could literally dig straight down and
then<00:06:43.899> you<00:06:44.019> can<00:06:44.110> get<00:06:44.289> it<00:06:44.409> relatively<00:06:45.039> safely

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:45.549 
then you can get it relatively safely

00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:47.159 
then you can get it relatively safely
but<00:06:46.449> I<00:06:46.509> just<00:06:46.659> thought<00:06:46.779> that<00:06:46.839> was<00:06:46.959> a<00:06:47.019> nifty

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
but I just thought that was a nifty

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:48.509 
but I just thought that was a nifty
little<00:06:47.379> item<00:06:47.709> oh<00:06:47.799> I<00:06:47.889> like<00:06:48.039> the<00:06:48.159> fact<00:06:48.309> that<00:06:48.369> it

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:48.519 
little item oh I like the fact that it

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:49.769 
little item oh I like the fact that it
doesn't<00:06:48.669> fire<00:06:48.909> anything<00:06:49.179> you<00:06:49.479> can<00:06:49.599> you<00:06:49.659> have

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:49.779 
doesn't fire anything you can you have

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:51.299 
doesn't fire anything you can you have
to<00:06:49.809> let<00:06:49.989> use<00:06:50.169> it<00:06:50.319> on<00:06:50.379> walls<00:06:50.649> and<00:06:50.799> stuff<00:06:51.009> and

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:51.309 
to let use it on walls and stuff and

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:53.909 
to let use it on walls and stuff and
yeah<00:06:51.819> it's<00:06:51.999> pretty<00:06:52.059> damn<00:06:52.360> cool<00:06:52.539> so<00:06:53.529> I<00:06:53.769> guess
