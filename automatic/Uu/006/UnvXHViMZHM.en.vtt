00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.190
 this 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.600
 it is 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.260
 and well hello today we get 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.390
 found for maintenance and size 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.189
 of hibiscus you know that the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 biscuits it's good it's family 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.259
 males vasser it's a plant that is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.820
 very well in our region 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.739
 on the other hand it is true that in period 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.410
 winter they tend to lose a 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.239
 little leaves and reduce their 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.760
 growth then in this season he 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.340
 started to restart 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.969
 so we're already going a little bit there 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.219
 the size of these of these beautiful flowers 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.440
 so usually when you have big 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.649
 stems like this one we're not going 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.190
 intersected at places where there is no 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.739
 leaf 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 for example if we want to resize this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.159
 plugged 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.949
 we will have to cross it at this level 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.469
 always above the leaves or 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.260
 foals we can retail is like that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.720
 the other parties here it is here we 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.000
 is on a branch with two stems same 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.020
 if this one is going to bloom this one also goes 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.420
 start to bloom 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.030
 so we will be able to retail and at this level 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.670
 there is always cut at an angle for 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.430
 let the water flows out there is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.980
 what is called complete fertilizer 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.620
 geranium or rozier me I use rather 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.450
 pellet formulas that are this 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.040
 called slow release 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.860
 it is elsewhere as and when 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.020
 watering is the langres and will be 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.240
 gently release into the soil when 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.120
 your hibiscus is so in a pot in 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.720
 goes on the one hand already aerate the earth a little 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.720
 surface 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.690
 then we will bring the fertilizer 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.880
 obviously when they are small pots 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.420
 like that we will put maximum value 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.070
 of a teaspoon have their 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.270
 mix a little bit so that the fertilizer 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:04.200
 go down and then we water 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.520
 and here I go get a watering can then 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.560
 after putting langres is always 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.209
 very important in harold so it takes 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.610
 know that hibiscus if you have them 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.260
 kept all winter in your lanai do not 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.739
 take them out and not directly to the full 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.660
 Sun 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.879
 you will first take them out in a 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.500
 where the morning sun or at 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.780
 shade for about a week 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.610
 the time they acclimatize and then 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.819
 you can put them back to the full 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.819
 Sun
