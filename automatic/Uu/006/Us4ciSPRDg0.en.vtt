00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
faster like that so this is how I found

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.340 
faster like that so this is how I found
out<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.110> pretty<00:00:46.260> much<00:00:47.510> when<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> give<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> full

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
out so pretty much when I give it full

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.490 
out so pretty much when I give it full
throttle<00:00:50.510> I'm<00:00:51.510> pretty<00:00:51.899> sure<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> clutch

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
throttle I'm pretty sure the clutch

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.990 
throttle I'm pretty sure the clutch
plates<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.190> spinning<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.670> bike<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
plates are just spinning and the bike is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.580 
plates are just spinning and the bike is
just<00:00:57.120> revving<00:00:57.480> high<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> power<00:00:58.079> band<00:00:58.320> sounds

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
just revving high the power band sounds

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.139 
just revving high the power band sounds
crisp<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> sounds<00:00:59.609> yeah<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.940> bike

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
crisp because it sounds yeah this bike

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.549 
crisp because it sounds yeah this bike
this<00:01:00.270> doesn't<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.809> anywhere<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.170> I'm<00:01:01.410> pretty

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
this doesn't go anywhere so I'm pretty

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.889 
this doesn't go anywhere so I'm pretty
sure<00:01:01.770> instead<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.449> spinning<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> back<00:01:03.690> wheel

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sure instead of spinning the back wheel

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.359 
sure instead of spinning the back wheel
just<00:01:04.140> spinning<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> clutch<00:01:04.769> plates<00:01:05.040> instead

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
just spinning the clutch plates instead

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
just spinning the clutch plates instead
so<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:06.450> take<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> clutch<00:01:07.049> cover<00:01:07.260> off

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so I'm gonna take the clutch cover off

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.550 
so I'm gonna take the clutch cover off
