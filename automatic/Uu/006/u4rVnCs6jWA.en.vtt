good for your shape and you know if it's

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.990 
good for your shape and you know if it's
up<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:20.050> date<00:05:20.230> then<00:05:20.500> all<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.280> better<00:05:21.460> but<00:05:21.850> you

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
interpretation on everything that you do

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.630 
interpretation on everything that you do
to<00:05:26.169> make<00:05:26.320> it<00:05:26.380> I<00:05:26.650> think<00:05:26.710> as<00:05:27.130> well<00:05:27.340> when<00:05:27.490> you're

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
to make it I think as well when you're

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.840 
to make it I think as well when you're
younger<00:05:27.880> you<00:05:28.630> follow<00:05:28.870> fashion<00:05:29.169> more<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:30.100> then

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
younger you follow fashion more and then

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.270 
younger you follow fashion more and then
as<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.150> get<00:05:31.240> older<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:32.200> find<00:05:32.470> your<00:05:32.680> style<00:05:32.919> and

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
as you get older you find your style and

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.940 
as you get older you find your style and
kind<00:05:34.120> of<00:05:34.180> work<00:05:34.390> it<00:05:34.510> into<00:05:34.690> fashion<00:05:35.200> does<00:05:35.830> that

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
kind of work it into fashion does that

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.630 
kind of work it into fashion does that
make<00:05:36.130> sense<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:37.390> know<00:05:37.450> but<00:05:37.720> I've<00:05:37.810> always<00:05:38.640> been

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
make sense you know but I've always been

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.880 
make sense you know but I've always been
into<00:05:40.330> fashion<00:05:40.510> I<00:05:40.870> mind<00:05:41.080> I've<00:05:41.260> not<00:05:41.440> always<00:05:41.470> had

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
into fashion I mind I've not always had

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.340 
into fashion I mind I've not always had
the<00:05:42.160> money<00:05:42.370> to<00:05:42.550> be<00:05:42.640> able<00:05:42.760> to<00:05:42.930> do<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.110> things

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
the money to be able to do the things

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.050 
the money to be able to do the things
perhaps<00:05:44.620> that<00:05:44.890> I<00:05:44.980> wanted<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.460> you<00:05:45.610> know<00:05:45.640> for

perhaps that I wanted to you know for

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.510 
perhaps that I wanted to you know for
small<00:05:46.360> children<00:05:47.070> and<00:05:48.070> now<00:05:48.490> it's

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
small children and now it's

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.879
