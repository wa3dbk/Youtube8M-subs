00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.700 

serve<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.460> original<00:02:00.880> DK<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.560> we're

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
serve you I'm the original DK and we're

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.740 
serve you I'm the original DK and we're
gonna<00:02:02.800> compare<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.670> KT<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.420> can

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
gonna compare it to the KT so you can

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.360 
gonna compare it to the KT so you can
see<00:02:04.900> how<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.260> like<00:02:05.410> basically<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.040> same

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
see how it's like basically the same

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.400 
see how it's like basically the same
like<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.790> wheel<00:02:06.940> wells<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.270> everything<00:02:07.660> the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
like the wheel wells and everything the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.020 
like the wheel wells and everything the
whole<00:02:08.590> entire<00:02:09.010> way<00:02:09.190> up<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:09.550> front<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:10.000> mean

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
whole entire way up to the front I mean

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.600 
whole entire way up to the front I mean
one<00:02:10.930> here<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.500> wheel<00:02:11.680> bases<00:02:12.100> there's<00:02:12.310> not<00:02:12.490> as

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
one here the wheel bases there's not as

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.770 
one here the wheel bases there's not as
many<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:14.140> starts<00:02:14.740> lower<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.630> can

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
many and it starts lower as the you can

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.320 
many and it starts lower as the you can
see<00:02:16.930> how<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.080> wheel<00:02:17.320> base<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.560> lower<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:19.240> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
see how the wheel base is lower so the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.940 
see how the wheel base is lower so the
wheel<00:02:19.480> base<00:02:19.630> is<00:02:19.660> gonna<00:02:19.810> be<00:02:19.960> smaller<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
wheel base is gonna be smaller and the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.570 
wheel base is gonna be smaller and the
concave<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.820> basically<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.360> same<00:02:26.580> just

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
concave is basically the same just

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.470 
concave is basically the same just
imagine<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.510> being<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:30.190> concave<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.270> if<00:02:31.330> you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
imagine it being the concave so if you

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.150 
imagine it being the concave so if you
have<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.900> arbiter<00:02:32.260> KT<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.710> can<00:02:32.860> put<00:02:33.040> your

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
have the arbiter KT you can put your

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.820 
have the arbiter KT you can put your
foot<00:02:33.430> like<00:02:34.390> here<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.470> can<00:02:35.590> feel<00:02:35.800> that

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
foot like here and you can feel that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.580 
foot like here and you can feel that
concave<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.550> that's<00:02:36.610> how<00:02:36.820> it's<00:02:36.970> gonna<00:02:37.060> be

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
concave and that's how it's gonna be

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.670 
concave and that's how it's gonna be
where<00:02:38.590> you're<00:02:38.710> gonna<00:02:38.770> put<00:02:38.980> your<00:02:39.100> foot<00:02:40.680> when

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
where you're gonna put your foot when

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.450 
where you're gonna put your foot when
you're<00:02:41.770> riding<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.710> mean<00:02:44.890> that's<00:02:45.070> not

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
you're riding and so I mean that's not

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.970 
you're riding and so I mean that's not
that's<00:02:45.790> kind<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.300> bad<00:02:46.480> thing<00:02:46.510> but<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.260> guess

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
that's kind of a bad thing but I guess

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.340 
that's kind of a bad thing but I guess
you<00:02:48.160> can<00:02:48.310> fix<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.960> because<00:02:49.960> if<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.110> want<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
you can fix it because if you want to

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.220 
you can fix it because if you want to
ride<00:02:50.530> your<00:02:50.680> feet<00:02:50.920> both<00:02:51.430> on<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.790> flat<00:02:52.030> part<00:02:52.300> the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
ride your feet both on the flat part the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.900 
ride your feet both on the flat part the
conchae<00:02:53.710> is<00:02:53.770> not<00:02:53.950> as<00:02:54.100> strong<00:02:54.400> where<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.790> would

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
conchae is not as strong where you would

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.540 
conchae is not as strong where you would
put<00:02:55.030> your<00:02:55.150> feet<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.290> like<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.770> put<00:02:57.100> my<00:02:57.220> foot

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
put your feet so I like to put my foot

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.990 
put your feet so I like to put my foot
on<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.239> kick<00:02:58.540> tail<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.350> then<00:03:00.160> like<00:03:00.370> right<00:03:00.820> on

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
on the kick tail and then like right on

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.309 
on the kick tail and then like right on
the<00:03:01.150> front<00:03:01.420> two<00:03:01.780> bolts

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
the front two bolts

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.259 
the front two bolts
and<00:03:03.739> that's<00:03:04.280> why<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.459> would<00:03:04.640> write<00:03:04.819> this<00:03:05.030> so

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
and that's why I would write this so

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.819 
and that's why I would write this so
it's<00:03:05.390> basically<00:03:05.659> the<00:03:05.810> same<00:03:06.049> as<00:03:06.110> riding<00:03:06.500> the

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
it's basically the same as riding the

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.979 
it's basically the same as riding the
KPA<00:03:07.219> just<00:03:07.579> a<00:03:07.640> smaller<00:03:07.939> wheelbase<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.689> it's

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
KPA just a smaller wheelbase and it's

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.720 
KPA just a smaller wheelbase and it's
symmetrical<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:11.239> that's<00:03:11.480> basically<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
symmetrical so that's basically the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.209 
symmetrical so that's basically the
thing<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.849> mean<00:03:14.000> they're<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.390> same<00:03:14.599> but<00:03:15.219> not

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
thing I mean they're the same but not

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:20.049 
thing I mean they're the same but not
the<00:03:16.430> same<00:03:16.670> but<00:03:17.599> they're<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.870> same
