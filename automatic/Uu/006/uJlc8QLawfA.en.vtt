hey<00:00:00.810> there<00:00:01.020> boys<00:00:01.170> and<00:00:01.260> girls<00:00:01.500> welcome<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.890> our

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hey there boys and girls welcome to our

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.430 
hey there boys and girls welcome to our
quick<00:00:02.550> tutorial<00:00:03.149> on<00:00:03.330> photosynthesis<00:00:04.200> in<00:00:04.350> the

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
quick tutorial on photosynthesis in the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.410 
quick tutorial on photosynthesis in the
chloroplast<00:00:04.799> now<00:00:05.730> you've<00:00:05.910> already<00:00:06.060> read<00:00:06.390> and

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
chloroplast now you've already read and

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.419 
chloroplast now you've already read and
saw<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.779> video<00:00:07.170> on<00:00:07.470> how<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.830> leaves<00:00:08.189> are

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
saw a video on how the leaves are

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.640 
saw a video on how the leaves are
designed<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.030> get<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.570> raw<00:00:09.750> materials<00:00:10.320> for

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
designed to get the raw materials for

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.499 
designed to get the raw materials for
photosynthesis<00:00:11.550> now<00:00:12.090> we're<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.330> take<00:00:12.480> a

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
photosynthesis now we're going to take a

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.749 
photosynthesis now we're going to take a
look<00:00:12.719> at<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> actual<00:00:13.320> reaction<00:00:14.160> inside<00:00:14.580> of

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
look at the actual reaction inside of

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.570 
look at the actual reaction inside of
the<00:00:14.849> chloroplast<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:16.369> produces<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
the chloroplast that produces and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.650 
the chloroplast that produces and
carries<00:00:17.880> out<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> process<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
carries out the process of

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.349 
carries out the process of
photosynthesis<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.560> make<00:00:19.770> food<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:21.210> we

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
photosynthesis to make food so here we

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.730 
photosynthesis to make food so here we
have<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> picture<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.080> cluster<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.529> plant

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
have a picture of a cluster of plant

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.259 
have a picture of a cluster of plant
cells<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.699> want<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> go<00:00:24.090> over<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
cells and you just want to go over a

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.550 
cells and you just want to go over a
couple<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.720> structures<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.320> you're<00:00:25.439> familiar

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
couple of structures so you're familiar

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.040 
couple of structures so you're familiar
with<00:00:25.830> them<00:00:26.099> first<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.180> all<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.660> guys<00:00:27.810> know

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
with them first of all as you guys know

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.839 
with them first of all as you guys know
as<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.380> talked<00:00:28.619> about<00:00:28.710> earlier<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> year

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
as we talked about earlier in the year

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.510 
as we talked about earlier in the year
plant<00:00:30.390> cells<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.689> cell<00:00:31.050> walls<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
plant cells have cell walls and so the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.190 
plant cells have cell walls and so the
cell<00:00:32.759> walls<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.210> these<00:00:33.360> clear<00:00:33.840> looking

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
cell walls are these clear looking

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.750 
cell walls are these clear looking
barriers<00:00:34.800> around<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> perimeter<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
barriers around the perimeter of the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.580 
barriers around the perimeter of the
cell<00:00:35.940> which<00:00:36.180> gives<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> cell<00:00:36.930> structure<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
cell which gives the cell structure and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.400 
cell which gives the cell structure and
support<00:00:38.629> now<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.690> next<00:00:40.050> thing<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
support now the next thing I'm going to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.740 
support now the next thing I'm going to
point<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.190> clear<00:00:41.489> fluid<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
point out is this clear fluid in the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
point out is this clear fluid in the
middle<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> inside<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> cell<00:00:44.280> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
middle or the inside of the cell that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.220 
middle or the inside of the cell that
everything<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.850> floating<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.360> animal<00:00:46.050> cells

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
everything is floating in animal cells

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.080 
everything is floating in animal cells
have<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.980> addition<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.460> plant<00:00:47.700> cells<00:00:47.940> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
have this in addition to plant cells and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
have this in addition to plant cells and
this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.300> called<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> cytoplasm<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> may

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this is called the cytoplasm as you may

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.250 
this is called the cytoplasm as you may
remember<00:00:50.360> okay<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.510> then<00:00:51.690> our<00:00:51.930> third

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
remember okay and then our third

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.990 
remember okay and then our third
organelle<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:52.980> want<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> point<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.670> here

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
organelle I just want to point out here

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.180 
organelle I just want to point out here
is<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> star<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> our<00:00:54.660> show<00:00:54.860> these<00:00:55.860> green

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is the star of our show these green

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520 
is the star of our show these green
disks<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.360> inside<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.020> these<00:00:58.260> are

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
disks that you see inside and these are

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.520 
disks that you see inside and these are
the<00:00:58.680> chloroplasts<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.539> chloroplasts<00:01:01.410> are

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the chloroplasts so the chloroplasts are

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.460 
the chloroplasts so the chloroplasts are
the<00:01:01.770> structures<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.640> which<00:01:03.470> photosynthesis

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the structures at which photosynthesis

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
the structures at which photosynthesis
occurs<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.210> tell<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
occurs so as you can tell that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.399 
occurs so as you can tell that
photosynthesis<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:08.159> important<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
photosynthesis is really important and

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.539 
photosynthesis is really important and
all<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:10.710> cells<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.100> tons<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
all these cells have tons of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.340 
all these cells have tons of
chloroplasts<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.240> them<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.630> make<00:01:12.900> plenty<00:01:13.229> of

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
chloroplasts in them to make plenty of

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.330 
chloroplasts in them to make plenty of
food<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.920> plant

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
food for the plant

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.090 
food for the plant
okay<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.380> chloroplasts<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.500> actually<00:01:16.770> filled

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
okay so chloroplasts are actually filled

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.370 
okay so chloroplasts are actually filled
with<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> green<00:01:17.850> pigment<00:01:18.240> called<00:01:18.570> chlorophyll

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
with a green pigment called chlorophyll

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440 
with a green pigment called chlorophyll
and<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.520> pigment<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.119> allows

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and it's this pigment that allows

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.230 
and it's this pigment that allows
photosynthesis<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.619> occur<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.400> let's<00:01:24.060> take<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
photosynthesis to occur so let's take a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.640 
photosynthesis to occur so let's take a
look<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> structure<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.290> chloroplast

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
look at the structure of a chloroplast

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.080 
look at the structure of a chloroplast
so<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.220> don't<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
so you don't just think that a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.210 
so you don't just think that a
chloroplast<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> bag<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.009> filled

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
chloroplast is a bag that's just filled

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.370 
chloroplast is a bag that's just filled
with<00:01:29.430> green<00:01:29.670> pigment<00:01:32.150> now<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> basic

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
with green pigment now this is the basic

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.780 
with green pigment now this is the basic
structure<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.860> chloroplast<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.520> doesn't

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
structure of a chloroplast it doesn't

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.069 
structure of a chloroplast it doesn't
have<00:01:35.880> everything<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.720> has<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
have everything but it just has the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.929 
have everything but it just has the
things<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.500> I'll<00:01:37.619> talk<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.460> first<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
things that I'll talk about so first of

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.330 
things that I'll talk about so first of
all<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> outer<00:01:39.960> membrane<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
all we have the outer membrane and the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
all we have the outer membrane and the
inner<00:01:41.369> membrane<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.450> any<00:01:42.659> membrane

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
inner membrane just like any membrane

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050 
inner membrane just like any membrane
they<00:01:43.290> allow<00:01:43.530> things<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.979> pass<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.549> through<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
they allow things to pass on through and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880 
they allow things to pass on through and
then<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> two<00:01:46.259> structures<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.860> which

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
then we have the two structures in which

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
then we have the two structures in which
photosynthesis<00:01:47.759> occurs<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
photosynthesis occurs and we have the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.460 
photosynthesis occurs and we have the
thylakoid<00:01:49.439> which<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.490> flat<00:01:51.149> disc<00:01:51.899> right

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
thylakoid which is this flat disc right

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.830 
thylakoid which is this flat disc right
there<00:01:52.799> okay<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.030> they're<00:01:54.240> stacked<00:01:54.600> on

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
there okay and then they're stacked on

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.800 
there okay and then they're stacked on
top<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.259> other<00:01:55.470> flat<00:01:56.219> disks<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:56.880> thylakoids<00:01:57.570> so

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
top of other flat disks or thylakoids so

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.359 
top of other flat disks or thylakoids so
they<00:01:57.960> look<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.229> stacks<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.799> coins

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
they look like stacks of coins

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.630 
they look like stacks of coins
well<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> stack<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.930> called<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.829> grana<00:02:02.159> which

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
well the stack is called a grana which

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.980 
well the stack is called a grana which
you<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.270> worried<00:02:03.540> about<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you don't have to be worried about and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.789 
you don't have to be worried about and
then<00:02:04.590> each<00:02:04.979> individual<00:02:05.899> coin<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.560> stack

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
then each individual coin in this stack

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.309 
then each individual coin in this stack
would<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> thylakoid<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.690> lastly<00:02:10.140> we

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
would be a thylakoid and then lastly we

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.780 
would be a thylakoid and then lastly we
have<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> stroma<00:02:11.039> which<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.520> where<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
have the stroma which is where the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.790 
have the stroma which is where the
second<00:02:12.239> part<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.480> photosynthesis<00:02:13.170> curves

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
second part of photosynthesis curves

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.180 
second part of photosynthesis curves
stroma<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.090> space<00:02:15.420> between<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:17.160> inner

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
stroma is just a space between the inner

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.010 
stroma is just a space between the inner
membrane<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.000> thylakoid<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:18.930> a

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
membrane and the thylakoid so it's a

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.350 
membrane and the thylakoid so it's a
fluid-filled<00:02:19.560> space<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.880> these<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.270> the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
fluid-filled space so these are the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.870 
fluid-filled space so these are the
parts<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> chloroplast<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:23.550> let's<00:02:23.730> take

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
parts of the chloroplast now let's take

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.750 
parts of the chloroplast now let's take
a<00:02:23.910> look<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.570> see<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:25.980> actually<00:02:26.130> goes<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.580> in

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
a look and see what actually goes on in

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.120 
a look and see what actually goes on in
the<00:02:26.820> process<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.360> photosynthesis<00:02:31.010> all<00:02:32.010> right

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
the process of photosynthesis all right

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.400 
the process of photosynthesis all right
so<00:02:32.400> as<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:33.300> talked<00:02:33.570> about<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.930> your<00:02:34.020> read<00:02:34.200> about

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
so as we talked about in your read about

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.010 
so as we talked about in your read about
and<00:02:34.740> we've<00:02:35.010> you've<00:02:35.550> heard<00:02:36.020> photosynthesis

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
and we've you've heard photosynthesis

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.600 
and we've you've heard photosynthesis
does<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.410> an<00:02:37.500> equation<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.490> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
does have an equation and this is the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.330 
does have an equation and this is the
equation<00:02:39.090> up<00:02:39.270> here<00:02:39.660> okay<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.290> here<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.160> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
equation up here okay so here on the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.010 
equation up here okay so here on the
Left<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:41.910> have<00:02:42.090> what<00:02:42.330> are<00:02:42.450> called<00:02:42.480> raw

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
Left we have what are called raw

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.620 
Left we have what are called raw
materials<00:02:43.860> these<00:02:44.670> are<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.030> things<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.510> are

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
materials these are the things that are

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.930 
materials these are the things that are
needed<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.170> carry<00:02:46.650> out<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.010> reaction<00:02:47.190> these

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
needed to carry out the reaction these

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.270 
needed to carry out the reaction these
are<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.240> ingredients<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.110> speak<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:50.070> we

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
are the ingredients so to speak so we

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.450 
are the ingredients so to speak so we
need<00:02:50.430> six<00:02:50.850> atoms<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.870> carbon<00:02:52.530> dioxide<00:02:52.560> or<00:02:53.250> six

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
need six atoms of carbon dioxide or six

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.520 
need six atoms of carbon dioxide or six
molecules<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:54.000> carbon<00:02:54.120> dioxide<00:02:54.530> six

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
molecules of carbon dioxide six

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.370 
molecules of carbon dioxide six
molecules<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:56.250> water<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.790> sunlight<00:02:57.780> and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
molecules of water and sunlight and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.780 
molecules of water and sunlight and
these<00:02:58.680> raw<00:02:58.860> materials<00:02:58.920> will<00:02:59.430> undergo<00:02:59.670> a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
these raw materials will undergo a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.170 
these raw materials will undergo a
reaction<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.600> create<00:03:01.160> products<00:03:02.160> such<00:03:02.550> as<00:03:02.790> six

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
reaction and create products such as six

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.840 
reaction and create products such as six
oxygen<00:03:03.810> molecules<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:05.100> glucose

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
oxygen molecules and one glucose

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.080 
oxygen molecules and one glucose
molecule<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:07.320> is<00:03:07.590> why<00:03:08.220> plants<00:03:08.760> carry

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
molecule and this is why plants carry

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.300 
molecule and this is why plants carry
out<00:03:09.210> photosynthesis<00:03:09.990> they<00:03:10.230> want<00:03:10.560> this

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
out photosynthesis they want this

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.040 
out photosynthesis they want this
molecule<00:03:11.940> right<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.360> because<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.960> the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
molecule right here because this is the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.770 
molecule right here because this is the
sugar<00:03:13.350> they<00:03:13.560> need<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.950> make<00:03:14.100> energy<00:03:14.330> so<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.630> our

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
sugar they need to make energy so in our

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.660 
sugar they need to make energy so in our
diagram<00:03:16.020> we<00:03:16.470> have<00:03:16.620> our<00:03:16.770> raw<00:03:16.980> materials<00:03:17.460> at<00:03:17.580> the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
diagram we have our raw materials at the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.700 
diagram we have our raw materials at the
top<00:03:17.850> here<00:03:18.300> we<00:03:18.420> have<00:03:18.540> our<00:03:18.690> water<00:03:18.870> now<00:03:19.470> for<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
top here we have our water now for the

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.870 
top here we have our water now for the
record<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.190> know<00:03:20.250> these<00:03:20.520> are<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.730> lot<00:03:20.850> of

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
record I know these are a lot of

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.700 
record I know these are a lot of
droplets<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.660> water<00:03:21.900> molecules<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:22.590> I

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
droplets not water molecules but I

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.530 
droplets not water molecules but I
picked<00:03:23.220> droplets<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.210> can<00:03:24.330> better

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
picked droplets so you can better

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.920 
picked droplets so you can better
identify<00:03:24.890> with<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.490> water<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.970> then<00:03:27.570> we<00:03:27.750> have

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
identify with the water and then we have

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.600 
identify with the water and then we have
sunlight<00:03:28.290> which<00:03:28.680> are<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.920> yellow<00:03:29.130> arrows

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
sunlight which are the yellow arrows

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.580 
sunlight which are the yellow arrows
here<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.120> then<00:03:30.390> we<00:03:30.450> have<00:03:30.540> our<00:03:30.660> carbon<00:03:31.050> dioxide

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
here and then we have our carbon dioxide

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.280 
here and then we have our carbon dioxide
carbon<00:03:32.280> has<00:03:32.940> one<00:03:32.970> carbon<00:03:33.510> which<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.080> one

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
carbon has one carbon which is the one

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.040 
carbon has one carbon which is the one
black<00:03:34.680> atom<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.730> molecule<00:03:36.210> and<00:03:36.720> then<00:03:36.870> it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
black atom in the molecule and then it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.230 
black atom in the molecule and then it
has<00:03:37.170> two<00:03:37.500> oxygens<00:03:38.070> which<00:03:38.670> are<00:03:38.790> represented<00:03:39.210> by

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
has two oxygens which are represented by

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.320 
has two oxygens which are represented by
the<00:03:39.300> two<00:03:39.570> red<00:03:40.070> molecules<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:41.550> this<00:03:41.790> diagram

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
the two red molecules so in this diagram

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.680 
the two red molecules so in this diagram
or<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.370> lesson<00:03:44.370> here<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.940> red<00:03:45.180> molecules

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
or in this lesson here the red molecules

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.080 
or in this lesson here the red molecules
will<00:03:45.870> be<00:03:46.050> representing<00:03:46.620> oxygen<00:03:47.160> so<00:03:47.820> here's

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
will be representing oxygen so here's

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.640 
will be representing oxygen so here's
what<00:03:48.240> happens<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.990> first<00:03:49.230> part<00:03:49.500> of

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
what happens in the first part of

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.260 
what happens in the first part of
photosynthesis<00:03:50.580> sunlight<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.090> going<00:03:51.150> to

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
photosynthesis sunlight is going to

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.300 
photosynthesis sunlight is going to
travel<00:03:51.510> from<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.870> Sun<00:03:52.140> okay

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
travel from the Sun okay

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.670 
travel from the Sun okay
eight<00:03:53.580> minutes<00:03:54.240> through<00:03:54.600> space<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.200> then

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
eight minutes through space and then

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.660 
eight minutes through space and then
it's<00:03:55.800> going<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.950> travel<00:03:56.250> through<00:03:56.640> our

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
it's going to travel through our

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.570 
it's going to travel through our
atmosphere<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.380> down<00:03:58.530> towards<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.010> surface

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
atmosphere and down towards the surface

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.340 
atmosphere and down towards the surface
of<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> earth<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.210> hid<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.450> leaf<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.990> then<00:04:01.110> go

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
of the earth and hid it leaf and then go

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.050 
of the earth and hid it leaf and then go
through<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.650> leaf<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.010> travel<00:04:02.820> through<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
through the leaf and travel through the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.550 
through the leaf and travel through the
chloroplast<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.810> it's<00:04:03.900> going<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.110> strike<00:04:04.410> the

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
chloroplast and it's going to strike the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.740 
chloroplast and it's going to strike the
thylakoid<00:04:05.100> all<00:04:05.940> right<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.330> lights<00:04:06.510> going

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
thylakoid all right so the lights going

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.500 
thylakoid all right so the lights going
to<00:04:06.810> strike<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.410> thylakoid<00:04:08.180> structures<00:04:09.180> here

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
to strike the thylakoid structures here

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.320 
to strike the thylakoid structures here
while<00:04:10.350> that's<00:04:10.560> happening<00:04:10.830> we<00:04:11.790> talked<00:04:12.060> about

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
while that's happening we talked about

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.440 
while that's happening we talked about
how<00:04:12.620> leaves<00:04:13.620> have<00:04:14.070> vessels<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.060> in<00:04:15.240> those

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
how leaves have vessels and in those

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.910 
how leaves have vessels and in those
vessels<00:04:15.660> they<00:04:15.959> have<00:04:16.049> vascular<00:04:16.410> tissue<00:04:16.709> called

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
vessels they have vascular tissue called

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.729 
vessels they have vascular tissue called
xylem<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.390> xylem<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.049> what<00:04:19.200> carries<00:04:19.620> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
xylem and the xylem is what carries the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.560 
xylem and the xylem is what carries the
water<00:04:19.980> so<00:04:20.340> while<00:04:20.609> all<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.180> sunlight<00:04:21.390> is

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
water so while all the sunlight is

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.850 
water so while all the sunlight is
coming<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:21.960> water<00:04:22.229> is<00:04:22.440> also<00:04:22.710> being

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
coming in water is also being

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.110 
coming in water is also being
transported<00:04:23.430> into<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.870> chloroplast

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
transported into the chloroplast

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.490 
transported into the chloroplast
now<00:04:27.270> when<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:27.660> happens<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:30.600> light<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.290> going

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
now when that happens the light is going

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.560 
now when that happens the light is going
to<00:04:31.680> split<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.280> water<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:32.820> if<00:04:32.970> we<00:04:33.090> take<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.300> look

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
to split the water so if we take a look

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.050 
to split the water so if we take a look
up<00:04:33.720> here<00:04:33.750> you'll<00:04:34.380> see<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:34.940> water<00:04:35.940> is

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
up here you'll see that water is

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.080 
up here you'll see that water is
hydrogen<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:36.870> oxygen<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.340> oxygen<00:04:38.790> is

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
hydrogen and oxygen so the oxygen is

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.000 
hydrogen and oxygen so the oxygen is
going<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.449> be<00:04:39.600> split<00:04:40.020> apart<00:04:40.169> from<00:04:40.830> the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
going to be split apart from the

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.490 
going to be split apart from the
hydrogen<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.760> then<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.300> oxygen<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:43.139> going<00:04:43.320> to

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
hydrogen and then the oxygen is going to

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.390 
hydrogen and then the oxygen is going to
be<00:04:43.620> floating<00:04:44.430> freely<00:04:44.850> in<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.960> chloroplast

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
be floating freely in the chloroplast

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.460 
be floating freely in the chloroplast
well<00:04:47.400> oxygens<00:04:48.270> don't<00:04:48.479> like<00:04:48.600> to<00:04:48.720> be<00:04:48.840> alone<00:04:49.110> so

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
well oxygens don't like to be alone so

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.780 
well oxygens don't like to be alone so
they're<00:04:49.620> going<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.860> buddy<00:04:50.130> up<00:04:50.340> with<00:04:50.370> another

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
they're going to buddy up with another

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.330 
they're going to buddy up with another
oxygen<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.660> create<00:04:51.930> molecules<00:04:52.470> called<00:04:53.130> Oh

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
oxygen and create molecules called Oh

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.969 
oxygen and create molecules called Oh
too<00:04:53.400> or<00:04:53.880> oxygen<00:04:54.360> molecules<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.440> this<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.860> how

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
too or oxygen molecules and this is how

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.100 
too or oxygen molecules and this is how
the<00:04:56.040> oxygen<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.850> we<00:04:56.910> breathe<00:04:57.060> is<00:04:57.510> created

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
the oxygen that we breathe is created

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.040 
the oxygen that we breathe is created
the<00:04:58.830> splitting<00:04:59.250> of<00:04:59.370> water<00:04:59.400> makes<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.510> oxygen

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
the splitting of water makes the oxygen

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.570 
the splitting of water makes the oxygen
and<00:05:01.200> then<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.440> oxygen<00:05:01.590> leaves<00:05:02.250> the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
and then the oxygen leaves the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.820 
and then the oxygen leaves the
chloroplast<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.510> then<00:05:04.020> leaves<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.560> plant

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
chloroplast and then leaves the plant

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.129 
chloroplast and then leaves the plant
cell<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.400> then<00:05:05.880> leaves<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.479> leaf<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:06.990> then

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
cell and then leaves the leaf and then

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.780 
cell and then leaves the leaf and then
goes<00:05:07.410> into<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.680> atmosphere<00:05:07.830> where<00:05:08.460> we

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
goes into the atmosphere where we

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.370 
goes into the atmosphere where we
happily<00:05:09.150> breathe<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.540> into<00:05:09.780> our<00:05:09.870> lungs<00:05:10.080> and

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
happily breathe it into our lungs and

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.320 
happily breathe it into our lungs and
use<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.620> for<00:05:10.740> energy<00:05:10.880> okay<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:11.940> that's<00:05:12.240> the

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
use it for energy okay so that's the

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.060 
use it for energy okay so that's the
first<00:05:12.570> part<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.900> photosynthesis<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.770> just<00:05:13.979> a

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
first part of photosynthesis is just a

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.760 
first part of photosynthesis is just a
splitting<00:05:14.490> of<00:05:14.610> water<00:05:15.139> produces<00:05:16.139> oxygen<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:16.680> a

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
splitting of water produces oxygen is a

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.350 
splitting of water produces oxygen is a
waste<00:05:16.979> but<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.370> main<00:05:17.669> reason<00:05:17.700> why<00:05:18.300> this

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
waste but the main reason why this

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.040 
waste but the main reason why this
happens<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.289> so<00:05:19.830> energy<00:05:20.400> is<00:05:20.430> made<00:05:20.940> now<00:05:21.720> when

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
happens is so energy is made now when

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.960 
happens is so energy is made now when
the<00:05:22.169> energy<00:05:22.590> is<00:05:22.710> made<00:05:22.950> this<00:05:23.340> energy<00:05:23.760> is<00:05:23.820> going

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
the energy is made this energy is going

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.610 
the energy is made this energy is going
to<00:05:24.150> be<00:05:24.240> used<00:05:24.510> for<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.810> second<00:05:25.380> part<00:05:25.530> of

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
to be used for the second part of

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.610 
to be used for the second part of
photosynthesis<00:05:26.430> now<00:05:27.180> these<00:05:27.960> energy

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
photosynthesis now these energy

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.629 
photosynthesis now these energy
molecules<00:05:29.220> then<00:05:29.850> leave<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.600> thylakoid<00:05:31.639> okay

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
molecules then leave the thylakoid okay

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.170 
molecules then leave the thylakoid okay
so<00:05:32.700> they<00:05:32.940> travel<00:05:33.419> out<00:05:33.570> into<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:34.110> stroma<00:05:34.680> and

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
so they travel out into the stroma and

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.640 
so they travel out into the stroma and
when<00:05:36.180> they<00:05:36.270> travel<00:05:36.660> out<00:05:36.720> into<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:37.080> stroma

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
when they travel out into the stroma

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.700 
when they travel out into the stroma
they're<00:05:38.340> going<00:05:38.639> to<00:05:38.760> react<00:05:39.150> with<00:05:39.930> diffused

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
they're going to react with diffused

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.010 
they're going to react with diffused
carbon<00:05:41.340> dioxide<00:05:41.910> that's<00:05:42.150> already<00:05:42.750> been

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
carbon dioxide that's already been

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.159 
carbon dioxide that's already been
inside<00:05:43.470> of<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.889> chloroplast<00:05:44.720> now<00:05:45.720> this

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
inside of the chloroplast now this

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.200 
inside of the chloroplast now this
reaction<00:05:46.440> here<00:05:47.099> between<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.550> energy<00:05:47.700> and<00:05:47.970> the

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
reaction here between the energy and the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.300 
reaction here between the energy and the
carbon<00:05:48.539> dioxide<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.110> super<00:05:49.530> complicated<00:05:49.919> so

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
carbon dioxide is super complicated so

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.379 
carbon dioxide is super complicated so
we're<00:05:50.430> not<00:05:50.490> really<00:05:50.639> going<00:05:50.789> to<00:05:50.910> go<00:05:51.000> through<00:05:51.270> it

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
we're not really going to go through it

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.210 
we're not really going to go through it
but<00:05:51.930> you<00:05:52.169> should<00:05:52.440> know<00:05:52.650> that<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:53.070> energy

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
but you should know that the energy

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.100 
but you should know that the energy
reacts<00:05:53.849> with<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.090> carbon<00:05:54.270> dioxide<00:05:54.900> and

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
reacts with the carbon dioxide and

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.710 
reacts with the carbon dioxide and
rearranges<00:05:55.680> it<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:55.979> make<00:05:56.190> this<00:05:56.789> molecule<00:05:57.090> here

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
rearranges it to make this molecule here

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.680 
rearranges it to make this molecule here
this<00:05:58.500> is<00:05:58.740> our<00:05:58.919> glucose<00:05:59.340> molecule<00:05:59.910> and<00:06:00.180> then

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
this is our glucose molecule and then

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.930 
this is our glucose molecule and then
once<00:06:00.900> the<00:06:01.020> glucose<00:06:01.410> is<00:06:01.590> made<00:06:01.830> it<00:06:02.370> travels<00:06:02.820> out

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
once the glucose is made it travels out

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.820 
once the glucose is made it travels out
of<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.120> chloroplast<00:06:03.419> and<00:06:03.930> then<00:06:04.169> into<00:06:04.680> the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
of the chloroplast and then into the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.219 
of the chloroplast and then into the
phloem<00:06:05.370> vessels<00:06:05.400> or<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.479> phloem<00:06:06.780> tissue<00:06:07.020> of

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
phloem vessels or the phloem tissue of

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.110 
phloem vessels or the phloem tissue of
the<00:06:07.320> vessels<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:07.919> then<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.430> glucose<00:06:08.849> gets

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
the vessels and then the glucose gets

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.210 
the vessels and then the glucose gets
sent<00:06:09.360> out<00:06:09.510> to<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:09.930> rest<00:06:10.169> of<00:06:10.320> the<00:06:10.380> plant<00:06:10.650> so<00:06:11.130> the

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
sent out to the rest of the plant so the

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.000 
sent out to the rest of the plant so the
plant<00:06:11.490> can<00:06:11.669> make<00:06:11.789> energy<00:06:12.139> okay<00:06:13.139> so<00:06:13.200> this<00:06:13.770> is

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
plant can make energy okay so this is

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.950 
plant can make energy okay so this is
how<00:06:14.479> chloroplasts<00:06:15.479> carry<00:06:15.750> out

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
how chloroplasts carry out

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.560 
how chloroplasts carry out
photosynthesis<00:06:17.060> thank<00:06:18.060> you<00:06:18.210> and<00:06:18.330> I<00:06:18.360> hope<00:06:18.479> that

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
photosynthesis thank you and I hope that

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.810 
photosynthesis thank you and I hope that
was<00:06:18.780> helpful
