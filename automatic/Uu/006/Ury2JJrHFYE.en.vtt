and I think in every country in every

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.789 
and I think in every country in every
culture<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:15.990> are<00:01:16.110> people<00:01:16.350> who<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.530> like

culture there are people who think like
that<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.670> type<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> guy<00:01:18.150> rather<00:01:18.600> than<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that so it's a type of guy rather than a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.289 
that so it's a type of guy rather than a
British<00:01:19.680> type<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.100> guy<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.939> know

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
British type of guy and I think you know

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.850 
British type of guy and I think you know
everyone<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.780> relate<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.229> now<00:01:22.650> as<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
everyone can relate to that now as a
