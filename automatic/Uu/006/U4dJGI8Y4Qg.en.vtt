using the washing machine some other
nice<00:01:42.969> features<00:01:43.359> of<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.869> bag<00:01:44.020> then<00:01:44.259> we<00:01:44.409> have

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
nice features of the bag then we have

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.770 
nice features of the bag then we have
the<00:01:44.859> zip<00:01:45.249> off<00:01:45.429> top<00:01:45.819> part<00:01:46.090> here<00:01:46.329> which<00:01:46.509> you<00:01:46.630> can

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
the zip off top part here which you can

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.379 
the zip off top part here which you can
just<00:01:47.020> see<00:01:47.170> has<00:01:47.799> a<00:01:48.100> built<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:48.759> pillow<00:01:48.999> which<00:01:49.240> is

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:49.389 
just see has a built in pillow which is

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:51.660 
just see has a built in pillow which is
of<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.630> good<00:01:49.840> size<00:01:50.109> and<00:01:50.439> shape<00:01:50.740> as<00:01:51.189> I<00:01:51.429> say<00:01:51.579> it

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
of a good size and shape as I say it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.950 
of a good size and shape as I say it
does<00:01:51.819> dip<00:01:52.060> off<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:52.329> if<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.479> don't<00:01:52.659> want<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.840> use

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
does dip off so if you don't want to use

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.719 
does dip off so if you don't want to use
that<00:01:52.990> then<00:01:53.619> there<00:01:53.740> is<00:01:53.829> just<00:01:54.039> a<00:01:54.130> zip<00:01:54.310> here<00:01:54.520> and

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
that then there is just a zip here and

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.249 
that then there is just a zip here and
we<00:01:54.789> can<00:01:54.939> simply<00:01:55.270> just<00:01:55.420> remove<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.810> who'd

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
we can simply just remove that who'd

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.160 
we can simply just remove that who'd
easily<00:01:56.829> enough<00:01:57.219> if<00:01:58.209> I<00:01:58.329> open<00:01:58.569> this<00:01:58.689> up<00:01:58.840> what<00:01:59.049> you

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
easily enough if I open this up what you

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.080 
easily enough if I open this up what you
will<00:01:59.319> find<00:01:59.530> here<00:01:59.889> is<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.459> we<00:02:00.670> have<00:02:00.850> some

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
will find here is that we have some

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.149 
will find here is that we have some
loops<00:02:01.359> at<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.929> top<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.649> can<00:02:02.859> just<00:02:03.009> see

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
loops at the top so you can just see

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.309 
loops at the top so you can just see
here<00:02:03.429> and<00:02:03.969> one<00:02:04.240> in<00:02:04.359> the<00:02:04.479> other<00:02:04.509> corner<00:02:04.899> and

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
here and one in the other corner and

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.809 
here and one in the other corner and
you'll<00:02:05.679> find<00:02:05.859> that<00:02:05.950> there's<00:02:06.130> another<00:02:06.340> two<00:02:06.609> on

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
you'll find that there's another two on

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.550 
you'll find that there's another two on
the<00:02:06.969> bottom<00:02:07.329> corners<00:02:07.719> of<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.050> bag<00:02:08.229> as<00:02:08.410> well

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the bottom corners of the bag as well

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.520 
the bottom corners of the bag as well
now<00:02:09.399> what<00:02:09.580> those<00:02:09.700> are<00:02:09.910> for<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.330> for<00:02:10.690> any<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.290> our

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
now what those are for is for any of our

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.680 
now what those are for is for any of our
out<00:02:11.830> well<00:02:12.070> sleeping<00:02:12.580> bag<00:02:12.790> liners<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.540> can

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
out well sleeping bag liners you can

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.600 
out well sleeping bag liners you can
actually<00:02:13.840> place<00:02:14.350> into<00:02:14.800> these<00:02:14.950> bags<00:02:15.220> and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
actually place into these bags and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.160 
actually place into these bags and
connect<00:02:15.940> them<00:02:16.090> into<00:02:16.510> these<00:02:16.630> loops<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.080> the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
connect them into these loops in the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.780 
connect them into these loops in the
corners<00:02:17.530> making<00:02:18.220> sure<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.610> have<00:02:18.760> a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
corners making sure that you have a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.760 
corners making sure that you have a
secure<00:02:19.180> fashion<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.990> liner<00:02:20.350> isn't

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
secure fashion and so the liner isn't

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.700 
secure fashion and so the liner isn't
going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.010> move<00:02:21.160> around<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.730> save<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.210> bag

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
going to move around and save the bag

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.870 
going to move around and save the bag
some<00:02:23.710> other<00:02:23.830> nice<00:02:24.010> features<00:02:24.340> then<00:02:24.490> at<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.670> top

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
some other nice features then at the top

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.660 
some other nice features then at the top
we<00:02:25.330> have<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.750> handy<00:02:26.170> storage<00:02:26.410> pocket<00:02:26.980> up<00:02:27.610> here

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
we have a handy storage pocket up here

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.240 
we have a handy storage pocket up here
and<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:29.290> we<00:02:29.380> have<00:02:29.500> plenty<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:29.920> detail<00:02:30.220> to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
show you on these zips themselves so

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.010 
show you on these zips themselves so
just<00:02:33.250> start<00:02:33.430> off<00:02:33.550> with<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> zip<00:02:34.030> cooler<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.690> a

just start off with the zip cooler is a
YKK<00:02:35.740> zip<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.030> good<00:02:37.300> quality<00:02:37.450> zip

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
YKK zip so this is a good quality zip

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.870 
YKK zip so this is a good quality zip
and<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.500> also<00:02:38.620> has<00:02:38.860> an<00:02:38.950> auto<00:02:39.130> lock<00:02:39.430> feature<00:02:39.670> on

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
and it also has an auto lock feature on

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.220 
and it also has an auto lock feature on
it<00:02:40.000> as<00:02:40.090> well<00:02:40.240> which<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:40.780> see<00:02:40.960> here

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
it as well which you can just see here

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.449

undone<00:02:42.670> during<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.540> night<00:02:43.720> we<00:02:44.680> then<00:02:44.830> feature

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
undone during the night we then feature

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.330 
undone during the night we then feature
our<00:02:45.670> EZ<00:02:46.000> glide<00:02:46.209> system<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.020> when<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.380> do<00:02:48.130> this

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
our EZ glide system so when I do this

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.220 
our EZ glide system so when I do this
you<00:02:48.640> can<00:02:48.790> see<00:02:48.940> just<00:02:49.150> how<00:02:49.240> easy<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.080> open

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
you can see just how easy it is to open

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.410 
you can see just how easy it is to open
and<00:02:50.590> close<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.830> bag<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.030> zips<00:02:52.240> not

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
and close the bag so the zips not

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
getting caught on any material if I just

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.940 
getting caught on any material if I just
show<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.420> this<00:02:55.600> in<00:02:55.780> detail<00:02:56.110> how<00:02:56.500> we<00:02:56.530> managed

show you this in detail how we managed

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.290 
show you this in detail how we managed
to<00:02:56.980> do<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:57.489> we<00:02:57.610> have<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> zip<00:02:58.030> on<00:02:58.209> the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
to do that so we have the zip on the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.090 
to do that so we have the zip on the
outside<00:02:58.660> obviously<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.410> then<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.950> inside

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
outside obviously and then on the inside

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.880 
outside obviously and then on the inside
we<00:03:00.550> have<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:00.940> luminous<00:03:01.900> piping<00:03:02.350> which<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.709> a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
we have this luminous piping which is a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.320 
we have this luminous piping which is a
nice<00:03:03.040> bit<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.250> visual<00:03:03.640> detail<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.209> is

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
nice bit of visual detail but it is

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.449 
nice bit of visual detail but it is
obviously<00:03:05.230> protecting<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:05.860> up<00:03:05.980> as<00:03:06.130> well

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
obviously protecting this up as well

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.699 
obviously protecting this up as well
then<00:03:07.030> behind<00:03:07.330> there<00:03:07.600> we<00:03:07.840> also<00:03:07.989> tape<00:03:08.380> this

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
then behind there we also tape this

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.490 
then behind there we also tape this
piece<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.070> material<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:09.670> this<00:03:10.180> site<00:03:10.450> then<00:03:11.350> on

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
piece of material on this site then on

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.320 
piece of material on this site then on
the<00:03:11.620> other<00:03:11.739> side<00:03:12.010> we<00:03:12.220> have<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.760> material

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
the other side we have this material

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.670 
the other side we have this material
here<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:13.720> opposed<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.260> microfiber

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
here as opposed to the microfiber

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.070 
here as opposed to the microfiber
polyester<00:03:15.430> again<00:03:15.790> just<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.270> stop<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.930> zip

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
polyester again just to stop the zip

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.840 
polyester again just to stop the zip
from<00:03:17.260> catching<00:03:17.500> on<00:03:17.770> any<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.400> material

from catching on any of the material

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.840 
from catching on any of the material
then<00:03:19.570> we<00:03:20.080> also<00:03:20.290> have<00:03:20.590> more<00:03:21.100> piping<00:03:21.549> here<00:03:21.730> as

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
then we also have more piping here as

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.100 
then we also have more piping here as
well<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.120> quite<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.360> lot<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.540> detail<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:23.019> these

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
well so quite a lot of detail in these

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
can open it up like I said as a divvy

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.360 
can open it up like I said as a divvy
and<00:04:04.450> then<00:04:04.660> attach<00:04:05.170> two<00:04:05.440> on<00:04:05.650> top<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:05.920> each<00:04:06.130> other
