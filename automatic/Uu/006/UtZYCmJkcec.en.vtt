my other video with the taliah waajid

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.749 
my other video with the taliah waajid
hairstyle<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.840> would<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:44.009> would<00:01:44.399> be

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
hairstyle I would like I would be

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.109 
hairstyle I would like I would be
pushing<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.600> weeks<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> hairstyle<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.880 

for<00:01:51.119> my<00:01:51.270> mini<00:01:51.540> twists<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.500> had<00:01:52.680> two

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
for my mini twists I think it had two

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.740 
for my mini twists I think it had two
things<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:53.820> twist<00:01:54.149> lasted<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.720> long

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
things that it my twist lasted so long

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.810 
things that it my twist lasted so long
full<00:01:55.229> first<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.189> they<00:01:56.280> lasted<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.790> long

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
full first I think they lasted so long

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.219 
full first I think they lasted so long
because<00:01:57.079> they<00:01:58.079> were<00:01:58.200> smaller<00:01:59.060> and<00:02:00.140> second<00:02:01.140> I

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
because they were smaller and second I

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.920 
because they were smaller and second I
think<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.590> lasted<00:02:02.040> longer<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> used

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
think it lasted longer because I used

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.880 
think it lasted longer because I used
this<00:02:04.200> stuff

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
this stuff

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.620 
this stuff
and<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.430> helped<00:02:06.090> my<00:02:06.210> twisting

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
and it really helped my twisting

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.760 
and it really helped my twisting
together<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.380> place<00:02:07.890> longer<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.959> made<00:02:10.619> them

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
together in place longer and made them

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.640 
together in place longer and made them
look<00:02:10.800> healthier<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.470> approve

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
look healthier and approve

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.380 
look healthier and approve
the<00:02:13.769> moisture<00:02:14.040> improve<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> moisture<00:02:15.209> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
the moisture improve the moisture and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.399 
the moisture improve the moisture and
stuff<00:02:15.599> like<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:18.299> ingredients<00:02:19.019> aren't

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
stuff like that the ingredients aren't

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:26.600 
stuff like that the ingredients aren't
all-natural<00:02:21.799> but<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:25.590> they<00:02:25.799> do<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.280> does

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
all-natural but in they do it does

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.830 
all-natural but in they do it does
contain<00:02:26.970> parabens<00:02:27.650> but<00:02:28.650> for<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.459> most<00:02:29.640> part

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840

but actually it didn't even do much in
this<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:04.170> was<00:03:04.319> good<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.310> brand<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:06.120> a

that product line is really good and

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.330 
that product line is really good and
people<00:03:19.019> abbreviate<00:03:19.709> organic<00:03:20.190> root

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340

people abbreviate organic root
stimulator<00:03:20.609> as<00:03:21.060> ORS<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.769> that's<00:03:23.609> how<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
stimulator as ORS so that's how the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.449 
stimulator as ORS so that's how the
title<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.269> my<00:03:24.419> video<00:03:24.569> is<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.470> that's<00:03:26.220> what<00:03:26.340> it

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
title of my video is and that's what it

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.940 
title of my video is and that's what it
stands<00:03:26.700> for<00:03:26.900> locking<00:03:27.900> twist<00:03:28.319> gel<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.739> think

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
stands for locking twist gel and I think

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.979 
stands for locking twist gel and I think
you've<00:03:29.099> all<00:03:29.250> probably<00:03:29.489> seen<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.269> before<00:03:30.480> and
