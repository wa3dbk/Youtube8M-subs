00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
actually learned this recently at my new

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.670 
actually learned this recently at my new
place<00:01:50.979> of<00:01:51.340> work<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.930> they<00:01:52.930> taught<00:01:53.140> us<00:01:53.170> this<00:01:53.470> on

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
place of work and they taught us this on

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.680 
place of work and they taught us this on
a<00:01:53.710> barrel<00:01:54.250> curl<00:01:54.520> with<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.760> curling<00:01:55.420> iron<00:01:55.540> you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
a barrel curl with the curling iron you

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.480 
a barrel curl with the curling iron you
can<00:01:55.780> use<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.020> on<00:01:56.229> really<00:01:56.530> any<00:01:56.800> kind<00:01:57.160> of<00:01:57.280> curl

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
can use it on really any kind of curl

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.300 
can use it on really any kind of curl
but<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:58.540> helps<00:01:58.900> so<00:01:59.260> much<00:01:59.470> more<00:01:59.890> when<00:02:00.160> it

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
but it just helps so much more when it

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.140 
but it just helps so much more when it
comes<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:01.710> volume<00:02:02.710> it's<00:02:03.010> amazing<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.120> love

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
comes to volume it's amazing and I love

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.000 
comes to volume it's amazing and I love
doing<00:02:04.660> it<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:04.870> that's<00:02:05.020> why<00:02:05.260> I<00:02:05.290> tried<00:02:05.440> it<00:02:05.920> out

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
doing it and that's why I tried it out

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.310 
doing it and that's why I tried it out
on<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.340> velcro<00:02:06.550> rollers<00:02:07.090> because<00:02:07.900> velcro

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
on the velcro rollers because velcro

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.660 
on the velcro rollers because velcro
rollers<00:02:08.649> are<00:02:08.860> there<00:02:09.280> for<00:02:10.230> volume<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.860> you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
rollers are there for volume so you

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.810 
rollers are there for volume so you
don't<00:02:13.000> really<00:02:13.330> need<00:02:13.950> absolutely<00:02:14.950> have<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.610> use

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
don't really need absolutely have to use

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.570 
don't really need absolutely have to use
the<00:02:16.390> quick<00:02:16.600> tease<00:02:16.930> or<00:02:17.350> any<00:02:17.800> kind<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.070> spray<00:02:18.340> I'm

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
the quick tease or any kind of spray I'm

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
hair slowly and efficiently so that when

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.040 
hair slowly and efficiently so that when

you go to take it out it's going to come
out<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.470> lot<00:02:38.980> easier

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.130 

sire

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.550 

as<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.980> can<00:02:49.130> see<00:02:49.370> I'm<00:02:49.580> using<00:02:49.870> different<00:02:50.870> sizes

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
as you can see I'm using different sizes

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.270 
as you can see I'm using different sizes
for<00:02:51.800> my<00:02:52.580> velcro<00:02:53.180> rollers<00:02:53.810> I'm<00:02:54.190> pretty<00:02:55.190> much

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
for my velcro rollers I'm pretty much

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.940 
for my velcro rollers I'm pretty much
trying<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.000> make<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.510> sections<00:02:57.020> for<00:02:57.740> each

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
trying to make the sections for each

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.430 
trying to make the sections for each
section<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.970> i'm<00:02:59.090> doing<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.840> velcro<00:03:00.230> roller

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
section that i'm doing a velcro roller

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.030 
section that i'm doing a velcro roller
on<00:03:00.730> about<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:02.030> size<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.290> width<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.740> the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
on about the size of the width of the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.440 
on about the size of the width of the
roller<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.540> if<00:03:06.110> one<00:03:06.740> of<00:03:06.890> my<00:03:06.920> rollers<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:08.060> half

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
roller so if one of my rollers is a half

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.500 
roller so if one of my rollers is a half
inch<00:03:08.750> I'm<00:03:09.170> making<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.520> pretty<00:03:10.820> small

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
inch I'm making it a pretty small

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.490 
inch I'm making it a pretty small
section<00:03:12.500> as<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:13.640> just<00:03:13.850> saw<00:03:14.030> with<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.200> velcro

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
section as you just saw with that velcro

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.070 
section as you just saw with that velcro
roller<00:03:15.920> it's<00:03:16.280> pretty<00:03:16.760> large<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.510> I'm<00:03:17.630> taking<00:03:17.840> a

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
roller it's pretty large so I'm taking a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.500 
roller it's pretty large so I'm taking a
lot<00:03:18.320> more<00:03:18.350> hair<00:03:18.770> once<00:03:19.640> they're<00:03:19.940> all<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.330> we

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
lot more hair once they're all in we

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.540 
lot more hair once they're all in we
want<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.810> set<00:03:21.020> for<00:03:21.290> about<00:03:21.380> 20<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.010> 30<00:03:22.220> minutes

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
want to set for about 20 to 30 minutes

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.110 
want to set for about 20 to 30 minutes
so<00:03:22.820> that<00:03:22.850> they<00:03:23.090> can<00:03:23.300> form<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:25.120> voluminous

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
so that they can form in that voluminous

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.320 
so that they can form in that voluminous
shape<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.140> when<00:03:27.950> you're<00:03:28.100> taking<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.580> down<00:03:28.820> you

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
shape and when you're taking it down you

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.500 
shape and when you're taking it down you
want<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.750> kind<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.620> keep<00:03:31.130> that<00:03:31.370> curl<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:32.000> there

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
want to kind of keep that curl in there

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.050 
want to kind of keep that curl in there
you're<00:03:33.380> not<00:03:33.410> necessarily<00:03:34.100> trying<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.670> keep<00:03:34.880> an

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
you're not necessarily trying to keep an

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.220 
you're not necessarily trying to keep an
actual<00:03:35.709> curl<00:03:36.880> formation<00:03:37.880> because<00:03:38.480> once<00:03:38.989> you

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
actual curl formation because once you

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.990 
actual curl formation because once you
comb<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.530> out<00:03:39.739> it's<00:03:40.040> not<00:03:40.220> going<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.430> stay<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:40.820> a

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
comb it out it's not going to stay in a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.900 
comb it out it's not going to stay in a
curl<00:03:41.239> but<00:03:41.989> that's<00:03:42.200> going<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.590> help<00:03:42.830> keep<00:03:43.610> that

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
curl but that's going to help keep that

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.300 
curl but that's going to help keep that
volume<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.690> hair<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.530> that's<00:03:45.920> why<00:03:46.160> I'm

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
volume in the hair and that's why I'm

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.980 
volume in the hair and that's why I'm
spraying<00:03:46.700> each<00:03:47.000> one<00:03:47.239> as<00:03:47.390> I<00:03:47.450> take<00:03:48.050> them<00:03:48.350> down

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.160 

and<00:03:54.410> see<00:03:55.400> how<00:03:55.580> much<00:03:55.760> volume<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:56.510> have<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.080> I
