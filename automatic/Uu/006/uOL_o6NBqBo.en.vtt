00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579 

here<00:00:00.390> we<00:00:00.539> are<00:00:00.570> with<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:00.930> growth<00:00:01.140> structures

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
here we are with the growth structures

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.379 
here we are with the growth structures
of<00:00:01.709> the<00:00:01.800> spinal<00:00:02.040> cord<00:00:02.250> and<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:02.909> tends<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.240> be

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
of the spinal cord and this tends to be

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.670 
of the spinal cord and this tends to be
very<00:00:03.570> simple<00:00:03.990> because<00:00:04.200> there's<00:00:04.380> not<00:00:04.440> too<00:00:04.589> many

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
very simple because there's not too many

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.980 
very simple because there's not too many
structures<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.879> can<00:00:06.060> be<00:00:06.120> kind<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.480> clearly

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
structures that can be kind of clearly

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.350 
structures that can be kind of clearly
identified<00:00:07.620> or<00:00:07.859> just<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.580> there's<00:00:08.760> just<00:00:09.000> not

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
identified or just that there's just not

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.089 
identified or just that there's just not
so<00:00:09.719> let's<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.170> course<00:00:10.380> get<00:00:10.559> oriented<00:00:10.920> of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
so let's of course get oriented of

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.890 
so let's of course get oriented of
course<00:00:11.370> as<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.820> beginning<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.330> up<00:00:12.540> here<00:00:12.750> is

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
course as the beginning so up here is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.150 
course as the beginning so up here is
the<00:00:13.019> brain<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> most<00:00:13.889> superior

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the brain so this is the most superior

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.589 
the brain so this is the most superior
aspect<00:00:14.549> down<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.059> would<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> most

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
aspect down here would be the most

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.510 
aspect down here would be the most
inferior<00:00:15.839> aspect<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.529> part<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.369> that

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
inferior aspect this part up here that

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.769 
inferior aspect this part up here that
I'm<00:00:17.580> touching<00:00:17.970> would<00:00:18.090> be<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> anterior<00:00:18.630> side

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
I'm touching would be the anterior side

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.179 
I'm touching would be the anterior side
behind<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.260> would<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> posterior<00:00:19.890> side

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
behind this would be the posterior side

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
behind this would be the posterior side
first<00:00:21.119> things<00:00:21.330> first<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.810> kind<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.140> see<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
first things first we kind of see the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.410 
first things first we kind of see the
length<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.310> spinal<00:00:23.640> cord<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.939> run<00:00:24.180> by<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
length the spinal cord is run by the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060 
length the spinal cord is run by the
anterior<00:00:24.960> median<00:00:25.320> fissure<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.859> little

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
anterior median fissure this little

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.890 
anterior median fissure this little
crack<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.519> races<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.449> way<00:00:27.660> straight

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
crack that races all the way straight

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.480 
crack that races all the way straight
down<00:00:27.960> but<00:00:28.650> one<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> other<00:00:28.980> things<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.400> we

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
down but one of the other things that we

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.820 
down but one of the other things that we
see<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> spinal<00:00:31.439> cord<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.679> not

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
see is that that the spinal cord is not

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
see is that that the spinal cord is not
like<00:00:31.980> consistently<00:00:32.790> thick<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.570> way

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
like consistently thick all the way

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
like consistently thick all the way
across<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.200> two<00:00:34.500> thickening<00:00:35.250> Zoar

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
across you get two thickening Zoar

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
across you get two thickening Zoar
enlargements<00:00:36.090> here<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.899> down<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.200> this

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
enlargements here and down here this

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.560 
enlargements here and down here this
would<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.190> cervical<00:00:38.790> enlargement<00:00:38.940> you

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
would be the cervical enlargement you

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.670 
would be the cervical enlargement you
can<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.870> gives<00:00:39.989> innervation<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
can see it gives innervation to the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.590 
can see it gives innervation to the
upper<00:00:41.040> extremity<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.640> then<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> lumbosacral

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
upper extremity and then the lumbosacral

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.680 
upper extremity and then the lumbosacral
largeman<00:00:43.230> which<00:00:43.559> gives<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.040> course<00:00:44.690> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
largeman which gives of course the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.830 
largeman which gives of course the
branches<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.250> lumbar<00:00:47.670> plexus<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
branches of the lumbar plexus and the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200 
branches of the lumbar plexus and the
sacral<00:00:49.170> plexus<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.160> those<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
sacral plexus so those are going to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
sacral plexus so those are going to
interview<00:00:51.660> our<00:00:51.750> lower<00:00:51.960> extremities<00:00:52.530> so

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
interview our lower extremities so

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.590 
interview our lower extremities so
that's<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> first<00:00:53.789> two<00:00:53.969> things<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.390> see

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
that's the first two things that we see

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.119 
that's the first two things that we see
the<00:00:54.899> serve<00:00:55.199> goal<00:00:55.440> enlargement<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.010> then

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the serve goal enlargement and then

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.400 
the serve goal enlargement and then
lumbosacral<00:00:56.760> largeman<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> course

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
lumbosacral largeman and then of course

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770 
lumbosacral largeman and then of course
right<00:00:58.739> at<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> end<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.760> see<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.270> spinal<00:01:00.539> cord

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
right at the end you see the spinal cord

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.529 
right at the end you see the spinal cord
actually<00:01:00.870> end<00:01:01.199> strangely<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.550> l1<00:01:03.239> right

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
actually end strangely at l1 right

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420 
actually end strangely at l1 right
around<00:01:03.690> l1<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.619> course<00:01:04.769> t12

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
around l1 if this is of course t12

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.679 
around l1 if this is of course t12
because<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> ribs<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.479> l1

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
because of the ribs and then you get l1

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.690 
because of the ribs and then you get l1
right<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> end<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.619> ends<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.100> cone<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
right the end it ends like a cone and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.810 
right the end it ends like a cone and
the<00:01:08.820> cone<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.180> called<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> conus<00:01:09.900> medullaris

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
the cone is called the conus medullaris

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.429 
the cone is called the conus medullaris
or<00:01:11.820> also<00:01:12.060> known<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> medullary<00:01:12.689> cone<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
or also known as the medullary cone so

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.590

conus medullaris or CONUS or medullary
cone<00:01:15.750> both<00:01:16.020> are<00:01:16.170> acceptable<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:17.340> yet<00:01:17.549> off<00:01:17.759> of

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
is the phylum terminology it's actually

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
is the phylum terminology it's actually
Pia<00:01:26.220> mater<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.729> always<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.450> sister

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
Pia mater I always think of my sister

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
Pia mater I always think of my sister
and<00:01:28.140> grabbing<00:01:28.710> her<00:01:28.920> foot<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.119> her

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and grabbing her foot you know with her

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
and grabbing her foot you know with her
sock<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.840> pulling<00:01:31.049> her<00:01:31.170> sock<00:01:31.740> off<00:01:31.979> and

sock on and pulling her sock off and
then<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> sock<00:01:33.299> still<00:01:34.259> attached

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
then it's just the sock still attached

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.380 
then it's just the sock still attached
to<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:34.770> foot<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> phylum

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to your foot and that's what the phylum

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.819 
to your foot and that's what the phylum
terminology<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.290> P<00:01:37.470> amount<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.770> this

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
terminology is just P amount of this

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.410 
terminology is just P amount of this
like<00:01:38.040> stretched<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.759> way<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> X<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
like stretched all the way to X like a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.569 
like stretched all the way to X like a
anchor<00:01:39.750> goes<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.350> way<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.100> coccyx

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
anchor goes all the way to the coccyx

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.340 
anchor goes all the way to the coccyx
gets<00:01:42.090> anchored<00:01:42.390> down<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.140> amount

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
gets anchored down so that this amount

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.910 
gets anchored down so that this amount
of<00:01:43.380> cord<00:01:43.560> doesn't<00:01:43.770> bounce<00:01:44.460> around<00:01:44.759> too<00:01:45.090> much

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
of cord doesn't bounce around too much

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
of cord doesn't bounce around too much
but<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> spinal<00:01:47.310> cord<00:01:47.460> ends<00:01:47.670> at<00:01:47.759> l1<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
but if the spinal cord ends at l1 of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.550 
but if the spinal cord ends at l1 of
course<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.110> innervation

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
course you have to have innervation

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.990 
course you have to have innervation
below<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.340> kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> see<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:50.880> this

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
below that you can kind of see all this

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
below that you can kind of see all this
so<00:01:51.210> how<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> spinal<00:01:52.560> cord

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
so how do we do that if the spinal cord

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.249 
so how do we do that if the spinal cord
ends<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:53.220> well<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.060> large<00:01:54.600> connect

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
ends here well we get this large connect

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.730 
ends here well we get this large connect
collection<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.390> reutlitz

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
collection of reutlitz

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.319 
collection of reutlitz
anterior<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> posterior<00:01:59.189> reutlitz<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.180> this

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
anterior and posterior reutlitz and this

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.139 
anterior and posterior reutlitz and this
is<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.960> call<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.409> cauda<00:02:01.770> equina

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
is what we call the cauda equina

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.240 
is what we call the cauda equina
literally<00:02:03.149> translated<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.899> tail<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
literally translated the tail of the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.300 
literally translated the tail of the
horse<00:02:05.490> cata<00:02:06.119> tale<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.930> quite<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> horse<00:02:08.039> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
horse cata tale and quite a horse and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.740 
horse cata tale and quite a horse and
but<00:02:08.520> don't<00:02:08.849> call<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.239> don't<00:02:09.509> call<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
but don't call it that don't call it the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.050 
but don't call it that don't call it the
horse's<00:02:10.140> tail<00:02:10.170> call<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.830> cauda<00:02:11.039> equina<00:02:11.160> so

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
horse's tail call it the cauda equina so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.930 
horse's tail call it the cauda equina so
this<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.599> collection<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.200> reutlitz

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
this is the collection of reutlitz

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.839 
this is the collection of reutlitz
and<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.780> let's<00:02:15.290> go<00:02:15.620> through<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.040> again<00:02:16.340> this

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
and so let's go through that again this

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.490 
and so let's go through that again this
would<00:02:17.060> be<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.330> cervical<00:02:17.780> enlargement<00:02:17.900> this

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
would be the cervical enlargement this

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.990 
would be the cervical enlargement this
would<00:02:18.650> be<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.890> lumbosacral<00:02:19.310> enlargement

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
would be the lumbosacral enlargement

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.280 
would be the lumbosacral enlargement
this<00:02:20.209> would<00:02:20.360> be<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.569> anterior<00:02:21.019> median

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
this would be the anterior median

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.040 
this would be the anterior median
fissure<00:02:21.319> crack<00:02:22.129> all<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.430> way<00:02:22.519> straight<00:02:22.790> down

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
fissure crack all the way straight down

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.750 
fissure crack all the way straight down
this<00:02:24.050> would<00:02:24.349> be<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.709> conus<00:02:25.040> medullaris<00:02:25.069> at

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
this would be the conus medullaris at

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.160 
this would be the conus medullaris at
the<00:02:25.849> end<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.450> would<00:02:26.599> be<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.810> phylum

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
the end this would be the phylum

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.809 
the end this would be the phylum
terminology<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:27.860> comes<00:02:28.220> off<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.670> made

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
terminology that comes off of that made

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.400 
terminology that comes off of that made
out<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.060> pia<00:02:29.269> mater<00:02:29.480> anchoring<00:02:29.870> itself<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.290> the

out of pia mater anchoring itself to the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.530 
out of pia mater anchoring itself to the
coccyx<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.130> then<00:02:31.519> all<00:02:31.730> these<00:02:31.910> reutlitz<00:02:32.390> is

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
coccyx and then all these reutlitz is

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.530 
coccyx and then all these reutlitz is
the<00:02:33.080> cauda<00:02:33.410> equina
