video for the Jackson galaxy base camp
and<00:00:10.890> Tunnel<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:12.060> was<00:00:12.750> also<00:00:13.050> looking<00:00:13.230> online<00:00:13.530> and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
and Tunnel I was also looking online and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.440 
and Tunnel I was also looking online and
it<00:00:14.040> said<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.310> it's<00:00:14.580> called<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.940> cat<00:00:15.180> carrier

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
it said that it's called a cat carrier

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.919 
it said that it's called a cat carrier
so<00:00:15.930> it<00:00:16.560> might<00:00:16.830> be<00:00:17.240> considered<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.419> as<00:00:18.689> well

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:18.929 
so it might be considered that as well
