there<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.610> ones<00:03:28.000> have<00:03:28.120> developed<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.570> little

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
there you ones have developed a little

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.300 
there you ones have developed a little
bit<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.020> it'll<00:03:29.140> be<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.320> little<00:03:29.380> bit<00:03:29.590> better<00:03:29.860> I

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
bit so it'll be a little bit better I

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.490 
bit so it'll be a little bit better I
don't<00:03:31.060> think<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.390> we're<00:03:31.540> as<00:03:32.050> a<00:03:32.080> lead<00:03:32.350> we're

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
don't think that we're as a lead we're

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.870 
don't think that we're as a lead we're
ready<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.770> say<00:03:32.980> we're<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.400> point<00:03:33.490> where

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
ready to say we're to the point where

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.760 
ready to say we're to the point where
one<00:03:34.240> time<00:03:34.450> we<00:03:34.540> had<00:03:34.570> five<00:03:34.840> NFL<00:03:35.260> quarterbacks

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
playing in our league I don't think

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.610

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
program right now so there's reason for

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.960 
program right now so there's reason for
hope<00:04:04.330> no<00:04:05.050> well<00:04:05.200> I<00:04:05.230> think<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:05.980> know<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.400> kind

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
hope no well I think so you know it kind

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.380 
hope no well I think so you know it kind
of<00:04:07.060> goes<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.240> cycles<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:08.760> once<00:04:09.760> those<00:04:09.940> those

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
of goes in cycles and once those those

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.330 
of goes in cycles and once those those
materially<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.560> are<00:04:11.680> good<00:04:11.800> at<00:04:11.890> playing<00:04:12.130> then

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
materially that are good at playing then

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.620 
materially that are good at playing then
I<00:04:12.430> failed<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.940> ones<00:04:13.120> coming<00:04:13.270> in<00:04:13.480> behind

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
I failed and the ones coming in behind

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.020 
I failed and the ones coming in behind
him<00:04:14.160> they<00:04:15.160> got<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.430> be<00:04:15.490> developed<00:04:15.880> for<00:04:15.970> the

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
him they got to be developed for the

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.640 
him they got to be developed for the
most<00:04:16.209> part<00:04:16.390> you<00:04:16.600> know<00:04:16.750> Manziel<00:04:17.200> was<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> special

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
most part you know Manziel was a special

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.800 
most part you know Manziel was a special
case<00:04:17.830> I<00:04:18.160> know<00:04:18.280> he's<00:04:18.430> not<00:04:18.549> just<00:04:18.610> leave<00:04:18.970> but<00:04:19.239> he

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
case I know he's not just leave but he

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.840 
case I know he's not just leave but he
has<00:04:19.930> developed<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.320> lot<00:04:20.440> faster<00:04:20.650> than<00:04:21.040> what

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
has developed a lot faster than what

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.630 
has developed a lot faster than what
most<00:04:22.210> college<00:04:22.630> players<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:24.010> process<00:04:24.430> it

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
most college players the process it

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.820 
most college players the process it
would<00:04:25.030> take<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.300> them<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.540> develop<00:04:25.630> we<00:04:26.590> think

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
would take to them to develop we think

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.440 
would take to them to develop we think
they<00:04:26.950> come<00:04:27.190> in<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.430> little<00:04:27.730> better<00:04:28.030> equipped

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
they come in a little better equipped

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.970 
they come in a little better equipped
with<00:04:28.570> all<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.870> seven<00:04:29.170> on<00:04:29.320> seven

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
with all the seven on seven

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.830 
with all the seven on seven
no<00:04:30.640> question<00:04:31.030> yeah<00:04:31.150> they're<00:04:31.360> further<00:04:31.570> long

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
no question yeah they're further long

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.920 
no question yeah they're further long
now<00:04:32.080> than<00:04:32.380> then<00:04:32.980> we<00:04:33.460> ever<00:04:33.610> work<00:04:33.930> there's
