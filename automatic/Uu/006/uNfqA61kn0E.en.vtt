minutes so now that my bet is nice and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.979 
minutes so now that my bet is nice and
soft<00:00:32.070> I'm<00:00:32.399> gonna<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.730> adding<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.300> my<00:00:33.450> ice<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
soft I'm gonna be adding that my ice and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.959 
soft I'm gonna be adding that my ice and
sugar<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:34.500> gradually<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.430> slower<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
sugar really gradually the slower the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.760 
sugar really gradually the slower the
better<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> reason<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.410> we're<00:00:37.620> using

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
better so the reason that we're using

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.889 
better so the reason that we're using
ice<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.280> sugar<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:38.940> caster<00:00:39.390> sugar<00:00:39.420> is

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
ice and sugar and not caster sugar is

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.229 
ice and sugar and not caster sugar is
purely<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.559> texture<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> use<00:00:41.760> caster

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
purely for texture if you use caster

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.060 
purely for texture if you use caster
sugar<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.660> will<00:00:42.780> taste<00:00:42.960> quite<00:00:43.230> grainy<00:00:43.620> but

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
sugar it will taste quite grainy but

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.740 
sugar it will taste quite grainy but
with<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> ice<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.520> sugar<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.239> lot<00:00:45.390> finer

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
with the ice and sugar it's a lot finer

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.200 
with the ice and sugar it's a lot finer
I've<00:00:46.440> always<00:00:46.800> added<00:00:47.129> all<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.489> my<00:00:47.610> icing<00:00:48.000> sugar

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
now if you can just see the difference

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
now if you can just see the difference
in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> color<00:00:51.570> now<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> lot<00:00:52.199> lighter<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
in the color now it's a lot lighter and

so you want to start off about a good
couple<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.380> centimeters<00:02:28.130> off<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.460> base<00:02:29.030> of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
couple of centimeters off the base of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.510 
couple of centimeters off the base of
your<00:02:29.450> cupcake<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.560> just<00:02:30.950> want<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.280> do<00:02:31.490> a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
your cupcake and you just want to do a

your cupcake and you just want to do a
circular<00:02:32.330> motion<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.710> just<00:02:34.070> keep<00:02:34.370> going

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
circular motion and just keep going

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.600 
circular motion and just keep going
around<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.860> want<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.130> try<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.460> make<00:02:37.580> sure

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
around you want to try and make sure

around you want to try and make sure
that<00:02:38.030> you're<00:02:38.180> squeezing<00:02:38.450> with<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.050> palm<00:02:39.290> of

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
that you're squeezing with the palm of

that you're squeezing with the palm of
your<00:02:39.500> hands<00:02:40.070> that's<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.910> key<00:02:41.240> really<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.080> in

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
your hands that's the key really so in

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.050 
your hands that's the key really so in
order<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.650> give<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:42.920> lots<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.310> heights<00:02:43.610> you

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
order to give it lots of heights you

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.380 
order to give it lots of heights you
want<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.480> just<00:02:44.660> keep<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.230> lift<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.740> up<00:02:46.390> so

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
want to just keep it lift it up so

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.240 
want to just keep it lift it up so
another<00:02:47.810> little<00:02:47.900> technique<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:48.890> just<00:02:49.130> to

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
another little technique it's just to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.790 
another little technique it's just to
make<00:02:49.430> kind<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.850> Peaks<00:02:50.420> with<00:02:51.080> your<00:02:51.230> buttercream

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
make kind of Peaks with your buttercream

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.280 
make kind of Peaks with your buttercream
and<00:02:52.070> just<00:02:52.400> work<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.730> all<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.120> way<00:02:53.450> around<00:02:53.600> and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
and just work it all the way around and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.140 
and just work it all the way around and
if<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.830> see<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.580> way<00:02:55.700> I'm<00:02:55.850> kind<00:02:56.060> of

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
if you can see the way I'm kind of

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.000 
if you can see the way I'm kind of
lifting<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.690> up<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.320> just<00:02:57.500> want<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.710> release

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
lifting it up you just want to release

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.860 
lifting it up you just want to release
it<00:02:58.310> nice<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:58.520> quickly<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.390> then<00:02:59.600> you<00:02:59.690> get

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
it nice and quickly and then you get

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.260 
it nice and quickly and then you get
really<00:03:00.200> nice<00:03:00.410> Peaks<00:03:00.860> I'm<00:03:01.610> now<00:03:01.820> going<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.060> move

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
really nice Peaks I'm now going to move

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.690 
really nice Peaks I'm now going to move
on<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.750> star-shaped<00:03:03.620> nozzle<00:03:03.710> and<00:03:04.400> show

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
on to the star-shaped nozzle and show

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.950 
on to the star-shaped nozzle and show
you<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.880> couple<00:03:05.300> of<00:03:05.390> different<00:03:05.540> techniques

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
you a couple of different techniques

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.930 
you a couple of different techniques
with<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.560> one<00:03:06.770> as<00:03:06.890> well<00:03:07.070> you're<00:03:07.610> going<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.790> do

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
with this one as well you're going to do

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.910 
with this one as well you're going to do
exactly<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.600> same<00:03:08.630> thing<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.260> remember<00:03:09.770> to

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
exactly the same thing just remember to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.560 
exactly the same thing just remember to
keep<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.280> height<00:03:10.550> from<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.090> base<00:03:11.300> of<00:03:11.540> your

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
keep the height from the base of your

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.560 
keep the height from the base of your
cupcake<00:03:12.140> when<00:03:12.830> you're<00:03:13.040> piping<00:03:13.310> around<00:03:13.700> once

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
cupcake when you're piping around once

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.110 
cupcake when you're piping around once
you<00:03:14.840> do<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.110> first<00:03:15.380> layer<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:16.490> then<00:03:16.700> use<00:03:17.090> that

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
you do the first layer you then use that

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.270 
you do the first layer you then use that
as<00:03:17.570> your<00:03:17.780> base<00:03:18.050> for<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.440> next<00:03:18.800> layer<00:03:19.010> so

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
as your base for the next layer so

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.040 
as your base for the next layer so
you've<00:03:19.430> got<00:03:19.580> something<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.180> follow<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.930> then

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
you've got something to follow and then

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.540 
you've got something to follow and then
you<00:03:21.170> get<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.500> height<00:03:21.800> on<00:03:22.040> your<00:03:22.070> buttercream

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
you get that height on your buttercream

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.000 
you get that height on your buttercream
and<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.300> just<00:03:23.510> looks<00:03:23.690> really<00:03:23.780> nice<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.800> neat

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
and it just looks really nice and neat

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.830 
and it just looks really nice and neat
another<00:03:25.520> technique<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.180> like<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:26.570> do<00:03:26.690> with

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
another technique that I like to do with

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.840 
another technique that I like to do with
a<00:03:26.900> star-shaped<00:03:27.170> nozzle<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.370> start<00:03:28.640> from

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
a star-shaped nozzle is to start from

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.510 
a star-shaped nozzle is to start from
the<00:03:28.970> outside<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.960> then<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.320> get<00:03:30.500> really<00:03:31.160> good

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
the outside and then you get really good

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.580 
the outside and then you get really good
Peaks<00:03:31.850> again<00:03:32.300> but<00:03:32.750> just<00:03:32.780> with<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.140> different

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
Peaks again but just with a different

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.810 
Peaks again but just with a different
shape<00:03:33.620> nozzle<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.310> time

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
shape nozzle this time

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.850 
shape nozzle this time
so<00:03:35.360> as<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.630> can<00:03:35.780> see<00:03:35.840> this<00:03:36.200> looks<00:03:36.440> really

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
so as you can see this looks really

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.950 
so as you can see this looks really
great<00:03:37.100> but<00:03:37.460> it's<00:03:37.580> really<00:03:37.910> not<00:03:38.150> too<00:03:38.360> difficult

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
great but it's really not too difficult

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.380 
great but it's really not too difficult
so<00:03:39.520> there<00:03:40.520> you<00:03:40.610> have<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.760> these<00:03:41.090> are<00:03:41.270> my

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
so there you have it these are my

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.900 
so there you have it these are my
perfectly<00:03:41.900> piped<00:03:42.170> cupcakes<00:03:42.740> really<00:03:43.370> nice<00:03:43.670> and

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
perfectly piped cupcakes really nice and

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.060
