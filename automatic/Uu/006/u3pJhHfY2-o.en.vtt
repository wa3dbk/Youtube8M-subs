but the reason I'm trying this new way
of<00:00:47.219> filming<00:00:47.489> things<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.149> because<00:00:48.360> I've<00:00:49.079> been

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
of filming things is because I've been

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.410 
of filming things is because I've been
thinking<00:00:50.399> how<00:00:50.610> am<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.210> film
