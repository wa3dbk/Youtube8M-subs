00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.770
 but 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.329
 hello 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:16.109
 near has read in front of the Aurelian walls stands the building 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.599
 ideal multi-function verbania designed in the heart of the 60s by the studio 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.829
 passarelli 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.640
 which means best represents the spirit of that era 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.590
 a brave international optimistic split considered by bruno zeri 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.059
 one of the best buildings thanks also cagliari of the twentieth century 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.649
 represents a sophisticated elaboration of the theme of the building we go to 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:40.670
 see her 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.030
 sex 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.910
 for you 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.130
 prelude to a metropolis tomorrow made up of free games that animate the center 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.810
 so brown zevi describes the villa apartments that stand at the top 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.750
 to the building built in 1964 in via campania by the passarelli studio 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.320
 kit is inspired and trays in the void of the house on frank lloyd wright's waterfall 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.150
 the chiaroscuro alternation of the agents and the indentations of these 12 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.360
 dwellings x 1 2 levels received the four terminal floors from which emerges the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.560
 lush vegetation of the hanging gardens 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.930
 hot dio and in detail he said mies van der rohe is in line with his lesson 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.210
 the accuracy in the choice of materials bands and planters in cement and grit 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.670
 Mental natural wood fixtures 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.460
 to me the entrance to the touch and open soleil horizontal in cement sicant the pillars 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.980
 broken down and growing beyond the construction I allude to its possible 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.790
 evolution 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.450
 flush with the height of the Aurelian walls it develops below the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.250
 residences the reflective block in browned brewery glass 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.890
 but only apparently it is a cube volume because rotating with respect to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.610
 upper floors the prism follows the trapezoidal shape of the lot 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.840
 surprising with an acute angle of 74 free 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.319
 funky love enough over a bot because it overturns the logic of a 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.520
 strong base on which grows lightening is construction we find 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.410
 under the glass block a backward and lowered base part 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.819
 compared to the state plan 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.069
 seems thought to suck the attention of the past 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.279
 so we don't write mario pisani 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.989
 inviting him to wander around the kingdom in that sort of magical cave 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.169
 from Latin represented by the area intended for retailers 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.299
 texture yendo to the work many of its expressive possibilities the plan 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.369
 commercial was subsequently obscured with deputies to assign to 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:46.589
 workshop study 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:51.129
 moreover, it was precisely the impulse to the tertiary transformation determined in 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.769
 boncompagni district ludovisi from the completion of the underpass of corso 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.019
 of Italy to originate the genesis of this resort building following the 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.249
 demolition of a building of the umbertide residential fabric 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:08.239
 While strict compliance with the rules, a very bare work was carried out 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:08.730
 cLICK 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.580
 able with its TV yeasts to undermine the consolidated language and 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.340
 opening the doors to the marinara of new people in fact here its first steps 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.019
 an architecture capable of becoming a mirror of a society in continuous 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.779
 transformation is able to change with the environment that hosts it 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:30.039
 because as lucio passarelli says a good architect is the one who succeeds in 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:35.159
 feel strongly to interpret concretely the first of the time in which 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:41.749
 the multifunctional features of this building are highlighted by 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:43.929
 taste different from materials 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:45.379
 this is my name 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.870
 we see the residences treated with interest have nothing to do 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.819
 with the wood of the offices at the base the glass that reflects the Aurelian walls 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.229
 why characterized my pc nn worth 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.919
 the importance of this building 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.869
 it transcends its time and brings us back to the present day is a complex building 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:10.290
 in simple language in the image. no way is a lesson that 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.049
 we report my ebay 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.049
 here 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.490
 this multi-functional building 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.200
 commercial and tertiary residential project designed by mauro coronelli over the years 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.759
 70 represents a very particular experimentation on the type of the building 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.270
 it is a Mannerist project that it nevertheless uses 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.220
 very modern material like reinforced concrete buys and ribbon windows 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.679
 in metal to make a work of expressive capacity very important 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:53.400
 pra 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.130
 on an area almost ten times larger than the study building 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.180
 passarelli an still young mauro coronelli designs and builds between the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.360
 1971 in 1976 in piazza san giovanni battista de la salle another 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.090
 interesting example of interpenetration of multiple functions in a single building 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.010
 it uses a simple syntax and standardized components in doing so 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.110
 the black anodized aluminum of the fixtures in the cement left in sight of 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.110
 modular panels create a clear chiaroscuro play 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.470
 orthogonality of the volumes is broken and animated by the circular stimuli of the 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.650
 stays of bathrooms and internal stairs 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.449
 the scanning of beams and pillars that come out at different points on the floor 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.630
 ground for construction determines twittered rhythmic cadence 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.979
 and it is still the structure of pillars on other memory parties 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.370
 building in via campania to unite to recompose the various morphologies dictated 

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:52.229
 by functions 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.289
 on two underground floors used for parking there are shops and 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.169
 offices with a system of tiles on which they stand like on a ground 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.339
 artificial two residential blocks of 4 floors 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.110
 the heart of the intervention is the gallery having them on the ground floor from which one is 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.110
 all vertical paths depart 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.770
 borrelli attentive to the functions if this complex 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:21.379
 through the modulation of the volumes that the stratification of the material 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:25.669
 however this is an architecture that does not celebrate itself but acquits to 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.960
 eminently urban planning function 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.379
 it is a vital junction for the Via Aurelia Boccea district 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.229
 fulfills the function of happiness service
