coming<00:01:18.350> directly<00:01:18.649> to<00:01:18.830> me<00:01:20.440> so<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.530> user

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
coming directly to me so the user

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.320 
coming directly to me so the user
doesn't<00:01:21.770> have<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.130> walk<00:01:22.250> around<00:01:22.399> these<00:01:23.179> it

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
doesn't have to walk around these it

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.820 
doesn't have to walk around these it
doesn't<00:01:23.539> have<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.690> go<00:01:23.780> find<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.110> orders<00:01:24.440> and

doesn't have to go find the orders and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.350 
doesn't have to go find the orders and
it<00:01:24.950> actually<00:01:25.100> increases<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.909> accuracy<00:01:26.149> of

it actually increases the accuracy of
