can<00:00:59.039> jump<00:00:59.280> higher<00:01:01.850> just<00:01:02.850> your<00:01:03.000> normal<00:01:03.149> jump<00:01:03.570> is

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
can jump higher just your normal jump is

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.710 
can jump higher just your normal jump is
higher<00:01:04.519> but<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.850> hold<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.240> down<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.659> then

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
higher but you can hold it down and then

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.190 
higher but you can hold it down and then
you'll<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.140> jetpack<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:09.330> rockets

you<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.740> keep<00:01:19.950> letting<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.720> I'm

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
you just keep letting off and on as I'm

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
you just keep letting off and on as I'm
doing<00:01:22.500> right<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:22.799> I'm<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.640> constantly<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
doing right now I'm not constantly on it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
doing right now I'm not constantly on it
but<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.750> you're<00:01:24.840> constantly<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:26.159> will

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
but if you're constantly on it it will

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.179 
but if you're constantly on it it will
go<00:01:26.759> down<00:01:27.030> very<00:01:27.420> quickly<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.979> hold

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
go down very quickly and if you hold

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.920 
go down very quickly and if you hold
shift<00:01:29.280> it'll<00:01:30.060> make<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.420> where<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.630> kind<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
shift it'll make it to where you kind of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.910 
shift it'll make it to where you kind of
glide<00:01:31.170> down<00:01:33.110> go<00:01:34.110> ahead<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.350> set<00:01:34.560> down<00:01:34.740> this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
glide down go ahead and set down this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.800 
glide down go ahead and set down this
mushroom<00:01:35.340> cow<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.820> will<00:01:35.939> show<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
mushroom cow and I will show you the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.380 
mushroom cow and I will show you the
bullets<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> shoot<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> bullets<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.210> need

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
bullets so to shoot the bullets you need

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.230 
bullets so to shoot the bullets you need
to<00:01:39.509> hit<00:01:39.630> Z<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.400> it's<00:01:41.400> pretty<00:01:41.549> much<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.729> one-shot

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to hit Z and it's pretty much a one-shot

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.289 
to hit Z and it's pretty much a one-shot
kill<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.720> anything<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.850> bullets

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
kill for anything so that's the bullets

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.179 
kill for anything so that's the bullets
and<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> laser<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:47.390> which<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.659> X

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
and then do the laser as well which is X

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.350 
and then do the laser as well which is X
and<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.540> laser<00:01:51.750> sets<00:01:52.140> things<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.530> fire<00:01:53.329> but<00:01:54.329> I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and the laser sets things on fire but I

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.510 
and the laser sets things on fire but I
didn't<00:01:54.810> hit<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.470> cow<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.189> let's<00:01:56.310> see<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.490> we

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
didn't hit the cow so let's see if we

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.690 
didn't hit the cow so let's see if we
can<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.909> again<00:01:57.680> there<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.799> go

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
can do this again there we go

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.969 
can do this again there we go
so<00:02:01.360> that's<00:02:01.689> what<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.930> laser<00:02:02.170> does<00:02:02.439> it<00:02:02.680> shoots

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
so that's what the laser does it shoots

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.190 
so that's what the laser does it shoots
pretty<00:02:03.430> much<00:02:03.670> laser<00:02:04.270> beams<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:04.869> can't<00:02:05.080> really

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
pretty much laser beams you can't really

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.649 
pretty much laser beams you can't really
see<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:06.130> mont<00:02:06.310> crater<00:02:06.580> duds<00:02:06.850> did<00:02:07.150> say<00:02:07.360> he<00:02:07.570> was

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
see the mont crater duds did say he was

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.979 
see the mont crater duds did say he was
working<00:02:08.080> on<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.590> way<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.569> do<00:02:10.569> some<00:02:10.750> sort<00:02:10.959> of

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
working on a way to do some sort of

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.979 
working on a way to do some sort of
particle<00:02:11.410> effect<00:02:11.680> with<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.069> lasers<00:02:12.810> now<00:02:13.810> let

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
particle effect with the lasers now let

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.330 
particle effect with the lasers now let
me<00:02:14.080> go<00:02:14.170> ahead<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.500> go<00:02:14.590> over<00:02:14.739> here<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.980> do<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
me go ahead and go over here to do the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.309 
me go ahead and go over here to do the
massive<00:02:15.790> explosion<00:02:18.870> just<00:02:19.870> head<00:02:20.110> down<00:02:20.290> right

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
massive explosion just head down right

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.590 
massive explosion just head down right
here<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.400> massive<00:02:21.700> explosion<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.510> go

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
here and the massive explosion if you go

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.440 
here and the massive explosion if you go
ahead<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:22.989> hit<00:02:23.140> see<00:02:23.640> it'll<00:02:24.640> set<00:02:24.880> off<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.030> huge

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
ahead and hit see it'll set off a huge

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.270 
ahead and hit see it'll set off a huge
explosion<00:02:25.810> around<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.010> see<00:02:27.190> it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
explosion around you and you can see it

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.820 
explosion around you and you can see it
says<00:02:27.430> warning<00:02:28.239> suit<00:02:28.810> there's<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.590> bunch<00:02:29.739> of

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
says warning suit there's a bunch of

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.970 
says warning suit there's a bunch of
crazy<00:02:30.130> numbers<00:02:30.580> going<00:02:30.880> everywhere<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.980> then

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
crazy numbers going everywhere and then

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.650 
crazy numbers going everywhere and then
it<00:02:33.430> tells<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.819> when<00:02:33.940> you're<00:02:34.090> able<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.360> do<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
it tells you when you're able to do the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.930 
it tells you when you're able to do the
explosion<00:02:35.200> again<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.620> says<00:02:35.890> uber<00:02:36.190> fart<00:02:36.640> ready

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
explosion again it says uber fart ready

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.900 
explosion again it says uber fart ready
sir<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.709> massive<00:02:39.130> explosion<00:02:39.430> and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
sir so that is the massive explosion and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.479 
sir so that is the massive explosion and
then<00:02:40.239> V<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.989> set<00:02:41.319> things<00:02:41.560> on<00:02:41.860> fire<00:02:41.920> like

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
then V is to set things on fire like

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.440 
then V is to set things on fire like
whatever<00:02:42.760> you're<00:02:42.880> looking<00:02:43.000> at<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.299> I'm

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
whatever you're looking at so I'm

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.840 
whatever you're looking at so I'm
looking<00:02:43.660> at<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.410> pig<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.430> if<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.549> hit<00:02:45.640> V

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
looking at that that pig so if I hit V

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
looking at that that pig so if I hit V
it'll<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.360> set<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> huge<00:02:48.450> panel<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.569> fire<00:02:49.840> over

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
it'll just set a huge panel of fire over

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.590 
it'll just set a huge panel of fire over
there<00:02:50.290> pretty<00:02:50.440> much<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.970> pig<00:02:52.239> is<00:02:52.390> now

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
there pretty much and that pig is now

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.259 
there pretty much and that pig is now
done<00:02:53.080> for<00:02:53.410> he<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.799> cooked<00:02:56.940> another<00:02:57.940> thing<00:02:58.150> we

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
done for he is cooked another thing we

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.080 
done for he is cooked another thing we
have<00:02:58.299> is<00:02:58.780> B<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.920> is<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.250> blow<00:03:00.549> things<00:03:00.580> up

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
have is B and that is to blow things up

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.850 
have is B and that is to blow things up
so<00:03:01.720> whatever<00:03:02.019> you're<00:03:02.230> looking<00:03:02.470> at<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.709> will

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
so whatever you're looking at you will

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.559 
so whatever you're looking at you will
blow<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.250> up<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:03.790> let's<00:03:04.000> go<00:03:04.120> ahead<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.330> just

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
blow it up so let's go ahead and just

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.259 
blow it up so let's go ahead and just
destroy<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.260> house<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> bit<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.220> don't<00:03:06.790> need<00:03:07.150> it

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
destroy this house a bit I don't need it

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:07.910 
destroy this house a bit I don't need it
anymore

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
anymore

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.289 
anymore
no<00:03:08.920> I'm<00:03:09.010> just<00:03:09.100> kidding<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.579> do<00:03:09.760> have<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.060> backup

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
no I'm just kidding I do have a backup

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.819 
no I'm just kidding I do have a backup
for<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.690> world<00:03:10.900> now<00:03:11.170> just<00:03:11.470> repair<00:03:11.799> it

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
for this world now just repair it

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.780 
for this world now just repair it
afterwards<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.890> there<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.130> go<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.280> can<00:03:15.579> see

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
afterwards so there you go you can see

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.819 
afterwards so there you go you can see
this<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.090> very<00:03:16.150> effective<00:03:16.840> at<00:03:16.989> long<00:03:17.170> distances

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
this is very effective at long distances

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.930 
this is very effective at long distances
I<00:03:18.870> don't<00:03:19.870> think<00:03:20.079> it's<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.549> no<00:03:21.549> if<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.730> doesn't

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
I don't think it's that no if it doesn't

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.940 
I don't think it's that no if it doesn't
reach<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.090> far<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.750> think<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.530> about<00:03:23.709> the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
reach that far I think this is about the

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.970 
reach that far I think this is about the
limit<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.519> will<00:03:24.609> reach<00:03:25.560> but<00:03:26.560> I'm<00:03:26.769> just

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
limit that it will reach but I'm just

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.890 
limit that it will reach but I'm just
completely<00:03:27.340> demolishing<00:03:28.180> this<00:03:28.359> house<00:03:28.540> as<00:03:28.780> you

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
completely demolishing this house as you

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.410 
completely demolishing this house as you
can<00:03:29.049> see<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:32.739> can<00:03:32.890> see<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.190> does<00:03:33.340> say<00:03:33.519> charging

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.330 

so<00:03:39.380> yeah<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.190> pretty<00:03:40.220> much<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:41.000> for<00:03:41.420> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
so yeah that is pretty much it for the
