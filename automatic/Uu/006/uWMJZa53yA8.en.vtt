00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.370
 But it is certain that Wilders did not participate on Wednesday 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.350
 yes all in all i think that as a team we went for it today 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.979
 we have given away little 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:15.839
 as a team it will be okay that we will go through the fire for each other 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.609
 you didn't buy anything unwell if you were six points behind and now for years 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.879
 probably what sparta nijkerk has to do can wait 

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:24.279
 grontmij best 8 points 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.050
 this is going to be very difficult 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.159
 only I can remember one more time 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.339
 a year earlier that we chow 8 points for some animals that we are champions 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.950
 were 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.060
 we have also given it away 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.240
 just now not in the nick of time just not just in 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.280
 yes that can happen so I will not exclude anything but it will be difficult 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.550
 the struggle and experience was gas transport 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.520
 juhasz and rightly so 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.140
 went to every position for this and fewer practice duels on an injured person 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.580
 today and that kind does offer prospects for the 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.810
 for the last matches 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.060
 the evening was again the difference if you look at Zwartendijk's consequences 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.250
 we have nothing to lose yes I totally agree with you I think we 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.000
 today, however, she asked for that reason 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 how can you find 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.950
 the experiences 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.500
 by years 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.560
 However, today is not a trip today 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.219
 That is a very different game than against Sparta Nijkerk 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.330
 this summer 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.980
 here it is easy 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.290
 yes it could be better but it is a shame it is not my first 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.160
 competition since two months 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.430
 get her music 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 all in all i am i have reasonable contract 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.350
 macerata 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.510
 year up and down to IJsselmeer birds for the last year 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.650
 also photo anp joop daalmeijer 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.570
 you notice that 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.380
 who do not sit in the cold clothes it is one 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.189
 yes it is a huge burden for me to continue in one go after work 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:48.909
 but 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.640
 at football make yes and then you notice that you 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.420
 yes that you can also tap your energy more at a given moment one goes 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.700
 name 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 i like how i dont have to make choices for myself because 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.810
 both football and 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.070
 work under 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.029
 can lead 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.019
 I have been found at Ajax for months now and 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.190
 yes i think we know yes 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.689
 that choices had to be made and 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.700
 yes, even fifteen minutes away, I was ahead of IJsselmeer birds 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.549
 drive me more often an hour and 45 minutes 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.709
 at 8 pm if you are normal 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.099
 can you also afterwards we sport the spartan travel time yes 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.459
 astronomy and she also wants choice considered it will be their first date 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.709
 old acquaintances 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.709
 well i will honestly tell you that he decides 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.729
 but for myself that the Jews had made and that 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.489
 would be nice 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.489
 at chelsea trainer being yes that is something 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.909
 afterwards yes a good example but I have to say that 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.529
 that I come there is well trained 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.849
 next to a playground 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.289
 yes that is with 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.819
 and there is an additional condition for me to go there 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.809
 Finally you play is education 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:04.939
 how experienced are 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.369
 during my say by his actions 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:09.990
 he is an absolute winner 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.990
 I noticed that he thought about everything for a while and 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.619
 for each other 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:20.329
 for every situation it has solutions available 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.520
 and if you look then the 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.830
 today there comes v playing in different ways so we already had 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.719
 different scenarios 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.019
 300,000 in our first day 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.400
 yes I work I love more than 2000 and experience the radio here if we want 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.570
 and we also have an amateur there, so yes I am 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.809
 I'm very satisfied 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:42.749
 it only became after
