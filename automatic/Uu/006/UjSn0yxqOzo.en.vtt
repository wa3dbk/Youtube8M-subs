00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.610
 hello, I'm ana martÃ­nez to train your 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.290
 dotcom dog in this video I'm going to 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.000
 show why your dog does not want 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.460
 eat and the correct treatment that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.929
 you must apply many times we are 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.580
 worried because our dog does not 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.279
 wants to eat and the reasons can be 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.499
 several although dogs seem to lie 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.630
 They get tired of eating the same thing for 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.970
 example the same I think maybe trying 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.009
 with other alternatives, motivate and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.529
 start eating can be a symptom 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.389
 transient and after trying something 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.369
 again eat the feed of 

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:33.780
 always also the disorders 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.149
 emotional can suppress appetite 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.660
 as for example the absence of its owner 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.519
 a move or also with the arrival of 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.719
 a baby to the family the animal can 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.789
 feel displaced in these 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.859
 circumstances all situations 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.870
 they can affect you at lunchtime 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.089
 pet our dog could be 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.550
 trying to draw attention to leave 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.469
 to eat you can try staying at your 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.999
 side while the dog eats since 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.519
 some dogs need to feel 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.620
 accompanied while doing it when 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.690
 I'm eating a little more 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.470
 less time at your side until you 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.300
 I used to eat alone 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.070
 a measure that will further stimulate 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.200
 animal is to keep its place and its 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.259
 impeccable around 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.020
 the lack of appetite is called anorexia and 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.200
 we have three different types the first 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.210
 is the true anorexia that is when 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.979
 the dog does not want to eat or even 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.750
 comes to the plate when we serve it 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.960
 food this is due to diseases 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.630
 infectious or parasitic affecting 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.299
 a digestive tract and the general state 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.090
 of the dog after we have anorexia 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.500
 false that is when the animal goes 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.689
 immediately to the plate when you 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.969
 we present your food but then not 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.640
 you can take it for mouth pains in 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.770
 the teeth the throat manifesting 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.390
 moans when trying to take or swallow the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.700
 food 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.280
 and finally there is anorexia 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.530
 selective that is when the dog comes 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.810
 immediately to your plate of food and 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.810
 it smells the content and it retires without eating 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.360
 head comes back it smells again and it 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.390
 remove or just a few bites and 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.190
 knock down your plate overturning its contents 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.869
 This is the typical situation of the dog 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.540
 who does not like the food that they have 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.239
 served now let's look at the causes of 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.100
 anorexia the mechanical causes would come to 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.959
 be all those problems that have 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.230
 been caused by the management of bodies 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.170
 solid strangers like little balls 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.450
 cords threads et cetera either in the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.620
 inside the oral cavity of the dog or 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 inside your device 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.810
 gastrointestinal then we have the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.420
 inflammatory that are all those 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.370
 allergic diseases or by ingestion 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.000
 of irritants as solvents 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.830
 caustic soda acids and so on that can 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.769
 cause irritation and ulcers in the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.230
 tongue in the mouth in the stomach esophagus 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.560
 and this will also produce the lack of 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.239
 appetite 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.030
 then we have the diseases 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.400
 infectious which are the most delicate of 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.530
 all are those diseases 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.080
 caused by viruses or bacteria that 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.170
 they affect dogs like distemper the 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.819
 parvovirus hepatitis etc. so 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.940
 that is recommended to all dogs 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.870
 say receive the sixfold vaccine and the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.390
 anti-rabies annually that also 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.860
 we have parasitic diseases 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.420
 both the internal parasites and the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.300
 external are capable of causing 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.760
 anorexia to dogs all dogs 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.459
 they must be wormed every three or 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.620
 four months this is important eye 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.140
 tumors are a very important cause 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.370
 also anorexia in dogs still 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.319
 from the beginning tumors can 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.930
 cause anorexia for nano pain in the 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.400
 gastrointestinal tract or depression 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.230
 of the sensorium and depression of the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.720
 gustatory and olfactory sensitivity to 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.310
 cause of the tumor and finally the changes 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.620
 of diet that is very frequent that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.349
 also produce anorexia the dog 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.090
 finally we go to the treatment for 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.370
 treat anorexia you have to treat the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.590
 specific diseases if there were 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.959
 there are situations where the dog presents 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.250
 diseases of different types should be 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.349
 treat the disease first 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.819
 directly because once the 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.040
 anorexia is going to go and the dog is going to 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.230
 recover your appetite another very subject 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.049
 important is to improve the quality and 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.640
 amount of food you have to 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.680
 animal deworming against 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.780
 internal parasites two or three times 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.880
 year more or less and against parasites 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.639
 externally every month this is very 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.979
 important is also important 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.389
 that vaccines are up to date otherwise 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.010
 what can be done in the case of 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.600
 anorexia is giving vitamins and 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.910
 supplements to the dog that many times 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.560
 by stress or mild illness 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.240
 they can be two or three days or so 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.860
 with anorexia but if we give 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.630
 nutritional supplements in many of 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.419
 these cases regain appetite 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.580
 quickly and finally if we had 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.350
 that we were sorry in a case of 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.139
 prolonged anorexia 20 percent 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.680
 more than body weight is recommended 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.690
 hospitalization of the dog 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.970
