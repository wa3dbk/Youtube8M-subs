the media hype out there and they find
out<00:02:21.900> some<00:02:22.079> people<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.620> was<00:02:22.769> very<00:02:22.920> fortunate

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
out some people so I was very fortunate

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.009

hands-on

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.540 
hands-on
I<00:02:27.030> also<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.780> max<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.340> look<00:02:29.460> at

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
I also like the max like if you look at

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.690 
I also like the max like if you look at
this<00:02:29.610> map<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.120> got<00:02:30.270> graffiti<00:02:30.930> which<00:02:31.700> you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
this map it's got graffiti which you

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.510 
this map it's got graffiti which you
know<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.360> right<00:02:33.630> it's<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:33.840> repeating<00:02:34.350> but<00:02:34.770> it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
know it right it's just repeating but it

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.840 
know it right it's just repeating but it
takes<00:02:35.760> away<00:02:36.030> from<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.630> usual<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.410> gray<00:02:37.740> and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
takes away from that usual like gray and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.970 
takes away from that usual like gray and
brown<00:02:38.850> palettes<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.230> game<00:02:40.440> has<00:02:40.710> kind

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
brown palettes that this game has kind

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.980 
brown palettes that this game has kind
of<00:02:41.040> had<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.270> think<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:42.570> great<00:02:42.750> because<00:02:42.840> I

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
of had so I think it's great because I

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.570 
of had so I think it's great because I
think<00:02:43.020> they<00:02:43.410> added<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.830> bunch<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.220> new<00:02:44.280> colors

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
think they added a bunch of new colors

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.810 
think they added a bunch of new colors
and<00:02:45.500> details<00:02:46.500> matter<00:02:46.980> right<00:02:47.490> right<00:02:49.040> yeah<00:02:50.040> also

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
but yeah I really like some ambush I

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.140 
but yeah I really like some ambush I
forget<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.010> some<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.370> names<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.790> them<00:03:17.940> but

yeah they had really good map design and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.910 
yeah they had really good map design and
I<00:03:20.580> felt<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:20.970> they<00:03:21.450> they<00:03:22.170> didn't<00:03:22.470> do<00:03:22.590> too<00:03:22.740> bad

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
I felt like they they didn't do too bad

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.710 
I felt like they they didn't do too bad
on<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.280> one<00:03:23.460> they<00:03:24.000> didn't<00:03:24.270> make<00:03:24.420> them<00:03:24.570> too

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
on this one they didn't make them too

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.390 
on this one they didn't make them too
convoluted<00:03:24.990> like<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.830> newer<00:03:25.980> colleges

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
convoluted like in the newer colleges

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.920 
convoluted like in the newer colleges
where<00:03:26.700> there's<00:03:26.820> like<00:03:26.970> three<00:03:27.240> levels<00:03:27.600> and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
where there's like three levels and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.480 
where there's like three levels and
paper<00:03:28.200> flying<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.010> things<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.310> are<00:03:29.400> very

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
paper flying and things that are very

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.729 
paper flying and things that are very
distracting<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.420> just<00:03:31.110> playing<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.500> very

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
distracting to just playing a very

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.000 
distracting to just playing a very
simple<00:03:32.370> shooter<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:34.380> would<00:03:34.830> personally

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
simple shooter and I would personally

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.190 
simple shooter and I would personally
give<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.430> game<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.270> what<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.720> saying<00:03:36.959> like

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
give this game and what is saying like

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.770 
give this game and what is saying like
cuz<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.650> only<00:03:38.010> got<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.250> limited<00:03:38.610> amount<00:03:39.420> of

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
cuz I only got a limited amount of

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.120 
cuz I only got a limited amount of
gameplay<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.560> course<00:03:40.770> there<00:03:40.920> was<00:03:41.040> no

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
gameplay and of course there was no

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.410 
gameplay and of course there was no
single<00:03:41.340> player<00:03:41.610> or<00:03:41.640> anything<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.330> was

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
single player or anything that it was

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.320 
single player or anything that it was
just<00:03:42.600> specifically<00:03:43.080> for<00:03:43.200> multiplayer<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.330> so

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
just specifically for multiplayer and so

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.310 
just specifically for multiplayer and so
I<00:03:45.360> would<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.290> far<00:03:46.620> give<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.790> 7.5<00:03:48.600> which

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
I would so far give it like a 7.5 which

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.770

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.930 
we have oh and the tsunami of course
that<00:04:09.480> comes<00:04:09.720> with<00:04:09.840> us<00:04:09.959> back

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
that comes with us back

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.840 
that comes with us back
where<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:12.320> horn<00:04:12.860> as<00:04:13.100> you<00:04:13.220> can<00:04:13.370> hear<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.610> little

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
where the horn as you can hear a little

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.730 
where the horn as you can hear a little
while<00:04:14.030> ago<00:04:14.180> they<00:04:14.540> had<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.930> warning<00:04:15.350> sounds

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
while ago they had the warning sounds

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.860 
while ago they had the warning sounds
and<00:04:15.980> then<00:04:16.610> the<00:04:16.700> tsunami<00:04:17.030> comes<00:04:17.269> crashing<00:04:17.690> onto

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
and then the tsunami comes crashing onto

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.990 
and then the tsunami comes crashing onto
land<00:04:18.200> and<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:19.130> think<00:04:19.340> that's<00:04:19.459> really<00:04:19.640> cool<00:04:19.760> I

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
land and I think that's really cool I

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.960 
land and I think that's really cool I
mean<00:04:20.269> we<00:04:20.360> see<00:04:20.510> an<00:04:20.600> interactive<00:04:21.049> maps<00:04:21.290> or<00:04:21.970> not

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
mean we see an interactive maps or not

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.320 
mean we see an interactive maps or not
necessarily<00:04:23.300> interactive<00:04:23.960> but<00:04:24.350> uh<00:04:25.240> what<00:04:26.240> is

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
necessarily interactive but uh what is

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.770
