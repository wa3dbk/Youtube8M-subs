00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
there and that was really bad move for

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.980 
there and that was really bad move for
them<00:03:52.630> if<00:03:53.630> they<00:03:53.870> would<00:03:54.020> all<00:03:54.260> went<00:03:54.530> boom<00:03:54.770> and<00:03:55.990> put

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
them if they would all went boom and put

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.060 
them if they would all went boom and put
some<00:03:57.200> support<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.130> us<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:59.290> Lancer<00:04:00.290> Don<00:04:00.500> us<00:04:00.710> and

some support on us and Lancer Don us and

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.920 
some support on us and Lancer Don us and
they<00:04:01.850> probably<00:04:02.030> would<00:04:02.270> have<00:04:02.360> got<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:02.660> round

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
they probably would have got that round

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.890 
they probably would have got that round
but<00:04:03.400> they<00:04:04.400> were<00:04:04.550> really<00:04:05.150> not<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.510> smartest

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
but they were really not the smartest

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.270 
but they were really not the smartest
guys<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:08.200> this<00:04:09.200> is<00:04:09.380> like<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.590> really<00:04:09.890> quick

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
guys and this is like a really quick

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.470 
guys and this is like a really quick
scrim<00:04:11.350> five<00:04:12.350> minutes<00:04:12.800> and<00:04:13.190> 15<00:04:13.910> seconds<00:04:14.360> I

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
scrim five minutes and 15 seconds I

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.530 
scrim five minutes and 15 seconds I
think<00:04:15.250> but<00:04:16.250> it's<00:04:16.520> one<00:04:16.700> of<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.850> quickest<00:04:17.270> rims

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540
