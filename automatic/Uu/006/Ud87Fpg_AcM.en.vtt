on this one you can actually see if you
look<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> site<00:00:29.070> glass<00:00:29.369> that's<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.939> bit

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
look at as a site glass that's a bit

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.310 
look at as a site glass that's a bit
bright<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> moment<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.289> of

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
bright at the moment but because of

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.110 
bright at the moment but because of
plastic<00:00:31.830> often<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> see<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:32.940> just

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
plastic often you can see so we just

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.160

yeah and know that and the reason you
need<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:24.120> because<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:27.349> outboard<00:02:28.349> engine

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
need that is because a outboard engine

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.410 
need that is because a outboard engine
is<00:02:28.829> running<00:02:29.069> much<00:02:29.459> cooler<00:02:29.939> than<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> motorcycle

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
is running much cooler than a motorcycle

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.420 
is running much cooler than a motorcycle
right<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.680> needs<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.129> be<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> right

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
right that needs to be the right

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.309 
right that needs to be the right
consistence<00:02:33.239> got<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.720> right<00:02:33.870> discuss

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
consistence got to be the right discuss

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.619 
consistence got to be the right discuss
at<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.590> Casa<00:02:34.890> T<00:02:35.159> ok<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.879> that<00:02:36.000> will<00:02:36.090> put<00:02:36.269> a

at this Casa T ok and that will put a

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.390 
at this Casa T ok and that will put a
motorcycle<00:02:37.319> oil<00:02:37.530> will<00:02:37.739> not<00:02:37.920> protect<00:02:38.250> that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
motorcycle oil will not protect that
