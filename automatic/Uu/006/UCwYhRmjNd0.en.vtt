00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.960
 Jonathan the national coach who hurt 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.950
 jovially to you what they went out to 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.170
 version 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.750
 He saw that I must sometimes so he 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.679
 knocked that english book what would that 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.779
 further 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.820
 no nothing further nothing were it goes 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.529
 well with you yes certainly the last 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.109
 couple of weeks 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.460
 made debut with la last month and now 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.380
 in the base against Estonia 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.689
 what you noticed when you got one 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.369
 excellent invasion counter 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.330
 italy that the national coach 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.159
 yes you hold a base in an in 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.129
 assign the qualification duel to 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:41.199
 in the meantime had contact no no no 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.540
 not really 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.250
 of course you want a natural course 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.489
 give him a chance and he did 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.720
 it went nicely from italy and then become 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.299
 rewarded you and 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.519
 and the basics here if you have to 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:58.280
 assess how you went ahead 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.739
 yes it went in honor what would be difficult yes 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.570
 we could build pride and run and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.150
 yes it was very compact in the back 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.850
 so it is such a bitch to be patient 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.740
 and yes in the first or second current 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.300
 we get to the e-mail and get it 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.400
 open a little bit 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.860

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.350

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.240

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.409
 refused if you say it's a man 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.720

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.710
 connection player and you are also a box 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.330

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.090
 expect and always growl best 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.680

 nature in school grip on your chances and 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.890
 green blue worries as I say serve 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.750
 in the player who plays on technique like that 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.470
 can say 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.470
