 Luke 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:15.169
 is a solenoid valve operated by the east efe to modify the pressure of 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.359
 advance piston transfer of injection pump 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.099
 the driving pressure of the advance is regulated by an advance corrector 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.179
 creating a fuel leak controlled by a penis bent in power 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.570

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.150
 pilots the progress corrector based on a programmed cartography whose 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.600
 Main parameters are the engine speed and the accelerator load 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.230
 Progress correction is made based on the temperature signals 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 of water air temperature atmospheric pressure 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.650
 the control and the control of the advance are realized in its tip closed loop 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.080
 the system permanently accompanies the requested advance with the real advance 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 For this, he considers the time that elapses between this moment and the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.740
 p sensor in the cinema 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.490
 Knowing the speed of rotation of the engine deduces the real advance 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.560
 depending on the operating conditions and the cartography if 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.170
 the actual advance value is incorrect l d 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.310
 It corrects it by activating the progress corrector 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.970
 the advance is also a function of the fuel flow 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.150
 when the amount of fuel admitted to the pump element is 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.630
 larger the pistons move apart and the rollers find the ring 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 eccentric before 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.540
 therefore the real advance increases and differs from the set value 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.630
 the progress corrector deactivated by l d 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.130

 the amount of fuel applied to the cylinder 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.019
 the advance device places the start of the moped injection 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.830
 at the optimum time for all operating cases 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.889
 modifying the angular position of the dish or vices 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.029
 it is done by controlling the fuel leak so that the piston of the 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.029
 advance device take a specific position

 If the advance device is not fed the transfer pressure

 that is present in the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.349
 When the solenoid valve is powered, a fuel leak is created by the 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.389
 channel that makes the pressure drop on the piston 1 in this case the advance is 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.019
 minimum 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.109

 the activation of the solenoid valves consists of feeding the empoli naro-1 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.409
 to make way for the fuel through the hole 2 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.860

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:14.409
 When the solenoid valve is activated, the vacuum generated by the pump 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.009
 vacuum reaches the membrane of the valve 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.720
 allowing the passage of burned gases towards the multiple of admission 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:28.369
 the purpose of mixing gas that tied with fresh air in the admission is for 

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:32.169
 reduce the temperature of the combustion chamber and thus reduce the
