so<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.739> know<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.100> terms<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:39.270> sort<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
so you know in terms of just sort of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
so you know in terms of just sort of
sheer<00:00:40.140> number<00:00:40.590> crunching<00:00:40.950> capabilities<00:00:41.489> it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
sheer number crunching capabilities it

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.920 
sheer number crunching capabilities it
does<00:00:41.730> pretty<00:00:41.910> well<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.629> there<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.840> some

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
does pretty well but there are some

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.360 
does pretty well but there are some
things<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.469> doesn't<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.770> necessarily

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
things that it doesn't do necessarily

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.930 
things that it doesn't do necessarily
quite<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.850> well<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.079> instance<00:00:46.940> I've

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
quite as well so for instance I've

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.580 
quite as well so for instance I've
noticed<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.329> when<00:00:48.480> you're<00:00:48.629> surfing<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> web

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
noticed that when you're surfing the web

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
noticed that when you're surfing the web
you<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.190> scrolling<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.640> reasonably<00:00:51.180> smooth

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you know scrolling is reasonably smooth

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.389 
you know scrolling is reasonably smooth
pinch-to-zoom<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:52.920> bit<00:00:53.129> jagged

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
pinch-to-zoom can be a little bit jagged

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.979 
pinch-to-zoom can be a little bit jagged
at<00:00:53.699> times<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.329> actually<00:00:54.390> doing<00:00:54.719> pretty<00:00:54.899> well

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
at times it's actually doing pretty well

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.299 
at times it's actually doing pretty well
right<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.320> load<00:00:58.590> full

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
right now but it's going to load full

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.290 
right now but it's going to load full
website<00:00:59.579> here<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.000> does<00:01:03.120> load

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
website here you can see it does load

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.580 
website here you can see it does load
pages<00:01:03.510> pretty<00:01:04.019> quickly<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.689> when<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> page

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
pages pretty quickly and when the page

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.700 
pages pretty quickly and when the page
isn't<00:01:07.770> completely<00:01:08.280> loaded<00:01:09.260> it's<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.380> little

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
isn't completely loaded it's a little

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.630 
isn't completely loaded it's a little
bit<00:01:10.830> more<00:01:10.950> jagged<00:01:11.220> here

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.530 

biggest<00:01:21.640> problem<00:01:21.909> I<00:01:21.970> really<00:01:22.180> have<00:01:22.299> with<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
biggest problem I really have with the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.560 
biggest problem I really have with the
tablet<00:01:22.840> though<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.259> battery<00:01:23.590> life<00:01:23.799> and<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
tablet though is the battery life and I

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.240 
tablet though is the battery life and I
think<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.259> really<00:01:26.409> has<00:01:26.650> more<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.040> do<00:01:27.220> with

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
think that really has more to do with

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.969 
think that really has more to do with
the<00:01:28.049> manufacturing<00:01:29.049> than<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.380> processor<00:01:29.799> per

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
the manufacturing than the processor per

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.980 
the manufacturing than the processor per
se<00:01:30.189> but<00:01:30.850> theoretically<00:01:31.570> you<00:01:31.689> should<00:01:31.720> be<00:01:31.840> able

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
se but theoretically you should be able

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.090 
se but theoretically you should be able
to<00:01:32.080> get<00:01:32.170> around<00:01:32.229> eight<00:01:32.619> hours<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:32.979> battery

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
to get around eight hours of battery

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.410 
to get around eight hours of battery
life<00:01:33.369> according<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.939> manufacturer

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
life according to the manufacturer

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.600 
life according to the manufacturer
estimates<00:01:34.840> in<00:01:35.110> actual<00:01:35.950> performance<00:01:36.399> I<00:01:36.460> found

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
estimates in actual performance I found

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
estimates in actual performance I found
that<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.759> get<00:01:36.880> about<00:01:36.940> four<00:01:37.299> hours<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.539> battery

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
that I get about four hours of battery

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.870 
that I get about four hours of battery
life<00:01:37.990> but<00:01:38.200> more<00:01:38.409> importantly<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.580> battery

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
life but more importantly the battery

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.060 
life but more importantly the battery
meter<00:01:40.090> is<00:01:40.270> completely<00:01:40.990> messed<00:01:41.289> up<00:01:41.470> right<00:01:41.950> now

it move or go away when the device is on
I<00:02:58.209> notice<00:02:58.780> there's<00:02:58.930> also<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.140> little<00:02:59.440> blue<00:02:59.769> dot

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
I notice there's also a little blue dot

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
or the top of the screen I suppose

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.259 
or the top of the screen I suppose
depending<00:03:05.140> on<00:03:05.410> how<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.560> want<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.769> look<00:03:05.859> at<00:03:06.040> it

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
depending on how you want to look at it

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.610 
depending on how you want to look at it
but<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.510> shows<00:03:07.870> up<00:03:08.019> in<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.140> most<00:03:08.290> when<00:03:08.530> you're

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
but it shows up in the most when you're

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.770 
but it shows up in the most when you're
on<00:03:08.829> a<00:03:08.859> white<00:03:09.100> background<00:03:09.280> or<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.760> blue<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:10.150> black

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
on a white background or a blue a black

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.809 
on a white background or a blue a black
background<00:03:11.049> so<00:03:11.920> there's<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.160> little<00:03:12.400> blue<00:03:12.609> dot

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
background so there's a little blue dot

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.340 
background so there's a little blue dot
that<00:03:12.850> doesn't<00:03:13.569> go<00:03:13.660> away<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.200> little

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
that doesn't go away so it's a little

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.670 
that doesn't go away so it's a little
bit<00:03:14.590> pixel<00:03:15.900> there's<00:03:16.900> an<00:03:17.109> ambient<00:03:17.650> light

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
sensor built-in right up here as far as

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.690 
sensor built-in right up here as far as
I<00:03:20.440> can<00:03:20.500> tell<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.739> doesn't<00:03:20.920> really<00:03:21.010> work

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
I can tell it doesn't really work

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.819 
I can tell it doesn't really work
because<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.389> stick<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:22.989> auto<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.560> nothing

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
because I stick this on auto and nothing

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:31.540 
because I stick this on auto and nothing
really<00:03:23.920> happens

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.180 

but<00:03:32.390> overall<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:33.050> mean<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.290> feels<00:03:33.620> pretty<00:03:33.950> good

stereo speakers first of all I always
kind<00:04:02.870> of<00:04:02.930> wonder<00:04:03.170> why<00:04:03.290> somebody<00:04:03.530> would<00:04:03.620> put

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
kind of wonder why somebody would put

stereo speakers so close to each other
you<00:04:06.050> can't<00:04:06.200> really<00:04:06.320> get<00:04:06.470> much<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.710> stereo

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
you can't really get much of a stereo

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.380 
you can't really get much of a stereo
effect<00:04:07.280> but<00:04:07.460> in<00:04:07.550> this<00:04:07.610> case<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.090> barely

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
effect but in this case you barely

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.670 
effect but in this case you barely
notice<00:04:08.690> anyway<00:04:09.050> because<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.290> speakers<00:04:09.560> are

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
notice anyway because the speakers are

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.010 
notice anyway because the speakers are
really<00:04:09.710> really<00:04:10.400> quiet<00:04:10.660> things<00:04:11.660> sound<00:04:11.840> pretty

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
really really quiet things sound pretty

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.560 
really really quiet things sound pretty
good<00:04:12.110> if<00:04:12.320> you<00:04:12.350> plug<00:04:12.590> in<00:04:12.830> a<00:04:13.190> headphone<00:04:13.910> jack<00:04:13.970> or

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
good if you plug in a headphone jack or

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.750 
good if you plug in a headphone jack or
a<00:04:14.900> headphone<00:04:15.350> or<00:04:15.530> external<00:04:15.920> speakers<00:04:16.220> but

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
a headphone or external speakers but

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.099 
a headphone or external speakers but
using<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.090> internal<00:04:17.390> speakers<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.900> wouldn't

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
using the internal speakers I wouldn't

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.509 
using the internal speakers I wouldn't
really<00:04:18.230> want<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.500> listen<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.859> music<00:04:18.950> or<00:04:19.370> watch

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
really want to listen to music or watch

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.610 
really want to listen to music or watch
movies<00:04:19.700> or<00:04:20.420> even<00:04:20.570> make<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.720> Skype<00:04:20.989> call<00:04:21.230> on<00:04:21.440> this

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
movies or even make a Skype call on this

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.290 
movies or even make a Skype call on this
I<00:04:21.769> think<00:04:21.950> I'd<00:04:22.040> want<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.220> plug<00:04:22.430> in<00:04:22.460> something<00:04:23.180> so

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
I think I'd want to plug in something so

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.690 
I think I'd want to plug in something so
I<00:04:23.330> could<00:04:23.480> hear<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.660> little<00:04:23.810> bit<00:04:23.960> better<00:04:24.700> so

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
I could hear a little bit better so

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.750 
I could hear a little bit better so
anyways<00:04:26.330> for<00:04:26.780> $220<00:04:27.620> it's<00:04:28.010> it's<00:04:28.670> an

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
anyways for $220 it's it's an

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.370 
anyways for $220 it's it's an
interesting<00:04:28.910> device<00:04:29.390> I<00:04:29.630> wanted<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.050> test<00:04:30.260> it

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
interesting device I wanted to test it

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.540 
interesting device I wanted to test it
because<00:04:30.500> it's<00:04:30.740> one<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:30.980> first<00:04:31.070> devices

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
because it's one of the first devices

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.760 
because it's one of the first devices
with<00:04:31.730> a<00:04:31.760> free<00:04:32.030> scale<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.750> quad-core<00:04:33.500> processor

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
with a free scale a quad-core processor

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.100 
with a free scale a quad-core processor
I'm<00:04:34.610> not<00:04:34.880> sure<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.030> would<00:04:35.150> recommend<00:04:35.570> buying<00:04:35.840> it

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
I'm not sure I would recommend buying it

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.159 
I'm not sure I would recommend buying it
even<00:04:36.410> at<00:04:36.500> 220<00:04:37.040> but<00:04:37.790> it<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.510> does<00:04:38.690> sort<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:38.960> show

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
even at 220 but it it does sort of show

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.530 
even at 220 but it it does sort of show
in<00:04:39.500> terms<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:39.950> performance<00:04:40.760> what<00:04:41.210> we<00:04:41.330> might<00:04:41.450> be

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
in terms of performance what we might be

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.060 
in terms of performance what we might be
able<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.720> expect<00:04:41.960> from<00:04:42.080> future<00:04:42.530> devices<00:04:42.710> with
