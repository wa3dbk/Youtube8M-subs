00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.980
 [Music] 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.040
 Hello dear beautiful that her past 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.560
 looks I show you today is different 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.150
 alternative to the biscuit floor those 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.070
 I usually particularly spending 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.779
 he distinguishes himself 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.990
 The keyboard is a bit too 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.939
 I did not want to change you 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.099
 Withheld we catch directly 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.810
 you need separate eggs for this 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.090
 they have to be properly clean 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.340
 be it is important an egg in your 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.840
 protein bowl the bowl should be on 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.090
 definitely were also impeccably clean 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.600
 no fats no mirrors or 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.829
 water rights just nice and clean 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.930
 then you can start the whole thing up 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.920
 to be beaten 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.449
 after a short moment you can open 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.489
 in any case a little bit faster 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.679
 salt added to the salt promotes the 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.839
 Volume education is very important 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.210
 then you can also after a short 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.589
 later, that's the sugar for it 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.670
 I still have a little vanilla left 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.260
 Sugar done 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.460
 but you can take over 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.829
 leave out every case that is not a 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.950
 problem 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.020
 then you'll leave relatively quickly though 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.060
 a trickle but you just leave 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.190
 about three quarters euros sugar star 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.720
 the other quarter we need 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.470
 after that for the yolks that is all 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.000
 important and then if you 're a stalker there 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.940
 have it in then just leave it that way 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.950
 Beat yourself that nice stiff 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.650
 has tips and then we do too 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.960
 while the whole thing is going on 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.300
 you have to beat your oven already 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.480
 Preheat and your form you can 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.280
 even with paper interpret that whole 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.990
 exact recipe so the quantities 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.820
 as well as the baking temperature and the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.720
 baking I will write you completely 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.150
 on my blog 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.670
 if anyone is interested in it 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.110
 should then I link you to the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.030
 every case down in the infobox 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.530
 there you can look and you 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.790
 Write out the recipe in any case and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.180
 Try it if you would like that 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.890
 I usually use my whole one 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.460
 normal discrete recipe and I'm fine 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.540
 just some cocoa powder but I do 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.360
 I also wanted another one 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.230
 alternative to the usual practice 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.780
 manufacture my goodness 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.569
 generally show and yes 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.319
 ok after the egg white stiff 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.060
 The exchange is easy 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.610
 the bowls and then you catch new 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.140
 egg yolk open and give after one 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.450
 short moment also the remaining sugar 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.240
 even more that a quarter then what 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.260
 is left over and then let go 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.489
 you also strong again 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.650
 open until the volume 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.000
 roughly doubled to a gap in 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.489
 It was a bit tricky to me because 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.440
 my whisk tower from mine 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.120
 unfortunately not until after 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.230
 at the very bottom of the bowl that comes 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.830
 means with me it has a bit longer 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.100
 but of course it took a while, of course 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.690
 works ok then we come to 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.890
 the dry ingredients the everyone up 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.680
 you can see and you need it 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.640
 normal flour baking powder 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.950
 cornflour and back cacau and the bug 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.370
 very important that you are right 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.630
 back so use jaba cacau instead 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.310
 Drink cacau, so to speak, the drinker 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.900
 chaos unfortunately god and with it we can 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.569
 in the end did not do anything with the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 is definitely the bug on the 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.870
 food starch you can also normal 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.010
 use potato starch or cornstarch 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.420
 I have to think about the baking powder 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.780
 say nothing and also I believe 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.670
 Not 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.410
 and what you have to do after that 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.940
 we have the coarsely performed once 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.769
 is that you in any case right 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.470
 thoroughly sifted that's quite whole 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.970
 important because once we tell there 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.100
 could this huge sale 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.680
 because we have to eliminate the lumps 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.760
 do not want to be in our mass 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.060
 and because we definitely with it 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.290
 minister we needed 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.130
 namely not in our mass the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.690
 are apartment door and ok that is if 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.760
 once thoroughly sown through 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.590
 then your mass should be like that too 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.190
 be far as it is with me now 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.620
 It opened nicely and what you then 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.590
 power is that you have to somehow kÃ¼chen 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.109
 put it aside okay then you catch it 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.959
 you a little bit of protein to your egg yolk 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.070
 to give it and in the beginning it is 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.720
 really just a little bit now 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.220
 see simply could you just about the mass 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.680
 to lighten up the whole thing a bit more 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.250
 to align and there you have to stop like 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.930
 said not very much love or 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.630
 pay attention just just 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.070
 fold in and then you can in 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.639
 one or two portions still that 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.909
 Add the remaining protein and should be there 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.979
 in any case with love and caution 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:30.110
 Take it and then really gently 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.930
 to settle because we are at this time 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.490
 Now we do not want that anymore 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.279
 the mass collapses and how that the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.259
 Whole air beat out that is 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:41.300
 now simply with much patience 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.639
 and with love the whole conceal and 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.770
 then you can see how beautiful the mass 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.430
 actually it would be pretty brave 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.810
 very fine-pored and then you can 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.300
 also add the flour after 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.620
 we see it reasonably underlined 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.620
 I'll just do it again by simply 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.729
 to loosen it up again and the media 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.729
 is to make provision then 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.469
 I also have a special or me 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.449
 I wrote a blogpost about it 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:07.520
 when to go through flour in any case 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.840
 should and when not because I link 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.210
 you too down in the infobox you 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:16.129
 believe that is relatively helpful for some 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.240
 of you to follow the case with chocolate 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.039
 you have to do a bit more 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.740
 patience have to lift the whole under 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.870
 because if I'm not mistaken that was 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.330
 simply because in cocoa powder, of course 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.969
 also bold the cover is of course too 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.250
 finished and this fat connects 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.589
 unfortunately not so fast with the 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.699
 remaining mass that means there you have to 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.189
 have a bit more patience with 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.479
 fold 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.830
 but after a time like mine 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.710
 Of course, this works 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.659
 even then that goes in yours from yours 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.139
 ready in the ring passes the 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.889
 once gross does not have to be special 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.960
 be even , so to speak 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.490
 and then it pushes me in any case 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.529
 immediately in the oven 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.149
 that is very important that may now 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.349
 not five minutes ten minutes 

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:59.449
 long standing on the counter that should 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:02.810
 best immediately in the oven comes with it 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:05.240
 us the crowd I fall together then 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.740
 is the whole baked shut 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.149
 certain time this has to bake and 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.830
 This usually breaks up after baking 

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:12.319
 head and let it cool then 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.750
 and so was my completed 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:17.449
 Result afterwards from relatively fine-pored 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:21.409
 except for some larger bubbles at the party 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:23.060
 of course, does nothing ok then I 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.740
 Show you that too I hope you have 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.469
 the video fell and was possibly 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.300
 even water could be helpful 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:31.039
 want to know or want to get rid of 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.839
 write me the below in the comments 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.060
 who wants to see more of me 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.639
 write that clicks on the right or 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.919
 left 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.180
 who has not subscribed to me yet 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.340
 It's best to pick it up very quickly 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.900
 after all the important information I write 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.490
 again below in the infobox and 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.599
 then I hope that in the next 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.599
 see video again
