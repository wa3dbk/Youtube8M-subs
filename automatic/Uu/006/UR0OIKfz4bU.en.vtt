00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.759
 distant action somehow me very 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.690
 struck here these balls I saw them in 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.019
 house of pioneers 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.190
 they were half a meter in diameter from bright 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:46.079
 bright such juicy colored threads are made 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.210
 they hung on our ceiling and me they 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.219
 something like the depths of the soul surprised 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.469
 naturally in childhood do not understand how 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.260
 way did such beauty 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.469
 well then I learned of course how it is 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.519
 done and today's lesson will be 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.220
 dedicated just such a product well, not 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.619
 be sure to make balls on the Christmas tree 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.619
 You can also make a ball and more for 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.720
 interior decoration 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.550
 if you make a ball and even more you can 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.920
 days of them make lamps either 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:24.090
 chandelier on the ceiling if you have a ball 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.750
 decent diameter that we need 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.890
 but naturally pva glue can 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.880
 take another glued clap it he after 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.069
 drying becomes transparent what is not 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.890
 affects the color of the thread stays 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:47.759
 such as that you chose also glue 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.729
 pva he is very strong if you buy glue 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.450
 pva in such a flat package then you 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.380
 will be comfortable on the day of the enemies in thick 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.830
 tick 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.849
 for example, I chose threads 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:08.640
 floss to create white balls on the new 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:12.569
 year on the tree and you thread the needle and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.150
 poke through and out 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.610
 thread already smeared with glue if you 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.560
 buy some other glue not in 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.760
 such convenient packaging can be simply 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.430
 use the saucer pour in 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.370
 glue saucer and of course you smell 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.379
 katie a little bit their hands because you 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.560
 will unwind the thread here and so it 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.500
 dunk and extra glue you have to 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.150
 a little squeeze but it's nothing 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.269
 scary i will enjoy today 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.569
 technique 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.079
 with a needle on the saucer so I do not for 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:54.090
 numbers do not need and of course 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:57.879
 the ball the ball can take any diameter 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.769
 In principle, preferably of course round 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.079
 shape or less round 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.989
 Well, the eggs are unusual such 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.209
 oval balls but that's okay from 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:12.299
 any oval ball can in principle 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:15.459
 if you want to make a circle, that is a ball and 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:20.919
 can be used in every way here 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:23.519
 here 's the nail polish also for 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:31.560
 scenery can use rhinestones beads 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:34.560
 In general, any of your fantasy buttons and 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 other 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.670
 to 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.840
 but 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.190
 he 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.540
