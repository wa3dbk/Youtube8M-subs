00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
for keeping the rain out so I keep that

on<00:00:27.359> whenever<00:00:27.599> we're<00:00:27.869> not<00:00:28.019> using<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.680> I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
on whenever we're not using it and I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.380 
on whenever we're not using it and I
pull<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> off<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.699> use<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:31.189> secondly<00:00:32.189> I

my<00:01:55.259> friend<00:01:55.500> Phil<00:01:55.740> came<00:01:56.040> up<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> idea<00:01:56.820> of

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
my friend Phil came up with the idea of

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.149 
my friend Phil came up with the idea of
using<00:01:57.719> kids<00:01:58.560> sized<00:01:59.689> bean<00:02:00.689> bags<00:02:01.049> they<00:02:01.979> work

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
using kids sized bean bags they work

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.389 
using kids sized bean bags they work
really<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:02.790> especially<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.979> we<00:02:04.979> fill<00:02:05.250> um

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.419 
really well especially if you we fill um
only<00:02:05.899> three-quarters<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.110> way<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:08.280> your

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
only three-quarters of the way so your

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.010 
only three-quarters of the way so your
butts<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.060> close<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> ground<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:09.929> it

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
butts really close to the ground but it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.660 
butts really close to the ground but it
gives<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.410> back<00:02:10.619> support<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.129> need

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
but here's that gives deny resistance if

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.860 
but here's that gives deny resistance if
I<00:02:18.260> said<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.650> right

carbon monoxide and I do know this

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.270 
carbon monoxide and I do know this
because<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:50.060> had<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.810> carbon<00:02:51.260> monoxide<00:02:51.739> detector

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
because I had a carbon monoxide detector

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.890 
because I had a carbon monoxide detector
in<00:02:52.580> here<00:02:53.330> one<00:02:53.540> night<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.319> positioned<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.100> in

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
in here one night and I positioned it in

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:04.530 
in here one night and I positioned it in
several<00:02:56.900> places<00:02:59.440> all<00:03:00.440> over<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:01.330> inside<00:03:03.400> floor

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
several places all over the inside floor

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.940 
several places all over the inside floor
head<00:03:05.540> height<00:03:06.910> standing<00:03:07.910> height<00:03:08.150> for<00:03:09.019> a<00:03:09.590> while

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
head height standing height for a while

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.300 
head height standing height for a while
in<00:03:10.310> each<00:03:10.519> position<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.390> didn't<00:03:11.750> even<00:03:12.310> have

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
in each position and it didn't even have

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.090 
in each position and it didn't even have
a<00:03:13.340> reading<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.970> was<00:03:14.090> zero<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.720> whole<00:03:14.750> time<00:03:15.140> so

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
a reading it was zero the whole time so

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.580 
a reading it was zero the whole time so
uh<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:17.350> tank<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.470> propane<00:03:18.560> lasts<00:03:19.280> about<00:03:20.590> 15

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
uh a tank of propane lasts about 15

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.910 
uh a tank of propane lasts about 15
hours<00:03:21.829> worth<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.940> burn<00:03:23.120> time<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:24.590> figured

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
hours worth the burn time so you figured

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.340 
hours worth the burn time so you figured
$20<00:03:25.519> worth<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.760> propane<00:03:25.940> gets<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.570> lot<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.959> a

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
$20 worth of propane gets you a lot of a

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.170 
$20 worth of propane gets you a lot of a
lot<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.799> fire<00:03:27.950> nights<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.900> that's<00:03:29.900> about<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:30.200> uh

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
lot of fire nights so that's about it uh

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.520 
lot of fire nights so that's about it uh
let's<00:03:32.180> go<00:03:32.329> to<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.510> night<00:03:32.720> shot<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.859> right<00:03:34.100> so
