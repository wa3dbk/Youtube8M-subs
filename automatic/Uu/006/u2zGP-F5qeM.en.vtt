we<00:00:21.070> are<00:00:21.100> going<00:00:21.279> to<00:00:21.369> do<00:00:21.520> a<00:00:21.550> rundown<00:00:22.000> of<00:00:22.420> these

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
we are going to do a rundown of these

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.929 
we are going to do a rundown of these
Shaka<00:00:23.170> boards<00:00:23.680> sorts<00:00:24.490> of<00:00:24.520> all<00:00:24.640> the<00:00:24.760> same

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
Shaka boards sorts of all the same

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.550 
Shaka boards sorts of all the same
features<00:00:25.360> but<00:00:25.390> this<00:00:25.810> is<00:00:25.930> just<00:00:25.960> a<00:00:26.290> little

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
features but this is just a little

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.030 
features but this is just a little
smaller<00:00:27.009> a<00:00:27.910> little<00:00:28.720> tighter<00:00:28.930> package<00:00:29.500> so<00:00:29.980> if

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
smaller a little tighter package so if

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.400 
smaller a little tighter package so if
you<00:00:30.130> got<00:00:30.310> a<00:00:30.340> little<00:00:30.730> little<00:00:31.689> narrower<00:00:32.020> stance

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
you got a little little narrower stance

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.500 
you got a little little narrower stance
this<00:00:32.890> is<00:00:33.040> great<00:00:33.220> I<00:00:33.550> were<00:00:33.790> like<00:00:33.910> really<00:00:34.060> like<00:00:34.480> a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
this is great I were like really like a

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.940 
this is great I were like really like a
smaller<00:00:34.810> wheel<00:00:35.020> base<00:00:35.260> but<00:00:35.680> if<00:00:35.739> you<00:00:35.800> got<00:00:35.920> a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
smaller wheel base but if you got a

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.680 
smaller wheel base but if you got a
wider<00:00:36.160> stance<00:00:36.460> this<00:00:36.880> is<00:00:37.030> great<00:00:37.180> it<00:00:37.480> can<00:00:37.630> be

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
wider stance this is great it can be

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.180 
wider stance this is great it can be
slightly<00:00:37.960> more<00:00:38.200> flexi<00:00:38.620> because<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:38.980> longer

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
slightly more flexi because the longer

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.450 
slightly more flexi because the longer
wheelbase<00:00:39.430> same<00:00:40.420> 8<00:00:40.660> ply<00:00:40.930> construction<00:00:41.890> much

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
wheelbase same 8 ply construction much

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.069 
wheelbase same 8 ply construction much
more<00:00:42.670> subtle<00:00:42.940> than<00:00:43.090> most<00:00:43.420> drop<00:00:43.660> decks<00:00:43.930> you'll

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
more subtle than most drop decks you'll

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.959 
more subtle than most drop decks you'll
find<00:00:44.350> so<00:00:44.920> you<00:00:44.980> get<00:00:45.130> a<00:00:45.190> nice<00:00:45.370> little<00:00:45.670> pocket

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
find so you get a nice little pocket

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.850 
find so you get a nice little pocket
there<00:00:46.390> without<00:00:46.899> lowering<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.500> board<00:00:47.680> too

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
there without lowering the board too

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.560 
there without lowering the board too
much<00:00:48.070> one<00:00:48.550> of<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.700> biggest<00:00:48.850> differences<00:00:49.390> in

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
much one of the biggest differences in

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.080 
much one of the biggest differences in
this<00:00:49.720> is<00:00:49.990> that<00:00:50.320> these<00:00:51.010> pockets<00:00:51.520> are<00:00:51.670> slightly

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
this is that these pockets are slightly

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.060 
this is that these pockets are slightly
more<00:00:52.390> aggressive<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.470> you're<00:00:53.620> going<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.770> get

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
more aggressive so you're going to get

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.700 
more aggressive so you're going to get
more<00:00:54.700> of<00:00:54.850> that<00:00:54.880> cupped<00:00:55.300> feeling<00:00:55.810> and<00:00:56.080> what's

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
more of that cupped feeling and what's

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.350 
more of that cupped feeling and what's
great<00:00:56.830> about<00:00:56.950> this<00:00:57.280> too<00:00:57.580> is<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:57.910> if<00:00:58.030> you<00:00:58.150> look

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
great about this too is that if you look

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.600 
great about this too is that if you look
in<00:00:58.510> these<00:00:58.630> corners<00:00:59.140> here<00:00:59.470> you<00:01:00.040> don't<00:01:00.250> really

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
in these corners here you don't really

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.850 
in these corners here you don't really
get<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:00.970> drop<00:01:01.329> down<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.660> lot<00:01:02.050> of<00:01:02.200> a<00:01:02.350> lot<00:01:02.740> of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
get a drop down a lot of a lot of

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.069 
get a drop down a lot of a lot of
dropped<00:01:03.100> X<00:01:03.400> will<00:01:04.059> have<00:01:04.239> kind<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.689> a<00:01:04.780> gap<00:01:05.049> here

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
dropped X will have kind of a gap here

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.460 
dropped X will have kind of a gap here
where<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.310> concave<00:01:06.790> this<00:01:07.299> way<00:01:07.509> meets<00:01:07.900> the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
where the concave this way meets the

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.380 
where the concave this way meets the
drop<00:01:08.770> in<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.040> deck<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.579> that'll<00:01:10.240> loosen

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
drop in the deck and that'll loosen

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.149 
drop in the deck and that'll loosen
concave<00:01:11.079> right<00:01:11.350> where<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.590> have<00:01:11.740> your<00:01:11.770> feet

concave right where you have your feet
it's<00:01:12.670> not<00:01:12.820> it's<00:01:12.880> about<00:01:13.090> this<00:01:13.479> is<00:01:13.750> a<00:01:14.350> nice<00:01:14.860> cup

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
it's not it's about this is a nice cup

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's not it's about this is a nice cup
all<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.759> way<00:01:15.880> around<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:17.049> foot<00:01:17.229> will<00:01:17.380> stay

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
all the way around your foot will stay

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.230 
all the way around your foot will stay
right<00:01:17.799> in<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:17.979> pocket<00:01:18.189> where<00:01:18.759> you<00:01:18.880> want<00:01:19.119> it
