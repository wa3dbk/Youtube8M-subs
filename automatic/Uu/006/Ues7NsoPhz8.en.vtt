the<00:02:42.480> police<00:02:42.840> we<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:43.680> slowly<00:02:44.100> turn<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.850> guess

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.440 

where's<00:02:48.810> he<00:02:48.900> gone<00:02:49.050> oh<00:02:49.350> there<00:02:49.560> he<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:53.450> he's

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
where's he gone oh there he is he's

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.910 
where's he gone oh there he is he's
nicking<00:02:54.900> off<00:02:57.020> all<00:02:58.020> right<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.470> put<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.739> in<00:02:58.800> that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
nicking off all right we put it in that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.460 
nicking off all right we put it in that
garage<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.489> guess<00:02:59.730> in<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.510> garage<00:03:03.020> is<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.230> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
garage I guess in the garage is that the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.330 
garage I guess in the garage is that the
whole<00:03:04.650> mission<00:03:09.290> why<00:03:10.290> does<00:03:10.620> he<00:03:10.770> want<00:03:10.980> three

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
whole mission why does he want three

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.520 
whole mission why does he want three
bikes<00:03:11.700> unless<00:03:12.600> he<00:03:12.720> wants<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.989> sell<00:03:13.320> them<00:03:13.440> I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
bikes unless he wants to sell them I

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.729 
bikes unless he wants to sell them I
guess<00:03:13.739> right<00:03:14.489> where<00:03:14.700> are<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.910> closest<00:03:15.330> ones

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
guess right where are the closest ones

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.949 
guess right where are the closest ones
right<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.860> ones<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.310> our<00:03:17.430> right<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.810> only

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
right the ones to our right the only

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.270 
right the ones to our right the only
problem<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.470> some<00:03:22.620> reason<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.040> roads
