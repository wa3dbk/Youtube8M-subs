00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.069
 Good day to all and so on 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.890
 shank extension 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.599
 I will increase the hosts under the screed furniture 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.759
 on here as you can see I just lick 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:18.960
 bolt and accordingly this one 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.140
 tyazhechko and of course himself in klinochek 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.279
 the result will be quite reliable 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.890
 the connection here is the handle was like 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.059
 this is the only way stretched 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:37.440
 that there was no furniture loop 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.360
 bronze nut as you see the knife here 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.020
 no longer exhibited 1 hand weaving 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.620
 specifically broke tested for strength 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:53.149
 would be a tray of legs and z10 once upon a time 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:56.850
 such a training handle turned out 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.030
 but as you can see the strength of the handle was enough 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.370
 in order to break the wedge 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.580
 nobody walks anywhere ie break 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.630
 and it will be quite problematic 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:13.890
 therefore the reliability of the connection hall is not 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.780
 raises some censure for 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:26.479
 this will need to do we have here 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:30.509
 hat bolt he has such a hat 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.070
 cone now this bolt with two 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.689
 I cut the sides flat 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.689
 that is, up to the thickness itself 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:52.640
 thread itself further with the help of dremel 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:56.900
 here here bones will be done here 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:04.190
 such a swallow keyway tail 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:05.030
 where is our Gadget and a little bit 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.119
 responds 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:15.580
 further it will be all with the help of a scraper 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:20.750
 to be pinched with 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:25.610
 it will not work 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:29.320
 what let's get started we start with 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:34.390
 cutting this of ours 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.390
 bolt now I will move to 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.049
 here is our result 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.010
 It turned out such a billet with 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.500
 cone cap now 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.510
 we describe this hat for a night and in 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.510
 we cut class to the wedge 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.070
 in the end we get two like that 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.070
 parts 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.900
 which it remains only to connect 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.050
 Circuits fit 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.820
 not exactly so with the help of few 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.270
 now 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.020
 pounding our stud 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.020
 inside our groove 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.270
 so here it will look 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.330
 assembled 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.870
 the only thing that I knowingly put on here 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.420
 more 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.320
 if you decide to solder this 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.830
 tail vitek 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.170
 do not forget to look at the thickness of the stripes 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.050
 Linochka what my case thickness 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.960
 blade three and a half millimeters 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.090
 Respectively more fit under this 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.050
 thickness 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.960
 thread on our cogs n4 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:33.290
 Respectively spendik in our holes 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.770
 will not crawl through any way be big 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:40.120
 the gap is near the blade and it is very 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.730
 ugly so before soldering 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.960
 put on a bolster and only then 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:51.970
 propaivaem our tail on it all night 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.970
 Thank you all for your attention.
