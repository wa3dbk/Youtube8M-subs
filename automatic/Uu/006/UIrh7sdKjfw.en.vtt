00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
thing to keep in mind when using the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.719 
thing to keep in mind when using the
stakeout<00:01:06.180> o<00:01:06.439> is<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.770> aim<00:01:08.070> down<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.369> site<00:01:08.580> as

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
stakeout o is to aim down the site as

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.000 
stakeout o is to aim down the site as
much<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.030> possible<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.110> drastically

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
much as possible because it drastically

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
much as possible because it drastically
is<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.430> increase<00:01:11.640> your<00:01:11.729> chances<00:01:11.880> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
is going to increase your chances of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.030 
is going to increase your chances of
killing<00:01:12.479> people<00:01:12.659> especially<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.740> like

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
killing people especially because like

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.399 
killing people especially because like
unlike<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.640> fast<00:01:14.880> 12<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.049> eight

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
unlike this fast 12 you don't have eight

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
unlike this fast 12 you don't have eight
shells<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.100> shoot<00:01:17.280> people<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.909> can't

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
shells to shoot people and you can't

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
shells to shoot people and you can't
shoot<00:01:18.390> them<00:01:18.600> nearly<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.290> fast<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
shoot them nearly as fast with with the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.880 
shoot them nearly as fast with with the
stakeout<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.750> much<00:01:22.110> better<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
stakeout so it's much better for you to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.120 
stakeout so it's much better for you to
go<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.020> aim<00:01:25.020> down<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> site<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.770> much<00:01:25.950> as

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
go and aim down the site as much as

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.980 
go and aim down the site as much as
possible<00:01:27.110> there<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.229> go

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
possible there we go

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.270 
right there that was a big mistake on my
part<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.229> knew<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.409> guy<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
part because I knew that guy at a a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
part because I knew that guy at a a
close<00:01:45.000> range<00:01:45.329> weapon<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.990> shotgun<00:01:46.560> or

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
close range weapon a shotgun or

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.429 
close range weapon a shotgun or
submachine<00:01:47.340> gun<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.240> was<00:01:48.720> dumb<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
submachine gun so that was dumb of me I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.600 
submachine gun so that was dumb of me I
should<00:01:49.680> probably<00:01:49.860> try<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.220> keep<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> as

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
should probably try and keep it as

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.700 
should probably try and keep it as
long-range<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.240> possible<00:01:51.750> right<00:01:51.899> now<00:01:53.360> alright

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
long-range as possible right now alright

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.090 
long-range as possible right now alright
though<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:57.320> walk<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.560> does<00:01:58.740> he<00:01:58.890> have
