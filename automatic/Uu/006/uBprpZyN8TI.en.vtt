 In charge of the area of ​​anesthesiology of 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.470
 specialty veterinary hospital 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.629
 we handle different types of 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.300
 anesthesia the main one is anesthesia 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.239
 inhalation through machine 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 anesthesia with web monitoring something 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.809
 similar to what does what is done in 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
 humans although we also make another type 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.360
 of anesthesia that is mainly a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.640
 through infusions this kind of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.799
 anesthesia we normally do them when 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.539
 resonance procedures are done 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.010
 magnetic that are obviously 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.170
 procedures for the equipment outside 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.939
 operating theater and we need to keep the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 patient the most 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:07.290
 immobile possible to carry out the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.540
 special procedure 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.970
 we necessarily require a physical examination 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.610
 general of all doctors in the area 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.680
 they make patients so 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.380
 perioperative 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.830
 for anesthesia in particular we can 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.440
 use propofol mental leisure that is one 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.630
 of highly used drugs in 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.310
 veterinary medicine the need and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.380
 socia tiba with the has also has 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.810
 started the solet and commonly it 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.540
 used for short procedures at 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.420
 better closing a wound when placing 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.280
 a bandage what is sought is to do the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.780
 anesthetic procedure where 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.780
 practically the surgeon is 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.070
 finishing his surgery and how many 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.960
 minutes the patient is already emerging 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.200
 of anesthesia so that it recovers what 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.200
 sooner 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.820
 in general terms the present 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.400
 anesthetic can be safe if you count 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.600
 with the necessary equipment and surveillance 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.600
