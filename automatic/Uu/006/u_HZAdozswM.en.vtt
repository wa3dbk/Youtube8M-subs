00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
with in this look we're going to be

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.950 
with in this look we're going to be
taking<00:01:22.549> a<00:01:22.819> look<00:01:22.850> at<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.240> medium<00:01:23.569> difficulty

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
taking a look at the medium difficulty

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.410 
taking a look at the medium difficulty
so<00:01:24.409> you<00:01:24.469> start<00:01:24.859> off<00:01:24.920> with<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.159> stockpile<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.999> barn

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
so you start off with a stockpile a barn

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.779 
so you start off with a stockpile a barn
a<00:01:26.719> bunch<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.259> supplies<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.950> about<00:01:28.460> five

a bunch of supplies and about five

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.660 
a bunch of supplies and about five
families<00:01:29.619> banished<00:01:30.619> isn't<00:01:31.100> your<00:01:31.340> typical

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670

families banished isn't your typical
city<00:01:32.420> builder<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:33.139> requires<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.889> lot<00:01:34.159> of<00:01:34.189> time

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
city builder it requires a lot of time

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.520 
city builder it requires a lot of time
and<00:01:34.880> planning<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.569> get<00:01:35.719> things<00:01:35.990> right<00:01:36.259> I'm

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
and planning to get things right I'm

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.440 
and planning to get things right I'm
sure<00:01:37.039> you'll<00:01:37.219> be<00:01:37.310> finding<00:01:37.639> yourself<00:01:37.999> starting

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
sure you'll be finding yourself starting

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.809 
sure you'll be finding yourself starting
over<00:01:38.780> many<00:01:39.170> times<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.859> get<00:01:40.009> just<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.789> right

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
over many times to get just the right

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.870 
over many times to get just the right

things you need to fulfill their health
level<00:03:14.480> for<00:03:14.719> example<00:03:15.139> you<00:03:15.319> can't<00:03:15.799> just<00:03:16.010> feed

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
level for example you can't just feed

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.800 
level for example you can't just feed
them<00:03:16.310> one<00:03:16.579> type<00:03:16.849> of<00:03:17.000> food<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.269> have<00:03:17.659> to

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
them one type of food you have to

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.050 
them one type of food you have to
diversify<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.560> food<00:03:18.859> if<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.489> don't<00:03:19.790> their

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
diversify the food if you don't their

diversify the food if you don't their
health<00:03:20.299> level<00:03:20.599> may<00:03:20.870> start<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.230> drop<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.799> then

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
health level may start to drop and then

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.970 
health level may start to drop and then
disease<00:03:22.669> might<00:03:22.969> set<00:03:23.269> in<00:03:23.419> so<00:03:23.930> there<00:03:24.560> are<00:03:24.590> ways

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
disease might set in so there are ways

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.009 
disease might set in so there are ways
to<00:03:25.010> counteract<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.700> by<00:03:26.090> getting

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
to counteract that by getting

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.530 
to counteract that by getting
medications<00:03:27.859> or<00:03:28.189> having<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.700> doctor<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.419> that

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
medications or having a doctor and that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.599 
medications or having a doctor and that
kind<00:03:29.719> of<00:03:29.780> thing<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.590> lots<00:03:31.129> of<00:03:31.310> different

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
kind of thing but lots of different
