 the truth they take to the cinema to eat or something 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.879
 minimum 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.099

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.989
 put the delicious shrimp 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.000
 important that you always wash them 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.609
 always passed through drinking water for 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.750

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.699
 characteristic is that they are white

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.229
