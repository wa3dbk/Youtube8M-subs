00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
now where you see the smoothie logo here

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.789 
now where you see the smoothie logo here
that<00:01:02.400> is<00:01:02.580> also<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.090> counterweight<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.680> be

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that is also a counterweight that can be

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.249 
that is also a counterweight that can be
moved<00:01:04.979> up<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.460> down<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:07.110> more

precise<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.220> balancing<00:01:08.759> I<00:01:08.909> usually<00:01:09.329> just

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
precise on your balancing I usually just

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
precise on your balancing I usually just
leave<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.750> right<00:01:09.960> where<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.710> seems<00:01:11.189> to

leave it right where it is it seems to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.560 
leave it right where it is it seems to
work<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.700> fine<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:13.530> curve<00:01:14.130> has<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:15.030> knob<00:01:15.300> in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
work out fine the curve has a knob in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.750 
work out fine the curve has a knob in
the<00:01:15.600> back<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.800> tilt<00:01:17.070> forward<00:01:17.550> or

the back that is for tilt forward or
tilt<00:01:18.060> backwards<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.870> then<00:01:19.620> you<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:20.040> these

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
tilt backwards and then you see these

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.070 
tilt backwards and then you see these
two<00:01:20.370> silver<00:01:20.760> counterweights<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.690> really

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
two silver counterweights it's really

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.670 
thumb helping you keep that one in
balance<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.690> let's<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.170> ahead<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.350> take<00:01:58.530> them

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
balance so let's go ahead and take them

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.990 
balance so let's go ahead and take them
outside<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.640> look<00:01:59.790> at<00:01:59.909> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
outside and we can look at the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:31.920 
outside and we can look at the
performance<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.690> both<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.229> them

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.350 

okay<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:33.010> was<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.250> Steadicam<00:02:33.549> curve<00:02:34.060> and

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
okay so that was the Steadicam curve and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.640 
okay so that was the Steadicam curve and
now<00:02:34.629> we're<00:02:34.780> going<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.959> look<00:02:35.110> at<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.319> Steadicam

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
now we're going to look at the Steadicam

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.280 
now we're going to look at the Steadicam
Smoothee<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.670> I'm<00:02:37.390> walking<00:02:37.689> around<00:02:38.110> at<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
Smoothee and I'm walking around at the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:56.740 
Smoothee and I'm walking around at the
same<00:02:38.590> pace

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.870 

you

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:04:43.990 

you

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.970 

okay<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.060> as<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.300> can<00:04:45.450> see<00:04:45.660> when<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.200> scenes

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
okay so as you can see when the scenes

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.520 
okay so as you can see when the scenes
are<00:04:47.190> slowed<00:04:47.430> down<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.850> 120<00:04:48.510> frames<00:04:48.660> per<00:04:48.870> second

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
are slowed down to 120 frames per second

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.100 
are slowed down to 120 frames per second
they<00:04:50.130> really<00:04:50.490> perform<00:04:50.970> pretty<00:04:51.360> similar<00:04:51.870> I

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
they really perform pretty similar I

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.780 
they really perform pretty similar I
think<00:04:52.440> they<00:04:52.710> both<00:04:52.860> perform<00:04:53.310> excellent

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
think they both perform excellent

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.670 
think they both perform excellent
actually<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.450> you<00:04:54.840> can<00:04:54.960> also<00:04:55.110> see<00:04:55.380> that<00:04:55.560> the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
actually and you can also see that the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.320 
actually and you can also see that the
possibilities<00:04:56.370> are<00:04:56.400> endless<00:04:56.700> when<00:04:57.180> you're

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
possibilities are endless when you're

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.480 
possibilities are endless when you're
shooting<00:04:57.600> in<00:04:57.840> slow<00:04:58.110> motion<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.770> using<00:04:59.310> a

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
shooting in slow motion and using a

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.640 
shooting in slow motion and using a
stabilizer<00:05:00.390> like<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.810> curve<00:05:01.050> or<00:05:01.350> the

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
stabilizer like the curve or the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.310 
stabilizer like the curve or the
smoothie<00:05:02.280> in<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.600> next<00:05:03.900> scenes<00:05:04.080> what<00:05:04.230> I'm

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
smoothie in the next scenes what I'm

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.920 
smoothie in the next scenes what I'm
going<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.470> do<00:05:04.650> is<00:05:04.890> I'm<00:05:05.010> actually<00:05:05.070> going<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.460> run

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
going to do is I'm actually going to run

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.570 
going to do is I'm actually going to run
first<00:05:06.930> with<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.230> curve<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.800> then<00:05:08.250> with<00:05:08.460> the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
first with the curve and then with the

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:21.860 
first with the curve and then with the
smoothie<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.210> see<00:05:09.540> how<00:05:09.750> they<00:05:10.020> handle<00:05:10.440> that<00:05:20.870> so

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
smoothie and see how they handle that so

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.660 
smoothie and see how they handle that so
not<00:05:22.050> too<00:05:22.230> bad<00:05:22.260> with<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.070> curve<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.550> was

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
not too bad with the curve I was

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.370 
not too bad with the curve I was
actually<00:05:23.850> pleasantly<00:05:24.210> surprised<00:05:24.870> it's<00:05:25.170> so

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
actually pleasantly surprised it's so

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.260 
actually pleasantly surprised it's so
small<00:05:25.830> that<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.130> figured<00:05:26.520> running<00:05:27.060> would

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
small that I figured running would

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.910 
small that I figured running would
actually<00:05:27.630> cause<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:28.020> to<00:05:28.110> bounce<00:05:28.230> around<00:05:28.500> quite

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
actually cause it to bounce around quite

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.130 
actually cause it to bounce around quite
a<00:05:28.950> bit<00:05:29.040> so<00:05:29.940> now<00:05:30.150> let's<00:05:30.360> take<00:05:30.510> a<00:05:30.570> look<00:05:30.840> at<00:05:30.960> the

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
a bit so now let's take a look at the

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:45.050 
a bit so now let's take a look at the
smoothie

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.490 

some<00:05:46.060> final<00:05:46.270> closing<00:05:46.720> thoughts<00:05:46.960> as<00:05:47.200> we<00:05:47.350> look
