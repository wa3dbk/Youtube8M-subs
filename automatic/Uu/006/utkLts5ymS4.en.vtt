00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
true because I haven't sort of tried to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.420 
true because I haven't sort of tried to
fit<00:00:24.090> everything<00:00:24.420> all<00:00:24.810> around<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:26.160> slight

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
fit everything all around the slight

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.130 
fit everything all around the slight
chord<00:00:26.789> change<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> slight<00:00:27.570> emphasis<00:00:27.990> on

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
chord change or the slight emphasis on

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.050 
chord change or the slight emphasis on
the<00:00:28.260> beat<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:29.099> I've<00:00:29.220> tried<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.849> just

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
the beat what I've tried to do is just

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.700 
the beat what I've tried to do is just
jam<00:00:30.420> over<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> top<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> laugh<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
jam over the top and have a laugh and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770 
jam over the top and have a laugh and
that's<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.309> think<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> beauty<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that's I think is the beauty of it you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.810 
that's I think is the beauty of it you
can<00:00:34.050> find<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.770> take<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.280> step<00:00:35.309> further

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
can find it to take it one step further

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.040 
can find it to take it one step further
but<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.480> all<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:36.630> sort<00:00:37.020> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
but this is all about sort of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
but this is all about sort of
improvisation<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> way<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.300> original

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
improvisation in a way so the original

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
way it sounds better but okay that's

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.550 
way it sounds better but okay that's
your<00:01:54.909> first<00:01:55.030> bit<00:01:55.390> then<00:01:55.990> we're<00:01:56.110> going<00:01:56.260> to<00:01:56.320> go

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
your first bit then we're going to go

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.320 
your first bit then we're going to go
down<00:01:57.040> here<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.640> seventh<00:01:57.940> fret<00:01:58.060> on<00:01:58.180> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
down here to the seventh fret on the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.160 
down here to the seventh fret on the
d-string<00:01:58.570> got<00:01:59.530> two<00:02:00.040> frets<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.850> then<00:02:01.540> play

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
d-string got two frets and then play

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.560 
d-string got two frets and then play
back<00:02:02.409> down<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.310> seventh<00:02:03.820> fret<00:02:04.030> again<00:02:04.180> so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
back down to the seventh fret again so

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.410 
back down to the seventh fret again so
we've<00:02:04.780> started<00:02:05.020> off<00:02:05.970> like<00:02:06.970> that

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
we've started off like that

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.810 
we've started off like that
I<00:02:07.450> suggest<00:02:08.200> sliding<00:02:08.770> up<00:02:08.920> from<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.429> seventh

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
I suggest sliding up from the seventh

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.360 
I suggest sliding up from the seventh
fret<00:02:10.060> D<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.410> 8th<00:02:12.340> 9th<00:02:12.610> fret<00:02:12.910> d<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:15.220> that

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
fret D to the 8th 9th fret d like that

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.730 
fret D to the 8th 9th fret d like that
so<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.640> slide<00:02:16.000> up<00:02:16.030> take<00:02:16.959> my<00:02:17.110> pressure<00:02:17.410> off<00:02:17.560> the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
so I slide up take my pressure off the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.590 
so I slide up take my pressure off the
finger<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.670> doesn't<00:02:18.910> ring<00:02:19.000> out<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.450> then

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
finger so it doesn't ring out and then

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.890 
finger so it doesn't ring out and then
just<00:02:19.630> play<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.170> 7th<00:02:20.470> fret<00:02:20.620> again<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:22.750> what

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
just play the 7th fret again that's what

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.640 
just play the 7th fret again that's what
I<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.709> we<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:29.380> then<00:02:29.470> just

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
I like to do so we have and then just

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.220 
I like to do so we have and then just
repeat<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.040> again<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:31.239> time<00:02:31.300> up<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.930> slight

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
repeat it again this time up in a slight

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.960 
repeat it again this time up in a slight
variation<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:32.980> listen<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.520> music<00:02:33.880> when

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
variation in listen to the music when

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.850 
variation in listen to the music when
you<00:02:34.090> feel<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.480> want<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.780> come<00:02:34.959> back<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.350> this

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
you feel you want to come back in this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.100 
you feel you want to come back in this
time<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.160> do<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.370> slightly<00:02:36.610> differently<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:41.050> I'm

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
time I do it slightly differently so I'm

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.290 
time I do it slightly differently so I'm
sliding<00:02:41.530> up<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.830> down<00:02:41.920> from<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.670> 5th<00:02:42.880> fret<00:02:43.030> to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
sliding up and down from the 5th fret to

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.550 
sliding up and down from the 5th fret to
the<00:02:43.360> 7th<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:45.840> leave<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.870> little<00:02:47.019> gap<00:02:47.290> if<00:02:47.530> you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
the 7th so leave a little gap if you

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.009 
the 7th so leave a little gap if you
want<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.700> what<00:02:48.730> we<00:02:48.940> have<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.330> first<00:02:49.720> bit

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
want to so what we have in the first bit

00:02:50.019 --> 00:03:00.600 
want to so what we have in the first bit
is<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:55.269> one's<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.570> bit<00:02:55.690> more<00:02:55.720> fluid<00:02:59.519> so<00:03:00.519> you

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
is this one's a bit more fluid so you

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.120 
is this one's a bit more fluid so you
can<00:03:00.730> either<00:03:00.850> go<00:03:01.650> or<00:03:03.989> up<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.350> entirely<00:03:05.950> up

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
can either go or up to you entirely up

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.940 
can either go or up to you entirely up
to<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:07.299> that's<00:03:07.660> your<00:03:07.900> first<00:03:08.079> bit<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.680> next

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
to you so that's your first bit the next

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.860 
to you so that's your first bit the next
bit<00:03:09.160> we're<00:03:09.760> going<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:09.970> go<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.329> g<00:03:10.540> string

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
bit we're going to go on to the g string

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.180 
bit we're going to go on to the g string
we're<00:03:11.019> going<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.200> play<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:11.560> we're<00:03:12.010> going<00:03:12.100> to

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
we're going to play this we're going to

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.240 
we're going to play this we're going to
use<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:13.540> technique<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:14.140> reducing<00:03:14.829> the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
use the technique of reducing the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.800 
use the technique of reducing the
pressure<00:03:15.549> on<00:03:15.700> our<00:03:15.730> left<00:03:16.060> hand<00:03:16.329> on<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.570> fret

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
pressure on our left hand on the fret

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.470 
pressure on our left hand on the fret
board<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.709> notes<00:03:18.010> aren't<00:03:18.370> ringing<00:03:18.549> out

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.270 

like<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:26.170> can<00:03:26.440> do<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.709> differently<00:03:26.829> by

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
like that you can do it differently by

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.069 
like that you can do it differently by
quite<00:03:27.549> like<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.060> gives<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.299> nice<00:03:28.450> feel<00:03:29.049> to

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
quite like that it gives a nice feel to

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.390 
quite like that it gives a nice feel to
it<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:32.200> can<00:03:32.320> slide<00:03:32.560> down<00:03:32.590> if<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.040> like

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
it you can slide down if you like

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.069 
it you can slide down if you like
so<00:03:33.579> what<00:03:33.730> we're<00:03:33.880> doing<00:03:33.910> on<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.329> 9th<00:03:34.600> fret<00:03:34.840> of

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
so what we're doing on the 9th fret of

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.789 
so what we're doing on the 9th fret of
the<00:03:35.110> G<00:03:35.579> finger<00:03:36.579> pressure<00:03:36.820> off<00:03:37.350> like<00:03:38.350> that

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
the G finger pressure off like that

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.800 
the G finger pressure off like that
then<00:03:39.190> we're<00:03:39.310> on<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.640> 7th<00:03:40.090> fret<00:03:40.269> of<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.570> G

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
then we're on to the 7th fret of the G

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.410 
then we're on to the 7th fret of the G
like<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.760> then<00:03:42.850> we're<00:03:42.940> going<00:03:43.060> down<00:03:43.269> to

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
like that and then we're going down to

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.839 
like that and then we're going down to
the<00:03:43.510> 10th<00:03:43.810> fret<00:03:43.989> d<00:03:44.320> ninth<00:03:44.739> fret<00:03:45.040> d

play<00:06:59.690> the<00:06:59.960> C<00:07:00.620> note<00:07:00.830> which<00:07:01.100> is<00:07:01.130> the<00:07:01.250> 13th<00:07:01.790> fret

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
play the C note which is the 13th fret

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.630 
play the C note which is the 13th fret
on<00:07:02.030> the<00:07:02.180> B<00:07:03.160> twice<00:07:05.710> so<00:07:06.710> that's<00:07:06.830> will<00:07:07.040> fall<00:07:07.310> apart

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.640 
on the B twice so that's will fall apart

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.290 
on the B twice so that's will fall apart
that<00:07:07.730> wrist<00:07:08.120> sounds<00:07:08.390> like<00:07:08.510> this<00:07:12.880> so<00:07:13.880> if<00:07:13.970> we<00:07:14.060> put

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
that wrist sounds like this so if we put

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:21.720 
that wrist sounds like this so if we put
that<00:07:14.450> riff<00:07:14.720> together<00:07:15.050> it<00:07:15.230> sounds<00:07:15.380> like<00:07:15.560> this

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:21.730 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.100 

so<00:07:22.730> I'll<00:07:22.910> just<00:07:23.090> play<00:07:23.240> the<00:07:23.450> last<00:07:23.600> couple<00:07:24.050> of

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110 
so I'll just play the last couple of

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.960 
so I'll just play the last couple of
bits<00:07:24.290> of<00:07:24.530> the<00:07:24.830> Santana

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
bits of the Santana

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.990 
bits of the Santana
riff<00:07:26.360> and<00:07:26.540> you'll<00:07:26.630> see<00:07:26.780> how<00:07:26.930> it<00:07:27.050> fits<00:07:27.290> together

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
riff and you'll see how it fits together

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:44.740 
riff and you'll see how it fits together
