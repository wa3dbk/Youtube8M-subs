00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.880
 something that throws the light from above 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.290

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.759
 beautiful pool in a nearby was 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.600
 on the wire made directly from the 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.610
 mendini architect who then composed 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.950
 of 20 to the architect mellini because he is

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:17.110
 where he eats he drinks he eats well is a 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.930
 game and biased yes it was difficult 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.220
 chosen by the cook 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.690
 we finally found a person 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.959
 very good at making dishes 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.310
 Sicilian and say just as good at 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.010
 make dishes that are not in the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.780
 Sicilian success profession speaks of 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.040
 international cuisine 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.040
 we also talk about international cuisine 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.500
 chatel i would say xana my gold in 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.930
 particular also for the sea sweets 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.290
 the sea landing began to marin 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.410

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.780
 our drivers who report to the various 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.079
 shoulders did not do them 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.760
 see two or three genres what though 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.890
 there is only one who likes the most miserable 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.799
 all blessed the service will provide is here a 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.319
 capo calavà of the all-inclusive service 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 free shuttle service included 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.799
 quite right 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:32.590
 fortunately there are so many things to do 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.380
 see from the Roman villa of patti al 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.740
 wait where it was also proactive 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.530
 because there was a black woman who did 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.810
 the double with wax cracola of the 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.970
 Bishop neral were from a claque 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.810
 and so he wanted to come to all 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.440
 costs 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.030

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.130

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.690
 and is with a very intense nightlife 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.900
 I would also recommend trips 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.790
 inside the sicily where it is found 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.730
 over all another climate 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.350
 other temperatures giuseppe si si 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.100
 in love with madonie mall ha 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:17.140
 confessed before the interview if 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.570

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.480

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.360

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.540
 freely on these vast plots of land a 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.310
 green and actually it was one 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.669
 shocking situation for one who comes 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.340
 from the sea with sea temperatures 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.530
