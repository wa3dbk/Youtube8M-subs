00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
nice it's a simple design but very

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.470

clubs I'm being a little bit secretive
about<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.940> cards<00:01:00.270> because<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.170> how

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
about the cards because of just how

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.700 
about the cards because of just how
unique<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.890> deck<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.899> let's<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.229> six<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
unique this deck is let's see six of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
unique this deck is let's see six of
hearts<00:01:05.299> ace<00:01:06.299> 2<00:01:06.689> 3<00:01:07.140> 4<00:01:07.560> 5<00:01:08.040> 6<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.390> one-way

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
hearts ace 2 3 4 5 6 is it a one-way

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
hearts ace 2 3 4 5 6 is it a one-way
design<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.290> don't<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:13.040> if<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.340> it's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
design I don't think so if it is it's

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
design I don't think so if it is it's
super<00:01:14.939> subtle<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.509> might<00:01:15.659> even<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.049> one-way

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
super subtle it might even be a one-way

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.450 
super subtle it might even be a one-way
this<00:01:16.680> way<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:18.439> don't<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.950> let's<00:01:20.189> take<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
this way I don't think so let's take a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
this way I don't think so let's take a
quick<00:01:20.759> riffle<00:01:21.150> test<00:01:26.119> nope<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.420> far<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.810> can

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
quick riffle test nope as far as I can

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.350 
quick riffle test nope as far as I can
tell<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> one-way<00:01:31.770> design<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.180> let

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
tell it is not a one-way design so let

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
tell it is not a one-way design so let
me<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.659> reverse<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.049> six<00:01:34.470> back<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> we'll

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
me just reverse the six back and we'll

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.660 
me just reverse the six back and we'll
go<00:01:35.729> through<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.030> phases<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:37.549> reason<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.610> took

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
go through the phases now reason I took

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.280
