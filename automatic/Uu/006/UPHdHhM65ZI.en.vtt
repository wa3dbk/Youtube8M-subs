00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.820

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.309

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.889
 well here you have the URL urls of the blog 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.960
 blog points apart tip tip dot net or 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.760
 facebook point support you dot net for 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.539
 facebook is worth the same for youtube 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.640
 would be youtube point stand you dot net 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.829
 they want me to roger go quickies 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.760
 we have seen in the last video of the course 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:34.550
 of the server 2012 as 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.110
 configures the theme of remote access what 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.820
 what are we going to see now is how to install 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.700
 the license manager of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.710
 terminal server to be able to install 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.050
 then licenses that will be necessary 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.750
 because when we get to work 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.460
 with this system of agreement so 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.190
 well let's go quickie we give here 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.550
 admin to see if you let me add 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.550
 roles 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.200
 server selection such roles of 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.960
 server remote desktop services 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.690
 we are seeing it there 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.500
 Remote Desktop Services will 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.500
 we mark this 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.020
 and we can continue next 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.630
 characteristic until the next 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.840
 next administration of licenses of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.240
 remote desktop voucher this is the one that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.939
 we mark already tells us that there is 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.549
 install a series of things here is worth 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.390
 as a management tool 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.330
 add characteristics 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.060
 next and well then if you have to 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.000
 restart reboot we say yes and 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.890
 we give you to install 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.080
 well the installation we will see is very 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.930
 simple, this is a process 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.600
 pretty fast as it's a process that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.580
 I think we already know all that 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.680
 I'm going to do if I see that you start 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.720
 stretch a lot 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.820
 I'm going to take a little break in the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.620
 video until this process completed 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.630
 agree once you have 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.370
 completed the process we are going to see the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 issue of licenses as we can 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.050
 add and others now I do not want either 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.260
 make a relatively simple video 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.330
 and brief not a brief explanation then 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.100
 that there is a video charif there is of 10 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.200
 minutes, if it can be five then 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.090
 better so let's see 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.160
 the installation of the feature this 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.989
 we have already done it many times it does not have 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.739
 it has no greater mystery so it's going to be 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.550
 a quick going fast let's give it a 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.440
 little margin 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.660
 the bromine as he commented that this 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.480
 install a role a feature then 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.950
 it is not something that should be very 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.740
 difficult if we have seen the videos 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.430
 previous tutorials of the course is worth the 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.370
 course I will take advantage of the small pause 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.250
 to tell you what 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.690
 we'll see 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.690
 if we access here 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.380
 let's see good does not respond or has 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.380
 left 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.030
 collapsed let's see 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.680
 is what the director's things have 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.280
 if we access here to youtube 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.120
 to see if he wants 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.530
 I've seen them in the slowest network yet 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.569
 but much faster, it also does not 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.760
 distract 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.159
 well let's see according to this the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.310
 correct installation such as 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:42.450
 well we close and see if here he gives the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.450
 win if we access youtube.com portet and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.200
 net point 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.080
 ok I do not know if you are seeing the url 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.269
 good already changed youtube points contribution 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.370
 You point net access to the channel 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.380
 youtube and here you have the course 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.210
 OK 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.110
 the windows server course that is 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.100
 accessible from the cover good 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.750
 we follow here correct installation 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.819
 perfect we come to tools a 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.239
 Once we have installed 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.190
 this feature and this error sorry 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.310
 terminal server administrator 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.510
 remote desktop licenses 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.600
 it and run it for nothing already 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.420
 we have here ready to agree that is what 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.820
 what should be done 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.130
 it is worth in principle in principle 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.289
 you would have to activate the server to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.230
 can install licenses 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.690
 in agreement 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.530
 once installed we have a period of 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.120
 grace of about 90 days I think it's that 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.310
 we can use it while 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.740
 we acquire the license if so for 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.480
 get to work according once 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.390
 that we already have them we would have to 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.140
 activate the server sorry I would have to 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.750
 activate it 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.520
 once installed the service is worth this 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.100
 the connection connection method 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.250
 automatic such we say that if the 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:08.150
 next name as the name of 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:12.910
 stack like the joke duracell last names 6 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:16.450
 for martínez company and acs 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.740
 since that country the region we're going to put 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.050
 Spain 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.889
 go to the following email 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.720
 next thing we're going to see start the 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.940
 existing we will not start the 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.250
 assistant we will give to finalize 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.210
 the server this in principle is in 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:38.050
 ready and we can give it to install 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.419
 licenses we come here we say that 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.400
 next and here we choose the type of 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.780
 license 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.940
 license packages is box is I do not know 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.600
 how much next here we would put the 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.669
 license and we will proceed with the subject myself 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.160
 as I do not have as I do not have a license 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.990
 of this one because I can not complete the 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.750
 process is ok but as we have is 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.040
 simple reinstall license and palante 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.590
 in agreement 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.040
 we remember terminal server tools 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.990
 license manager and install 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.600
 licenses 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.460
 according to this and a friends cake 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.410
 I leave 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.169
 until a next video tutorial in the 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.419
 that we will surely continue working on 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.130
 The issue of the terminal server is worth 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.440
 to learn how to take advantage of it and to 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.270
 start to give more cane is this 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.680
 technique and nothing that I hope you like 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.860
 the course but that you encourage 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.410
 share it and above all I hope that 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.539
 Well, the videos will help you to go 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.900
 learning to operate this system without 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.370
 plus 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.039
 a greeting thank you very much for watching the 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.240
 video and as always I wait for you in the 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.240
 next until after
