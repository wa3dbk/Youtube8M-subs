00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.259
 Good morning, good afternoon, good evening to you 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.630
 watching our schools of model interpretation 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.819
 I hope it's both good 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.439
 and it would be great to receive 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.269
 a comment your recipient 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.769
 to motivate us and help us to do more and better 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:29.829
 well come on, our goal today is to meet cox people who work with 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:30.919
 say 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.780
 many people call me asking if I go I have a specific course for the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.930
 dengue says 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.640
 but the industrial modeling course to have been it enables the student to perform 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.600
 these creeds also 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.920
 logical that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.680
 the farm correct interpretation 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.400
 I sleep as God says 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.040
 knowing the structure is because I say it is characterized by cutouts is a 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 cutout is very beautiful and cut with three stitches 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.880
 now 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.350
 the fashion uses me accompanies the note in some times we have each exit 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.270
 narrowed off 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.430
 would be slightly higher 1 1 per 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.550
 the altar and had to be changed in the north of spain x interpretation execution 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.350
 of warrants 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.060
 and this occurs only from black industrial modeling and been will give you the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.280
 All we need is 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.020
 I have myself in the classroom 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.280
 the year videos we're seeing some basic jacket like this I'll see if 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770
 I can put 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.560
 they here in you tube 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.040
 because I think it's going to be very timely 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 to meet the people who 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.440
 I had to late for a course 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.630
 that he will not attend the case to the needs but I can say 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.280
 what little is our industrial modeling course? 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.570
 perfectly 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.300
 not only the segment of ingestion of the party segment 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.840
 uniform segment 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.120
 any piece that you will perform in flat fabric 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.780
 you will perform with professional quality 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 to use it in our pacheco modes 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.019
 tested and approved 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.979
 only to make the first the first modeling kitty 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.969
 I rode the house and at one year 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.599
 working as a stylist and modeler in the morning in a 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.720
 what I knew to be 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.450
 necessary that your as consulting as a stylist and ohio created pieces 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.579
 to realize this is to cover the holidays of a modeler in a 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.639
 confection 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.509
 she can perform can test 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.750
 The only one that's been here has only improved. 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.370
 so today we can offer people a really 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.949
 quality 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.789
 who will make you 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.789
 is to perform pieces as practicality 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.629
 working with interpretation with execution of models and not politicians 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:57.409
 why 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.079
 it's all there tested that she's that skeleton already heavy 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.829
 would stop 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.639
 the methods of interpretation that are passed in a clear and objective way 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.910
 and also has the virtual room 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.540
 where the student has a poor attendance for three months and apply the mind then 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.200
 There's no way you can not learn. 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.669
 and you can not keep all your 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.779
 doubts and difficulties solved the service is personalized 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.519
 here I do not have much to talk about the challenge is this because 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.659
 And says 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.240
 and that is the default 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.759
 traditional jacket is an additional illustrious jacket 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:40.609
 now in the thread segment we also work with elastane 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.369
 So 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:48.239
 or it stand-up it requires that the modeling always be 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.320
 for everything it has been with elastano 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.160
 There is no way you can do it. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.300
 the modeling of a traditional tissue 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.900
 11 11 10 a jaguar who comes from nature photo 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:08.279
 the boss bought there with the disc but when you attack it badly 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.279
 denominated between the cut and not for the sierras of Santa Catarina 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:15.069
 will be respected that it did not give a defect 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:20.909
 swim in the tissue if the relationship will have no effect not woven with elastane 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.559
 so you need almost the modeling to the material that you are 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:27.819
 Working 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.139
 and for this the notion of interpretation 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.349
 it's essential 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.140
 so I'm hitting here every day showing 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.680
 which is really very important the professional is only complete 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.540
 when he knows how to look at the model making the correct reading of that other modelli 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.400
 very important thing is a delight to always be aware of the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.400
 fashion trends 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.289
 As a rest, he is not a stylist and will not create 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.770
 but it needs to translate the creation 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.770
 so often used Japanese speaking 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.199
 and how it performed 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.199
 Portuguese then the two do not understand the world 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.589
 becky it was even a lack of respect for modeling in relation to the stylist 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:18.080
 because he speaks, paper caesar accepts everything 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 somehow is right because stylists 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.050
 usually the majority do not have a basic minimum knowledge of 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.110
 modeling so he does not know 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.439
 enter into that professional's universe 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:35.220
 clearly if you want to be a stylist 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.210
 of success I do rivers courses and what is also the modeling for fabric 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.129
 If you take disability you already have all the knowledge you need to work on 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.330
 any other area 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.060
 because if I say that the same one you already know you will understand the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.189
 which had been lodged 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:54.280
 then that's it 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.070
 What I want to leave here is basically what day 10 it is 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.449
 made in industrial modeling for flat fabric 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.869
 and that you have to adjust 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.240
 or reading the model 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.380
 and the construction of the new team 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.580
 always the raw material 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.999
 by the samu have no action 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:22.389
 and then you have to always be able to notice any team being serious about this party 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.239
 more accentuated length that is using each node instead 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.530
 Ã©rico alan little more than 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.969
 the machine head 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:36.150
 these details are very important in the stage always made a sport one x 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.360
 that it has to be accepted the plant may have modifications 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.620
 and to follow fashion trend these details are very important 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:49.329
 I hope you have like the water of your feedback your comments 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.309
 and took a look 

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:54.819
 I did not speak for years when I noticed 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:58.949
 one could go back and learn more and better. 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.419
 that's what our dvd fashion courses are for 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:07.840
 are distance courses you do in your home 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.389
 your work at the weekend the time that suits you 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:16.259
 because the classroom in the afternoon in up to 24 hours a day does not have 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:16.930
 study 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.849
 the student in April when 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:21.009
 has a specific material 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:26.099
 he does this the queries and sends his questions his works that receive the 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.129
 notification 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:32.219
 of the corrections and send your return to your questions on your and he enters it 

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:33.520
 in the room and saw everything there 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.580
 so it's very interactive 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.319
 really 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:39.759
 provides 

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.849
 effective learning 

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:45.599
 Good morning, good afternoon. A good night to you and see you tomorrow.
