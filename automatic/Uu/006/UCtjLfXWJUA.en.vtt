the games I think we should first take a
look<00:02:23.700> at<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> controller<00:02:24.360> now<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.990> Xbox<00:02:25.410> was

look at the controller now the Xbox was
originally<00:02:26.190> launched<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.820> Xbox<00:02:27.450> chip

the controller s which I have here the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.100 
the controller s which I have here the
main<00:02:32.190> difference<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.820> obviously<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.630> sizes

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
main difference is obviously the sizes

same all the way up to the brand-new
Xbox<00:02:55.470> one<00:02:55.740> which<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.160> see<00:02:56.340> as<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.460> good<00:02:56.700> thing

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
Xbox one which I see as a good thing

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.070 
Xbox one which I see as a good thing
because<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.300> think<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.690> layout<00:02:58.050> is

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
because I think this layout is

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.150 
because I think this layout is
near-perfect

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
near-perfect

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.950 
near-perfect
the<00:02:59.310> only<00:02:59.580> major<00:02:59.850> difference<00:03:00.150> which<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.840> on

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
the only major difference which is on

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.080 
the only major difference which is on

the original Xbox controller there is

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.240 
the original Xbox controller there is
the<00:03:03.330> two<00:03:03.540> white<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:03.900> black<00:03:04.290> buttons<00:03:04.710> which

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
the two white and black buttons which

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.760 
the two white and black buttons which
