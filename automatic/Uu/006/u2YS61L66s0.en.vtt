hello this is mama Shaquille here and

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.210 
hello this is mama Shaquille here and
you're<00:00:03.210> watching<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:04.049> radial<00:00:04.529> engine<00:00:04.710> being

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
you're watching a radial engine being

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.670 
you're watching a radial engine being
designed<00:00:05.700> in<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.330> generator<00:00:06.899> shape<00:00:07.230> design

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
designed in the generator shape design

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.680 
designed in the generator shape design
and<00:00:08.160> partly<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.059> partners<00:00:09.540> and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
and partly with the partners and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.499 
and partly with the partners and
workbench<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.530> was<00:00:11.190> finally<00:00:11.519> assembled<00:00:12.000> in

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
workbench and was finally assembled in

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.629 
workbench and was finally assembled in
the<00:00:12.660> assembly<00:00:13.230> design<00:00:13.380> workbench<00:00:14.099> as<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.460> can

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the assembly design workbench as you can

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.300 
the assembly design workbench as you can
see<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.059> these<00:00:15.299> are<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.540> files<00:00:16.049> or<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.920> part

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
see here these are the files or the part

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.760 
see here these are the files or the part
files<00:00:17.640> which<00:00:17.970> was<00:00:18.180> used<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.750> do<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.439> complete

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
files which was used to do the complete

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.300 
files which was used to do the complete
assembly<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.730> radial<00:00:21.230> engine<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.890> as<00:00:23.100> you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
assembly of this radial engine so as you

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.720 
assembly of this radial engine so as you
know<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.910> radial<00:00:24.840> engine<00:00:25.380> was<00:00:25.730> previously

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
know this radial engine was previously

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.009 
know this radial engine was previously
used<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> aircraft<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:29.449> it's<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
used in the aircraft so it's like the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.920 
used in the aircraft so it's like the
radial<00:00:31.470> engine<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.219> reciprocating<00:00:33.149> IC

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
radial engine is a reciprocating IC

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.510 
radial engine is a reciprocating IC
engine<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> internal<00:00:34.860> combustion<00:00:35.309> engine

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
engine the internal combustion engine

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.270 
engine the internal combustion engine
with<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> cylinders<00:00:37.230> which<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.829> pointing

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
with the cylinders which are pointing

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.260 
with the cylinders which are pointing
outwards<00:00:38.820> from<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> crankshaft<00:00:39.510> so

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
outwards from the crankshaft so

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.740 
outwards from the crankshaft so
basically<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.739> different<00:00:44.190> parts

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
basically you have the different parts

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.380 
basically you have the different parts
which<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> introduce<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.390> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
which I'm going to introduce to you so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.500 
which I'm going to introduce to you so
you<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.000> different

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
you can see that the different

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
you can see that the different
articulated<00:00:52.260> roads<00:00:52.530> these<00:00:52.800> are<00:00:52.980> called<00:00:53.219> as

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
articulated roads these are called as

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.880 
articulated roads these are called as
the<00:00:53.399> articulate<00:00:54.059> approach<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the articulate approach and this is the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.799 
the articulate approach and this is the
master<00:00:56.370> road<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.850> done<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
master road here so it was done with the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.299 
master road here so it was done with the
bottom-up<00:01:01.170> assembly<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:03.890> as<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.250> see

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
bottom-up assembly and as you can see

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.789 
bottom-up assembly and as you can see
here<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.330> different<00:01:06.840> angles<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:07.590> was

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
here the different angles which was

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.080 
here the different angles which was
given<00:01:08.189> was<00:01:08.810> 70<00:01:09.810> degrees<00:01:09.840> each<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.820> over<00:01:11.820> here

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
given was 70 degrees each and over here

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.230 
given was 70 degrees each and over here
I<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.210> given<00:01:12.540> 75<00:01:13.320> 75<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.760> sine<00:01:14.970> Phi<00:01:15.210> sine

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
I have given 75 75 this is sine Phi sine

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.850 
I have given 75 75 this is sine Phi sine
Phi<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.350> all<00:01:16.530> 70<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:18.439> that's<00:01:19.439> all

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
Phi and this is all 70 so that's all

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.130 
Phi and this is all 70 so that's all
about<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.310> angles<00:01:20.970> which<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.420> given<00:01:21.840> which

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
about the angles which was given which

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.899 
about the angles which was given which
we<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:23.009> used<00:01:23.280> while<00:01:23.729> you're

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
we which would be used while you're

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.500 
we which would be used while you're
doing<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> assembly<00:01:24.750> over

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
doing the assembly over

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.250 
doing the assembly over
the<00:01:26.200> angle<00:01:26.680> constraint<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:27.880> let<00:01:28.180> me<00:01:28.270> just<00:01:28.480> talk

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
the angle constraint so let me just talk

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.960 
the angle constraint so let me just talk
a<00:01:29.320> little<00:01:29.560> bit<00:01:29.710> about<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.160> different<00:01:30.610> parts

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
a little bit about the different parts

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.740 
a little bit about the different parts
which<00:01:31.120> was<00:01:31.330> used<00:01:31.630> in<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.820> making<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:34.360> our

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
which was used in the making of our

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.340 
which was used in the making of our
radial<00:01:35.320> engine<00:01:35.760> so<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:37.270> different<00:01:37.660> parts<00:01:38.170> are

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
radial engine so the different parts are

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.070 
radial engine so the different parts are
one<00:01:39.190> is<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.370> mass<00:01:39.760> rule<00:01:40.150> which<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.810> most

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
one is a mass rule which is the most

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.160 
one is a mass rule which is the most
important<00:01:41.680> part<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.190> this<00:01:42.460> radiant<00:01:42.910> engine<00:01:43.300> so

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
important part of this radiant engine so

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.200 
important part of this radiant engine so
as<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.530> can<00:01:44.710> see<00:01:44.770> here<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.700> master

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
as you can see here this is a master

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.890 
as you can see here this is a master
rule<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:48.430> generator<00:01:48.970> shape<00:01:49.270> design<00:01:49.630> was

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
rule and the generator shape design was

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.530 
rule and the generator shape design was
used<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.380> little<00:01:50.650> bit<00:01:50.830> for<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.370> design<00:01:51.880> and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
used a little bit for this design and

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.200 
used a little bit for this design and
you<00:01:53.440> can<00:01:53.680> see<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.190> different<00:01:54.610> holes<00:01:54.850> over

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
you can see the different holes over

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.340 
you can see the different holes over
here<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.670> know<00:01:57.820> are<00:01:58.090> used<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.870> link<00:01:59.110> between

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
here you know are used to a link between

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.100 
here you know are used to a link between
the<00:01:59.920> articulator<00:02:00.820> growth<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.510> the<00:02:01.690> master

piston pin plug and you have the piston
pin<00:02:19.390> over<00:02:19.930> here<00:02:20.230> which<00:02:20.470> holds<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
pin over here which holds the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.900 
pin over here which holds the
articulated<00:02:22.900> rod<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.950> piston<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:27.190> over

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
articulated rod and the piston so over

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.290 
articulated rod and the piston so over
here<00:02:28.270> we<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.690> again<00:02:29.400> some<00:02:30.400> small<00:02:30.730> parts<00:02:31.180> of

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
here we have again some small parts of

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.040 
here we have again some small parts of
the<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:31.660> just<00:02:32.020> called<00:02:32.260> as<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> link<00:02:32.920> pin<00:02:33.190> which

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
the here just called as a link pin which

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.640 
the here just called as a link pin which
holds<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.260> articulated<00:02:36.250> road<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
holds the articulated road and the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.280 
holds the articulated road and the
master<00:02:38.650> wall<00:02:38.860> together<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:40.390> basically<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
master wall together so basically the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.990 
master wall together so basically the
working<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:43.680> radial<00:02:44.680> engine<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.790> be

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
working of radial engine can be

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.250 
working of radial engine can be
explained<00:02:46.510> from<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.930> top<00:02:47.170> view<00:02:48.480> as<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.720> see

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
explained from the top view as you see

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.140 
explained from the top view as you see
it<00:02:50.380> from<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.709> top<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.160> can<00:02:51.489> feel<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.120> can

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
it from the top you can feel you can

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.170 
it from the top you can feel you can
unit<00:02:52.810> see<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.110> seems<00:02:53.530> like<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:53.800> star<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.970> that's

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
unit see it seems like a star so that's

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.270 
unit see it seems like a star so that's
the<00:02:55.360> reason<00:02:55.690> some<00:02:55.959> languages<00:02:56.530> they<00:02:56.739> call<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.160> a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
the reason some languages they call it a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.350 
the reason some languages they call it a
star<00:02:57.700> engine<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.950> bits<00:03:00.400> because<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:01.060> its

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
star engine so it bits because of its

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.840 
star engine so it bits because of its
look<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.500> star<00:03:02.800> when<00:03:03.130> it's<00:03:03.280> viewed<00:03:03.489> from<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
look of a star when it's viewed from the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.440 
look of a star when it's viewed from the
top<00:03:04.090> view<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:05.380> basically<00:03:06.130> what<00:03:06.760> happens<00:03:07.239> in

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
top view so basically what happens in

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.280 
top view so basically what happens in
our<00:03:07.660> raid

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
our raid

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.520 
our raid
engine<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:10.540> will<00:03:10.720> have<00:03:10.989> another

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
engine is you will have another

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.380 
engine is you will have another
particular<00:03:13.950> Center<00:03:14.950> over<00:03:15.340> here<00:03:15.610> with<00:03:15.879> respect

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
particular Center over here with respect

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.809 
particular Center over here with respect
to<00:03:16.540> which<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:17.409> particular<00:03:17.799> two<00:03:18.189> components

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
to which this particular two components

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.030 
to which this particular two components
will<00:03:18.939> be<00:03:18.970> connected<00:03:19.659> with<00:03:19.689> but<00:03:20.349> one

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
will be connected with but one

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.089 
will be connected with but one
particular<00:03:21.579> component<00:03:21.790> here<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:23.799> its

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
particular component here and that its

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.520 
particular component here and that its
Center<00:03:24.579> will<00:03:24.790> be<00:03:25.000> fixed<00:03:25.420> so<00:03:25.959> what<00:03:26.140> happens

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
Center will be fixed so what happens

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.610 
Center will be fixed so what happens
here<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:28.510> particular<00:03:29.159> drive<00:03:30.159> here

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
here is this particular drive here

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.140 
here is this particular drive here
assembled<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.980> there<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.610> drive<00:03:33.879> is

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
assembled that there is the drive is

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.759 
assembled that there is the drive is
with<00:03:34.329> respect<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:35.079> particular<00:03:35.379> point

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
with respect to this particular point

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.270 
with respect to this particular point
over<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:37.000> what<00:03:37.180> happens<00:03:37.599> is<00:03:37.840> this<00:03:38.680> link

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
over here and what happens is this link

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.300 
over here and what happens is this link
moves<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:42.370> same<00:03:42.640> time<00:03:43.030> we<00:03:43.329> have<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:44.560> you

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
moves and the same time we have this you

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.809 
moves and the same time we have this you
know<00:03:45.340> drives<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:46.500> five<00:03:47.500> Pistons<00:03:48.129> in<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.519> five

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
know drives of five Pistons in this five

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.110 
know drives of five Pistons in this five
accesses<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:50.230> what<00:03:50.440> happens<00:03:50.829> is<00:03:51.040> this<00:03:51.760> moves

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
accesses so what happens is this moves

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.240 
accesses so what happens is this moves
in<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:52.690> direction<00:03:52.930> when<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.680> drive<00:03:53.920> comes

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
in this direction when the drive comes

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.809 
in this direction when the drive comes
from<00:03:54.489> here<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.750> moves<00:03:56.019> in<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:56.409> direction

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
from here and it moves in this direction

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.410 
from here and it moves in this direction
whereas<00:03:57.819> over<00:03:58.299> here<00:03:58.659> this<00:03:59.019> piston<00:03:59.560> compresses

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
whereas over here this piston compresses

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.330 
whereas over here this piston compresses
the<00:04:01.420> compression<00:04:01.930> stroke<00:04:02.230> happens<00:04:02.739> here<00:04:03.099> and

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
the compression stroke happens here and

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.270 
the compression stroke happens here and
the<00:04:03.730> expansion<00:04:04.239> stroke<00:04:04.569> happens<00:04:05.109> here<00:04:05.409> so<00:04:06.159> in

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
the expansion stroke happens here so in

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.599 
the expansion stroke happens here so in
that<00:04:06.519> way<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.629> drive<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.170> given<00:04:08.530> from<00:04:08.799> five<00:04:09.579> of

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
that way the drive is given from five of

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.910 
that way the drive is given from five of
the<00:04:09.879> Pistons<00:04:10.299> from<00:04:10.480> five<00:04:10.780> sites<00:04:11.109> and<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.650> gives

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
the Pistons from five sites and it gives

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.059 
the Pistons from five sites and it gives
enormous<00:04:12.910> energy<00:04:13.299> so<00:04:14.260> that's<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.650> reason<00:04:14.799> it

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
enormous energy so that's the reason it

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.199 
enormous energy so that's the reason it
was<00:04:15.280> used<00:04:15.669> for<00:04:16.030> aircraft<00:04:16.570> engines<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:18.209> till

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
was used for aircraft engines so till

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.219 
was used for aircraft engines so till
the<00:04:19.389> time<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.709> know<00:04:20.880> there<00:04:21.880> was

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
the time that you know there was

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.170 
the time that you know there was
advancement<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:24.160> turbo<00:04:24.400> engines<00:04:24.940> have

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
advancement and the turbo engines have

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.730 
advancement and the turbo engines have
come<00:04:25.800> so<00:04:26.970> that's<00:04:27.970> all<00:04:28.180> about<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:29.110> working<00:04:29.560> of

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
come so that's all about the working of

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.210 
come so that's all about the working of
our<00:04:29.979> radial<00:04:30.940> engine<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.690> soon<00:04:32.620> I'm<00:04:32.800> going<00:04:33.099> to

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
our radial engine and soon I'm going to

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.250 
our radial engine and soon I'm going to
come<00:04:33.370> up<00:04:33.520> with<00:04:33.699> more<00:04:34.240> tutorials<00:04:34.840> which<00:04:35.110> is

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
come up with more tutorials which is

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.679 
come up with more tutorials which is
based<00:04:35.560> on<00:04:35.860> this

based on this

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.809 
based on this
and<00:04:37.779> try<00:04:38.409> to<00:04:38.469> make<00:04:38.739> a<00:04:38.769> simulation<00:04:39.309> on<00:04:39.549> this

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
and try to make a simulation on this

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.019 
and try to make a simulation on this
which<00:04:40.330> can<00:04:40.509> better<00:04:40.749> explain<00:04:41.049> you<00:04:41.459> so<00:04:42.459> I<00:04:42.759> hope
