to have the fender the rear fender this

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.740 
to have the fender the rear fender this
was<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:31.310> part<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.730> license<00:02:33.090> plate<00:02:33.270> after<00:02:33.510> I

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
was a part of the license plate after I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.410 
was a part of the license plate after I
kind<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.110> hacked<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.239> drilled<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.360> hole

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
kind of hacked it and drilled a hole

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.270 
kind of hacked it and drilled a hole
through<00:02:36.540> it

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
through it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.550 
through it
Wow<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.910> doing<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.630> didn't<00:02:40.319> really<00:02:40.410> know

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
Wow is doing this and didn't really know

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.030 
Wow is doing this and didn't really know
which<00:02:40.980> way<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.310> was<00:02:41.459> gonna<00:02:41.610> go<00:02:41.910> as<00:02:42.150> far<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:43.040> their

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
which way I was gonna go as far as their

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.130 
which way I was gonna go as far as their
design<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.819> how<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.030> was<00:02:45.150> gonna<00:02:45.300> cut<00:02:45.660> things<00:02:45.959> I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
design and how I was gonna cut things I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.220 
design and how I was gonna cut things I
kind<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:47.340> know<00:02:47.400> winged<00:02:47.760> it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
kind of just you know winged it

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.449 
kind of just you know winged it
basically<00:02:49.230> why<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.380> ended<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.709> doing<00:02:49.920> was

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
basically why I ended up doing was

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.100 
basically why I ended up doing was
taking<00:02:53.360> this<00:02:54.380> plate<00:02:55.380> back<00:02:55.620> here<00:02:56.040> originally

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
taking this plate back here originally

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.300 
taking this plate back here originally
you<00:02:58.110> know<00:02:58.319> cutting<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.920> off<00:03:00.920> cutting<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.160> off

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
you know cutting it off cutting it off

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.660 
you know cutting it off cutting it off
right<00:03:02.940> there<00:03:03.709> because<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.950> was<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.100> nice<00:03:05.310> little

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
right there because it was a nice little

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.240 
right there because it was a nice little
angle<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.390> came<00:03:06.600> with<00:03:06.630> already<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:08.010> from

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
angle that it came with already so from

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.190 
angle that it came with already so from
here<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:09.330> dropped<00:03:10.140> down<00:03:11.239> then<00:03:12.239> came<00:03:12.540> almost

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
here it's dropped down then came almost

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.800 
here it's dropped down then came almost
close<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.410> your<00:03:13.650> real<00:03:13.830> rear<00:03:14.250> will<00:03:14.690> but<00:03:15.690> it

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
close to your real rear will but it

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.810 
close to your real rear will but it
wasn't<00:03:15.989> that's<00:03:16.109> where<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.380> go<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.859> I<00:03:17.190> thought

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
wasn't that's where I go that I thought

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.300 
wasn't that's where I go that I thought
would<00:03:18.060> be<00:03:18.120> great<00:03:18.329> for<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.660> license<00:03:19.079> plate<00:03:19.310> I'm

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
would be great for a license plate I'm

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.220 
would be great for a license plate I'm
signed<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.790> up<00:03:20.940> my<00:03:21.090> seats<00:03:21.450> knowing<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.019> on

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
signed it up my seats knowing that on

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.949 
signed it up my seats knowing that on
there<00:03:22.530> just<00:03:22.709> bolted<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.280> from<00:03:23.519> here<00:03:23.930> because<00:03:24.930> I

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
there just bolted on from here because I

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.009 
there just bolted on from here because I
didn't<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.950> real<00:03:26.880> life<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.359> I<00:03:27.390> had<00:03:27.660> or

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
didn't like the real life that I had or

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.160 
didn't like the real life that I had or
I'm<00:03:28.230> sorry<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.980> turn<00:03:29.790> signals<00:03:30.299> I<00:03:30.540> ended<00:03:31.049> up

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
I'm sorry the turn signals I ended up

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.099 
I'm sorry the turn signals I ended up
installing<00:03:31.590> these<00:03:31.980> LEDs<00:03:32.579> I<00:03:32.970> still<00:03:33.840> need<00:03:33.959> some

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
installing these LEDs I still need some

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.660 
installing these LEDs I still need some
resistors<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:34.769> there<00:03:34.950> because<00:03:35.190> they're<00:03:35.430> kind

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
resistors on there because they're kind

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.289 
resistors on there because they're kind
of<00:03:35.840> hyper<00:03:36.840> blinking<00:03:37.350> right<00:03:37.440> now<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.209> guys

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
of hyper blinking right now so you guys

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.960 
of hyper blinking right now so you guys
can<00:03:39.359> tell<00:03:41.420> also<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.450> installed<00:03:43.100> an<00:03:44.100> LED<00:03:44.730> on<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
can tell also I installed an LED on the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.080 
can tell also I installed an LED on the
inside<00:03:45.480> license<00:03:46.079> plate<00:03:46.400> right<00:03:47.400> above<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.880> lip

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
inside license plate right above the lip

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.750 
inside license plate right above the lip
it<00:03:48.510> was<00:03:48.900> actually<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.470> perfect<00:03:49.799> install

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.820 

if<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.599> was<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.900> just<00:03:54.050> seemed<00:03:54.200> like<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.440> meant

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
if it was it just seemed like it meant

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.320 
if it was it just seemed like it meant
just<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.099> kind<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.400> throw<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.819> on<00:03:55.879> there<00:03:56.180> was

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
just to kind of throw that on there was

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.960 
just to kind of throw that on there was
perfect<00:03:56.980> but<00:03:57.980> here<00:03:58.190> let<00:03:58.400> me<00:03:58.430> have<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.760> guys

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
perfect but here let me have you guys

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:11.979 
perfect but here let me have you guys
take<00:03:59.330> a<00:03:59.360> look<00:04:09.220> you<00:04:10.220> know<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.610> mean<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.450> covers

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
take a look you know I mean it covers

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.740 
take a look you know I mean it covers
the<00:04:12.379> LED<00:04:12.830> covers<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.670> Elijah's<00:04:14.299> plane<00:04:14.540> of

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
the LED covers the Elijah's plane of

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.939 
the LED covers the Elijah's plane of
course<00:04:14.959> we<00:04:15.170> have<00:04:15.379> our<00:04:17.169> turn<00:04:18.169> signals<00:04:18.709> also

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
course we have our turn signals also

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.800 
course we have our turn signals also
illuminated<00:04:19.459> kind<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.449> what<00:04:20.540> I<00:04:20.630> was<00:04:20.780> thinking

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
illuminated kind of what I was thinking

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.110 
illuminated kind of what I was thinking
going<00:04:21.290> forward<00:04:22.130> was<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.610> was<00:04:22.729> actually<00:04:22.850> gonna

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
going forward was I was actually gonna

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.520 
going forward was I was actually gonna
grab<00:04:23.680> these<00:04:24.680> turn<00:04:25.070> signals<00:04:25.639> and<00:04:26.380> actually<00:04:27.380> get

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
grab these turn signals and actually get

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
grab these turn signals and actually get
them<00:04:27.650> right<00:04:28.280> here<00:04:29.979> so<00:04:30.979> when<00:04:31.130> you're<00:04:31.250> actually

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
them right here so when you're actually

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.240 
them right here so when you're actually
looking<00:04:31.789> at<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.240> from<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:32.600> pattern<00:04:32.960> here<00:04:33.250> it

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
looking at it from the pattern here it

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.800 
looking at it from the pattern here it
would<00:04:34.400> be<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:34.520> better<00:04:34.729> indicator<00:04:35.120> kids<00:04:35.479> means

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
would be a better indicator kids means

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.040 
would be a better indicator kids means
that<00:04:36.520> it'll<00:04:37.520> be<00:04:37.610> hard<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:38.030> notice<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.720> follow

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
that it'll be hard to notice it follow

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.200 
that it'll be hard to notice it follow
the<00:04:39.229> car<00:04:39.440> behind<00:04:39.800> me<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.580> I<00:04:40.610> just<00:04:40.789> don't<00:04:41.030> want

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
the car behind me and I just don't want

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.020 
the car behind me and I just don't want
to<00:04:41.240> get<00:04:41.389> pulled<00:04:41.539> over<00:04:41.690> for<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.910> but<00:04:43.910> once

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
to get pulled over for that but once

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.189 
to get pulled over for that but once
again<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.330> just<00:04:44.360> kind<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:44.690> want<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.900> show<00:04:45.139> you

again I just kind of want to show you

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.210 
again I just kind of want to show you
