especially if you like to four-wheel

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.710 
especially if you like to four-wheel
drive<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.910> case<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.599> my

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
drive or as in the case of one of my

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.550 
drive or as in the case of one of my
customers<00:00:28.519> go<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> mud<00:00:30.090> um<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.320> first

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
customers go out in the mud um the first

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.840 
customers go out in the mud um the first
thing<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.949> say<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> clutch

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
thing I want to say is what a clutch

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.639 
thing I want to say is what a clutch
looks<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.360> most<00:00:33.960> people<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.260> never<00:00:34.350> seen

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
looks like most people have never seen

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.410 
looks like most people have never seen
one<00:00:34.829> they<00:00:35.040> actually<00:00:35.370> sit<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:35.850> in

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
one they actually sit right up in

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.520 
one they actually sit right up in
between<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> transmission<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.469> engine

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
between the transmission and the engine

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
between the transmission and the engine
and<00:00:37.980> basically<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.180> these<00:00:39.300> little

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and basically you have these little

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.330 
and basically you have these little
pressure<00:00:39.750> plates<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.500> can't<00:00:40.920> even<00:00:41.160> make<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
pressure plates here I can't even make a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.330 
pressure plates here I can't even make a
move<00:00:42.649> then<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.829> some<00:00:44.010> friction

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
move then you have some friction

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.220 
move then you have some friction
material<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> inside<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.110> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
material on the inside and this is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.020 
material on the inside and this is
actually<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.739> magic<00:00:47.160> stuff<00:00:47.460> okay<00:00:47.850> that's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
actually the magic stuff okay that's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.610 
actually the magic stuff okay that's
what<00:00:48.210> allows<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.870> shift<00:00:49.140> those<00:00:49.350> gears

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
what allows you to shift those gears

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.860 
what allows you to shift those gears
what<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> clutch<00:00:50.730> does<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.510> many<00:00:51.660> people

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
what a clutch does and what many people

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.630 
what a clutch does and what many people
don't<00:00:52.110> understand<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.340> clutch

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
don't understand is that a clutch

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.709 
don't understand is that a clutch
manually<00:00:54.539> engages<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.449> transmission<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
manually engages the transmission it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
manually engages the transmission it
allows<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> give<00:00:58.859> power<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> engine

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
allows you to give power from the engine

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.779 
allows you to give power from the engine
to<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> wheels<00:01:00.660> okay<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> your

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
to the wheels okay and so this is your

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.399 
to the wheels okay and so this is your
transmission<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.660> clutch<00:01:03.899> sits<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
transmission and the clutch sits on the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.770 
transmission and the clutch sits on the
end<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.640> between<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.180> transmission

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
end there in between the transmission

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.530 
end there in between the transmission
and<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.930> motor<00:01:07.310> now<00:01:08.310> when<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> clutch<00:01:09.240> isn't

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and the motor now when a clutch isn't

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.850 
and the motor now when a clutch isn't
working<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:09.960> that's<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> hear

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
working right that's when you hear

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580 
working right that's when you hear
people<00:01:10.979> talk<00:01:11.310> about<00:01:11.340> its<00:01:12.060> slipping<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.200> it's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
people talk about its slipping or it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.520 
people talk about its slipping or it's
not<00:01:13.740> um<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.640> staying<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.450> gear<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:15.960> maybe

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
not um you know staying in gear or maybe

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.679 
not um you know staying in gear or maybe
you<00:01:16.710> can't<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.640> gear<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.299> try<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> get

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you can't put it in gear you try to get

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.749 
you can't put it in gear you try to get
into<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.930> verse<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> gears<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:20.009> there<00:01:20.280> or

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
into a verse and the gears not there or

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.100 
into a verse and the gears not there or
maybe<00:01:20.970> you're<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.150> losing<00:01:21.420> power<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
maybe you're just losing power to the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.859 
maybe you're just losing power to the
wheels<00:01:22.320> well<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.369> happens<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.330> clutch

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
wheels well what happens is that clutch

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
wheels well what happens is that clutch
material<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.770> friction<00:01:26.250> material<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
material that friction material that I

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
material that friction material that I
told<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.479> important<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.290> wears<00:01:28.619> off

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
told you is so important it wears off

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.550 
told you is so important it wears off
you<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.640> how<00:01:29.820> thin<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> skinny<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you can see how thin and skinny the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.399 
you can see how thin and skinny the
material<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.549> these<00:01:32.640> edges<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.420> comparison

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
material is on these edges in comparison

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
material is on these edges in comparison
to<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.619> good<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> bad<00:01:35.909> ones

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
to this good one here and the bad ones

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
to this good one here and the bad ones
here<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.500> marred<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
here you can see it's all marred up and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300 
here you can see it's all marred up and
and<00:01:38.549> messed<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.409> causes<00:01:41.130> is

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and messed up and what that causes is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.520 
and messed up and what that causes is
that<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.610> no<00:01:41.820> longer<00:01:42.090> able<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.689> click<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that it's no longer able to click it in

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.539 
that it's no longer able to click it in
and<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.040> gear<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:44.939> shift<00:01:45.390> now

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
and out of gear when you shift now

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.160 
and out of gear when you shift now
another<00:01:47.549> symptom<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.630> see<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.020> this

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
another symptom that we can see on this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.630 
another symptom that we can see on this
clutch<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.829> see<00:01:50.070> how<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.369> kind<00:01:50.430> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
clutch you can see how it's kind of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.700 
clutch you can see how it's kind of
black<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> burned<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.140> material

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
black and burned on the on the material

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.120 
black and burned on the on the material
here<00:01:52.979> um<00:01:53.810> basically<00:01:54.810> what<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.009> I'll

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
here um basically what that is and I'll

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.980 
here um basically what that is and I'll
compare<00:01:56.520> them<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.780> that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
compare them for you here with that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.899 
compare them for you here with that
black<00:01:58.350> those<00:01:58.649> black<00:01:58.920> marks<00:01:58.950> are<00:01:59.520> what<00:01:59.790> we<00:01:59.880> call

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
black those black marks are what we call

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
black those black marks are what we call
hot<00:02:00.329> spots<00:02:00.840> that's<00:02:01.110> where<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> metals<00:02:01.680> gotten

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
hot spots that's where the metals gotten

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.190 
hot spots that's where the metals gotten
super<00:02:02.250> super<00:02:02.759> hot<00:02:03.000> when<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> clutch<00:02:03.960> was

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
super super hot when the clutch was

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.770 
super super hot when the clutch was
beginning<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.860> fail<00:02:05.159> oftentimes<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.600> will

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
beginning to fail oftentimes that will

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.020 
beginning to fail oftentimes that will
happen

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
happen

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.820 
happen
now<00:02:08.119> there's<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.600> couple<00:02:09.080> other<00:02:09.380> things<00:02:09.470> that

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
now there's a couple other things that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.370 
now there's a couple other things that
can<00:02:10.069> happen<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:10.850> know<00:02:10.970> mechanically<00:02:11.630> we

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
can happen to you know mechanically we

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.800 
can happen to you know mechanically we
can<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.550> clutch<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:13.940> bearing<00:02:14.600> came

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
can see this clutch is bearing came

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.059 
can see this clutch is bearing came
apart<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.560> see<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.860> little<00:02:15.980> pieces

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
apart and you can see the little pieces

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.340 
apart and you can see the little pieces
of<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:16.940> just<00:02:16.970> kind<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.360> came<00:02:17.540> apart<00:02:17.930> inside

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
of it it just kind of came apart inside

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.380 
of it it just kind of came apart inside
there<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.370> was<00:02:19.520> on<00:02:19.670> another<00:02:19.790> one<00:02:20.240> that

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
there and this was on another one that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.420 
there and this was on another one that
failed<00:02:20.660> as<00:02:20.930> well<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.620> clutch<00:02:21.830> material

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
failed as well the clutch material

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.090 
failed as well the clutch material
wasn't<00:02:22.760> quite<00:02:22.940> as<00:02:23.090> far<00:02:23.300> one<00:02:23.630> on<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.110> one<00:02:24.350> but

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
wasn't quite as far one on this one but

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.190 
wasn't quite as far one on this one but
we<00:02:25.220> certainly<00:02:25.550> have<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.239> hot<00:02:26.420> spots<00:02:26.810> again

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
we certainly have the hot spots again

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.500 
we certainly have the hot spots again
you<00:02:27.380> can<00:02:27.560> see<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.489> know<00:02:28.520> burning<00:02:29.150> marks

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
you can see that you know burning marks

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.180 
you can see that you know burning marks
from<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.750> clutch<00:02:30.319> material<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:30.980> up

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
from the clutch material going up

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.940 
from the clutch material going up
against<00:02:31.640> there<00:02:31.850> now<00:02:32.390> enough<00:02:33.350> of<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.590> boring

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
against there now enough of the boring

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.400 
against there now enough of the boring
stuff<00:02:34.100> let<00:02:34.520> me<00:02:34.640> tell<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:34.970> what<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.930> can<00:02:36.170> do

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
stuff let me tell you what you can do

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.160 
stuff let me tell you what you can do
okay<00:02:37.160> first<00:02:37.520> of<00:02:37.819> all<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.540> thing<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.900> need<00:02:39.080> to

okay first of all the thing you need to
realize<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.739> clutches<00:02:40.130> operate<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:40.970> fluid

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
realize is clutches operate with a fluid

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.350 
realize is clutches operate with a fluid
it's<00:02:41.660> called<00:02:41.930> hydraulic<00:02:42.590> fluid<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.459> whenever

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
it's called hydraulic fluid so whenever

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.050 
it's called hydraulic fluid so whenever
we<00:02:44.600> see<00:02:44.840> any<00:02:45.110> fluid<00:02:45.709> leak<00:02:45.920> from<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.280> car<00:02:46.550> it

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
we see any fluid leak from a car it

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.360 
we see any fluid leak from a car it
becomes<00:02:47.360> critical<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.110> make<00:02:48.320> sure<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:49.220> you

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
becomes critical to make sure that you

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.180 
becomes critical to make sure that you
find<00:02:49.670> out<00:02:49.850> what<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.330> fluid<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:51.320> repair

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190

fluids typically clear you can't really
tell<00:03:12.530> what<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.799> is<00:03:12.829> if<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.310> saw<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.640> dripping

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
tell what it is if you saw it dripping

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000 
tell what it is if you saw it dripping
it<00:03:14.120> would<00:03:14.239> look<00:03:14.390> like<00:03:14.450> water<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.440> if<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.650> felt

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
it would look like water but if you felt

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.640 
it would look like water but if you felt
it<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.400> would<00:03:16.549> be<00:03:16.670> slippery<00:03:17.209> like<00:03:17.510> oil<00:03:17.900> so

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
it it would be slippery like oil so

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.440 
it it would be slippery like oil so
that's<00:03:19.160> one<00:03:19.489> thing<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:19.970> really<00:03:20.090> want<00:03:20.390> to

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450
