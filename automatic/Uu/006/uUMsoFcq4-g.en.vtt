ground up I don't suppose you've ever

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.060 
ground up I don't suppose you've ever
put<00:02:22.490> this<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.730> scale<00:02:23.230> with<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.260> normal<00:02:24.680> praying

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
put this to scale with a normal praying

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.910 
put this to scale with a normal praying
mantis<00:02:25.400> never<00:02:25.760> know<00:02:26.660> no<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.050> know<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.770> there's

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
mantis never know no I know and there's

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.410 
mantis never know no I know and there's
not<00:02:28.070> i<00:02:28.100> should<00:02:28.430> say<00:02:28.700> there's<00:02:28.880> not<00:02:29.000> one<00:02:29.180> single

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
not i should say there's not one single

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420 
not i should say there's not one single
scale<00:02:29.900> for<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.290> show<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.800> know<00:02:30.890> there's<00:02:31.250> if

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
scale for the show you know there's if

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.060 
scale for the show you know there's if
there<00:02:31.610> was<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.660> ants<00:02:32.870> would<00:02:33.200> have<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.590> be<00:02:33.739> i

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
there was the ants would have to be i

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.490 
there was the ants would have to be i
mean<00:02:34.520> as<00:02:34.940> compared<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.930> ants<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.350> would

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
mean as compared to the ants this would

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.070 
mean as compared to the ants this would
have<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.650> be<00:02:36.739> 50<00:02:37.190> or<00:02:37.220> 70<00:02:37.790> feet<00:02:37.940> tall<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:38.959> it's

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
have to be 50 or 70 feet tall so it's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.240 
have to be 50 or 70 feet tall so it's
not<00:02:39.140> really<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.410> much<00:02:39.470> about<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.770> physical

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
not really so much about the physical

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.430 
not really so much about the physical
dimensions<00:02:40.670> as<00:02:40.850> is<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.300> presentation<00:02:41.840> yeah

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
dimensions as is the presentation yeah

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.890 
dimensions as is the presentation yeah
yeah<00:02:42.950> i<00:02:42.980> mean<00:02:43.190> i<00:02:43.280> mean<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.090> early<00:02:44.450> years<00:02:44.660> is

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
yeah i mean i mean in the early years is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.630 
yeah i mean i mean in the early years is
you<00:02:45.680> know<00:02:45.769> when<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:45.920> can't<00:02:46.160> be<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> first

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
you know when I can't be the first

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.420 
you know when I can't be the first
concept<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.380> thought<00:02:48.380> well<00:02:48.620> how<00:02:48.830> big<00:02:49.190> are<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
concept I thought well how big are the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.800 
concept I thought well how big are the
ants<00:02:49.700> going<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.910> be<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.269> because<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.600> have<00:02:50.720> to

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
ants going to be and because you have to

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.479 
ants going to be and because you have to
have<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.959> size<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.440> build<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.160> can't<00:02:52.370> just

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
have a size to build to you can't just

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.490 
have a size to build to you can't just
start<00:02:52.700> an<00:02:52.820> assembly<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.200> have<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.350> say

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
start an assembly in and you have to say

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.470 
start an assembly in and you have to say
well<00:02:54.650> how<00:02:54.709> big<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:55.730> if<00:02:55.850> its<00:02:56.000> twenty<00:02:56.150> feet

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
well how big is it so if its twenty feet

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.570 
well how big is it so if its twenty feet
how<00:02:57.170> big<00:02:57.350> is<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.590> head<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.950> 20<00:02:58.190> foot<00:02:58.340> and

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
how big is the head of a 20 foot and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.220 
how big is the head of a 20 foot and
that's<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.180> next<00:02:59.330> thing<00:02:59.450> all<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.870> I<00:02:59.900> didn't

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
that's the next thing all that I didn't

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.050 
that's the next thing all that I didn't
realize<00:03:00.590> these<00:03:00.769> things<00:03:00.830> as<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.220> can't<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.820> idea

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
realize these things as I can't the idea

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.449 
realize these things as I can't the idea
it<00:03:02.150> was<00:03:02.239> just<00:03:02.420> an<00:03:02.510> idea<00:03:02.920> we<00:03:03.920> start<00:03:04.130> building

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
it was just an idea we start building

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.370 
it was just an idea we start building
you<00:03:04.580> live<00:03:04.730> all<00:03:04.910> wait<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> minute<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.810> know<00:03:05.930> 20

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
you live all wait a minute you know 20

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.990 
you live all wait a minute you know 20
foot<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:06.769> how<00:03:06.950> big<00:03:07.130> is<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.310> head<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.489> have<00:03:07.820> no

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
foot in how big is the head I have no

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.520 
foot in how big is the head I have no
idea<00:03:08.180> how<00:03:08.600> do<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.870> how<00:03:09.079> do<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.200> figure<00:03:09.410> that

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
idea how do you how do you figure that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.949 
idea how do you how do you figure that
out<00:03:09.680> well<00:03:10.070> that's<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.850> fun<00:03:11.060> well<00:03:11.390> three<00:03:11.720> hands

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
out well that's the fun well three hands

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.509 
out well that's the fun well three hands
in<00:03:12.200> here<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.470> can't<00:03:12.500> see<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.010> third<00:03:13.220> one<00:03:13.250> back

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
in here you can't see the third one back

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.770 
in here you can't see the third one back
there<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.760> mean<00:03:13.880> there's<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.120> place<00:03:14.329> you<00:03:14.450> can<00:03:14.600> see

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
there I mean there's a place you can see

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.530 
there I mean there's a place you can see
all<00:03:14.810> three<00:03:15.140> book<00:03:15.670> but<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.700> consider<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.299> three

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
all three book but I consider the three

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.930 
all three book but I consider the three
to<00:03:17.660> be<00:03:17.780> one<00:03:18.049> sculpture<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.519> way<00:03:19.579> it<00:03:19.850> is

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
to be one sculpture so in that way it is

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.509 
to be one sculpture so in that way it is
the<00:03:20.090> largest<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:21.230> original<00:03:22.070> idea<00:03:22.280> for<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
the largest the original idea for the

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.240 
the largest the original idea for the
big<00:03:22.670> bug<00:03:22.850> started<00:03:23.420> with<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:24.170> first<00:03:24.320> subjects

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
big bug started with the first subjects

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.940 
big bug started with the first subjects
were<00:03:25.340> ants<00:03:25.579> mantis<00:03:26.410> dragonflies<00:03:27.410> spider<00:03:27.769> and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
were ants mantis dragonflies spider and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.270 
were ants mantis dragonflies spider and
web<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:30.170> they're<00:03:30.530> still<00:03:30.769> there<00:03:31.010> still

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
web and so they're still there still

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.610 
web and so they're still there still
like<00:03:31.760> really<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.269> key<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:33.140> me<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.470> key

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
like really the key to me the key

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.979 
like really the key to me the key
components<00:03:33.829> i<00:03:34.340> think<00:03:34.519> they<00:03:34.610> individually

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
components i think they individually

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.030 
components i think they individually
they<00:03:35.989> still<00:03:36.230> tell<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.560> story<00:03:36.799> of<00:03:36.829> the<00:03:36.920> big

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
they still tell the story of the big

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.850 
they still tell the story of the big
bugs<00:03:37.250> mm-hmm<00:03:38.110> it's<00:03:39.110> one<00:03:39.320> of<00:03:39.350> those<00:03:39.500> one<00:03:39.829> of

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
bugs mm-hmm it's one of those one of

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.190 
bugs mm-hmm it's one of those one of
those<00:03:39.980> things<00:03:40.220> we<00:03:40.549> get<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.880> go<00:03:41.720> into<00:03:41.900> all<00:03:42.170> the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
those things we get to go into all the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.280 
those things we get to go into all the
story<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.489> difference<00:03:43.820> between<00:03:44.290> insects

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
story of the difference between insects

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.180 
story of the difference between insects
and<00:03:45.410> arachnids<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:48.200> also<00:03:48.410> using<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.010> word
