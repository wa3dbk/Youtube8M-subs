calculators<00:00:14.549> really<00:00:14.969> work<00:00:15.179> hell<00:00:15.570> yeah<00:00:16.109> know

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
calculators really work hell yeah know

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.700 
calculators really work hell yeah know
what<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.220> um<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.060> vaguely<00:00:18.840> know<00:00:19.289> about<00:00:19.529> it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
what that is um I vaguely know about it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.290 
what that is um I vaguely know about it
because<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> part<00:00:20.250> always<00:00:20.520> uses<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
because the part always uses that to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.939 
because the part always uses that to
like<00:00:21.480> figure<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.900> where<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> should<00:00:22.320> be

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
like figure out where I should be

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.609 
like figure out where I should be
mm-hmm<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:24.150> I've<00:00:24.269> never<00:00:24.510> personally<00:00:24.900> used<00:00:25.500> it

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
mm-hmm but I've never personally used it

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.689 
mm-hmm but I've never personally used it
I<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.720> think<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.130> put<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.310> much<00:00:29.429> focus

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
I have and I think I put so much focus

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.060 
I have and I think I put so much focus
on<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.240> down<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.750> when<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> don't<00:00:31.619> hit<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
on it down like when I don't hit the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.260 
on it down like when I don't hit the
numbers<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> amount<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.940> reps<00:00:33.120> I'm

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
numbers of the amount of reps I'm

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.630 
numbers of the amount of reps I'm
supposed<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> I'm<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.110> fuck<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:35.340> weak

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
supposed to I'm just like fuck I'm weak

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.540 
supposed to I'm just like fuck I'm weak
okay<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> basic<00:00:37.079> ass<00:00:37.230> bitch<00:00:37.530> break<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
okay so I'm a basic ass bitch break it

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.450 
okay so I'm a basic ass bitch break it
down<00:00:38.700> very<00:00:39.180> elementary<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.260> me<00:00:40.350> me<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.250> right

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
down very elementary for me me all right

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
down very elementary for me me all right
so<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.000> wasn't<00:00:42.270> rep<00:00:42.570> calculators<00:00:43.140> ours

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so what wasn't rep calculators ours

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.260 
so what wasn't rep calculators ours
basically<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.040> instance<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> hit<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
basically for instance if you hit on the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.670 
basically for instance if you hit on the
bench<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.690> blue<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.590> thirty<00:00:46.860> five<00:00:48.680> thirty

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
bench like blue one thirty five thirty

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.080 
bench like blue one thirty five thirty
four<00:00:50.340> thirty<00:00:50.520> let's<00:00:51.030> say<00:00:51.210> hypothetically

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
four thirty let's say hypothetically

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.040 
four thirty let's say hypothetically
thirty<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> put<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> calculator

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
thirty you put it in the calculator

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.959 
thirty you put it in the calculator
whether<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.129> internet<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.879> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
whether it's on the internet or if you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.150 
whether it's on the internet or if you
get<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.600> an<00:00:57.719> app<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.620> tells<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.100> exactly

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
get a like an app it tells you exactly

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180 
get a like an app it tells you exactly
oh<00:00:59.789> because<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.449> hit<00:01:00.629> 135<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.590> thirty<00:01:01.829> times

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
oh because you hit 135 for thirty times

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.000 
oh because you hit 135 for thirty times
it<00:01:02.699> says<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.120> oh<00:01:03.300> you're<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.960> rep<00:01:04.199> max<00:01:04.439> will

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it says like oh you're one rep max will

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.780 
it says like oh you're one rep max will
be<00:01:05.600> 275<00:01:06.650> it<00:01:07.650> tells<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> what<00:01:08.250> your<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.610> rep

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
be 275 it tells you what your one rep

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
be 275 it tells you what your one rep
max<00:01:08.850> yeah<00:01:09.720> yeah<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.229> there's<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
max yeah yeah I think there's like a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
max yeah yeah I think there's like a
certain<00:01:11.369> amount<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> reps<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.659> ten

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
certain amount of reps I think like ten

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.510 
certain amount of reps I think like ten
or<00:01:13.140> eight<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> most<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:14.369> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
or eight is like the most on some of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.850 
or eight is like the most on some of
them<00:01:14.640> um<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.259> gives<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.650> an

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
them um and it just gives you like an

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
them um and it just gives you like an
approximate<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.640> some<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.090> are

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
approximate but some of these are are

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.830 
approximate but some of these are are
pretty<00:01:19.080> good<00:01:19.409> right<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.700> don't<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.299> me<00:01:21.420> cute

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840

stopped using that you got for me I

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.880 
stopped using that you got for me I
think<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.599> best<00:02:12.780> way<00:02:12.930> cuz<00:02:13.410> for

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
think it's just the best way cuz for

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.650 
think it's just the best way cuz for
instance<00:02:14.250> I'm<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.400> gonna<00:02:14.670> say<00:02:14.880> his<00:02:15.150> name<00:02:15.360> like

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
instance I'm not gonna say his name like

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.860 
instance I'm not gonna say his name like
that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.339 
that
Nadine<00:02:16.400> he<00:02:17.400> could<00:02:17.610> hit<00:02:17.790> 405<00:02:18.420> for<00:02:18.720> like<00:02:18.930> five

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
Nadine he could hit 405 for like five

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.250 
Nadine he could hit 405 for like five
times<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.069> squat<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:21.090> he'll<00:02:22.019> hit

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
times on the squat and then he'll hit

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.410 
times on the squat and then he'll hit
but<00:02:22.950> 500<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.610> 5<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:26.459> what<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.670> heck<00:02:26.819> why<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
but 500 for 5 so what the heck why is it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.110 
but 500 for 5 so what the heck why is it
your<00:02:27.690> 405<00:02:28.170> look<00:02:28.380> exactly<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.830> your<00:02:29.010> 500<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.090> I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
your 405 look exactly like your 500 so I

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640 
your 405 look exactly like your 500 so I
think<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:30.569> based<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.959> people<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:31.470> some

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
think it's based on people like some

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.500 
think it's based on people like some
people<00:02:31.920> reps<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.610> mean<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:32.819> think<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.299> good

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
people reps I mean I think it's a good

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.539 
people reps I mean I think it's a good
baseline<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:34.799> get<00:02:34.920> an<00:02:35.040> idea<00:02:35.370> where

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
baseline you can then get an idea where

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.229 
baseline you can then get an idea where
you're<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.569> way<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.720> kind<00:02:37.049> of<00:02:37.170> gauge

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
you're at and that way you kind of gauge

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.729 
you're at and that way you kind of gauge
your<00:02:39.239> one<00:02:39.540> rep<00:02:39.750> max<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.380> at<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.530> same

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
your one rep max but then at the same

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.770 
your one rep max but then at the same
time<00:02:40.799> like<00:02:41.250> let's<00:02:41.880> say<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.299> hit<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.510> one

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
time like let's say you do hit that one

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.809 
time like let's say you do hit that one
rep<00:02:42.959> max<00:02:43.080> based<00:02:43.350> off<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.590> calculator<00:02:44.069> if<00:02:44.670> you

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
rep max based off the calculator if you

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.220 
rep max based off the calculator if you
feel<00:02:45.090> good<00:02:45.299> then<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.600> pretty<00:02:45.720> smooth<00:02:46.080> you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
feel good then it's pretty smooth you

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.860 
feel good then it's pretty smooth you
could<00:02:46.350> push<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.799> maybe<00:02:46.950> go<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> little<00:02:47.430> more

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
could push it and maybe go a little more

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.350 
could push it and maybe go a little more
probably<00:02:48.870> not<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.200> actually<00:02:49.620> for<00:02:49.950> me<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:51.030> was

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
probably not I actually for me it was

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.240 
probably not I actually for me it was
wrong<00:02:51.569> really<00:02:52.140> yeah<00:02:52.410> cuz<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.739> said<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.040> like

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
wrong really yeah cuz it said like like

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.160 
wrong really yeah cuz it said like like
a<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.790> Santa<00:02:54.209> Barbara<00:02:54.569> oh<00:02:54.599> you<00:02:54.780> did<00:02:54.900> for<00:02:55.049> my

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
a like a Santa Barbara oh you did for my

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.500 
a like a Santa Barbara oh you did for my
budget<00:02:55.489> yeah<00:02:58.220> my<00:02:59.220> one<00:02:59.459> rep<00:02:59.640> max<00:02:59.820> I<00:03:00.060> put<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.359> my

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
budget yeah my one rep max I put in my

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.750 
budget yeah my one rep max I put in my
numbers<00:03:00.720> those<00:03:01.019> like<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.350> like<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.859> did<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> like

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
numbers those like and like I did a like

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.300 
numbers those like and like I did a like
a<00:03:02.790> max<00:03:03.239> rep<00:03:04.049> like<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.530> kind<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.769> seen<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.130> car

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
a max rep like I kind of seen the car

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.620 
a max rep like I kind of seen the car
let<00:03:05.609> me<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:05.790> how<00:03:05.940> many<00:03:06.000> times<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.329> can<00:03:06.420> hit<00:03:06.540> it

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
let me see how many times I can hit it

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.360 
let me see how many times I can hit it
for<00:03:06.750> reps<00:03:06.959> yeah<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.739> then<00:03:07.859> I<00:03:07.890> looked<00:03:08.100> at<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
for reps yeah and then I looked at the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.970 
for reps yeah and then I looked at the
calculator<00:03:08.820> oh<00:03:09.600> you're<00:03:09.989> one<00:03:10.290> rep<00:03:10.440> max<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.859> this

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
calculator oh you're one rep max is this

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.710 
calculator oh you're one rep max is this
most<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.340> dude<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.880> hit<00:03:12.060> more<00:03:12.420> than<00:03:12.480> that

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
most like dude I hit more than that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.840 
most like dude I hit more than that
before<00:03:13.079> yeah<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.010> think<00:03:14.130> there's<00:03:14.430> it's<00:03:14.760> a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
before yeah so I think there's it's a

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.099 
before yeah so I think there's it's a
little<00:03:15.060> bit<00:03:15.180> long<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.690> little<00:03:15.870> fluff

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
little bit long it's a little fluff

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.750 
little bit long it's a little fluff
that's<00:03:16.500> my<00:03:16.650> personal<00:03:16.980> opinion<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.609> you've

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
that's my personal opinion so you've

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.490 
that's my personal opinion so you've
never<00:03:18.030> used<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.329> no<00:03:18.660> I've<00:03:18.959> never<00:03:19.079> personally

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
never used that no I've never personally

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.470 
never used that no I've never personally
used<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.160> mark<00:03:20.340> has<00:03:20.519> used<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.820> on<00:03:20.940> me<00:03:21.120> all<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
used it mark has used it on me all the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.809 
used it mark has used it on me all the
time<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:22.380> okay<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.799> hit<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.459> hit<00:03:23.609> this

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
time like okay you hit it you hit this

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.789 
time like okay you hit it you hit this
amount<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.690> weight<00:03:24.810> for<00:03:25.019> X<00:03:25.200> amount<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.530> times

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
amount of weight for X amount of times

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.620 
amount of weight for X amount of times
he<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.519> then<00:03:26.670> he<00:03:26.700> like<00:03:26.970> calculus<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.510> he's

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
he and then he like calculus and he's

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.059 
he and then he like calculus and he's
like<00:03:27.750> okay<00:03:27.989> then<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.290> should<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.950> know

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
like okay then you should you know

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.580 
like okay then you should you know
theoretically<00:03:29.790> be<00:03:30.090> at<00:03:30.420> these<00:03:30.900> numbers<00:03:31.109> I

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
theoretically be at these numbers I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.349 
theoretically be at these numbers I
never<00:03:31.859> I<00:03:32.130> never<00:03:32.160> tell<00:03:32.549> myself<00:03:32.670> like<00:03:32.880> okay<00:03:33.239> this

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
never I never tell myself like okay this

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.300 
never I never tell myself like okay this
is<00:03:33.540> set<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.750> stone<00:03:34.079> so<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.920> be<00:03:35.040> this

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
is set in stone so I have to be this

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.500 
is set in stone so I have to be this
number<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.640> draw<00:03:35.850> off<00:03:35.970> like<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.269> gauge

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
number to draw off like that gauge

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.309 
number to draw off like that gauge
uh-huh<00:03:38.060> yes<00:03:39.060> you're<00:03:39.389> calculating<00:03:39.630> like<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
uh-huh yes you're calculating like the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.129 
uh-huh yes you're calculating like the
25<00:03:43.430> yes<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.700> never<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.630> focus<00:03:45.989> on<00:03:46.049> it

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
25 yes I I never like really focus on it

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.650 
25 yes I I never like really focus on it
too<00:03:46.230> much<00:03:46.380> it's<00:03:46.799> more<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.160> like<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:48.540> an

like that's where I should be
yeah<00:03:51.930> it's<00:03:52.139> mentally<00:03:52.560> for<00:03:52.799> me<00:03:52.920> like<00:03:53.130> there's

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
like this whole mental game that I just

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.949 
like this whole mental game that I just
prior<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.300> it<00:03:57.450> because<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.840> gives

amount of like tools and shit like that

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.270 
amount of like tools and shit like that
impossible<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.480> just<00:04:21.720> want<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.049> like<00:04:22.200> just<00:04:23.100> go

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
impossible I just want to like just go

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.770 
impossible I just want to like just go
for<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.730> just<00:04:23.820> want<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.150> write<00:04:24.300> my<00:04:24.450> numbers

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
for it I just want to write my numbers

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.300 
for it I just want to write my numbers
and<00:04:24.990> then<00:04:25.290> just<00:04:25.440> beat<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:25.680> number<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:26.220> I

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
and then just beat that number that I

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.650 
and then just beat that number that I
just<00:04:26.460> wrote<00:04:26.610> down<00:04:26.669> that's<00:04:27.090> that's<00:04:27.480> all

just wrote down that's that's all
basically<00:04:28.169> I<00:04:28.290> just<00:04:28.530> shouldn't<00:04:28.830> be<00:04:28.889> a<00:04:28.950> little

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
basically I just shouldn't be a little

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.830 
basically I just shouldn't be a little
bit<00:04:29.340> more<00:04:29.520> conservative<00:04:29.940> no<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.630> used<00:04:30.780> to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
bit more conservative no like I used to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.270 
bit more conservative no like I used to
be<00:04:30.960> like<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.229> like<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.350> hip<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:31.710> four

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
be like it's like a hip this four

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.129 
be like it's like a hip this four
triples<00:04:32.700> it<00:04:32.880> doubled<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.450> can<00:04:33.600> hit<00:04:33.690> hit

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
triples it doubled and I can hit hit

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.650 
triples it doubled and I can hit hit
this<00:04:34.350> for<00:04:34.680> like<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.700> single<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.210> know<00:04:36.330> but<00:04:36.540> now

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
this for like a single you know but now

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.020 
this for like a single you know but now
I<00:04:36.690> try<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:36.990> be<00:04:37.200> like<00:04:37.950> I'll<00:04:38.490> try<00:04:38.729> to<00:04:38.790> get<00:04:39.000> a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
I try to be like I'll try to get a

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.670 
I try to be like I'll try to get a
higher<00:04:39.270> rep<00:04:39.510> scheme<00:04:39.690> on<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.110> nigga<00:04:40.290> if<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.560> can

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
higher rep scheme on this nigga if I can

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.830 
higher rep scheme on this nigga if I can
hit<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.860> for<00:04:41.010> five<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.760> know<00:04:42.180> for<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.540> fact<00:04:42.600> I

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
hit this for five I know for a fact I

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.420 
hit this for five I know for a fact I
get<00:04:42.990> it<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.200> for<00:04:43.410> like<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.710> double<00:04:44.100> war<00:04:44.190> it's

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
get it this for like a double war it's

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.830 
get it this for like a double war it's
tingling<00:04:44.700> now<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.150> think<00:04:45.270> it's<00:04:45.510> not<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.690> new

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
tingling now I think it's not the new

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.780 
tingling now I think it's not the new
approach<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.229> have<00:04:46.260> now<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:47.070> a<00:04:47.160> good<00:04:47.340> tool<00:04:47.610> but

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
approach I have now it's a good tool but

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.310 
approach I have now it's a good tool but
I<00:04:47.820> think<00:04:48.060> when<00:04:48.210> one<00:04:48.660> of<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.840> mistakes<00:04:49.110> I've

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
I think when one of the mistakes I've

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.560 
I think when one of the mistakes I've
seen<00:04:49.560> people<00:04:49.860> do<00:04:50.010> is<00:04:50.130> like<00:04:50.280> oh<00:04:50.550> like<00:04:51.120> because

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
seen people do is like oh like because

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.030 
seen people do is like oh like because
they<00:04:51.750> put<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.169> kind<00:04:52.290> of<00:04:52.440> like<00:04:52.560> no<00:04:52.710> I've<00:04:52.860> hit

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
they put in the kind of like no I've hit

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.680 
they put in the kind of like no I've hit
it<00:04:53.070> before<00:04:53.280> it's<00:04:53.729> like<00:04:53.820> no<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.060> haven't<00:04:54.360> you

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
it before it's like no you haven't you

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.240 
it before it's like no you haven't you
don't<00:04:55.020> know<00:04:55.139> how<00:04:55.290> that<00:04:55.380> weight<00:04:55.590> feels<00:04:55.889> yeah

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
don't know how that weight feels yeah

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.350 
don't know how that weight feels yeah
but<00:04:56.490> they're<00:04:56.639> basing<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.210> off<00:04:57.450> that<00:04:58.250> yeah<00:04:59.360> yeah

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
but they're basing it off that yeah yeah

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.300 
but they're basing it off that yeah yeah
just<00:05:00.960> because<00:05:01.080> it's<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.530> tool<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.160> I<00:05:02.190> think

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
just because it's a tool so I think

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.980 
just because it's a tool so I think
people<00:05:02.669> should<00:05:03.030> use<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.300> as<00:05:03.479> a<00:05:03.510> tool<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:03.960> not

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
people should use it as a tool but not

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.930 
people should use it as a tool but not
say<00:05:04.380> like<00:05:04.590> all<00:05:04.740> right<00:05:05.070> like<00:05:05.250> oh<00:05:05.490> because<00:05:05.820> it's

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
say like all right like oh because it's

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.029 
say like all right like oh because it's
the<00:05:06.000> one<00:05:06.120> rub<00:05:06.330> calculator<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:07.020> me<00:05:07.200> or<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.800> could

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
the one rub calculator to me or I could

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.190 
the one rub calculator to me or I could
hit<00:05:08.160> this<00:05:08.310> number<00:05:08.640> I've<00:05:08.760> done<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.150> yes<00:05:09.390> I<00:05:09.600> set
