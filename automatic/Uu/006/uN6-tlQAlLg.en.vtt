00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.450
 Oracle wants to present training research 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.380
 probably the most compact training machine of our planet 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.999
 experience against the Slovenes on the 4th 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.140
 designed to have viruses 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.140
 men and women 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.480
 a minority for health customers 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.569
 the patented technique 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.250
 there were 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.870
 the ISU nature is 90 kg from Gulbis 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.230
 infinitely adjustable and the fronts can be used quickly 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.440
 So you always have enough practice resistance 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.800
 So they packed 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 here are some exercise two games 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.070
 like myself and shouted self govern here at the same time 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.050
 Shoulders and broad back muscles for a sporty woman shape 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.110
 Here is a special exercise in four corners of the sample back and the drain 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.090
 entire shoulder area 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.020
 Training for small or large circles for the important pectoral muscles 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.970
 a workout with duration of tension stimulated for thighs and abdomen 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.800
 Squats but reinforced by this generator 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.430
 save time 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.430
 and combine fun with success 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.400
 the ISE NATO trains them highly efficiently 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.610
 the cockpit of the machine prevents errors during training 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.190
 and the training map shows you how it works 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.720
 Take note of our 3 reader generator models 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 this is the standard model Classic 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.680
 here the model SpaceNet in the Looks execution 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.179
 a strong piece of space technology 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.679
 or experience up to 180 kilograms due to heavy rain 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.039
 secret speech 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.509
 if she wanted to know who 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.929
 visit us on our website 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:26.059
 challenge them
