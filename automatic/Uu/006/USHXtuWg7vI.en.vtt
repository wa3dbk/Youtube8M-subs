00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.129
 Trusts higher translated means Dr who's paved the way for Cross 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.460
 People who move athletically and swiftly over obstacles of any kind 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.479
 preferably in the middle of the city 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.109
 the whole is called Pack u 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.279
 We also found someone in Potsdam who prefers to hunt and act 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.279
 as comfortable runs in his rear wheel for us 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 cover the areas 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.189
 jumps from walls and helps Bengtson 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.029
 ASV has not led guides at Parkour Aigner 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.230
 For the 19-year-old, it was initially in first place a little clear majority 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.230
 a jump 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.850
 So the course for me on the one hand the sport of fun that meet 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.230
 the coaching team are happy 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.190
 Doing this makes it difficult to overcome what you still have to overcome 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.920
 easier to someone because what a value because 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.380
 Problems Micic overcome in Yemen 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.310
 a quarter to a half pro-western took seduction 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.060
 and also has the pros 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.980
 For about a year he finds several times a week spectators just can not find 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.430
 and that is very impressive for me and something else again 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.590
 as the normal sport 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.840
 completely different 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.750
 on buy one 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.510
 and spend extra space changing rooms 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.590
 This is not enormous in this jump on the big hill 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.060
 why there is no objection to the hifi system 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.020
 nor can he have a scrap of paper or not 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.620
 but what looks easy is hard work 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.620
 the sports scientists without title 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.780
 in extreme sports like climbing or popcorn the athlete of course 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.060
 special requirements he needs a lot of time on the one hand 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.030
 Strength endurance mobility 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.979
 On the other hand, there must be a certain mental condition 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:41.670
 bring 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.619
 a degree of risk-taking is very important, but he does 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.850
 has to control because of certain actions 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.750
 are very dangerous and therefore an increased injury caused them alarm 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.400
 so as not to hurt oneself as desired, everything went in time again more 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.190
 directed 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.190
 but what about the fear of hurting yourself? 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.480
 So you should fear in the Parcour Gaal "I think you should respect the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.190
 Obstacles arm full height of the two you jump 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.890
 as soon as you are afraid you should not actually make the jump 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.720
 should rather move to another day will know the problem too 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.979
 more 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.800
 since Robert Harting is a pro after a long discussion 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.119
 most 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.729
 So good was very nice I liked it very much 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:29.339
 I can still go and then he made himself big Sat 1 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.759
 the supreme judge 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.399
 a wish has been issued 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.409
 Trinity was under pressure from Gontard i-button
