00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
minute and then once you press f5 it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.040 
minute and then once you press f5 it
makes<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.880> beeping<00:00:30.210> sound<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.869> may<00:00:31.019> have

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
makes a beeping sound as you may have

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.049 
makes a beeping sound as you may have
heard<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:32.009> lights<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> screen<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
heard and it lights up the screen for a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
heard and it lights up the screen for a
second<00:00:33.450> as<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:34.230> does<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
second as it does this but this is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.410 
second as it does this but this is
because<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.460> editing<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> code<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
because it's editing the code and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.400 
because it's editing the code and
jaggers's<00:00:38.270> client-side<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.570> therefore

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
jaggers's client-side and therefore

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.930 
jaggers's client-side and therefore
enables<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.129> another<00:00:41.370> two<00:00:41.550> spins

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
enables you to get another two spins

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.869 
enables you to get another two spins
this<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.010> diocese<00:00:44.010> full<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> coding

this is a diocese full on the coding

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.959 
this is a diocese full on the coding

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
side and I don't think this will be

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.250 
side and I don't think this will be
around<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:48.270> long<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:48.510> they'll<00:00:48.870> patch<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
around for long because they'll patch it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
around for long because they'll patch it
pretty<00:00:49.739> soon<00:00:49.950> up<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.340> see<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.670> video<00:00:50.969> so

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
here you go squeal of fortune bypass and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.199 
here you go squeal of fortune bypass and
it's<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:18.410> putting<00:03:19.410> me<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.680> position<00:03:20.209> so

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209

it's just putting me in position so
we'll<00:03:21.690> just<00:03:21.900> wait<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.349> one<00:03:22.470> way<00:03:22.680> I'll<00:03:22.829> give

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
we'll just wait and one way I'll give

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.589 
we'll just wait and one way I'll give
you<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:23.099> description<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.639> what<00:03:23.790> virustotal<00:03:24.299> is

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
you a description of what virustotal is

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.360 
you a description of what virustotal is
so<00:03:25.500> basically<00:03:26.069> if<00:03:26.370> you're<00:03:26.700> unsure<00:03:26.849> of<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.269> file

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
so basically if you're unsure of a file

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.360 
so basically if you're unsure of a file
you<00:03:29.370> uploaded<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.880> virustotal<00:03:31.040> which<00:03:32.040> scans

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
you uploaded to virustotal which scans

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.940 
you uploaded to virustotal which scans
it<00:03:32.579> on<00:03:32.669> over<00:03:33.919> 43<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:35.489> maybe<00:03:36.450> even<00:03:36.660> more<00:03:36.950> anti

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
it on over 43 to maybe even more anti

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.050 
it on over 43 to maybe even more anti
viruses<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.730> then<00:03:39.540> from<00:03:39.900> there<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.349> some

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
viruses and then from there it some

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.099 
viruses and then from there it some
tells<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.180> if<00:03:42.269> only<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.569> antivirus<00:03:42.989> is

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
tells you if only the antivirus is

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.120 
tells you if only the antivirus is
picked<00:03:43.319> up<00:03:43.500> any<00:03:45.109> virus<00:03:46.109> kind<00:03:46.349> of<00:03:46.440> signatures<00:03:46.889> I

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
picked up any virus kind of signatures I

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.089 
picked up any virus kind of signatures I
guess<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.260> then<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.620> decide<00:03:49.650> if<00:03:49.950> you

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
guess and then you can decide if you

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.470 
guess and then you can decide if you
want<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.340> trust<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.639> program<00:03:51.000> or<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.389> it

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
want to trust the program or not and it

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.720 
want to trust the program or not and it
allows<00:03:51.720> groups<00:03:51.989> like<00:03:52.200> make<00:03:53.069> comments<00:03:53.489> as<00:03:53.609> well

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
allows groups like make comments as well

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.150 
allows groups like make comments as well
so<00:03:54.030> as<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.660> can<00:03:54.750> see<00:03:54.900> right<00:03:54.930> now<00:03:55.109> my<00:03:55.799> father<00:03:56.040> is

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
so as you can see right now my father is

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.930 
so as you can see right now my father is
being<00:03:56.340> analyzed<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:58.769> waiting<00:03:59.069> for<00:03:59.340> that

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
being analyzed and just waiting for that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.960 
being analyzed and just waiting for that
so<00:04:00.690> I'm<00:04:00.930> I'll<00:04:01.440> try<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.739> like

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
now people are normally scared if they

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.040 
now people are normally scared if they
have<00:04:26.950> a<00:04:26.980> virus<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.460> upload<00:04:27.730> to<00:04:27.760> virustotal<00:04:28.330> or

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
have a virus to upload to virustotal or

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.280 
have a virus to upload to virustotal or
if<00:04:29.230> their<00:04:29.560> programs<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.340> virus<00:04:30.610> because<00:04:31.050> if<00:04:32.050> he

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
if their programs a virus because if he

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.630 
if their programs a virus because if he
gets<00:04:32.500> detected<00:04:32.910> then<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.090> like<00:04:34.510> um<00:04:35.490> sends<00:04:36.490> out

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
gets detected then it like um sends out

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.820 
gets detected then it like um sends out
the<00:04:37.330> thing<00:04:37.600> to<00:04:37.810> all<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.020> other<00:04:38.140> anti<00:04:38.410> viruses

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
the thing to all the other anti viruses

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.290 
the thing to all the other anti viruses
so<00:04:38.980> that<00:04:39.130> they<00:04:39.280> have<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.610> pick<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:39.910> up<00:04:40.000> as<00:04:40.180> well

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
so that they have to pick it up as well

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.200 
so that they have to pick it up as well
so<00:04:40.830> basically<00:04:41.830> their<00:04:42.310> virus<00:04:42.640> will<00:04:42.820> get<00:04:42.970> picked

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
so basically their virus will get picked

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.470 
so basically their virus will get picked
up<00:04:43.420> but<00:04:44.350> if<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:45.040> like<00:04:45.610> me<00:04:45.820> I<00:04:45.850> have<00:04:46.150> nothing<00:04:46.330> to

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.930 
up but if I like me I have nothing to
hide<00:04:46.690> so<00:04:46.750> all<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.890> legit<00:04:48.220> YouTube<00:04:48.580> is<00:04:48.760> around
