00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.420 
back set it to the guitar level setting
and<00:03:40.840> then<00:03:41.140> we'll<00:03:41.170> play<00:03:41.410> our<00:03:41.530> part<00:03:41.740> we'll

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
and then we'll play our part we'll

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.890 
and then we'll play our part we'll
create<00:03:42.610> an<00:03:42.760> audio<00:03:43.030> track<00:03:43.209> for<00:03:43.420> our<00:03:43.540> guitar<00:03:43.780> to

now<00:03:46.450> we'll<00:03:46.630> need<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.810> make<00:03:46.959> sure<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.230> input

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
now we'll need to make sure the input

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.840 
now we'll need to make sure the input
for<00:03:47.680> this<00:03:47.770> track<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.220> assigned<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.580> input

panel now we have our EQ controls so we

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.860 
panel now we have our EQ controls so we
could<00:04:52.610> boost<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.970> highs<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.389> lows<00:04:53.600> if<00:04:53.780> we

could boost the highs of the lows if we

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.230 
could boost the highs of the lows if we
wanted<00:04:54.139> to<00:04:54.199> and<00:04:54.770> we<00:04:54.860> can<00:04:54.979> also<00:04:55.100> engage<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.789> 75

we've<00:04:59.930> got<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.110> track<00:05:00.380> created<00:05:00.740> in<00:05:00.830> queue<00:05:01.009> basis

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
we've got a track created in queue basis

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.800 
we've got a track created in queue basis
I've<00:05:01.490> assigned<00:05:01.729> it<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:01.940> input<00:05:02.270> number<00:05:02.509> three

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
I've assigned it to input number three

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:14.830 
I've assigned it to input number three
and<00:05:03.020> now<00:05:03.289> we<00:05:03.350> can<00:05:03.560> record

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.030 

so<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:15.990> is<00:05:16.080> how<00:05:16.170> easy<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.500> is<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.800> record

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
so this is how easy it is to record

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.620 
so this is how easy it is to record

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.670 
mix and whatever da W you might be using
now<00:05:21.240> we<00:05:21.300> can<00:05:21.510> continue<00:05:21.750> layering<00:05:22.080> more<00:05:22.380> tracks

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
now we can continue layering more tracks

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.200 
now we can continue layering more tracks
on<00:05:22.860> top<00:05:23.070> of<00:05:23.250> this<00:05:23.370> we<00:05:23.820> could<00:05:23.940> bring<00:05:24.120> in

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
on top of this we could bring in

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.880 
on top of this we could bring in
multiple<00:05:24.450> instruments<00:05:25.020> at<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.170> same<00:05:25.380> time<00:05:25.650> if

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
multiple instruments at the same time if

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.290 
multiple instruments at the same time if
we<00:05:25.980> have<00:05:26.070> two<00:05:26.220> or<00:05:26.340> three<00:05:26.370> background<00:05:26.940> singers

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
we have two or three background singers

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.400 
we have two or three background singers
we<00:05:27.420> could<00:05:27.540> give<00:05:27.660> them<00:05:27.810> each<00:05:27.930> a<00:05:28.020> microphone

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
we could give them each a microphone

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.050 
we could give them each a microphone
bring<00:05:28.680> them<00:05:28.800> in<00:05:28.950> separately<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:29.850> we<00:05:29.940> have<00:05:30.030> a

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
bring them in separately so we have a

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.610 
bring them in separately so we have a
lot<00:05:30.300> of<00:05:30.420> flexibility<00:05:30.990> using<00:05:31.290> that<00:05:31.440> input

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
lot of flexibility using that input

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.620 
lot of flexibility using that input
scheme<00:05:32.100> to<00:05:32.580> bring<00:05:32.670> up<00:05:32.850> to<00:05:32.970> four<00:05:33.180> tracks<00:05:33.450> at<00:05:33.570> a
