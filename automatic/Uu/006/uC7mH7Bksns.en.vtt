00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
two bins i have a bottom bin and what i

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.259 
two bins i have a bottom bin and what i
did<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.560> i<00:00:22.680> drilled<00:00:23.010> some<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.820> air<00:00:24.000> holes

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
did is i drilled some little air holes

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.240 
did is i drilled some little air holes
down<00:00:24.570> here<00:00:24.869> near<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.170> bottom<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:26.130> I've

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
down here near the bottom and then I've

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.380 
down here near the bottom and then I've
got<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:27.090> internal<00:00:27.869> bin<00:00:28.400> that's<00:00:29.400> smaller<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
got this internal bin that's smaller and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
got this internal bin that's smaller and
I've<00:00:30.480> got<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> sitting<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.529> something<00:00:31.949> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
I've got it sitting up on something so

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.340 
I've got it sitting up on something so
that<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.640> ball<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.390> liquid<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.960> drain

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that the ball the liquid can drain

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.200 
that the ball the liquid can drain
through<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> bottom<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.700> I've<00:00:35.820> done<00:00:36.000> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
through the bottom now what I've done is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.090 
through the bottom now what I've done is
I've<00:00:36.329> drilled<00:00:36.630> holes<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> bottom<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.920> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
I've drilled holes in the bottom of this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
I've drilled holes in the bottom of this
very<00:00:38.520> bottom<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.120> container<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.899> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
very bottom of this container so that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
very bottom of this container so that
the<00:00:40.260> excess<00:00:40.620> liquid<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.190> drain<00:00:41.399> drain

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the excess liquid can drain drain

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.959 
the excess liquid can drain drain
through<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.860> as<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.610> always

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
through and as you can see I always

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.090 
through and as you can see I always
leave<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.690> lid<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.739> see<00:00:46.770> how

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
leave like the lid like this you see how

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
leave like the lid like this you see how
it's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.370> skewed<00:00:47.969> now<00:00:48.809> people<00:00:49.110> are

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it's a little skewed now people are

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
it's a little skewed now people are
worried<00:00:49.710> about<00:00:49.800> worms<00:00:50.129> escaping<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.360> I

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
worried about worms escaping actually I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.760 
worried about worms escaping actually I
find<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.170> put<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> lid<00:00:52.739> down<00:00:52.879> tight<00:00:54.770> like

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
find if I put the lid down tight like

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.939 
find if I put the lid down tight like
most<00:00:56.010> people<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.149> worms<00:00:57.530> crawl<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.739> all

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
most people do the worms crawl up all

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.189 
most people do the worms crawl up all
over<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> lids<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.000> all<00:01:00.149> over<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.539> sides<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
over the lids and all over the sides and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.930 
over the lids and all over the sides and
it<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.530> gets<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:01.890> gross<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.489> nasty<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
it just gets really gross and nasty and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.149 
it just gets really gross and nasty and
you<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> worms<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.199> trying<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:05.010> out

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you know the worms are trying to get out

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
you know the worms are trying to get out
of<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> leave<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.270> look

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
of there because if you leave it look

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.940 
of there because if you leave it look
slightly<00:01:07.200> eschewed<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:09.950> more

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
slightly eschewed like this more

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.710 
slightly eschewed like this more
ventilation<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.909> them<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.330> tend<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
ventilation for them and they tend to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.789 
ventilation for them and they tend to
not<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.799> now

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
not want to get out so this is it now

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.520 
not want to get out so this is it now
that<00:01:17.310> ticks<00:01:17.610> I've<00:01:18.479> seen<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.170> many<00:01:19.200> different

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
that ticks I've seen so many different

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.510 
that ticks I've seen so many different
ways<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:21.020> doing<00:01:22.020> worm<00:01:22.439> bins<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.250> digging

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
ways of doing worm bins you know digging

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520 
ways of doing worm bins you know digging
a<00:01:23.729> hole<00:01:23.759> every<00:01:24.360> day<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.900> every<00:01:24.930> couple<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.470> days

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
a hole every day or every couple of days

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 
a hole every day or every couple of days
and<00:01:25.920> something<00:01:26.159> saving<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> compost<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and something saving up the compost and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.749 
and something saving up the compost and
throwing<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.799> well

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
throwing it in and what have you well

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
throwing it in and what have you well
instead<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.900> dig<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> big<00:01:31.409> trench

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
instead what I do is I dig a big trench

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.249 
instead what I do is I dig a big trench
and<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.250> push<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> soil<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.930> side

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and I push all the soil up on one side

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.319 
and I push all the soil up on one side
and<00:01:34.560> then<00:01:34.979> what<00:01:35.159> I've<00:01:35.280> done<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.820> I've<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and then what I've done is I've got a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.550 
and then what I've done is I've got a
piece<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.630> cardboard<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:39.110> look<00:01:40.110> how<00:01:40.259> those

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
piece of cardboard and look how those

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770 
piece of cardboard and look how those
worms<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.130> under<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:41.820> love<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
worms and under there they just love the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.600 
worms and under there they just love the
cardboard<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.130> I've<00:01:44.220> done<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
cardboard and then what I've done is

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.100

and<00:03:46.370> then<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.090> just<00:03:47.300> have<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.480> little<00:03:47.630> mortar<00:03:47.989> and

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
and then I just have a little mortar and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.680 
and then I just have a little mortar and
pestle<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:48.620> I<00:03:48.680> just<00:03:48.890> grind<00:03:49.160> them<00:03:49.280> up<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.730> so

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
pestle and I just grind them up and so

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.780 
pestle and I just grind them up and so
now<00:03:51.050> what<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.290> does<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:52.190> not<00:03:52.459> only<00:03:52.640> gives

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
now what that does that not only gives

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.210 
now what that does that not only gives
the<00:03:53.239> worms<00:03:53.450> calcium<00:03:54.200> which<00:03:54.440> helps<00:03:54.830> them<00:03:54.980> with

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
the worms calcium which helps them with

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.670 
the worms calcium which helps them with
reproduction<00:03:56.000> but<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.810> gives<00:03:56.930> them<00:03:57.080> some<00:03:57.320> grit

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
reproduction but it gives them some grit

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.949 
reproduction but it gives them some grit
so<00:03:58.100> they're<00:03:59.060> like<00:03:59.180> chickens<00:03:59.630> they<00:03:59.810> have

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
so they're like chickens they have

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.840 
so they're like chickens they have
gizzards<00:04:00.320> they<00:04:00.470> don't<00:04:00.650> have<00:04:00.800> teeth<00:04:01.070> but<00:04:01.730> they

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
gizzards they don't have teeth but they

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.350 
gizzards they don't have teeth but they
have<00:04:01.970> gizzards<00:04:02.420> just<00:04:02.720> like<00:04:02.900> birds<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.940> that's

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
have gizzards just like birds and that's

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.930 
have gizzards just like birds and that's
how<00:04:05.540> they<00:04:05.690> grind<00:04:06.290> up<00:04:06.530> their<00:04:06.769> food<00:04:07.070> once<00:04:07.700> they

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
how they grind up their food once they

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.410 
how they grind up their food once they
eat<00:04:08.900> it<00:04:09.050> is<00:04:09.640> so<00:04:10.640> that<00:04:10.820> just<00:04:11.030> gives<00:04:11.090> them<00:04:11.360> a

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
eat it is so that just gives them a

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.280 
eat it is so that just gives them a
little<00:04:11.450> bit<00:04:11.780> of<00:04:11.870> grit<00:04:12.140> as<00:04:12.320> well<00:04:12.560> as

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
little bit of grit as well as

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.770 
little bit of grit as well as
some<00:04:13.560> calcium<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.489> help<00:04:14.700> them<00:04:14.849> too<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.659> what

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
some calcium to help them too so what

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.340 
some calcium to help them too so what
I'll<00:04:15.870> do<00:04:16.109> is<00:04:16.139> you<00:04:16.650> know<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:17.310> doesn't<00:04:18.000> smell<00:04:18.350> you

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
I'll do is you know it doesn't smell you

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.420 
I'll do is you know it doesn't smell you
don't<00:04:19.530> see<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.739> whole<00:04:19.919> bunch<00:04:19.949> of<00:04:20.220> fruit<00:04:20.400> flies

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
don't see a whole bunch of fruit flies

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.050 
don't see a whole bunch of fruit flies
or<00:04:20.910> anything<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.989> know<00:04:22.669> you<00:04:23.669> would<00:04:23.789> think<00:04:23.940> it

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
or anything you know you would think it

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.939 
or anything you know you would think it
would<00:04:24.210> be<00:04:24.360> kind<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.780> nasty<00:04:25.169> just<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.770> leave<00:04:25.889> it

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
would be kind of nasty just to leave it

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.150 
would be kind of nasty just to leave it
like<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.220> but<00:04:26.729> and<00:04:27.240> then<00:04:27.389> about<00:04:27.979> once<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.130> week

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
like this but and then about once a week

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.719 
like this but and then about once a week
or<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:29.729> I<00:04:29.820> put<00:04:30.030> something<00:04:30.389> that's<00:04:30.690> kind<00:04:31.020> of

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
or if I put something that's kind of

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.640 
or if I put something that's kind of
really<00:04:32.810> decomposing<00:04:33.810> quick<00:04:34.050> like<00:04:34.289> you<00:04:34.530> know

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
really decomposing quick like you know

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.409 
really decomposing quick like you know
some<00:04:34.919> rotting<00:04:35.280> bananas<00:04:35.430> or<00:04:35.970> something<00:04:36.270> then

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
some rotting bananas or something then

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.100 
some rotting bananas or something then
I'll<00:04:36.539> cover<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.110> up<00:04:37.350> right<00:04:37.620> away<00:04:37.770> but

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
I'll cover it up right away but

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.719 
I'll cover it up right away but
otherwise<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.530> just<00:04:40.770> leave<00:04:40.949> it<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.220> this<00:04:41.250> and

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
otherwise I just leave it like this and

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.520 
otherwise I just leave it like this and
I<00:04:41.880> don't<00:04:42.090> shut<00:04:42.449> it<00:04:42.509> completely<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.110> i<00:04:43.229> think

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
I don't shut it completely and i think

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.400 
I don't shut it completely and i think
that<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.850> secret<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.449> I've<00:04:45.599> discovered<00:04:46.050> is

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
that the secret that I've discovered is

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.550 
that the secret that I've discovered is
if<00:04:47.099> I<00:04:47.250> don't<00:04:47.580> shut<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.060> completely<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.020> leave

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
if I don't shut it completely and leave

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.900 
if I don't shut it completely and leave
these<00:04:49.800> little<00:04:50.220> air<00:04:50.550> gaps<00:04:51.560> it<00:04:52.560> doesn't<00:04:53.520> go<00:04:53.639> into

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
these little air gaps it doesn't go into

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.730 
these little air gaps it doesn't go into
a<00:04:54.300> neuro<00:04:54.740> anaerobic<00:04:55.849> decomposition<00:04:57.320> which<00:04:58.320> is

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
a neuro anaerobic decomposition which is

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.969 
a neuro anaerobic decomposition which is
the<00:04:59.070> smelly<00:04:59.460> composition<00:05:00.979> decomposition

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
the smelly composition decomposition

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.999 
the smelly composition decomposition
sorry<00:05:02.250> about<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:03.530> correct<00:05:04.530> me<00:05:04.620> if<00:05:04.740> I'm

yeah and the other thing too is when

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.469 
yeah and the other thing too is when
dealing<00:05:14.130> with<00:05:14.280> worms<00:05:14.610> you<00:05:14.849> don't<00:05:15.180> want

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
dealing with worms you don't want

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.710 
dealing with worms you don't want
anything<00:05:15.840> pokey<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:17.340> prefer<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.120> use<00:05:18.389> something

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
anything pokey I prefer to use something

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.360 
anything pokey I prefer to use something
like<00:05:18.900> this<00:05:19.139> you<00:05:19.320> can<00:05:19.470> see<00:05:19.650> how<00:05:19.770> big<00:05:19.949> the<00:05:20.099> times

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
like this you can see how big the times

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.640 
like this you can see how big the times
are<00:05:20.900> they're<00:05:21.900> not<00:05:22.050> going<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.260> hurt<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.500> worms

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
are they're not going to hurt the worms

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.240 
are they're not going to hurt the worms
whereas<00:05:23.070> if<00:05:23.220> you<00:05:23.370> use<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.610> trowel<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:26.130> have

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
whereas if you use a trowel you have

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.980 
whereas if you use a trowel you have
those<00:05:26.400> sharp<00:05:26.699> edges<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.240> you're<00:05:27.360> digging<00:05:27.599> in

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
those sharp edges and you're digging in

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.040 
those sharp edges and you're digging in
you<00:05:28.380> can<00:05:28.680> easily<00:05:29.010> cut<00:05:29.490> worms<00:05:29.669> in<00:05:29.940> half<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:30.990> you

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
you can easily cut worms in half so you

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.710 
you can easily cut worms in half so you
know<00:05:31.320> what<00:05:31.830> I'll<00:05:31.949> do<00:05:32.220> is<00:05:32.490> I'll<00:05:32.520> just<00:05:33.060> take<00:05:33.659> a

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
know what I'll do is I'll just take a

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.200 
know what I'll do is I'll just take a
little<00:05:33.930> bit<00:05:34.139> of<00:05:34.199> the<00:05:34.440> stuff<00:05:35.430> off<00:05:35.669> of<00:05:35.699> the<00:05:35.940> side

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
little bit of the stuff off of the side

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.390 
little bit of the stuff off of the side
and<00:05:36.599> cover<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.139> up<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.530> little<00:05:37.680> bit<00:05:37.800> you<00:05:38.370> know

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
and cover it up a little bit you know

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.000
