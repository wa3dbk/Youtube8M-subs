we brought several remote cameras which
are<00:01:38.000> motion<00:01:38.540> activated<00:01:38.660> like<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:39.500> one<00:01:39.710> this

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
are motion activated like this one this

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.400 
are motion activated like this one this
time<00:01:40.479> we're<00:01:41.479> hoping<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.899> get<00:01:42.020> some<00:01:42.259> more

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
time we're hoping to get some more
