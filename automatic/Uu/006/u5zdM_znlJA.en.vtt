00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
the comma gumball I noticed how the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.600 
the comma gumball I noticed how the
workouts<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.050> could<00:01:39.200> never<00:01:39.350> gate<00:01:39.710> how<00:01:40.400> heavy

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
the ball is going to be because the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.680 
the ball is going to be because the
water<00:01:42.410> in<00:01:42.980> there<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.730> transitions<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.510> lot

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
water in there and it transitions a lot

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.270 
water in there and it transitions a lot
so<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.080> makes<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.410> have<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.590> use<00:01:45.860> them<00:01:46.040> out<00:01:46.160> of

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280
