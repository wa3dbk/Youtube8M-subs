 [Music] 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.560
 Hello guys! I've just learned about a dog named Chaseer. (Cheeser) is a herding dog, 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.180
 It has a vocabulary of more than a thousand words, the same as a child of four. 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.960
 But what makes Chaseer exceptional is that they can distinguish between name and deed. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.800
 Pick up your lips. Come on! Well done, well done. 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.800
 Mays pregnancy, jealousy O (Cheser). Well done! 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.520
 "Nose on ABC, nose on ABC". "Well done, well done!" 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.120
 This is (Oliver). (Oliver), do you think you're smarter than Chase? What do you think? 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.500
 Yes, let's go to find out. Come on! 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.360
 Take your jacket. Where is your jacket? 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.760
 Take your glory. Where is your greatness? No, this is your gift. 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.620
 Where is your greatness? Your greatness, your greatness. Both. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.360
 I found your bone? where is she? Well, perhaps Oliver is not good at this particular test. 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.220
 But the fact that we tried to communicate with dogs, 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.410
 And that they communicate with us in return, means that the human relationship with the dog is very special. 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.980
 Who is the best boy? 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.700
 I was known for my ability to talk to little dogs. 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.740
 (Talk of Children) 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.180
 Or a lot. 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.160
 (Talk of children) 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.960
 It is hard to tell if they are responding to words, or just to the emotions that are in my voice. 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.970
 Or the fact that I seem silly. One recent study suggests that both things happen, or three. 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.720
 Researchers at the University of Sussex have made loudspeakers of loudspeakers on both sides of the dog. 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.960
 When dogs heard abstract orders from their emotional context, they turned their heads to the right, 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.690
 Indicating that they are treating the verbal meaning in their left hemisphere. 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.600
 When they heard the emotional tone in the voice, but the words were mixed, 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.290
 They turned their heads to the left, suggesting that the processing of emotional sounds occurs in the right hemisphere. 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.709
 These experiments show that dogs can separate word meanings from their emotional significance. 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.959
 But how much information has been received from both? 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.390
 When I ask my dog, "Do you want to go for a walk?" It does not handle reality 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.980
 For the purpose of the sentence in our own way, such as "Mmm, let me see, do I really want to go now? 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.970
 And exercise some exercises? Maybe I'm not in the right mood today? 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.150
 I mean, I'm a dog, what does it mean to want something? " 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.180
 Like the quality of dogs in dealing with words, and in many of our interactions, there are probably a lot of "smart Hans" in the stadium. 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.020
 In the early 1900s it was said about a horse named Hans He 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.020
 Capable of solving simple mathematical equations by clicking with a hoop to represent numbers. 2 + 3? 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.660
 Smart horse! Despite their recent discovery that Hans could not practice mathematics at all, he just was 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.580
 Responding to small hints from his trainers, perhaps the expressions of their face are shrinking 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.510
 When approaching the correct answer, or perhaps a loud buzzer when he clicks the correct number. 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.880
 Hans Smart explains that while we believe that language is something we experience primarily through our ears, 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.940
 We communicate meaning using methods more than just audio frequencies. 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.380
 In his book "Expression of Emotions in Human and Animal" 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.440
 That the way we express and explain our feelings evolved from animals, 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.980
 And that our ability to recognize fear, happiness, and sadness, even between species, is a public and fungal ability. 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.790
 It is something we are born with. 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.410
 Scientists are still debating whether Darwin is right or not, but recent research suggests 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.650
 We share a distinctive kind of emotional intuition with our dog companions. 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.660
 The dog is the only animal outside the order of primate who can make eye contact with the human, 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.910
 Their predecessors were wolves, even their forebears, and although they were very genetically close to hybridization with dogs, 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.360
 They will not look into our eyes, which is why it is never possible to trust a wolf 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.310
 "How do I do?" 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.610
 When reading the emotions of others, we tend to look in a disproportionate and involuntary way 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.959
 To the right side of their faces. Dogs share this phenomenon called left bias 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.819
 But it only occurs when you look at the human face, not when looking at the faces of other dogs. 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.919
 They seem to be genuinely trying to understand what we are telling them and what they mean. 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.979
 We seem to understand them too, or at least think we understand. The researchers tested in Hungary 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.249
 The ability of people to interpret the meaning of barking recorded for dogs, they discovered that many 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.150
 Of people can actually talk to dogs. 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.760
 What does this bark mean? 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.760
 Well, this dog is angry, this is fairly easy. 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.180
 What about this bark? 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:05:01.419
 "Do you want to go hiking?" Well, this dog wants to go for a walk. 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:08.259
 another one. 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.420
 I have no idea what this means! 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.520
 If you think about this, this communication language between humans and dogs is very logical. We have been involved in evolution. 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.240
 With these organisms for the last 10,000 years. We have made them wolves 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.650
 To our hands, our minds, and our voice. 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.729
 Even if we do not understand each other well, well, they are always here to listen to us, 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.449
 This is the true meaning of the best friend. Is not that right, my friend? 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.249
 (Phone ring) 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:36.920
 Give me back. Sorry. 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.540
 Hi? Ah, yes, of course. it's yours 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.880
 "Hello? Oliver talks." "Hi, you have a dog" 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.380
 "Oh, hello Luna!" "Have you seen Venice recently?" "She's been out for hours! 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.400
 I miss her. "" Oh oh " 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.180
 Mm, thanks for Luna! If you want to find out more about dog behavior, go directly to BrainCraft 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.129
 And find out if they really miss us when we leave. Stay curious 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.520
 Good boy, oh, and special thanks to Oliver 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
