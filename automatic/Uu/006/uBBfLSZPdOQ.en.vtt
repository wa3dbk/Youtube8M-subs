00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
words that you purchase there's a really

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.299

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

actually<00:00:53.640> place<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.210> down<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> lot<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
actually place it down I see a lot of

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.840 
actually place it down I see a lot of
players<00:00:55.680> make<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.129> mistake<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.670> some

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
players make this mistake for some

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.279 
players make this mistake for some
reason<00:00:57.149> where<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.360> purchase<00:00:57.719> award<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
reason where they purchase award and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
reason where they purchase award and
then<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> next<00:00:58.920> five<00:00:59.190> minutes<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.640> just

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
then for the next five minutes they just

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.849 
then for the next five minutes they just
never<00:00:59.910> place<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.469> trick<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
never place it down just one trick you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.619 
never place it down just one trick you
can<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.399> guess<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.879> when<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.359> ward

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
can do I guess is that when you ward

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
can do I guess is that when you ward
when<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.199> purchase<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> ward<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.250> you're

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
when you purchase the ward as you're

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130 
when you purchase the ward as you're
walking<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.150> lane<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.930> tell

winter<00:01:16.770> ward<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.610> anyway<00:01:18.119> let's<00:01:18.360> take<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> look

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
winter ward but anyway let's take a look

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
winter ward but anyway let's take a look
at<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> highlight<00:01:19.259> video<00:01:19.560> alright<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
at the highlight video alright so I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.219 
at the highlight video alright so I
think<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.240> biggest<00:01:21.479> problems<00:01:22.049> is

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
think one of your biggest problems is

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
think one of your biggest problems is
that<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.310> never<00:01:23.490> place<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:24.000> wards

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that you just never place your wards

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.539 
that you just never place your wards
which<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.140> pretty<00:01:25.409> important<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.310> notice

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
which is pretty important and I notice

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
which is pretty important and I notice
just<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.210> some<00:01:27.360> reason<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> lot<00:01:28.080> of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
just a lot for some reason like a lot of

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.840

now this is obviously also going to take

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.559 
now this is obviously also going to take
a<00:02:38.950> long<00:02:39.190> time<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.489> learn<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:40.329> really

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
a long time to learn but it's really

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.789 
a long time to learn but it's really

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
if no one's calling the shots then you

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.100 
if no one's calling the shots then you
have<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.730> step<00:02:45.970> up<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.299> be<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.420> person<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.870> do

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
a very long time to fix but positioning

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.320 
a very long time to fix but positioning
especially<00:05:31.280> on<00:05:31.370> champions<00:05:31.760> like<00:05:31.910> azir

important<00:05:35.470> let's<00:05:36.470> take<00:05:36.620> a<00:05:36.650> look<00:05:36.800> at<00:05:36.890> this

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
important let's take a look at this

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.220 
important let's take a look at this
example<00:05:37.160> first<00:05:37.640> so<00:05:38.390> right<00:05:38.750> now<00:05:38.780> you<00:05:38.990> either

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
example first so right now you either

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.490 
example first so right now you either
have<00:05:39.470> a<00:05:39.500> choice<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:40.180> going<00:05:41.180> in<00:05:41.450> with<00:05:42.020> your<00:05:42.260> e

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
have a choice of going in with your e

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.680 
have a choice of going in with your e
because<00:05:43.130> you're<00:05:43.520> too<00:05:43.790> far<00:05:44.000> away<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.210> land<00:05:44.540> your

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
because you're too far away to land your

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.080 
because you're too far away to land your
W<00:05:45.230> and<00:05:45.320> Q<00:05:45.560> on<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.430> simoom<00:05:46.669> so<00:05:46.880> you<00:05:46.940> would<00:05:47.060> have

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
W and Q on the simoom so you would have

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.750 
W and Q on the simoom so you would have
to<00:05:47.240> eat<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:47.840> then<00:05:48.110> W<00:05:48.500> again<00:05:48.740> and<00:05:48.919> Q<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.580> so

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
to eat and then W again and Q and so

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.240 
to eat and then W again and Q and so
forth<00:05:50.060> but<00:05:50.840> instead<00:05:51.440> you<00:05:51.650> just<00:05:51.710> decide<00:05:52.100> to

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
forth but instead you just decide to

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.950 
forth but instead you just decide to
stay<00:05:52.460> in<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.640> back<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.090> not<00:05:53.210> do<00:05:53.479> that<00:05:53.660> and

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
stay in the back and not do that and

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.710 
stay in the back and not do that and
then<00:05:54.530> instead<00:05:55.010> you<00:05:55.580> just<00:05:55.610> you<00:05:56.030> see<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.360> victor

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
then instead you just you see the victor

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.630 
then instead you just you see the victor
and<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.260> just<00:05:57.410> kind<00:05:57.620> of<00:05:57.650> hesitate<00:05:58.160> and<00:05:58.370> then

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640

he<00:05:58.790> flashes<00:05:59.150> away<00:05:59.300> and<00:06:00.080> so<00:06:00.410> now<00:06:00.530> you<00:06:00.590> kind<00:06:00.830> of

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
he flashes away and so now you kind of

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.680 
he flashes away and so now you kind of
start<00:06:01.520> running<00:06:01.760> backwards<00:06:02.240> which<00:06:02.330> is<00:06:02.479> good
