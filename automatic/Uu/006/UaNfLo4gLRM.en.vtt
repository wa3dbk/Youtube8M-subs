00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
they're kind of fat and I think the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.319

this<00:01:33.810> little<00:01:33.960> fat<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:34.950> is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
this little fat so what you can do is

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.440 
this little fat so what you can do is
you'll<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.430> able<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.640> stir<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.060> easier

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
with all the ice moving around so that's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.280 
with all the ice moving around so that's
good<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.909> pretty<00:01:39.150> heavy<00:01:39.270> duty<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.170> we'll

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
good it's pretty heavy duty to and we'll

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.499 
good it's pretty heavy duty to and we'll
use<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> julep<00:01:40.860> strainer<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.850> strain<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.390> ice

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
too low now let's go see kind of come in

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.550 
too low now let's go see kind of come in
yellow<00:03:36.650> yellowness<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.919> it<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:40.049> ice<00:03:40.199> queens

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
yellow yellowness to it so ice queens

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:54.310 
yellow yellowness to it so ice queens
are<00:03:40.709> yellow<00:03:44.419> blue<00:03:45.419> I<00:03:46.519> don't<00:03:47.519> know<00:03:47.579> about<00:03:47.669> that

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.470 

we<00:03:55.320> go<00:03:55.580> what<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.730> will<00:03:56.850> do<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.000> you'll<00:03:57.210> notice

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
we go what that will do is you'll notice

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.580 
we go what that will do is you'll notice
some<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.810> ice<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.080> already<00:03:58.230> kind<00:03:58.500> of

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
some of the ice is already kind of

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.260 
some of the ice is already kind of
melting<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.980> little<00:03:59.010> just<00:03:59.580> enough<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.880> dilute

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
melting a little just enough to dilute

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.880 
melting a little just enough to dilute
it<00:04:00.450> chill<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.500> get<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.710> right<00:04:01.860> balance

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
it chill it so you get the right balance

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.920 
it chill it so you get the right balance
of<00:04:02.280> ice<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.790> but<00:04:03.210> do<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:03.540> about<00:04:03.630> 30

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
of ice and you but do this about 30

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.220 
of ice and you but do this about 30
seconds<00:04:05.270> you've<00:04:06.270> got<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.420> nice<00:04:06.570> balance<00:04:07.020> of<00:04:07.080> ice

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
seconds you've got a nice balance of ice

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.390 
seconds you've got a nice balance of ice
a<00:04:07.740> little<00:04:07.860> pineapple<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.430> there<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.790> then<00:04:10.400> use

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
a little pineapple on there and then use

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.450 
a little pineapple on there and then use
that<00:04:11.430> later<00:04:12.290> we'll<00:04:13.290> strain<00:04:13.770> that<00:04:13.920> right<00:04:14.280> off

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
that later we'll strain that right off

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.320 
that later we'll strain that right off
into<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.880> cocktail<00:04:15.120> glass<00:04:18.680> look<00:04:19.680> at<00:04:19.799> that

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
into the cocktail glass look at that

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:29.980 
into the cocktail glass look at that
just<00:04:21.330> makes<00:04:21.630> enough<00:04:27.050> ice<00:04:28.050> queen<00:04:28.440> right<00:04:28.710> there
