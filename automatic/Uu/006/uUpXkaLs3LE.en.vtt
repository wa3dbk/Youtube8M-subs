plus you have you can see here that you

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.940 
plus you have you can see here that you
have<00:01:33.689> some<00:01:33.930> head<00:01:34.079> shoppers<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.740> if

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
have some head shoppers in the back if

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.380 
have some head shoppers in the back if

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you put some head shoppers back there

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.889 
you put some head shoppers back there
and<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:37.259> trampled<00:01:38.189> steams<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.420> barriers

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
and some trampled steams at the barriers

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.469 
and some trampled steams at the barriers
or<00:01:40.140> at<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.950> stairs<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.850> basically<00:01:42.210> can

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
or at the stairs to you basically can

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.270 
or at the stairs to you basically can
just<00:01:42.659> sit<00:01:42.810> there<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.229> nothing<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:44.130> only

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
just sit there and do nothing the only

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.030 
just sit there and do nothing the only
downside<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.780> eventually<00:01:46.680> after<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
downside is is that eventually after a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.069 
downside is is that eventually after a
few<00:01:47.310> rounds<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.759> break<00:01:48.299> off<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> have

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
few rounds they break off and you have

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.109 
few rounds they break off and you have
to<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:49.590> them<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.950> suggest<00:01:50.759> building

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to go and get them I suggest building

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.850 
to go and get them I suggest building

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
dive think I just go to go off to the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
dive think I just go to go off to the
side<00:02:06.780> because<00:02:06.960> those<00:02:07.170> things<00:02:07.380> will<00:02:07.530> like

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
side because those things will like

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.219 
side because those things will like
really<00:02:08.700> slow<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.060> down<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.079> run

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
really slow you down so if you just run

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.569 
really slow you down so if you just run
off<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> side<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.920> keep<00:02:11.039> dolphin<00:02:11.400> diving

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
you can finish the round like 10 times

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.020 
you can finish the round like 10 times
faster<00:02:13.470> than<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.680> already<00:02:13.829> can<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.430> it's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
