review of it originally I was inspired
to<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.860> because<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.250> saw<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to do this because I saw one of the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.330 
to do this because I saw one of the
reviews<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:10.260> an<00:01:10.409> episode<00:01:10.650> called<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
reviews about an episode called the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.730 
reviews about an episode called the
doctor's<00:01:11.880> daughter<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:13.290> couldn't

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
doctor's daughter and I couldn't

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
doctor's daughter and I couldn't
disagree<00:01:14.250> more

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
disagree more

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.780 
disagree more
I<00:01:15.119> thought<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.689> episode<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:17.100> episode<00:01:17.400> itself

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
I thought the episode the episode itself

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.910 
I thought the episode the episode itself
was<00:01:18.119> okay<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.170> was<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> couple<00:01:19.680> major

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
was okay but there was a couple major

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.120 
was okay but there was a couple major
plot<00:01:20.700> features<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.200> thought<00:01:22.799> were<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
plot features which I thought were a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
plot features which I thought were a
travesty<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:25.670> there<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.090> some<00:01:27.330> some

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
travesty and there was just some some

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.950 
travesty and there was just some some
lazy<00:01:28.439> plot<00:01:29.070> devices<00:01:29.490> overall<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> had<00:01:30.780> some

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
lazy plot devices overall I had some

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
lazy plot devices overall I had some
serious<00:01:31.470> problems<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.189> episode<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
serious problems with that episode and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.940 
serious problems with that episode and
they<00:01:32.909> were<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.680> thought<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
they were just like you know thought it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.920 
they were just like you know thought it
was<00:01:35.100> great<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.350> maybe<00:01:37.350> I'll<00:01:37.560> make<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:38.159> video

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
was great and so maybe I'll make a video

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.170 
was great and so maybe I'll make a video

season they're having four specials
five<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> suppose<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.009> count<00:02:05.189> last<00:02:05.670> year's

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
five I suppose if you count last year's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.919 
five I suppose if you count last year's
Christmas<00:02:06.509> special<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
