of<00:03:46.340> course<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:46.700> have<00:03:46.849> my<00:03:47.030> ground<00:03:47.390> if<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.930> would

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
of course I have my ground if I would

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.860 
of course I have my ground if I would
like<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.380> switch<00:03:49.000> nasal<00:03:50.000> passages<00:03:50.480> instead<00:03:50.780> of

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
like to switch nasal passages instead of

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.509 
like to switch nasal passages instead of
having<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.110> switch<00:03:51.380> hands<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.920> can<00:03:52.130> just<00:03:52.340> turn

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
having to switch hands I can just turn

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.030 
having to switch hands I can just turn
these<00:03:52.880> two<00:03:53.090> fingers<00:03:53.590> opposite<00:03:54.590> each<00:03:54.769> other

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
these two fingers opposite each other

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.110 
these two fingers opposite each other
one<00:03:55.700> nasal<00:03:56.690> passage<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:58.280> other<00:03:58.459> nasal

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
one nasal passage and the other nasal

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.670 
one nasal passage and the other nasal
passage<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.349> looks<00:04:01.190> like<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.610> okay<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:03.290> next

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
passage so looks like this okay the next

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.869 
passage so looks like this okay the next
technique<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:04.730> or<00:04:05.450> mudra<00:04:05.930> is<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:07.069> large

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
technique is or mudra is the large

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.539 
technique is or mudra is the large
stinger<00:04:08.840> okay<00:04:09.379> which<00:04:09.680> is<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.860> very<00:04:10.190> strong

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
stinger okay which is a very strong

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.379 
stinger okay which is a very strong
blockage<00:04:11.269> remover<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:11.989> pain<00:04:12.739> remover<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.730> so
