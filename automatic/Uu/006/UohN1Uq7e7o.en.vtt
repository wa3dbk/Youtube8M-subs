battlefield<00:04:02.200> 3<00:04:02.440> defibrillators<00:04:03.099> were<00:04:04.019> just

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
battlefield 3 defibrillators were just

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.099 
battlefield 3 defibrillators were just
very<00:04:05.709> very<00:04:06.010> difficult<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.419> try<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.660> get<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.870> kill

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
very very difficult to try to get a kill

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.870 
very very difficult to try to get a kill
with<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.380> did<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> montage<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.310> but<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.760> was

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
with I did a montage on that but it was

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.849 
with I did a montage on that but it was
a<00:04:09.910> hard<00:04:10.599> thing<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.930> do<00:04:11.139> in<00:04:11.260> battlefield<00:04:11.650> 3<00:04:11.709> and

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
a hard thing to do in battlefield 3 and

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.740 
a hard thing to do in battlefield 3 and
battlefield<00:04:12.040> 4<00:04:12.370> defibrillator<00:04:13.120> kills<00:04:13.419> are

battlefield 4 defibrillator kills are

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.650 
battlefield 4 defibrillator kills are
pretty<00:04:14.440> easy<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:14.919> guess<00:04:15.250> because<00:04:15.940> they're<00:04:16.389> part

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
pretty easy I guess because they're part

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.319 
pretty easy I guess because they're part
of<00:04:16.720> assignments<00:04:17.229> now<00:04:17.400> we're<00:04:18.400> part<00:04:18.760> of<00:04:18.849> this

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
is pretty accurate on its own so I don't

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.749 
is pretty accurate on its own so I don't
think<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:58.949> will<00:04:59.099> definitely<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.639> will

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
think you will definitely you will

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.249 
think you will definitely you will
automatically<00:05:00.360> need<00:05:00.569> like<00:05:00.779> a<00:05:00.809> muzzle<00:05:01.229> brake

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.029 
heavy barrel to me in battlefield 4 it's

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.329 
heavy barrel to me in battlefield 4 it's
there<00:05:06.719> is<00:05:06.809> no<00:05:06.839> points<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.409> this<00:05:07.529> a<00:05:07.770> lot<00:05:08.249> of

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:08.339 
there is no points to this a lot of

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.889 
there is no points to this a lot of
these<00:05:08.429> weapons<00:05:08.639> are<00:05:08.969> already<00:05:09.240> super<00:05:09.629> accurate

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:09.899 
these weapons are already super accurate

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:12.489 
these weapons are already super accurate
so<00:05:10.379> using<00:05:10.770> an<00:05:10.919> equipment<00:05:11.339> heavy<00:05:11.639> barrel<00:05:12.059> and

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:12.499 
so using an equipment heavy barrel and

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.290 
so using an equipment heavy barrel and
losing<00:05:13.499> all<00:05:13.649> that<00:05:13.770> act<00:05:13.979> I'm<00:05:14.279> losing<00:05:14.909> all<00:05:15.089> that

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
losing all that act I'm losing all that

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.749 
losing all that act I'm losing all that
stability<00:05:15.869> just<00:05:16.379> again<00:05:17.339> a<00:05:17.369> little<00:05:17.550> bit<00:05:17.699> of

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
stability just again a little bit of

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.199 
stability just again a little bit of
accuracy<00:05:17.999> is<00:05:18.419> ridiculous<00:05:19.080> so<00:05:19.999> muzzle<00:05:20.999> break

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:21.209 
accuracy is ridiculous so muzzle break

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:25.249 
accuracy is ridiculous so muzzle break
suppressor<00:05:22.019> is<00:05:22.529> pretty<00:05:23.009> pretty<00:05:23.879> awesome<00:05:24.569> not

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
suppressor is pretty pretty awesome not

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.769

using<00:05:25.559> any<00:05:25.709> attachments<00:05:26.429> for<00:05:26.699> your<00:05:26.969> barrel<00:05:27.599> is

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
using any attachments for your barrel is

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.049 
using any attachments for your barrel is
also<00:05:28.319> great<00:05:28.619> so<00:05:28.830> this<00:05:29.369> right<00:05:29.550> here<00:05:29.610> as<00:05:29.849> you<00:05:29.879> can

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:30.059 
also great so this right here as you can

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:32.570 
also great so this right here as you can
see<00:05:30.269> I'm<00:05:30.419> not<00:05:30.509> using<00:05:30.689> any<00:05:30.990> any<00:05:31.800> attachments<00:05:32.490> on

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
see I'm not using any any attachments on

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.639 
see I'm not using any any attachments on
my<00:05:32.699> barrel<00:05:33.119> and<00:05:33.330> it's<00:05:33.539> still<00:05:33.869> dropping<00:05:34.169> people

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:34.649 
my barrel and it's still dropping people

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:37.459 
my barrel and it's still dropping people
on<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.339> suppressor<00:05:35.909> also<00:05:36.749> is<00:05:36.959> a<00:05:36.990> pretty

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
on the suppressor also is a pretty

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.489 
on the suppressor also is a pretty
accurate<00:05:38.039> um<00:05:38.610> attachment<00:05:39.389> so<00:05:39.629> I<00:05:39.839> think<00:05:40.259> I

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:40.499 
accurate um attachment so I think I

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:41.989 
accurate um attachment so I think I
might<00:05:40.619> stick<00:05:40.860> with<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.099> suppressor<00:05:41.639> I<00:05:41.669> used

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:41.999 
might stick with the suppressor I used

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.389 
might stick with the suppressor I used
to<00:05:42.529> roll<00:05:43.529> with<00:05:43.709> the<00:05:43.800> suppressor<00:05:44.159> and

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:44.399 
to roll with the suppressor and

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.730 
to roll with the suppressor and
battlefield<00:05:44.849> 3<00:05:45.029> with<00:05:45.179> the<00:05:45.240> l85<00:05:45.809> so<00:05:46.169> I<00:05:46.409> think

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
battlefield 3 with the l85 so I think

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.290 
battlefield 3 with the l85 so I think
imma<00:05:47.039> stick<00:05:47.219> with<00:05:47.339> the<00:05:47.429> suppressor<00:05:47.849> and

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
imma stick with the suppressor and

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.949 
imma stick with the suppressor and
depending<00:05:48.719> on<00:05:48.949> the<00:05:49.949> range<00:05:50.219> or<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:51.419> style<00:05:51.719> of
