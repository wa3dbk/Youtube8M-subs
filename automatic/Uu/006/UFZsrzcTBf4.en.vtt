don't know I'm just not digging this new
thing<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.810> hopefully<00:01:34.590> it'll<00:01:34.710> work<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:35.030> so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
thing but hopefully it'll work out so

by<00:01:41.040> twenty-five<00:01:41.549> percent<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.970> ten<00:01:42.150> seconds

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
by twenty-five percent for ten seconds

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.360 
by twenty-five percent for ten seconds
your<00:01:43.020> threat<00:01:43.380> level<00:01:43.680> towards<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> attacker

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
your threat level towards the attacker

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.490 
your threat level towards the attacker
is<00:01:44.549> reduced<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.360> effect<00:01:45.690> cannot<00:01:45.960> occur<00:01:46.229> more

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
is reduced this effect cannot occur more

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.390 
is reduced this effect cannot occur more
than<00:01:46.560> once<00:01:46.740> every<00:01:47.479> 30<00:01:48.479> seconds<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.250> that's

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
than once every 30 seconds so that's

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.670 
than once every 30 seconds so that's
actually<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.790> pretty<00:01:50.940> good<00:01:51.390> leveling<00:01:51.990> ability

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
actually a pretty good leveling ability

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.670 
actually a pretty good leveling ability
to<00:01:52.799> pick<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.170> sadly<00:01:55.170> i'm<00:01:55.260> really<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.590> sure

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
to pick up and sadly i'm really not sure

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.870 
to pick up and sadly i'm really not sure
why<00:01:55.920> i<00:01:55.950> didn't<00:01:56.190> take<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.460> maybe<00:01:56.580> we'll<00:01:56.700> find

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
why i didn't take it maybe we'll find

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
why i didn't take it maybe we'll find
