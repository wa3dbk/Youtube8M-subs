00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.280

 mycroft as it runs normal 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.840
 iron with a little bit of what I 'm 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.740
 recording with nostalgia kills facbook 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.970
 this is a little bit of the 1,102 bed 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.980
 but, as you can see, it runs 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.290
 normal forgiveness for the act is because I am 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.799

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.799
 the night 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.099
 because I'm running faster but 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.739
 normal everything serves there are not so many 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.560
