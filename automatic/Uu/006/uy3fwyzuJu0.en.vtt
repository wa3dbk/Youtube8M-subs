00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.170
 hello everyone here we are for a new one 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.500
 video 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.789
 then today it is a video in collaboration 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.939
 with a gentleman called enrico de 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.179
 marco is practically my first 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.710
 collaboration with let's say a company 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.789
 so i'm really really 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.339
 happy and in any case shortly owed me 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.289
 get a package with the 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.449
 collaboration of another company but 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:38.690
 anyway he takes you from the video when i am 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.789
 comes from the package and nothing or what I have 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.579
 cooperated closely with this gentleman 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:47.739
 then I leave you under the link anyway 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.440
 of the site and in any case of site 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.559
 www.philips.it and makes cover notes 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.250
 has devised original and unique covers 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.519
 protected by copyright and nothing I did again 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.499
 King's heart to see which one sent me 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.269
 to the note are the covers that yes 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.850
 stick to the phone 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.220
 so now the cell phone in charge but 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.689
 in short, they put themselves behind it 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:21.159
 they attack like this and are flexible 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:24.649
 see and they are particular because 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.560
 Thus begins the flyer in everything 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:31.219
 each color different because for each 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.030
 cover there is a dialect precisely was the 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.969
 peace written that is a soft cover e 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.969
 sturdy thin flexible protect 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:44.329
 these things chopped off as a dirty routine 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:47.750
 scratches and water splashes and and also 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.750
 Washable and is also non-slip 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.240
 then it can be attached and detached more 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:03.920
 times obviously because it is not used and 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:06.020
 he throws and afterwards he is silent indeed 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.959
 it is an idea born also for a purpose 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.380
 cultural that of that is that of 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.810
 enhance all Italian dialects 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.250
 here it says the eye flies its way 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.250
 fo racheli punches 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.840
 now sorry if I did not read correctly but 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.360
 I don't know much about him I can't read 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.069
 good to interpret these dialects well 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.220
 here are several and some precisely the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.880
 colosseum here there was brand by fif 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:44.930
 the virus almost the flag point 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:48.840
 Italian and nothing looks like this e 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.330
 so you see the detached and has pinched 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.940
 on the phone now was a moment 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.370
 because I show you his 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.350
 function of capable here then now vi 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.980
 I show its function but first 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.220
 I wanted to show you how it was 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:10.440
 then it really is really pretty I have to 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:16.130
 say in my opinion and blue and is beautiful and 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.610
 thin and and it is really comfortable because 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.220
 protect yourself 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.030
 maybe it was iphone falls because it is 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.239
 however, it has a specific thickness for 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.130
 to protect 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.720
 now we are in front of the mirror 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.140
 because I show you just how 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.209
 works sorry the bad quality but it is 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.519
 evening and dark and it is a bit difficult for me 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.200
 hold the ipad in your hand the mobile phone 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.329
 at the same time I'll show you how 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:51.859
 it works you can just stick to a 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:55.470
 veto and leave so wait and see 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:58.500
 no zucchi is really cool 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.920
 I must say really beautiful and comes off 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.420
 also very easily 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:10.880
 here is peaceful mortar to make you of 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.880
 really see a cool one 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.730
 obviously this does not have to happen 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:27.030
 very easily because otherwise you don't 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:30.060
 off now more perfect here and without 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.490
 scratches sense nothing is perfect but nothing 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.130
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.590
