00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.029 
little bit better and swivel 360 degrees
and<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.959> camera<00:01:47.229> does<00:01:47.380> allow<00:01:47.619> you<00:01:47.679> to<00:01:47.889> take

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.080 
stills or video and like I said it has a
microphone<00:01:50.409> built-in<00:01:51.009> so<00:01:51.639> we'll<00:01:51.759> go<00:01:51.880> ahead

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
microphone built-in so we'll go ahead

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.969 
microphone built-in so we'll go ahead
our<00:01:52.389> cameras<00:01:52.719> plugged<00:01:52.959> into<00:01:53.139> the<00:01:53.289> USB<00:01:53.319> and

our cameras plugged into the USB and

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.469 
our cameras plugged into the USB and
we'll<00:01:54.099> put<00:01:54.279> it<00:01:54.369> right<00:01:54.520> on<00:01:54.759> top<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.119> our

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
we'll put it right on top of our

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.629 
we'll put it right on top of our
computer<00:01:56.109> here<00:01:56.439> and<00:01:56.560> then<00:01:57.189> we'll<00:01:57.369> kind<00:01:57.579> of

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:57.639 
computer here and then we'll kind of

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.309 
computer here and then we'll kind of
clamp<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.090> down<00:01:58.119> a<00:01:58.599> little<00:01:58.810> bit<00:01:59.020> with<00:01:59.200> the

clamp it down a little bit with the
pinch<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.950> maybe<00:02:00.099> we'll<00:02:00.279> bring<00:02:00.459> it<00:02:00.609> up<00:02:00.729> a

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:00.849 
pinch and maybe we'll bring it up a

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.099 
pinch and maybe we'll bring it up a
little<00:02:00.969> bit<00:02:01.299> and<00:02:01.509> you<00:02:01.569> just<00:02:01.689> kind<00:02:01.869> of<00:02:01.929> play
