00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 This is the Philips D205 series in this 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.990
 case the pattern version with four hand 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.589
 sets it is available from 1 to 4 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.900
 handsets 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.130
 so the normal version say the guru 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.690
 you could say 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.980
 which is with a hand move and base station 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.509
 and who can then possibly enter 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.190
 in various other forms 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.720
 depending on how much natural 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.670
 hand-stitching need it is one 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.930
 stylish elegant dect telephone set 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.580
 without too much fuss 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.830
 if we take a look at a dect 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.150
 telephone set and to the hand itself 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.400
 I actually think it's a small screen 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 whatever is illuminated and we think about it 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.489
 seen the top yet 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.840
 listen and take at the bottom 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.309
 natural substructure under the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.110
 function keys find the numeric 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.670
 keyboard back to find that 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.110
 speaker for the hands-free set and here 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.820
 behind these clubs are the triple a 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.920
 Batteries the back matte finished 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.149
 and there are nice ribs in that 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.289
 we say that you have some grip on it 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.610
 device which also makes things nice 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.829
 hands remained even if you were longer 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.329
 are on the phone 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.100
 now go and look further 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.620
 the device works exactly for that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 we see here that the device actually 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.469
 bit straightforward 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.840
 you just see the date and time and you can 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.090
 press down for the call log and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.500
 above for the telephone book 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.299
 phone book can handle up to 50 numbers 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 that is a bit on the small side 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.140
 but unfortunately that is no different 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.330
 and if we go back to the menu 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.330
 completely we have to go back once 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.880
 then we can go to the menu we see you 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.350
 phone book, we can see the phone 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.869
 settings' I chose generous settings 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.159
 do among other things eco and ecoplus mode 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.570
 see some more services and it 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.400
 answer machine you can also here 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.360
 everything can be monitored from then on 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.009
 sets but of course you can 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.049
 answering machine also operate from it 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.250
 base station has base station here 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.409
 all buttons on the answering machine 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.850
 to operate and of course also here 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.960
 the frame is on the back 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.460
 speak so you are the answering machine 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.869
 also in listening 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.369
 without you say sit hand 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.840
 in addition, we now have 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.390
 a page a test if we click on it 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 then all devices will ring and then you can 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.119
 You naturally take a look if you have one 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.990
 device where exactly it is 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.180
