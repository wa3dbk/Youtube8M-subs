00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
inside of the case now it's holding off

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.730 
inside of the case now it's holding off
for<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:57.959> for<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> little<00:01:58.259> bit<00:01:58.410> there's<00:01:58.619> some

for that for a little bit there's some
really<00:01:58.920> cool<00:01:59.130> features<00:01:59.190> in<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.819> we<00:02:00.000> got<00:02:00.149> to

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
really cool features in here we got to

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.969 
really cool features in here we got to
list<00:02:00.539> drive<00:02:00.780> phase<00:02:01.050> we<00:02:01.289> got<00:02:01.440> to<00:02:01.619> lyst<00:02:01.800> hard

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
list drive phase we got to lyst hard

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
list drive phase we got to lyst hard
drive<00:02:02.190> bays<00:02:02.429> we<00:02:02.940> got<00:02:03.090> thumb<00:02:03.330> screws<00:02:03.690> which<00:02:04.080> is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
drive bays we got thumb screws which is

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.779 
drive bays we got thumb screws which is
pretty<00:02:04.319> standard<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.830> your<00:02:05.009> expansion<00:02:05.399> slots

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
pretty standard for your expansion slots

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.510 
pretty standard for your expansion slots
also<00:02:06.690> we<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.349> removable<00:02:07.709> hard<00:02:08.069> drive<00:02:08.130> base

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
also we have removable hard drive base

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.510 
also we have removable hard drive base
so<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.149> case<00:02:09.560> initially<00:02:10.560> supported<00:02:11.069> six

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
so this case initially supported six

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.070 
so this case initially supported six
hard<00:02:11.790> drives<00:02:11.880> now<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.240> had<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.480> take<00:02:12.690> out<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
hard drives now I had to take out the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.680 
hard drives now I had to take out the
top<00:02:13.319> three<00:02:13.830> because<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.790> our<00:02:14.849> long<00:02:15.090> video<00:02:15.390> card

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
top three because of our long video card

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.660 
top three because of our long video card
now<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.260> case<00:02:16.500> does<00:02:16.800> support<00:02:17.130> quite<00:02:17.459> long

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
now this case does support quite long

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.030 
now this case does support quite long
video<00:02:18.000> cards<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:19.230> when<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.740> install

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
video cards but when you install

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.130 
video cards but when you install
something<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.459> gtx<00:02:20.849> 480<00:02:21.240> unfortunately

something like a gtx 480 unfortunately
it's<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.319> that<00:02:22.410> borderline<00:02:22.920> where<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.310> can't

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
it's on that borderline where I can't

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.350 
it's on that borderline where I can't
install<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:25.580> extra<00:02:26.580> three<00:02:26.790> hard<00:02:26.970> drive<00:02:27.209> so

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
install the extra three hard drive so

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.030 
install the extra three hard drive so
you<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.599> only<00:02:27.750> install<00:02:27.989> three<00:02:28.410> now

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
you can only install three now

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.650 
you can only install three now
installing<00:02:29.910> hard<00:02:30.150> drives<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.420> really<00:02:30.599> easy

goes through here worked really good one
really<00:03:30.720> cool<00:03:30.870> feature<00:03:31.379> about<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:32.129> front<00:03:32.489> USB

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
really cool feature about the front USB

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.830 
really cool feature about the front USB
3<00:03:33.180> s<00:03:33.269> unlike<00:03:33.599> any<00:03:33.810> other<00:03:34.379> case<00:03:34.739> I've<00:03:35.010> ever<00:03:35.099> seen

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
3 s unlike any other case I've ever seen

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.140 
3 s unlike any other case I've ever seen
is<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.170> when<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.680> do<00:03:37.980> take<00:03:38.220> out<00:03:38.370> your<00:03:38.489> USB<00:03:38.849> 3

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
is that when you do take out your USB 3

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.879 
is that when you do take out your USB 3
s<00:03:39.209> here<00:03:39.480> check<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:39.989> out<00:03:40.349> so<00:03:40.470> we<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.739> two

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
s here check this out so we have the two

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.680 
s here check this out so we have the two
USB<00:03:41.280> 3<00:03:41.519> headers<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:41.819> then<00:03:42.090> on<00:03:42.209> top<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.389> that<00:03:42.540> we

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
USB 3 headers but then on top of that we

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.839 
USB 3 headers but then on top of that we
have<00:03:42.720> two<00:03:42.959> USB<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.530> point<00:03:43.769> out<00:03:43.920> headers<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.400> if

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
have two USB to point out headers so if

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.930 
have two USB to point out headers so if
your<00:03:45.030> case<00:03:45.299> does<00:03:45.540> not<00:03:45.720> have<00:03:45.959> USB<00:03:46.470> 3.0<00:03:47.159> internal

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
your case does not have USB 3.0 internal

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.640 
your case does not have USB 3.0 internal
header<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.389> can<00:03:48.690> convert<00:03:49.109> them<00:03:49.290> back<00:03:49.440> down

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
header you can convert them back down

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.379 
header you can convert them back down
the<00:03:49.889> two<00:03:50.069> point<00:03:50.340> oh<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.209> coolest

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
the two point oh that is the coolest

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.539 
the two point oh that is the coolest
thing<00:03:51.780> ever<00:03:51.989> in<00:03:52.290> every<00:03:52.680> case<00:03:52.889> should<00:03:53.160> do<00:03:53.340> this

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
thing ever in every case should do this

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.240 
thing ever in every case should do this
this<00:03:54.359> gives<00:03:54.660> this<00:03:54.810> case<00:03:55.079> huge<00:03:55.560> bragging<00:03:55.980> point

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250

this<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.579> honestly<00:03:59.970> love<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.540> feature<00:04:00.690> that's

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
this I honestly love this feature that's

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.750 
this I honestly love this feature that's
more<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.410> best<00:04:01.560> things<00:04:01.769> no<00:04:02.069> other<00:04:02.099> cases<00:04:02.459> done

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
more the best things no other cases done

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.369 
more the best things no other cases done
it<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.840> just<00:04:03.989> makes<00:04:04.139> it<00:04:04.230> awesome

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
it so and it just makes it awesome

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.800 
it so and it just makes it awesome
because<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.919> motherboard<00:04:05.160> only<00:04:05.430> supports

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
because this motherboard only supports

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.390 
because this motherboard only supports
only<00:04:06.810> has<00:04:06.989> one<00:04:07.230> internal<00:04:07.500> USB<00:04:07.680> 3<00:04:08.010> header<00:04:08.160> and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
only has one internal USB 3 header and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.099 
only has one internal USB 3 header and
then<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:08.609> can<00:04:08.760> take<00:04:08.879> the<00:04:09.000> other<00:04:09.209> header<00:04:09.810> and

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
then I can take the other header and

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.129 
then I can take the other header and
convert<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.560> into<00:04:10.829> a<00:04:11.010> two<00:04:11.280> point<00:04:11.549> O<00:04:11.730> header<00:04:12.139> so

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
convert it into a two point O header so

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.259 
convert it into a two point O header so
that's<00:04:13.349> awesome<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:14.040> really<00:04:14.849> that's<00:04:15.000> about

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
that's awesome and really that's about

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.509 
that's awesome and really that's about

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
it on the inside so it's super easy to

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.589 
it on the inside so it's super easy to
work<00:04:17.669> in<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:17.970> was<00:04:18.060> pretty<00:04:18.209> easy<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.449> layout

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
out which is great to work with tons of

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.409 
out which is great to work with tons of
motherboards<00:04:58.099> also<00:04:59.099> really<00:04:59.909> cool<00:05:00.059> note<00:05:00.270> if

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
you do like 200 millimeter fans you can

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.980 
you do like 200 millimeter fans you can
not<00:05:02.699> only<00:05:02.849> put<00:05:03.119> one<00:05:03.149> in<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.389> top<00:05:03.569> of<00:05:03.749> the<00:05:03.809> case

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
not only put one in the top of the case

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.929 
not only put one in the top of the case
you<00:05:04.409> can<00:05:04.529> actually<00:05:04.649> get<00:05:04.830> rid<00:05:05.039> of<00:05:05.069> the<00:05:05.219> 120s<00:05:05.759> and

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:05.939 
you can actually get rid of the 120s and

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.329 
you can actually get rid of the 120s and
put<00:05:06.869> them<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:07.229> put<00:05:07.409> one<00:05:07.589> in<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.949> front<00:05:08.129> of<00:05:08.249> the

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:08.339 
put them and put one in the front of the

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.559 
put them and put one in the front of the
case<00:05:08.459> which<00:05:08.669> is<00:05:08.789> cool<00:05:08.909> i<00:05:08.999> just<00:05:09.179> noticed<00:05:09.449> that

actually so here's where all our wires
go<00:05:11.729> with<00:05:11.879> our<00:05:11.999> hard<00:05:12.209> drives<00:05:12.479> which<00:05:12.689> is<00:05:12.809> pretty

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:12.959 
go with our hard drives which is pretty

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:14.959 
go with our hard drives which is pretty
sweet<00:05:13.229> and<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.099> all<00:05:14.219> just<00:05:14.249> goes<00:05:14.429> in<00:05:14.699> pretty

here to run some more cables another
hole<00:05:18.389> here<00:05:18.659> we<00:05:18.749> can<00:05:18.869> run<00:05:19.020> more<00:05:19.169> cables<00:05:19.589> through

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
hole here we can run more cables through

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.579 
hole here we can run more cables through
pull<00:05:20.669> up<00:05:20.759> here<00:05:20.999> to<00:05:21.119> run<00:05:21.240> cables<00:05:21.629> so<00:05:22.199> they<00:05:22.469> got

for USB 3 43 like no case is going to

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.379 
for USB 3 43 like no case is going to
support<00:06:04.769> that<00:06:04.860> in<00:06:05.129> say<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.610> motherboard<00:06:06.089> I<00:06:06.269> mean

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
support that in say a motherboard I mean

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.119 
support that in say a motherboard I mean
motherboard<00:06:06.839> supports<00:06:06.959> that<00:06:07.319> and<00:06:07.559> then<00:06:08.009> I'll

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
motherboard supports that and then I'll

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.009 
motherboard supports that and then I'll
so<00:06:08.249> then<00:06:08.490> they<00:06:08.669> did<00:06:08.849> that<00:06:08.969> awesome<00:06:09.360> feature<00:06:09.569> so
