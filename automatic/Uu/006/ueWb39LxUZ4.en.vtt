 is also a literary critic who makes him 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.369
 be a little different from other 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.410
 populations until the specific subject 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.019
 part of the book they begin to discuss 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.730
 some works of title certain systemma 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.590
 conception about what you think of each 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.120
 thing that does become a little half 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.010
 Friends, I'll talk like this. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.140
 only that the crew is very 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.790
 ill-treated by them and are all 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.250
 First trip ships will still talk 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.870
 so it says that the vessel that 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.810
 is why they suffer a lot since the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.090

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.120
 certain things of this hunting and the 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.800
 industries only when he arrives will 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.930

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.319
 with him had to work on that ship 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.450
 It was also how he did not know I am 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.239
 absolutely nothing and some crews 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.250

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.959
 everything with him wants to understand the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.829
