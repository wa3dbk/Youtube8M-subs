dystopian fiction happening and these

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.100 
dystopian fiction happening and these
were<00:06:39.600> the<00:06:39.750> kind<00:06:39.960> of

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
were the kind of

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.780 
were the kind of
sci-fi<00:06:40.230> stories<00:06:40.710> that<00:06:40.920> the<00:06:41.100> science<00:06:41.400> fiction
