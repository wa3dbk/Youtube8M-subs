don't<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.840> think<00:03:34.870> we<00:03:35.350> should<00:03:35.800> start<00:03:36.100> with<00:03:36.250> one

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
don't you think we should start with one

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.020 
don't you think we should start with one
of<00:03:37.000> our<00:03:37.120> more<00:03:37.360> dynamic<00:03:38.050> findings

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.880 

every<00:03:43.660> woman<00:03:43.780> myself<00:03:44.110> included<00:03:44.770> as

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
experienced them but nobody knows they

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.160 
experienced them but nobody knows they
exist<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.840> we<00:03:47.050> would<00:03:47.230> resent<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:48.630> we<00:03:49.630> they

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
exist and we would resent that we they

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.809 
exist and we would resent that we they
exist<00:03:50.560> because<00:03:50.740> we<00:03:51.010> watch<00:03:51.280> them<00:03:51.580> but<00:03:51.760> you

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
exist because we watch them but you

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.480 
exist because we watch them but you
can't<00:03:51.880> wire<00:03:52.420> up<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.780> vagina<00:03:53.490> graphical

can't wire up a vagina graphical
verification<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.410> let<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.190> be<00:03:57.310> as<00:03:58.180> I've

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420
