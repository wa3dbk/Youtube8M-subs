00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
place using this this is a we call it a

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.569 
place using this this is a we call it a
heart<00:01:49.630> it's<00:01:49.899> basically<00:01:50.319> a<00:01:50.439> wedge<00:01:50.799> pull<00:01:51.399> that

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
heart it's basically a wedge pull that

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.200 
heart it's basically a wedge pull that
through<00:01:51.939> this<00:01:52.899> is<00:01:53.259> what<00:01:53.380> connects<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:54.729> piston

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
through this is what connects the piston

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.080 
through this is what connects the piston
to<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.719> frame<00:01:55.960> that's<00:01:56.560> right

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
to the frame that's right

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.690 
to the frame that's right
perfect<00:01:58.990> nicely<00:01:59.319> done<00:01:59.530> simple<00:02:00.369> physics

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
perfect nicely done simple physics

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.669 
perfect nicely done simple physics
that's<00:02:00.880> just<00:02:01.060> not<00:02:01.240> going<00:02:01.390> anywhere<00:02:01.659> so<00:02:02.530> this

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
that's just not going anywhere so this

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.740 
that's just not going anywhere so this
is<00:02:02.799> just<00:02:02.890> held<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.280> by<00:02:03.399> that<00:02:03.549> snug<00:02:03.909> fit<00:02:04.179> yep<00:02:04.569> as

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
is just held in by that snug fit yep as

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.059 
is just held in by that snug fit yep as
long<00:02:04.959> as<00:02:05.140> there's<00:02:05.319> pressure<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.890> ropes

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
long as there's pressure on the ropes

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.289 
long as there's pressure on the ropes
which<00:02:06.310> means<00:02:06.520> there's<00:02:06.729> tension<00:02:07.000> on<00:02:07.179> the

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
which means there's tension on the

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.270 
which means there's tension on the
system<00:02:07.659> that<00:02:07.689> heart<00:02:08.349> can't<00:02:08.590> go<00:02:08.709> anywhere<00:02:09.069> and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
system that heart can't go anywhere and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.919 
system that heart can't go anywhere and
you're<00:02:09.489> always<00:02:09.670> gonna<00:02:09.849> be<00:02:10.060> held<00:02:10.269> safe<00:02:10.479> right

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
you're always gonna be held safe right

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.860 
you're always gonna be held safe right
on<00:02:11.140> okay<00:02:11.709> you<00:02:12.190> know<00:02:12.430> what<00:02:12.610> I'm<00:02:13.450> gonna<00:02:13.599> let<00:02:13.660> the

one<00:02:27.790> rope<00:02:28.360> hydraulic<00:02:28.989> elevator<00:02:29.110> works<00:02:29.680> is

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
one rope hydraulic elevator works is

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.949 
one rope hydraulic elevator works is
you've<00:02:30.549> got<00:02:30.760> your<00:02:30.790> two<00:02:31.120> ropes<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.630> are<00:02:31.780> on<00:02:31.930> a

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
you've got your two ropes that are on a

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.690 
you've got your two ropes that are on a
fixed<00:02:32.049> position<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.099> ground<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.579> then

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
fixed position on the ground and then

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.370 
fixed position on the ground and then
this<00:02:33.849> side<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.299> attached<00:02:34.630> actually<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
this side is attached actually to the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.680 
this side is attached actually to the
car<00:02:35.620> okay<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.459> if<00:02:36.519> we<00:02:36.639> push<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.940> button<00:02:37.090> push

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
car okay so if we push the button push

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.410 
car okay so if we push the button push
the<00:02:37.900> button<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.859> get<00:02:39.069> oil<00:02:39.340> going<00:02:40.060> into<00:02:40.299> this

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
the button we get oil going into this

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.840 
the button we get oil going into this
cylinder<00:02:40.720> which<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.560> pushing<00:02:42.040> up<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.549> ramp

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
cylinder which is pushing up that ramp

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.660 
cylinder which is pushing up that ramp
which<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.660> pushing<00:02:44.079> that<00:02:44.230> wheel<00:02:44.560> which<00:02:45.489> is

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
which is pushing that wheel which is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.910 
which is pushing that wheel which is
pulling<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.150> ropes<00:02:46.359> up<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.230> it's<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
pulling the ropes up and it's the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.660 
pulling the ropes up and it's the
mechanical<00:02:48.700> advantage<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.780> pulley<00:02:50.670> that

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
mechanical advantage of the pulley that

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.699 
mechanical advantage of the pulley that
gives<00:02:51.910> us<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.150> two-to-one<00:02:52.660> lift<00:02:53.079> ratio<00:02:53.500> right

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
gives us a two-to-one lift ratio right

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.069 
gives us a two-to-one lift ratio right
absolutely<00:02:54.310> correct<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.209> for<00:02:55.569> every<00:02:55.810> inch

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
absolutely correct so for every inch

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.809 
absolutely correct so for every inch
that<00:02:56.350> cylinder<00:02:56.739> goes<00:02:56.980> we're<00:02:57.310> moving<00:02:57.609> two

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
that cylinder goes we're moving two

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.660 
that cylinder goes we're moving two
inches<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.139> very<00:02:59.560> elegant<00:02:59.859> simple

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
inches this is a very elegant simple

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.729 
inches this is a very elegant simple
system<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.840> works<00:03:02.019> every<00:03:02.290> time<00:03:02.530> but

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
system it is it works every time but

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.770 
system it is it works every time but
we're<00:03:02.859> not<00:03:02.980> quite<00:03:03.190> done<00:03:03.250> yet

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
we're not quite done yet

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.090 
we're not quite done yet
before<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:04.900> can<00:03:05.049> go<00:03:05.170> forward<00:03:05.500> with<00:03:05.650> passing

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
before we can go forward with passing

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.800 
before we can go forward with passing
this<00:03:06.220> stage<00:03:06.489> off<00:03:06.730> we<00:03:06.910> have<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.090> do<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.239> very<00:03:07.510> very

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
this stage off we have to do a very very

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.449 
this stage off we have to do a very very
important<00:03:08.260> test<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.560> ensure<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.980> safety<00:03:09.370> is

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
important test to ensure the safety is

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.400 
important test to ensure the safety is
there<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:10.180> called<00:03:10.389> a<00:03:10.480> drop<00:03:10.720> test<00:03:10.989> are<00:03:11.350> you

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
there it's called a drop test are you

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.200 
there it's called a drop test are you
ready<00:03:11.650> for<00:03:11.829> that<00:03:12.010> yeah<00:03:12.790> for<00:03:13.060> sure

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
ready for that yeah for sure

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
Allen press the button okay well look at

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.500 
Allen press the button okay well look at
this<00:03:18.430> there<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.550> go<00:03:19.700> as<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:19.970> can<00:03:20.180> see<00:03:20.360> this

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
this there you go as you can see this

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.240 
this there you go as you can see this
installations<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.260> little<00:03:21.470> further<00:03:21.680> along<00:03:21.920> we

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
installations a little further along we

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.190 
installations a little further along we
actually<00:03:22.550> have<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.730> cab<00:03:23.060> installed<00:03:23.600> on<00:03:23.840> top<00:03:24.050> of

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
actually have a cab installed on top of

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.570 
actually have a cab installed on top of
that<00:03:24.260> metal<00:03:24.590> frame<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.130> were<00:03:25.250> working

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
that metal frame that you were working

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.910 
that metal frame that you were working
with<00:03:25.610> before<00:03:25.910> yeah<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.530> looks<00:03:27.560> like<00:03:27.890> a

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
with before yeah and it looks like a

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.560 
with before yeah and it looks like a
real-deal<00:03:28.220> elevator<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.980> an<00:03:31.250> elevator<00:03:31.820> okay

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
real-deal elevator it's an elevator okay

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.260 
real-deal elevator it's an elevator okay
so<00:03:33.140> now<00:03:33.290> comes<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:34.130> drop<00:03:34.460> test<00:03:34.730> so<00:03:35.150> if

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
so now comes the drop test so if

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.060 
so now comes the drop test so if
everything<00:03:35.600> else<00:03:35.780> failed<00:03:36.200> that's<00:03:36.800> the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
everything else failed that's the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.860 
everything else failed that's the
critical<00:03:37.370> test<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.970> engages<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.600> brakes

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
critical test that engages the brakes
