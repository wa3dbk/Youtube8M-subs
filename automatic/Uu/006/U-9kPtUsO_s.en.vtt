hydroponics<00:00:46.989> is<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.739> ability<00:00:48.400> to<00:00:48.430> grow

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
hydroponics is the ability to grow

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.580 
hydroponics is the ability to grow
plants<00:00:49.210> without<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:50.050> use<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.199> soil
