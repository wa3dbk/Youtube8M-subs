you're on a day like today is princess
there<00:03:28.830> will<00:03:28.980> be<00:03:30.380> pretty<00:03:31.380> much<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> continuous

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
there will be pretty much a continuous

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.700 
there will be pretty much a continuous
checking<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.720> weather<00:03:33.930> by<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.260> pilot

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
checking of the weather by the pilot

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.950 
checking of the weather by the pilot
because<00:03:35.490> like<00:03:35.730> today<00:03:36.060> we're<00:03:36.270> forecast<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.840> get

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
because like today we're forecast to get

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.270 
because like today we're forecast to get
showers<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.500> thunderstorms<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:38.100> afternoon

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
showers and thunderstorms this afternoon

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.100 
showers and thunderstorms this afternoon
and<00:03:38.880> there's<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.090> known<00:03:39.510> as<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.690> front<00:03:39.960> moving

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
and there's a known as a front moving

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.090 
and there's a known as a front moving
through<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:40.770> that<00:03:40.980> will<00:03:41.730> change<00:03:43.100> throughout

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
through so that will change throughout

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.880 
through so that will change throughout
the<00:03:44.370> day<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:44.970> will<00:03:45.120> change<00:03:45.860> how<00:03:46.860> we

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
the day and it will change how we

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.490 
the day and it will change how we
respond<00:03:47.550> what<00:03:48.210> we<00:03:48.330> can<00:03:48.510> respond<00:03:48.960> to<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.410> how

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
respond what we can respond to and how

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.640 
respond what we can respond to and how
far<00:03:49.740> we<00:03:49.920> can<00:03:50.070> go<00:03:50.280> there<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.570> think<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.440> pretty

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
far we can go there is I think a pretty

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.070 
far we can go there is I think a pretty
strong<00:03:52.980> safety<00:03:53.490> culture<00:03:53.700> here<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.570> has<00:03:54.840> just

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
strong safety culture here it has just

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.960 
strong safety culture here it has just
been<00:03:55.230> in<00:03:55.350> existence<00:03:56.190> here<00:03:56.400> ever<00:03:56.610> since<00:03:56.760> the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
been in existence here ever since the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.690 
been in existence here ever since the
beginning<00:03:57.470> now<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.740> we've<00:03:58.860> had<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.310> again

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
beginning now that we've had and again

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.460 
beginning now that we've had and again
the<00:03:59.850> industry<00:04:00.270> itself<00:04:00.360> has<00:04:00.810> had<00:04:00.960> 20<00:04:01.290> more

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
the industry itself has had 20 more

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.410 
the industry itself has had 20 more
years<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.830> experience<00:04:02.370> we've<00:04:02.910> learned<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.270> lot

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
years of experience we've learned a lot

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.540 
years of experience we've learned a lot
from<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.780> some<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.380> difficult<00:04:05.130> lessons

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
from the some of the difficult lessons

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.130 
from the some of the difficult lessons
and<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:06.150> think<00:04:06.360> we're<00:04:06.480> be<00:04:06.690> able<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:06.930> provide

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
and I think we're be able to provide

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.200 
and I think we're be able to provide
better<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.740> safer<00:04:07.890> care<00:04:08.670> throughout<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
better and safer care throughout the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.570 
better and safer care throughout the
