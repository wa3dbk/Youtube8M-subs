review is the preview because Aaron it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.260 
review is the preview because Aaron it
seems<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.530> courtroom<00:01:16.979> he's<00:01:17.790> getting<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
seems is in a courtroom he's getting a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.960 
seems is in a courtroom he's getting a
court-martial<00:01:19.070> presumably<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.430> decide<00:01:20.759> his

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
court-martial presumably to decide his

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.960 
court-martial presumably to decide his
fate<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.750> he<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.640> he<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
fate because he you know he was on the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.910 
fate because he you know he was on the
trouble<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.630> took<00:01:24.810> our<00:01:25.020> men<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> stand<00:01:25.530> through

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
trouble it took our men to stand through

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
trouble it took our men to stand through
the<00:01:26.040> arm<00:01:26.250> before<00:01:26.670> Aaron<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.720> came<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the arm before Aaron actually came to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.219 
the arm before Aaron actually came to
his<00:01:28.170> senses<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:30.390> makes<00:01:30.689> sense<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.079> they

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
his senses so it makes sense that they

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.450 
his senses so it makes sense that they
want<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> actually<00:01:31.650> find<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.280> he's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
want to actually find out that he's

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
want to actually find out that he's
actually<00:01:32.670> controllable<00:01:33.600> because<00:01:33.869> even<00:01:34.140> he

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
actually controllable because even he

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.289 
actually controllable because even he
took<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.920> three<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.340> four<00:01:35.369> swings<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:36.090> me

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
took like three or four swings at me

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
took like three or four swings at me

track woman were trying to kill her so

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
track woman were trying to kill her so
that's<00:01:41.460> probably<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:41.850> he's<00:01:42.030> locked<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.420> in

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that's probably what he's locked up in

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
that's probably what he's locked up in
Chains<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.350> previous<00:01:43.530> ebc<00:01:44.009> Levi<00:01:44.670> kicking

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
him in the face which is a bit amusing

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.620 
him in the face which is a bit amusing
also<00:01:47.340> he<00:01:47.399> took<00:01:47.579> my<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.759> abnormal<00:01:48.180> Titans<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
also he took my the abnormal Titans the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.630 
also he took my the abnormal Titans the
armored<00:01:49.110> titan<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.040> colossal<00:01:50.460> time

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
armored titan and the colossal time

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
armored titan and the colossal time
again<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.630> saw<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> colossal<00:01:52.170> Titan<00:01:52.470> warp<00:01:52.710> in

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
again we saw the colossal Titan warp in

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.319 
again we saw the colossal Titan warp in
with<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> lightning<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.790> he's<00:01:53.909> obviously<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
with the lightning so he's obviously a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.480 
with the lightning so he's obviously a
human<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.079> an<00:01:55.290> errand<00:01:55.740> turning<00:01:56.280> his

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
human just like an errand turning his

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.880 
human just like an errand turning his
tie<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.820> he<00:01:57.270> had<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> flashlight<00:01:57.619> we<00:01:58.619> also

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
tie and he had a flashlight we also

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.069 
tie and he had a flashlight we also
didn't<00:01:59.399> get<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> ground<00:02:00.240> really

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
didn't get to see the ground really

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.719 
didn't get to see the ground really
around<00:02:01.619> where<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.890> console<00:02:02.250> Thailand<00:02:02.520> once

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
around where the console Thailand once

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.480 
around where the console Thailand once
so<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.659> don't<00:02:03.840> know<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.110> his

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
so we don't know if his

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.460 
so we don't know if his
kien<00:02:04.880> down<00:02:05.090> there<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:05.960> there's<00:02:06.350> no

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
kien down there so there's no

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.660 
kien down there so there's no
confirmation<00:02:06.710> one<00:02:07.009> way<00:02:07.100> or<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.189> other<00:02:07.250> Aaron

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
confirmation one way or the other Aaron

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.059 
confirmation one way or the other Aaron
didn't<00:02:07.880> look<00:02:08.000> down<00:02:08.500> also<00:02:09.500> with<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.709> armored

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
didn't look down also with the armored

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.949 
didn't look down also with the armored
titan<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.970> didn't<00:02:11.180> see<00:02:11.270> anything<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.750> do<00:02:11.840> with

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
titan we didn't see anything to do with

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.600 
titan we didn't see anything to do with
that<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> armored<00:02:12.860> titan<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.280> probably

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
that so the armored titan is probably

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.970 
that so the armored titan is probably
also<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:14.090> human<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:15.260> simply<00:02:15.709> because<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
also a human just simply because the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.260 
also a human just simply because the
fact<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.220> we<00:02:16.400> didn't<00:02:16.610> see<00:02:16.700> him<00:02:16.790> appear<00:02:17.090> will

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
fact that we didn't see him appear will

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.960 
fact that we didn't see him appear will
disappear<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.620> obviously<00:02:19.310> he<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:19.670> all<00:02:19.819> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
disappear and obviously he can all the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.580 
disappear and obviously he can all the
people<00:02:20.239> just<00:02:20.390> barge<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.780> at<00:02:20.959> all<00:02:21.019> just<00:02:21.470> like

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
people just barge that at all just like

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.080 
people just barge that at all just like
the<00:02:21.709> claw<00:02:21.830> certain<00:02:22.130> laws<00:02:22.310> but<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:22.940> while

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the claw certain laws but in a while

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.699 
the claw certain laws but in a while
human<00:02:23.510> would<00:02:23.660> want<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.050> break<00:02:24.290> down<00:02:24.500> the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
it so yeah I mean recap what can you say

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.550 
it so yeah I mean recap what can you say
we've<00:04:11.389> seen<00:04:11.660> them<00:04:11.780> all<00:04:11.870> before<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.230> guess

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
we've seen them all before I guess

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.700 
we've seen them all before I guess
they're<00:04:12.769> saving<00:04:13.070> up<00:04:13.160> for

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
they're saving up for

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.350 
they're saving up for
it<00:04:13.800> it<00:04:14.280> was<00:04:14.370> thirteen<00:04:14.730> point<00:04:14.940> fire<00:04:15.120> which

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
it it was thirteen point fire which

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.090 
it it was thirteen point fire which
means<00:04:15.570> we'll<00:04:15.690> get<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.900> 14<00:04:16.440> so<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.710> guess<00:04:16.950> it

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
means we'll get a 14 so I guess it

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.920 
means we'll get a 14 so I guess it
didn't<00:04:17.400> take<00:04:17.430> up<00:04:17.700> an<00:04:17.820> episode<00:04:18.180> slot<00:04:18.480> which

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
didn't take up an episode slot which

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.990 
didn't take up an episode slot which
means<00:04:19.140> we'll<00:04:19.230> prolly<00:04:19.350> get<00:04:19.560> 26<00:04:20.070> 27<00:04:20.460> actual

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
means we'll prolly get 26 27 actual

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.730 
means we'll prolly get 26 27 actual
episodes<00:04:21.390> so<00:04:22.020> that's<00:04:22.140> good<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.500> has<00:04:22.590> some

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
episodes so that's good it has some

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.560

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570
