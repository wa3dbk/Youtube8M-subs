point<00:01:19.110> Kali<00:01:19.740> college<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.430> much<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

business

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.149 
business
right<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.659> owners<00:01:24.920> investing<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> lot<00:01:26.130> of

money in so I think it's best readers to
be<00:01:28.409> open<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.799> honest<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.250> get<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
don't have very much time so you have to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.789

position possible or not just kind of

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.790 
position possible or not just kind of
making<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.190> decision<00:02:36.550> tough<00:02:36.880> 50ms<00:02:37.480> and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
making that decision tough 50ms and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.140 
making that decision tough 50ms and
making<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.890> tough<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.160> possible<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:39.730> I'm

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
making it tough as possible so I'm

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.370

trying<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.510> know<00:02:40.570> gives<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.050> as<00:02:41.200> high<00:02:41.320> as

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
trying you know gives just as high as

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.660 
trying you know gives just as high as
possible<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.920> he's<00:02:42.010> clearly<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.430> make<00:02:42.520> an

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670
