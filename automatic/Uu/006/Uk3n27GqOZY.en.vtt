00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.980
 such a new lamp of dictation machines 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.839
 this is possible 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.839
 Chet Baker Clear 14 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.559
 with carbon much praise 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.669
 The head is made of aluminum because of the market leadership 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:28.729
 fabulous 468 ansi lumens with XML LDP four AA batteries 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.510
 Power in the cellar 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.910
 in the cat like mining wall 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.760
 so 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.270
 around a barrier 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 Stans scoreboard 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.250
 as many most 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.610
 with memory function 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.130
 maximum 150 hours who nice box 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 in the world 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.260
 Fonseka had 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 operation manual 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.670
 done very well 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.720
 for 2010 he is the best of the soul 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.390
 their summary of the data 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.490
 4 68 to 20 50 and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.630
 to want Fitch 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.770
 It has been a lot about itself hours seven hours of sunshine and 150 hours 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.770
 be locked because also 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 someone who lives them 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.610
 The century Opel sees it as a Schalke squad 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.960
 Mainburg 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 Pauli was from our point of view 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.909
 and the long bank really makes a find I'm not a friend of 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.239
 dpa but as lamps ever note standardization 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.899
 not out of cover 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.899
 has something 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.180
 not number 1 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.449
 8th 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.909
 Baghdad they can become very beautiful 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.959
 compared with the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.649
 that is by the way 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:40.619
 from the LG for leadership and we are unfortunately need to know which 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.619
 foods 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.729
 one way 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.119
 yes Netphen sent 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.159
 Klockow 4 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.069
 the Wall Street Journal 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.199
 with too much on top 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.799
 and we join our team 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.199
 mandatory 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.199
 the culprit is until 31 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.729
 Track does not have to facilitate Rusterholz 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.169
 Coach 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.140
 we want that too 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.140
 yes Siri not that 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.639
 in a world full of 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.399
 it has to do that, too 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:24.469
 the financial report Raiser No what these possibilities 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.469
 very very stretch 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.139
 Baghdad 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:00.109
 at the 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.999
 while Bayern on 7 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.519
 she from 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.749
 we really had something very similar 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.749
 Apparently one of the other has copied off the other bit 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.579
 how it looks 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.579
 how it looks 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.389
 sio 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.389
 thanks to final ranking 1 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.469
 as a berserker 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.120
 everything would be about him 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.120
 Jürgen Schaller switched 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.900
 today parlor steps steps 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.900
 would the title 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.699
 Now let's have a look 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.469
 After all that is quite different 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.589
 of which I do not like him at all 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.589
 all changes made and with some luck 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:13.759
 and this role 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.650
 Change mode here 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.650
 made next to Münchweiler 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.580
 al 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.900
 why very nice moment 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.979
 not conducive in the front 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.080
 so a few words from the function 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.569
 percent 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.889
 Barenberg Ehlers 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.599
 if the battery 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.379
 then half full is then 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.379
 sounds pull every 12 seconds 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.029
 which is really bad but read again 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.710
 he worried about time will change the battery then it is clear that lives there 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.909
 Wanted to take over groups, said widmer-schlumpf 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.680
 Erwin Prölls 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.310
 kes Bonhoff Power left hand on the light is from the power in the culprits well 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.110
 feel constantly EU and running out of battery in displays decides 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.189
 Milder is the Battery 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:36.639
 flat 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.499
 Of course, all this has to say something that will not of course 7 paintings room 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:43.710
 is saved, of course 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.780
 These were important points but look and woodier one has 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.819
 for the students 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:51.249
 had before 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:54.249
 by means of stay 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:58.379
 and still running and running to the 40th 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:12.539
 stay behind in the black light Rademacher 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.770
 the first is with the chip him 

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:22.330
 there was the world the soul delivered the next idea for the cover page 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.550
 You clearly see in the crisis region a bit unfair because their talents are not 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.539
 more 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:30.029
 more
