DPS<00:01:56.160> and<00:01:56.690> again<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.780> specifics<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:58.500> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
DPS and again the specifics are just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.290 
DPS and again the specifics are just
based<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> klaxxi<00:01:59.490> itself<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.820> next<00:02:03.060> we'll

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
based on the klaxxi itself so next we'll

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.850 
based on the klaxxi itself so next we'll
talk<00:02:03.480> about<00:02:03.630> some<00:02:04.050> avoidable<00:02:04.410> damage

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
talk about some avoidable damage

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.479 
talk about some avoidable damage
mechanics<00:02:05.010> that<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.510> avoid<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:07.830> DPS<00:02:08.250> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
mechanics that you can avoid as a DPS to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.150 
mechanics that you can avoid as a DPS to
help<00:02:08.640> your<00:02:08.789> raid<00:02:08.970> out<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:10.110> again<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:10.800> are<00:02:10.920> so

many<00:02:11.280> abilities<00:02:11.519> across<00:02:12.090> nine<00:02:12.330> clacks<00:02:12.629> it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
many abilities across nine clacks it's

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.080 
many abilities across nine clacks it's
not<00:02:13.080> worth<00:02:13.260> listing<00:02:13.620> them<00:02:13.739> all<00:02:13.890> but<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.060> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
not worth listing them all but here is a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.450 
not worth listing them all but here is a
list<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> main<00:02:15.930> ones<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.370> do

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
list of the main ones that you can do

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.430 
list of the main ones that you can do
something<00:02:17.700> about<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.390> assist<00:02:18.840> your<00:02:18.990> rate<00:02:19.200> or

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
something about to assist your rate or

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.500 
something about to assist your rate or
avoid<00:02:19.710> properly

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
avoid properly

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.770 
avoid properly
so<00:02:21.439> from<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.129> okok<00:02:22.610> pellucid<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.510> will<00:02:23.659> use

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
so from I okok pellucid you will use

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.280 
so from I okok pellucid you will use
calculation<00:02:24.560> which<00:02:25.549> basically<00:02:25.879> causes<00:02:26.269> a<00:02:26.780> few

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
calculation which basically causes a few

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.690 
calculation which basically causes a few
random<00:02:27.650> raid<00:02:27.799> members<00:02:28.129> usually<00:02:28.280> three<00:02:28.670> or

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
random raid members usually three or

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.360 
random raid members usually three or
four<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.689> be<00:02:29.720> linked<00:02:30.170> together<00:02:30.409> with<00:02:31.040> fiery

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
four to be linked together with fiery

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.170 
four to be linked together with fiery
beams<00:02:32.110> now<00:02:33.110> when<00:02:33.620> those<00:02:33.799> players<00:02:34.040> are<00:02:34.519> linked

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
beams now when those players are linked

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.270 
beams now when those players are linked
the<00:02:35.900> further<00:02:36.349> away<00:02:36.500> they<00:02:36.860> are<00:02:36.890> from<00:02:37.010> one

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
the further away they are from one

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.069 
the further away they are from one
another<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.940> less<00:02:38.120> damage<00:02:38.540> they<00:02:38.750> will<00:02:38.870> take

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
another the less damage they will take

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.780 
another the less damage they will take
so<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.650> main<00:02:39.920> thing<00:02:39.950> here<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.430> if<00:02:40.640> you're

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
so the main thing here is if you're

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.940 
so the main thing here is if you're
linked<00:02:41.000> together<00:02:41.150> with<00:02:41.480> someone<00:02:41.840> run<00:02:42.680> far

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
linked together with someone run far

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.589 
linked together with someone run far
away<00:02:43.069> from<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.489> rest<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.909> the<00:02:44.120> members<00:02:44.299> that

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
are also linked and until it's over it

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.110 
are also linked and until it's over it
doesn't<00:02:47.540> last<00:02:47.659> very<00:02:47.780> long<00:02:48.849> other<00:02:49.849> than<00:02:50.060> that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
doesn't last very long other than that

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.210 
doesn't last very long other than that
if<00:02:50.540> you're<00:02:50.810> not<00:02:50.930> linked<00:02:51.319> just<00:02:51.709> simply<00:02:52.040> avoid

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
if you're not linked just simply avoid

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.009 
if you're not linked just simply avoid
standing<00:02:52.879> in<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.209> beams<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.720> you'll<00:02:53.810> avoid

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
standing in the beams and you'll avoid

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.490 
standing in the beams and you'll avoid

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
the damage from Cara's the locust you

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.250 
the damage from Cara's the locust you
will<00:02:57.920> use<00:02:58.069> hurl<00:02:58.370> amber<00:02:58.940> which<00:02:59.870> as<00:03:00.079> you<00:03:00.170> might

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
will use hurl amber which as you might

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.610 
will use hurl amber which as you might
guess<00:03:00.500> drops<00:03:00.889> a<00:03:01.069> more<00:03:01.340> puddles<00:03:01.519> on<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.819> ground

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
guess drops a more puddles on the ground

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.899 
guess drops a more puddles on the ground
simply<00:03:03.620> just<00:03:03.769> avoid<00:03:04.040> Santa<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.489> those<00:03:04.609> pretty

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
heavy damage to that player as well as

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.539 
heavy damage to that player as well as
split<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.079> damage<00:03:27.440> among<00:03:27.709> anyone<00:03:28.129> that's<00:03:28.370> in

split that damage among anyone that's in

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.580 
split that damage among anyone that's in
a<00:03:28.609> straight<00:03:29.030> line<00:03:29.060> with<00:03:29.569> them<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.290> here<00:03:30.500> you

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
a straight line with them so here you

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.629 
a straight line with them so here you
can<00:03:30.620> see<00:03:30.889> the<00:03:31.010> aim<00:03:31.190> bar<00:03:31.629> in<00:03:32.629> front<00:03:33.199> of<00:03:33.349> me<00:03:33.440> there

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
can see the aim bar in front of me there

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.610 
can see the aim bar in front of me there
so<00:03:34.639> players<00:03:35.299> that<00:03:35.660> were<00:03:35.810> stacked<00:03:36.109> in<00:03:36.319> that

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
so players that were stacked in that

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.699 
so players that were stacked in that
line<00:03:36.919> which<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.340> was<00:03:37.519> not<00:03:37.730> because<00:03:37.970> I'm<00:03:38.090> mad

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
line which I was not because I'm mad

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.080 
line which I was not because I'm mad
we're<00:03:39.709> actually<00:03:39.980> splitting<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.579> damage<00:03:40.910> with

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
we're actually splitting the damage with

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.559 
we're actually splitting the damage with
a<00:03:41.120> targeted<00:03:41.660> player<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.769> goal<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.400> have

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
a targeted player so the goal is to have

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.789 
a targeted player so the goal is to have
most<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.750> raid<00:03:45.019> if<00:03:45.230> not<00:03:45.379> all<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.590> it

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
most of the raid if not all of it

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.490 
most of the raid if not all of it
stacking<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.549> that<00:03:46.730> line<00:03:47.000> but<00:03:47.959> not<00:03:48.319> actually

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
will kill you very quickly so other than

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.789 
will kill you very quickly so other than
that<00:04:16.579> it's<00:04:16.970> all<00:04:17.239> very<00:04:17.780> standard<00:04:18.229> stuff<00:04:18.440> that's

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
that it's all very standard stuff that's

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.819 
that it's all very standard stuff that's
not<00:04:19.489> really<00:04:19.729> avoidable<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:21.440> just<00:04:21.620> do<00:04:21.709> your

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
not really avoidable so just do your

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.969 
not really avoidable so just do your
best<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.550> stay<00:04:23.330> spread<00:04:23.570> out<00:04:23.750> around<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.800> room

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
best to stay spread out around the room

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.440 
best to stay spread out around the room
and<00:04:25.250> within<00:04:25.699> hill<00:04:25.970> range<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.389> elected<00:04:26.720> stuff

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
and within hill range and elected stuff

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.570 
and within hill range and elected stuff
so<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.570> final<00:04:29.810> thing<00:04:29.960> of<00:04:30.200> course<00:04:30.409> for<00:04:30.889> dps<00:04:31.310> is

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
so the final thing of course for dps is

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.000 
so the final thing of course for dps is
target<00:04:32.270> priority<00:04:32.810> basically<00:04:33.680> what<00:04:33.889> do<00:04:33.950> you

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
target priority basically what do you

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.640 
target priority basically what do you
attack<00:04:34.280> we

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
attack we

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.490 
attack we
and<00:04:35.040> what's<00:04:35.729> more<00:04:35.970> important<00:04:36.330> than<00:04:36.389> others<00:04:36.630> so

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
and what's more important than others so

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.230 
and what's more important than others so
on<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.650> screen<00:04:37.889> there<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.250> can<00:04:38.430> see<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.940> the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
on the screen there you can see that the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.260 
on the screen there you can see that the
basic<00:04:39.570> priority<00:04:40.110> for<00:04:40.620> your<00:04:40.800> attacks<00:04:41.190> if<00:04:41.490> any

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
basic priority for your attacks if any

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.670 
basic priority for your attacks if any
of<00:04:42.330> these<00:04:42.509> are<00:04:42.720> active<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:43.289> should<00:04:43.440> kill

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
of these are active you should kill

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.379 
of these are active you should kill
those<00:04:43.860> before<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.610> get<00:04:44.729> back<00:04:44.789> on<00:04:45.180> whatever

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
those before you get back on whatever

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.170 
those before you get back on whatever
boss<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.169> is<00:04:46.229> that<00:04:46.470> your<00:04:46.590> rate<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:46.830> killing<00:04:47.190> so

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
boss it is that your rate is killing so

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.840 
boss it is that your rate is killing so
first<00:04:48.780> is<00:04:49.020> amber<00:04:49.500> which<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:49.949> cast<00:04:50.190> by<00:04:50.430> Corvin

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
first is amber which is cast by Corvin

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.480 
first is amber which is cast by Corvin
the<00:04:50.940> Prime<00:04:51.560> basically<00:04:52.560> this<00:04:52.680> is<00:04:52.740> applied<00:04:53.250> to

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
the Prime basically this is applied to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.760 
the Prime basically this is applied to
klaxxi<00:04:54.449> that<00:04:54.630> reaches<00:04:54.930> fifty<00:04:55.199> percent<00:04:55.500> health

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
klaxxi that reaches fifty percent health

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.850 
klaxxi that reaches fifty percent health
and<00:04:56.039> after<00:04:56.759> 10<00:04:57.000> seconds<00:04:57.449> if<00:04:57.720> not<00:04:58.020> killed<00:04:58.380> it

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
and after 10 seconds if not killed it

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.469 
and after 10 seconds if not killed it
will<00:04:59.310> heal<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.669> klaxxi<00:05:00.000> back<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.240> full<00:05:00.449> health

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
will heal the klaxxi back to full health

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.520 
will heal the klaxxi back to full health
so<00:05:00.960> especially<00:05:01.949> when<00:05:02.490> you<00:05:02.759> have<00:05:03.060> Corvin<00:05:03.600> as

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
so especially when you have Corvin as

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:43.529 
that bug that couch on as soon as it

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.140 
that bug that couch on as soon as it
links<00:06:44.460> to<00:06:44.520> another<00:06:44.789> player

and this will prevent that player from
dying<00:06:48.190> essentially<00:06:49.320> so<00:06:50.320> that's<00:06:50.470> it<00:06:50.650> really<00:06:50.830> I
