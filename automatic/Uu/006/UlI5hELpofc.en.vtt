have to buy the solid state relays you
have<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.420> rebuy<00:00:36.750> them<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.649> there's<00:00:38.610> some

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
have to rebuy them so there's some

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.100 
have to rebuy them so there's some
different<00:00:38.940> products<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.480> buy<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:40.020> these

different products you can buy for these
relays<00:00:40.440> which<00:00:40.620> will<00:00:40.770> allow<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> dimming<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
relays which will allow the dimming and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.940

the<00:00:42.480> number<00:00:42.780> escapes<00:00:43.110> from<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> what

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the number escapes from now and what

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.470 
the number escapes from now and what
they<00:00:44.040> actually<00:00:44.160> called<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.730> I'll<00:00:44.879> post<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.420> on

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
they actually called so I'll post it on

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.260 
they actually called so I'll post it on
the<00:00:45.539> bottom<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.809> video<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:47.910> yeah<00:00:48.059> so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the bottom of this video but yeah so

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.400 
the bottom of this video but yeah so
here<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.809> they're<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.260> is

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
here you can see they're just this is

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.840 
here you can see they're just this is
the<00:00:49.469> basic<00:00:49.770> board<00:00:49.980> set<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.489> moment

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the basic board set at the moment

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.520 
the basic board set at the moment
nothing<00:00:51.510> much<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.440> like

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
nothing much going on so it's like

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.049 
nothing much going on so it's like
something<00:00:52.829> very<00:00:52.980> very<00:00:53.070> quick<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.760> just

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
something very very quick this is just

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.770 
something very very quick this is just
how<00:00:54.180> I've<00:00:54.300> set<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.570> my<00:00:54.660> my<00:00:55.410> plugs<00:00:56.360> all<00:00:57.360> powering

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
how I've set up my my plugs all powering

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.630 
how I've set up my my plugs all powering
off<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.140> power<00:00:58.379> supply<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.550> on

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
off of one power supply and you see on

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
off of one power supply and you see on
the<00:00:59.699> floor<00:00:59.820> they're<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.300> done<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.690> there's

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the floor they're just done here there's

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.740 
the floor they're just done here there's
my<00:01:01.469> circuit<00:01:01.800> breaker<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.940> main<00:01:03.090> power<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.539> is

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
my circuit breaker my main power then is

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.359 
my circuit breaker my main power then is
going<00:01:04.049> into<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.559> first<00:01:04.799> chop<00:01:04.979> block<00:01:05.100> here

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
going into the first chop block here

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.940 
going into the first chop block here
just<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> middle<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> video<00:01:06.960> this

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
just in the middle of the video this

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.370 
just in the middle of the video this
will<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:08.420> power<00:01:09.420> these<00:01:10.490> four<00:01:12.320> these<00:01:13.320> four

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
will then power these four these four

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
will then power these four these four
ways<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.159> plus<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> bottom<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.000> there's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
ways here plus the bottom one there's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.960 
ways here plus the bottom one there's
got<00:01:15.330> an<00:01:15.390> extra<00:01:15.600> plug<00:01:15.780> 5-pound<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:16.860> four<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
got an extra plug 5-pound these four and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.520 
got an extra plug 5-pound these four and
then<00:01:18.150> I've<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.330> looped<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> other

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
then I've just looped it to the other

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
then I've just looped it to the other
chop<00:01:19.710> block<00:01:19.799> at<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.009> top<00:01:20.250> which<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:20.939> feeds

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
chop block at the top which then feeds

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
chop block at the top which then feeds
the<00:01:21.450> power<00:01:21.659> supply<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> these<00:01:22.860> four<00:01:23.670> blocks

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the power supply to these four blocks

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.300 
the power supply to these four blocks
over<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.390> side<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.689> well<00:01:24.979> I'm<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> try

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
over this side as well I'm going to try

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.640 
over this side as well I'm going to try
this<00:01:26.369> year<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.880> underneath<00:01:27.270> each<00:01:27.450> one

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
this year is that underneath each one

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
this year is that underneath each one
it's<00:01:28.650> got<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> mini<00:01:29.040> chop<00:01:29.280> block<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.000> where

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's got a mini chop block this is where

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.319 
it's got a mini chop block this is where
my<00:01:30.450> my<00:01:31.259> light<00:01:31.470> feeds<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.670> say<00:01:33.150> we've

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
my my light feeds will go and say we've

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.530 
my my light feeds will go and say we've
got<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> plug<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.020> plug<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.540> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
got a plug it will plug in and then the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.359 
got a plug it will plug in and then the
neutral<00:01:36.900> side<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> positive<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
neutral side or the positive or the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.100 
neutral side or the positive or the
negative<00:01:38.520> side<00:01:39.299> would<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.570> into<00:01:39.720> either<00:01:39.990> one

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
negative side would go into either one

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.080 
negative side would go into either one
one<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.950> those<00:01:41.040> chopped<00:01:41.250> blocks<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
one of those chopped blocks and then the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.179 
one of those chopped blocks and then the
other<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.299> will<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.479> straight<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> relays

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
other one will go straight to the relays

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.319 
other one will go straight to the relays
that's<00:01:44.189> hard<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> explain<00:01:44.640> right<00:01:44.759> now<00:01:44.909> without

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that's hard to explain right now without

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.200 
that's hard to explain right now without
actually<00:01:45.659> being<00:01:45.810> plugged<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
actually being plugged in so just in the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.460 
actually being plugged in so just in the
center<00:01:48.509> there<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> force<00:01:49.290> group

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
center there you can see the force group

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.950 
center there you can see the force group
is<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.890> that's<00:01:50.280> where<00:01:50.460> my<00:01:50.640> my<00:01:51.180> my<00:01:51.659> board's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
is there that's where my my my board's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.300 
is there that's where my my my board's
going<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.740> Arduino<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> my

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
going to go with my Arduino and my

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.969 
going to go with my Arduino and my
relays<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> there's<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.470> much<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> explain

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
relays on so there's not much to explain

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.200 
relays on so there's not much to explain
on<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.189> part<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> video<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> moment<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.030> just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
on this part the video the moment I just

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
on this part the video the moment I just
wanted<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.450> show<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.659> my<00:01:58.140> board<00:01:58.979> setup<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.520> far

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
wanted to show you my board setup so far

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.300 
wanted to show you my board setup so far
with<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> power<00:02:00.390> supply<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:01.040> hope<00:02:02.040> you'll<00:02:02.189> come

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
with the power supply I hope you'll come

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980 
with the power supply I hope you'll come
back<00:02:02.369> within<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> next<00:02:03.030> couple<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.600> days<00:02:03.750> with

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
back within the next couple of days with

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.100 
back within the next couple of days with
it<00:02:04.020> all<00:02:04.200> set<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.540> running<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.960> can

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
it all set up and running and then I can

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.190 
it all set up and running and then I can
show<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.560> video<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.860> detail
