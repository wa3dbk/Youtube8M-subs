00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
start getting

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.870 
start getting
I'd<00:04:26.660> about<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:28.220> know<00:04:28.310> I<00:04:28.340> think<00:04:28.640> their

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
I'd about and you know I think their

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.000 
I'd about and you know I think their
commitment<00:04:29.540> because<00:04:29.750> it's<00:04:30.200> it's<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.680> most

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
commitment because it's it's the most

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.040 
commitment because it's it's the most
commitment<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.640> they've<00:04:31.820> really<00:04:32.120> made<00:04:32.150> from

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
commitment that they've really made from

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.840 
commitment that they've really made from
a<00:04:33.200> conference<00:04:33.500> standpoint<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.340> think<00:04:34.580> that's

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
a conference standpoint I think that's

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.920 
a conference standpoint I think that's
just<00:04:34.910> another<00:04:35.240> one<00:04:35.420> of<00:04:35.450> those<00:04:35.540> things<00:04:35.750> that's

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
just another one of those things that's

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.960 
just another one of those things that's
good<00:04:36.470> for<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.710> ACC<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.310> was<00:04:37.670> thinking<00:04:37.850> about

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
good for the ACC I was thinking about

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.730 
good for the ACC I was thinking about
this<00:04:38.150> there<00:04:38.300> were<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.480> bound<00:04:38.660> bulls<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.290> now

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
this there were the bound bulls and now

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.290 
this there were the bound bulls and now
you<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.340> Florida<00:04:40.610> State<00:04:40.640> have<00:04:40.940> gone<00:04:41.120> after

you and Florida State have gone after

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.850 
you and Florida State have gone after
each<00:04:41.540> other<00:04:41.750> last<00:04:42.230> few<00:04:42.440> years<00:04:42.470> for<00:04:42.770> the

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
each other last few years for the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.320 
each other last few years for the
Atlantic<00:04:43.130> Division<00:04:43.400> title<00:04:43.640> is<00:04:43.730> clemson

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330

Florida<00:04:44.750> State<00:04:44.960> now<00:04:45.140> one<00:04:45.380> of<00:04:45.410> these<00:04:45.530> big

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
Florida State now one of these big

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.190

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.670 
mean i think clemson florida state has
always<00:04:50.450> been<00:04:50.600> a<00:04:50.660> big<00:04:50.870> rivalry<00:04:51.080> in<00:04:51.380> college

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
now but it but i think as of late the

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.740 
now but it but i think as of late the
last<00:04:57.830> few<00:04:58.250> years<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:58.820> if<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.150> winner<00:04:59.390> of<00:04:59.480> that

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
last few years and if the winner of that

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.810 
last few years and if the winner of that
game<00:04:59.990> has<00:05:00.320> gone<00:05:00.560> on<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:01.550> know<00:05:01.610> when<00:05:01.790> our

know that we're going to always have our
traditional<00:05:55.340> rivalries<00:05:55.820> you<00:05:56.720> know<00:05:56.780> for

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
traditional rivalries you know for

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.420

Clemson<00:05:57.290> Florida<00:05:57.560> State<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:57.890> not<00:05:57.920> play<00:05:58.280> each

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
Clemson Florida State to not play each

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.250 
Clemson Florida State to not play each
other<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.670> don't<00:05:58.940> think<00:05:59.090> that's<00:05:59.150> good<00:05:59.450> for

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
other I don't think that's good for

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.050 
other I don't think that's good for
Clemson<00:06:00.890> Georgia<00:06:01.190> Tech<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:01.550> not<00:06:01.700> play<00:06:01.910> each

Clemson Georgia Tech to not play each

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.450 
Clemson Georgia Tech to not play each
other<00:06:02.210> that's<00:06:02.780> not<00:06:02.960> good<00:06:02.990> you<00:06:03.860> know<00:06:03.980> back<00:06:04.160> like

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
other that's not good you know back like

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.950 
other that's not good you know back like
when<00:06:04.640> I<00:06:04.670> was<00:06:04.760> at<00:06:04.940> Alabama<00:06:05.300> Alabama<00:06:05.600> and

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
when I was at Alabama Alabama and

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.660 
when I was at Alabama Alabama and
Tennessee<00:06:06.050> to<00:06:06.350> not<00:06:06.560> play<00:06:06.800> or<00:06:07.250> Alabama<00:06:07.550> in

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
Tennessee to not play or Alabama in

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.700 
Tennessee to not play or Alabama in
Auburn<00:06:07.790> at<00:06:08.090> you<00:06:08.360> know<00:06:08.480> so<00:06:08.660> I<00:06:08.690> think<00:06:09.050> we<00:06:09.590> would

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
Auburn at you know so I think we would

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.320 
Auburn at you know so I think we would
always<00:06:09.860> have<00:06:10.160> those<00:06:10.310> traditional<00:06:10.880> rivalries

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
always have those traditional rivalries

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.290 
always have those traditional rivalries
but<00:06:11.510> if<00:06:11.780> the<00:06:12.290> conference<00:06:12.740> with<00:06:13.730> the<00:06:13.910> expansion

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
but if the conference with the expansion

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.240 
but if the conference with the expansion
ever<00:06:14.870> felt<00:06:15.170> like<00:06:15.350> that<00:06:15.410> hey<00:06:15.710> we<00:06:15.860> need<00:06:15.980> to<00:06:16.040> maybe

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
ever felt like that hey we need to maybe

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.380 
ever felt like that hey we need to maybe
look<00:06:16.460> at<00:06:16.670> some<00:06:17.240> some<00:06:17.750> reshuffling<00:06:18.110> I<00:06:19.390> would

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
look at some some reshuffling I would

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.390 
look at some some reshuffling I would
not<00:06:20.570> have<00:06:20.780> a<00:06:20.810> problem<00:06:20.900> with<00:06:21.320> that<00:06:21.350> but<00:06:21.680> again<00:06:21.890> I

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
not have a problem with that but again I

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.970 
not have a problem with that but again I
would<00:06:22.670> want<00:06:22.850> to<00:06:22.910> protect<00:06:23.240> those<00:06:23.480> those<00:06:24.050> very

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
would want to protect those those very

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.530
