00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
so three centers all along there for the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.800 
so three centers all along there for the
second<00:02:03.280> line<00:02:03.369> they're<00:02:03.609> all<00:02:03.819> NHL<00:02:04.299> is<00:02:04.420> again<00:02:04.630> and

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
then if we go to the third line I think

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.300 
then if we go to the third line I think
we<00:02:07.240> have<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.929> think<00:02:08.200> these<00:02:08.319> are<00:02:08.380> shl<00:02:09.159> teams<00:02:10.110> so

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.740 
league they are I believe they're
Canadian<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.699> then<00:03:40.030> if<00:03:40.120> we<00:03:40.209> look<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.629> the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
Canadian and then if we look to the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.659 
Canadian and then if we look to the
goaltender's<00:03:41.470> here<00:03:41.620> we<00:03:41.769> got<00:03:41.919> Braden<00:03:42.519> Holtby

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
goaltender's here we got Braden Holtby

the<00:03:44.889> backup<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.310> believe<00:03:45.549> for<00:03:45.699> this<00:03:45.819> with<00:03:45.970> her

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
the backup I believe for this with her

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.009 
the backup I believe for this with her
Broncos<00:03:46.780> at<00:03:47.019> 70<00:03:47.769> overall<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:49.239> there<00:03:49.479> is<00:03:49.690> the

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
Broncos at 70 overall so there is the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.379 
Broncos at 70 overall so there is the
first<00:03:50.319> hockey<00:03:50.620> ultimate<00:03:51.280> team<00:03:51.549> team<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.239> the
