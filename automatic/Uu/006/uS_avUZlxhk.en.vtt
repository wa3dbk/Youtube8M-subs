I've got my straightedge laying on there
and<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.600> shine<00:00:56.839> my<00:00:56.989> light<00:00:57.229> through<00:00:57.559> on<00:00:57.680> this

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
and I shine my light through on this

can see the light coming through

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.010 
can see the light coming through
starting<00:01:03.649> about<00:01:03.949> here<00:01:04.479> all<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.660> way<00:01:05.750> back<00:01:05.990> so

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
starting about here all the way back so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.440 
starting about here all the way back so
that<00:01:06.320> means<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:06.679> part<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.039> the<00:01:07.160> steel<00:01:07.820> and

the hole is deformed I've got to make up
for<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:11.140> again<00:01:12.140> I'll<00:01:12.350> probably<00:01:12.560> do<00:01:12.800> it<00:01:12.920> with

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
for that again I'll probably do it with

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.570 
for that again I'll probably do it with
bondo<00:01:13.520> one<00:01:14.390> thing<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:14.720> wanted<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.140> try<00:01:15.350> this

this<00:01:22.580> is<00:01:22.759> normally<00:01:23.360> used<00:01:23.600> on<00:01:23.899> boats<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.259> run

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
this is normally used on boats that run

this is normally used on boats that run
over<00:01:24.560> 100<00:01:25.009> miles<00:01:25.190> an<00:01:25.399> hour<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.759> plutonium

it's been tried on 90 mile an hour book

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.169 
it's been tried on 90 mile an hour book
but<00:01:46.160> this<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.399> one<00:01:46.520> thing<00:01:46.700> I've<00:01:46.789> been<00:01:46.910> thinking

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
but this is one thing I've been thinking

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:54.520 
but this is one thing I've been thinking
about<00:01:47.209> trying<00:01:49.060> anyway<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:53.080> put<00:01:54.080> this<00:01:54.289> on

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
about trying anyway so I put this on

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.400 
about trying anyway so I put this on
here<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:55.039> noticed<00:01:55.489> there's<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.759> gap<00:01:56.229> I'm<00:01:57.229> not

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
here I noticed there's a gap I'm not

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.199 
here I noticed there's a gap I'm not
gonna<00:01:57.560> do<00:01:57.709> it<00:01:57.830> on<00:01:58.459> the<00:01:58.520> camera<00:01:58.970> because<00:01:59.030> it

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
gonna do it on the camera because it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.699 
gonna do it on the camera because it
takes<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.479> while<00:01:59.629> but<00:01:59.840> what<00:01:59.989> I'll<00:02:00.110> do<00:02:00.319> is<00:02:00.530> I'll

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
takes a while but what I'll do is I'll

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:05.020 
takes a while but what I'll do is I'll
fill<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.099> in<00:02:01.369> I'll<00:02:01.580> bondo<00:02:01.970> this<00:02:02.149> in<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:04.030> hump

flat<00:02:22.430> line<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.200> start<00:02:24.440> measuring<00:02:25.780> let's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
flat line and I start measuring let's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.420 
flat line and I start measuring let's
call<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.080> right<00:02:27.260> blade<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.069> what<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
call the right blade this is what the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.309 
call the right blade this is what the
boat<00:02:28.580> rares<00:02:28.849> back<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.540> start<00:02:29.900> measuring<00:02:30.170> to

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
boat rares back on I start measuring to

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.170 
boat rares back on I start measuring to
this<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.519> giving<00:02:31.730> me<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.819> rough<00:02:32.000> idea

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
this this is just giving me a rough idea

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.580 
this this is just giving me a rough idea
when<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.510> get<00:02:32.720> serious<00:02:32.989> about<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.379> I'll

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
when I get serious about it I'll

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.620 
when I get serious about it I'll
actually<00:02:33.800> use<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.430> steel<00:02:35.440> ruler<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:38.000> far<00:02:38.240> it's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
actually use a steel ruler so far it's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.340 
actually use a steel ruler so far it's
all<00:02:38.780> pretty<00:02:39.050> cool

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
all pretty cool

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.880 
all pretty cool
in<00:02:39.830> other<00:02:40.190> words<00:02:40.430> this<00:02:40.760> plate<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:42.590> in

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
in other words this plate is in

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.310 
in other words this plate is in
relationship<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.840> flat<00:02:45.020> part<00:02:45.260> of

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
relationship to that the flat part of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.810 
relationship to that the flat part of
the<00:02:45.380> boat<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:45.980> all<00:02:46.160> square

you know go from 90 to about 60 the bolt

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.440 
you know go from 90 to about 60 the bolt
will<00:03:33.740> actually<00:03:34.070> start<00:03:34.310> inhaling<00:03:34.550> air<00:03:35.180> into

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
will actually start inhaling air into

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
the steering and the boat slowly turns

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.770 
the steering and the boat slowly turns
it'll<00:03:40.430> turn<00:03:40.550> left<00:03:40.820> or<00:03:41.030> turn<00:03:41.210> right<00:03:41.270> I<00:03:41.480> can't

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
it'll turn left or turn right I can't

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
predict which way it's going to go I've

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.230 
predict which way it's going to go I've
been<00:03:43.040> wondering<00:03:43.340> what<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.550> problem<00:03:43.730> was<00:03:44.060> all

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240
