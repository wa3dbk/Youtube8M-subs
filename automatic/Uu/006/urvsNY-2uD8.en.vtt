00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 and efficient double-double dollars 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.799
 next to have a little character 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.769
 on this day we're going to see exercise number one and warm up 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.070
 Warm up exercise number one is very simple 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.419
 all they have to do is press 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.539
 in each of the frets we want here on the guitar 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.990
 this is the first or the second the third and the fourth 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.990
 for each of these frets we are going to use 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.760
 one time 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.340
 in this case the index finger 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.740
 let's use for this disorder 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.100
 the middle finger we are going to use for this fret all the quotas that are 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.660
 find this stumble 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.680
 the ring finger for all the strings are in this fret and the little finger 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.690
 for all the strings that are in this trance 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.690
 the thumb always goes in the back 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.160
 so that there is a correct pressure of the tedax 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.910
 the execution of the following 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 we press with the finger on the first string 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.450
 in the first stroke 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 and with the right hand we just touch the first door 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
 you can touch it with the index finger in the right hand 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 when you have clear sound 1 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.910
 you can continue with the next one because if you put it here, the star will sound 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.810
 incorrect 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.979
 navarra - January pieces and neither if you put it here in the separator 1 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 the correct way to put that is here in the center 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.810
 if you realize it is with the tip of the finger 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.020
 it's with the part of kiev that I know what is placed 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.270
 ee in the fourth 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.480
 when I have a clear sound do the same 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 but with the next time 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.930
 remember that I will always respond in half the traffic 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.870
 then we go with the third regrowth 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.980
 and we go with the fourth of that 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.340
 with your right hand you just touch with the index finger do not put much 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.619
 tension for the moment 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.619
 The important thing is that this exercise is not clear 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.799
 I'm going to repeat it 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.589
 very well after you already have 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.589
 perfected you become the hotel sound 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.729
 will continue with the following with the feel accounts 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.179
 for me that is to say enough and going up 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:42.589

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.200

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:02.489
 very well 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.680
 remember that for the sound to be clear you always put the half back 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.969
 that's what more before and after 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:10.489
