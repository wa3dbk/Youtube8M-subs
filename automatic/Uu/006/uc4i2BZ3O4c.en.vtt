00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.970 
some bantu knots all around and then
later<00:02:17.209> we<00:02:17.450> took<00:02:17.480> them<00:02:17.810> down<00:02:18.019> once<00:02:18.410> my<00:02:18.560> hair<00:02:18.709> was

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
later we took them down once my hair was

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.000 
later we took them down once my hair was
about<00:02:19.190> 75%<00:02:19.760> dry<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.540> it's<00:02:20.660> just<00:02:20.930> drying<00:02:21.200> still

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
about 75% dry and it's just drying still

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.070 
about 75% dry and it's just drying still
dancing<00:02:22.519> here<00:02:22.970> actually<00:02:23.150> they're<00:02:23.840> still

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
dancing here actually they're still

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.830 
dancing here actually they're still
drying<00:02:24.320> out<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:24.830> basically<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.280> only<00:02:25.660> use<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
drying out but basically I only use the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.620 
drying out but basically I only use the
batching<00:02:27.230> off<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.560> air<00:02:27.739> dry<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.420> would

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
batching off the air dry so that I would

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.330 
batching off the air dry so that I would
have<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> more<00:02:30.140> stressed-out<00:02:30.470> look<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.130> also

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
have a more stressed-out look but also

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.720 
have a more stressed-out look but also
when<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.420> pull<00:02:32.600> my<00:02:32.690> hair<00:02:32.900> into<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.380> bun<00:02:33.739> or<00:02:34.250> too

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
when I pull my hair into a bun or too

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.320 
when I pull my hair into a bun or too
many<00:02:34.910> buns<00:02:35.500> my<00:02:36.500> hair<00:02:36.739> gives<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.610> flatter<00:02:37.940> look

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
many buns my hair gives a flatter look

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.850 
many buns my hair gives a flatter look
because<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.810> bantu<00:02:39.140> knots<00:02:39.350> have<00:02:39.560> stretched

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
because the bantu knots have stretched

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.120 
because the bantu knots have stretched
out<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.370> roots<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:41.320> lot<00:02:42.320> more<00:02:42.590> than<00:02:42.829> if<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.100> just

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
out the roots a lot more than if I just

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.340 
out the roots a lot more than if I just
try<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.579> wash<00:02:43.850> my<00:02:44.060> hair<00:02:44.239> put<00:02:44.480> in<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.720> twist<00:02:45.079> and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
try to wash my hair put in a twist and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.809 
try to wash my hair put in a twist and
then

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
then

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.970 
then
try<00:02:45.939> to<00:02:45.999> put<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.329> in<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.480> bun<00:02:46.659> afterwards<00:02:47.200> so

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
try to put it in a bun afterwards so

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.129 
try to put it in a bun afterwards so
yeah<00:02:48.129> it<00:02:48.879> stretched<00:02:49.359> out<00:02:49.540> there<00:02:49.749> it's<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:50.019> lot

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
yeah it stretched out there it's a lot

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:55.020 
yeah it stretched out there it's a lot
better<00:02:51.329> so<00:02:52.329> yeah<00:02:52.959> that's<00:02:53.760> what<00:02:54.760> I've<00:02:54.969> got

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
better so yeah that's what I've got

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.199 
better so yeah that's what I've got
going<00:02:56.879> really<00:02:57.989> loose<00:02:58.989> bantu<00:02:59.560> knot<00:03:00.209> so

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
going really loose bantu knot so

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.209 
going really loose bantu knot so
basically<00:03:01.689> I'll<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.139> so<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.739> way<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.069> has

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
basically I'll it so this way it has

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.339 
basically I'll it so this way it has
ways<00:03:03.609> more<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.299> then<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.569> starts<00:03:04.930> will<00:03:05.079> curls

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
ways more and then it starts will curls

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.949 
ways more and then it starts will curls
on<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.680> ends<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:06.719> basically<00:03:07.719> because

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
on the ends but basically because

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.410 
on the ends but basically because
because<00:03:08.799> it<00:03:08.920> wasn't<00:03:09.219> fully<00:03:09.459> dry

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
because it wasn't fully dry

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.619 
because it wasn't fully dry
it<00:03:11.049> didn't<00:03:11.439> get<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.829> kind<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.430> get<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.419> full

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
it didn't get to kind of get the full

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.170 
it didn't get to kind of get the full
curl<00:03:14.019> thing<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:14.739> got<00:03:14.889> nice<00:03:15.129> ways<00:03:15.459> which<00:03:16.060> I

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
curl thing so it's got nice ways which I

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.309 
curl thing so it's got nice ways which I
like<00:03:16.389> actually<00:03:16.689> and<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:19.450> that's<00:03:19.659> it<00:03:19.840> really

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
like actually and and that's it really

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.619 
like actually and and that's it really
so<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:21.069> do<00:03:21.370> like<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.819> hair<00:03:22.359> maintenance

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
so I do like that hair maintenance

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.599 
so I do like that hair maintenance
treatment<00:03:23.349> it<00:03:23.739> doesn't<00:03:24.129> have<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.280> weird

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
treatment it doesn't have a weird

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.929 
treatment it doesn't have a weird
texture<00:03:25.000> or<00:03:25.299> smell<00:03:25.599> it's<00:03:26.260> some<00:03:26.680> thick<00:03:27.159> but

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
texture or smell it's some thick but

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.909 
texture or smell it's some thick but
that's<00:03:28.150> what<00:03:28.449> I<00:03:28.480> expect<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.349> doesn't<00:03:29.799> make

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
that's what I expect it doesn't make

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.059 
that's what I expect it doesn't make
your<00:03:30.040> hair<00:03:30.099> too<00:03:30.219> hard<00:03:30.669> and<00:03:31.829> basically<00:03:32.829> does

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
your hair too hard and basically does

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.470 
your hair too hard and basically does
make<00:03:33.219> your<00:03:33.370> hair<00:03:33.489> heart<00:03:33.519> after<00:03:34.239> you<00:03:34.299> wash<00:03:34.449> that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
make your hair heart after you wash that

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.390 
make your hair heart after you wash that
and<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.290> does<00:03:35.500> like<00:03:35.769> leave<00:03:35.980> your<00:03:36.010> hair<00:03:36.250> quite

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
and it does like leave your hair quite

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.209 
and it does like leave your hair quite
soft<00:03:36.730> so<00:03:36.849> it's<00:03:37.150> good<00:03:37.750> moisture<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.829> protein

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:39.219 
soft so it's good moisture of protein

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.849 
soft so it's good moisture of protein
balance<00:03:39.459> in<00:03:39.819> there<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.959> I'll<00:03:41.439> definitely<00:03:41.590> be

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
balance in there so I'll definitely be

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.500 
balance in there so I'll definitely be
using<00:03:42.040> again<00:03:42.430> I'll<00:03:42.730> be<00:03:42.939> doing<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.299> more

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
using again I'll be doing a more

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.929 
using again I'll be doing a more
