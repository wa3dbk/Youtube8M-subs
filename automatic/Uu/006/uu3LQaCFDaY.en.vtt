00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.566
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:04.366
When we reach the middle of the year,
what comes to our minds, Duca?

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.533
June Fest.

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.600
And that's why today's recipe
is inspired by this festivity,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.666
-that happens every June.
-But the recipe is so good,

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.266
that you can make all year long.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.666
CREAMY PAMONHA

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.933
1 CUP OF SWEET CORN

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.833
1/2 CUP OF COCONUT MILK

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.333
1 SPOON OF BUTTER

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.433
2 TABLE SPOONS OF SUGAR

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:37.033
BLEND IT

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:42.033
TAKE IT TO THE FRIDGE
UNTIL IT IS COLD

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.666
SERVE IT WITH CINNAMON POWDER

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:53.766
The festivities have so many foods,
it is difficult to choose only one.

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:57.133
I always save room for pamonha,
and you, Duca?

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.966
In my belly there's room
for everything.

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.766
I go to each tent
and eat a little bit,

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.966
to taste everything.

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:07.433
Then I go to another June Fest
to eat a little more.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:10.533
I eat until July.
July Fest, why not?

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.100
-This is a good tip.
-From tent to tent.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.133
From sweet to sweet.

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.300
From forró to forró.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.000
From arrocha to arrocha.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.900
And the sofrência?

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.733
Must be it, we must
suffer in the June Fest.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.133
COMMENTS OF THE WEEK

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:29.066
Before we read the first comment

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:33.100
I have a confession to make, Duca.
I love reading all the comments.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.466
-We really read them all.
-Really.

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:40.866
We can't answer them all,
we can't put them all here,

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.666
but we read all of them.

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:46.300
So, send your comment because
we are going to read it.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.000
And remember, in any language.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:52.266
And Stephanie said that
she doesn't like pudding,

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:55.766
but the one with dulce de leche
made her mouth water.

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.933
-How come you don't like pudding?
-I've never met someone

00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:00.366
who doesn't like pudding.

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.700
Thus, you said it made your mouth water,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.100
and I bet you made the recipe,
ate and loved it, right, Steph?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.033
But this one is made
with dulce de leche, right?

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.166
Mariane said:
I called my father Pudding.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.100
Great compliment!

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.300
Mari, does he like this compliment?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.766
I'd like to be called Pudding.

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.533
I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:24.700
It's loving.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.833
It's cute.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:27.400
And Ian said:

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:36.800
We are trying,
we are making an effort.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.500
After all, we love that vibe,
eating is a cultural act

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.933
and we are showing Brazilian cookery
for the world.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.933
-Did you like this video?
-Like it, share it, favorite it.

00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:54.000

June Fest food.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.433

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:58.000
come to Brazil.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.333
