 socially positively surprised

 who are with these not with these plans 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.780
 in the tweets that are collected to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.670
 below the source the description 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.560
 logically you can see some of the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.470
 examples that highlight the hype that 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.460
 has raised the internal presentation 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.160
 logically 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.580
 are your company employees and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.680
 they have to raise hype but the truth 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.990
 is that with games like quantum break or 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.970
 rise of the tomb raider 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.010
 remember that Microsoft already announced that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.410
 I had titles 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.270
 many titles for next year 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.970
 as even games that would come out for 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.400
 year 2016 and they did not want to saturate the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.340
 calendar 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.620
 up there everything is all right and the truth 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.430
 is that it was the tweets that you can see 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.140
 the source the description as you can see 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.850
 that great hype that has taken over 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.630
 all of them and the truth is that 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.600
 augur a great year for xbox as soon as 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.330
 to games so let's hope it will be like that 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.060
 we hope that enough consoles come 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.729
 and hopefully above all that we leave 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.890
 benefited us the players that 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.840
 there are no problems that do not have any 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.470
 kind of problems the servers the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.960
