I couldn't make them spawn each time

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.380 
I couldn't make them spawn each time
because<00:02:41.070> they'd<00:02:41.340> spawn<00:02:41.640> around<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.240> map

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
because they'd spawn around the map

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.660 
because they'd spawn around the map
crazily<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.230> start<00:02:43.530> rapidly<00:02:44.190> killing<00:02:44.520> you
