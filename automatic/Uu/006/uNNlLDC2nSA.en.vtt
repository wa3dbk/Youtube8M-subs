00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 and welcome to the mod 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:09.210
 Presentation of the broker turbo tractor 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.870
 is from the broker 95 and some become him 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.219
 have seen or maybe are too 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.800
 just come across him 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.210
 if you see the video yes that wants the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.580
 I do not think of big now 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.859
 drove a bit faster than that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.539
 normal everyday life is a job we need 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.740
 do not look then everything is the same and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.250
 remained the same except that the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.710
 description missing or we look 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.320
 how he would manage to do so with the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.320
 physics with the driving behavior is it too 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.210
 had quite funny in the comments had 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.210
 I saw something of 440 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:55.050
 300 is the same and unfortunately the website 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.260
 respect beautiful new beautiful dreams okay 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.260
 on 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.199
 how it works 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.640
 once again across the network again and again 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.470
 managed even 200 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:21.310
 So as I said it is in 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:23.940
 rhineland-palatinate trees well understood 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.340
 that drives a bit faster than 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.710
 the normal or the number in tractors 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 So as if I just said fashion and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.659
 katy winter not too much at first easy 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.979
 try it has also loaded 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.380
 that actually quite from the point of view 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:48.690
 I would use it now, too 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.690
 not necessarily but still okay okay 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.009
 I'll say that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.950
 very funny mod dementiewa comparison 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.500
 peter eraser has indeed turned but 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.640
 I need the model of mod now 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.160
 not necessarily to fly around 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.280
 Water was quite fun though 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.480
 but not too good for you anymore 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.579
 the wish presentation nevertheless fallen 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.019
 and let me like it there and still 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.650
 very important thanks for the 100th 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.110
 subscribers 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.390
 we cracked it now because 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.640
 I just do not have that good life 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.380
 I had enough subscribers 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.470
 thanks thank you thank you 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.519
 the package that's going on really well 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.480
 and I'm so speechless that I already 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.810
 to promise again 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.530
 well then we see us nothing 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.530
 until then or
