 supplementary to the sun or changes 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.960
 of temperature the benefits of 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.480
 carrot in the skin the saying of we are 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.000
 what we eat is something that every day that 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.700
 happens more convinces me and is that it does not fit 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.190
 doubt that a good diet is over 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.680

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.510
 aspect is the case of one of the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.810
 foods that we are going to talk about today

 the carrot aside from being a food 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.460
 ideal for many diets due to its 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.280
 low caloric intake and its high content 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.500
 We are facing a food 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.900

 of this food are based on a high 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.010

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.720
 antioxidants these last ones we 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.810
 to fight the signs of aging 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.420
 and to protect our skin before 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.550

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.030
 to our skin to maintain a color 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.850
 tanned since it stimulates training 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.410
 of melanin so it is a great ally 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.440
 to keep the color you've 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.780
 got this summer that yes no 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.270

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.160
 produce a yellowish orange color in 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.250
 the palms of the hands and feet 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.310
 It is also ideal to fight the skin 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.920

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.510

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.730
 puree and add an egg white it 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.890
 they mix and we already have a mask 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.800
 ready to apply to our skin that 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.770
 you should let it rest for half an hour and 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.290
