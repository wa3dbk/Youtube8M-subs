00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
you don't see too much of a reflection

this<00:00:39.890> ok<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.370> free<00:00:41.700> version<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.780> free

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this ok so the free version the free

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990 
this ok so the free version the free
version<00:00:46.170> only<00:00:46.500> allows<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.219> create<00:00:47.399> one

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
version only allows you to create one

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.569 
version only allows you to create one
image<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.840> pretty<00:00:49.140> stupid<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.430> can

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
image which is pretty stupid but you can

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.959 
image which is pretty stupid but you can
still<00:00:50.760> export<00:00:51.329> them<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.960> photo<00:00:52.649> library

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
still export them to your photo library

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.850 
still export them to your photo library
so<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.300> guess<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.989> could<00:00:55.020> make<00:00:55.410> more<00:00:55.620> than<00:00:55.680> one

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
so I guess you could make more than one

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.130 
so I guess you could make more than one
image<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.879> they<00:00:57.210> won't<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
image but they won't be in here and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.010 
image but they won't be in here and
categorize<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.250> could<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.960> click

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
categorize like you could so if I click
