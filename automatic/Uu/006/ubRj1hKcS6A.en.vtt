Hello everyone, I really love watching s'morning routines for school, so in this video I am going to share with you my school morning routine. I've tried to make it quite unique and creative so I hope you like it
The first thing that I do after I wake up is check all my social media such as Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook.. Then I head into my closet and get dressed. In this video I'm wearing a black t-shirt, cardigan and skirt skirt socks from Topshop. After I've changed I go to the bathroom and brush my teeth as well as wash my face. I always use Jojoba oil to hydrate my skin. I never do anything special with my hair so I just throw it in a messy ponytail. My everyday makeup is very simple as I don't really wear makeup - I just use the Collection Lasting Perfection concealer under my eyes and a Maybelline mascara. Then I take my school bag and go downstairs where I have my breakfast which usually consists of cornflakes. After I've eaten I put on my coat from and my boots and go to school by car.
