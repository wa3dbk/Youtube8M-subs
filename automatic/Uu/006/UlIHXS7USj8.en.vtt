00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.509 

this<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.319> original<00:00:07.410> battery<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.280> came

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
this is the original battery that came

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.459 
this is the original battery that came
with<00:00:08.700> spiky<00:00:09.120> I'm<00:00:09.330> going<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.809> open<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.170> up<00:00:10.290> and

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
with spiky I'm going to open it up and

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:44.869 
with spiky I'm going to open it up and
look<00:00:10.559> at<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.980> individual<00:00:11.490> cells

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.649 

so<00:00:45.879> this<00:00:46.030> is<00:00:46.180> just<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.510> single<00:00:46.809> battery<00:00:48.659> there's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
so this is just a single battery there's

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:57.750 
so this is just a single battery there's
eight<00:00:49.960> of<00:00:49.989> them<00:00:50.320> total<00:00:56.370> okay<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.610> voltage

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
eight of them total okay so the voltage

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:12.420 
eight of them total okay so the voltage
of<00:00:58.210> one<00:00:58.809> of<00:00:58.930> these<00:00:58.989> batteries<00:01:01.620> 1.3<00:01:02.620> volts

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.990 

so<00:01:13.060> here's<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.360> bad<00:01:13.600> sale<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.500> still<00:01:14.800> is<00:01:15.070> at

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
so here's a bad sale the still is at

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.570 
so here's a bad sale the still is at
about<00:01:16.240> zero<00:01:16.600> volts<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.310> sale<00:01:18.550> is

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
about zero volts so this sale is

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.240 
about zero volts so this sale is
defective<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.510> it<00:01:20.290> would<00:01:20.410> lower<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:21.010> overall

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
defective and it would lower the overall

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.990 
defective and it would lower the overall
voltage<00:01:22.120> of<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.630> entire<00:01:22.930> pack<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.280> I<00:01:24.310> have<00:01:24.940> a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
voltage of the entire pack so I have a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
voltage of the entire pack so I have a
little<00:01:25.180> box<00:01:25.510> here<00:01:26.020> says<00:01:26.680> ng<00:01:27.280> for<00:01:27.580> no<00:01:27.729> good<00:01:28.020> I'm

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
little box here says ng for no good I'm

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.010 
little box here says ng for no good I'm
going<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.260> put<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.500> bad<00:01:29.680> fill<00:01:30.070> in<00:01:30.280> there

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.630 

that's<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.200> good<00:01:35.350> voltage<00:01:37.830> that<00:01:38.830> one<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.310> zero

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
that's a good voltage that one is zero

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.100 
that's a good voltage that one is zero
volt<00:01:42.570> good<00:01:43.570> voltage<00:01:44.790> good<00:01:45.790> voltage<00:01:46.979> good<00:01:47.979> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
volt good voltage good voltage good and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.260 
volt good voltage good voltage good and
good<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.890> out<00:01:51.009> of<00:01:51.040> all<00:01:51.280> these<00:01:51.490> batteries<00:01:52.000> out

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
good so out of all these batteries out

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.420 
good so out of all these batteries out
of<00:01:52.630> all<00:01:52.869> these<00:01:52.990> cells<00:01:53.320> we<00:01:53.560> have<00:01:53.740> two<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.369> are

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
of all these cells we have two that are

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:03.150 
of all these cells we have two that are
bad<00:02:00.570> these<00:02:01.570> six<00:02:01.899> cells<00:02:02.170> could<00:02:02.619> be<00:02:02.770> used<00:02:03.040> for

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
bad these six cells could be used for

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.210 
bad these six cells could be used for
something<00:02:03.520> else<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.290> these<00:02:05.290> two<00:02:05.590> may<00:02:06.160> be

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
something else and these two may be

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.050 
something else and these two may be
reconditioned<00:02:07.000> I'm<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.509> trice<00:02:07.780> urging<00:02:08.290> them<00:02:08.470> to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
reconditioned I'm a trice urging them to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.230 
reconditioned I'm a trice urging them to
see<00:02:10.060> if<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.270> can<00:02:10.450> recondition<00:02:11.050> them
