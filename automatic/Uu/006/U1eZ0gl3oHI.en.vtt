00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
let's go ahead and talk about it and as

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.160 
let's go ahead and talk about it and as
you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.989> see<00:00:34.550> it<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.120> light<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.840> has

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
you can see it is a light that has

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.369 
you can see it is a light that has
basically<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.950> linear<00:00:39.110> configuration<00:00:40.110> you've

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
basically a linear configuration you've

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.069 
basically a linear configuration you've
got<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:41.010> total<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.640> four<00:00:41.879> diodes<00:00:42.239> running

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
got a total of four diodes running

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
got a total of four diodes running

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
across a deep dish reflector in this

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.450 
across a deep dish reflector in this
particular<00:00:45.600> light<00:00:46.110> head<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.829> has<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> black

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
particular light head it has a black

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.910 
particular light head it has a black
flange<00:00:48.289> which<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.620> comes<00:00:49.770> with

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
flange which is what it comes with

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.010 
flange which is what it comes with
standard<00:00:50.250> along<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.180> some<00:00:51.329> mounting<00:00:51.690> screws

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.500 
wiring that's a variety of wiring coming
out<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.370> light<00:01:02.579> by<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.789> way<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.120> also

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
out here this light by the way is also

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.560 
out here this light by the way is also
synchronize<00:01:03.989> double<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.500> relation<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.129> other

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
synchronize double in relation to other

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.990 
synchronize double in relation to other
sngl<00:01:06.570> five<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> has<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.500> sinc<00:01:08.040> function<00:01:08.880> as

this<00:01:19.259> particular<00:01:19.650> head<00:01:20.009> itself<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.720> thing

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
this particular head itself so the thing

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.510 
this particular head itself so the thing
is<00:01:22.110> proof<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> pudding<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
is proof is in the pudding I'm going to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.490 
is proof is in the pudding I'm going to
go<00:01:23.610> ahead<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.880> turn<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.689> has<00:01:25.140> an<00:01:25.290> amp

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
go ahead and turn it on it has an amp

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
go ahead and turn it on it has an amp
draw<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.860> about<00:01:26.570> 0.25<00:01:27.590> amps<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.130> operates

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
draw of about 0.25 amps and it operates

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700 
draw of about 0.25 amps and it operates
in<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> voltage<00:01:30.060> range<00:01:30.270> between<00:01:30.509> 12<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.200> 24

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
in a voltage range between 12 and 24
volts<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.189> again<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.850> could<00:01:33.000> potentially<00:01:33.150> use

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
volts so again you could potentially use

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.980 
volts so again you could potentially use
this<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.220> 24<00:01:35.220> volt<00:01:35.250> vehicle<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.750> need

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
this on a 24 volt vehicle if that need

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.289 
this on a 24 volt vehicle if that need
