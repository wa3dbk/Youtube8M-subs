00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 I'll bring you back today with the same recipe. 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.000
 natural alternative for hair that 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.730
 It's with rich milk. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.009
 I'll tell you some of the benefits first. 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.060
 of coconut milk 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.090
 The coconut pulp contains 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.949
 b mineral salts and is very rich 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.359
 in saturated acids and fatty acids 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.510
 are also known as spam megas 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.540
 namely 63 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 the mega 6 and others 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.640
 coconut milk has proteins between it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.379
 the avenine to mines and china in being year 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.570
 hair is mainly made up of 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.420
 by proteins 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 so the coconut milk is acting 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.840
 as a capillary reconstructor 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.199
 coconut milk lubricates moisturizes and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 strengthens the root and yarns 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.650
 hair growth and prevent reminding 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.770
 pre-built fels heating 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.360
 I did not cut a medium coconut the preference 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 that the body is quite dry well 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.420
 dry, which means that the drier the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.240
 amount of oil so I will do so 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.310
 tite does not hit the blender and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 and then the bike to 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.770
 apply back with your hair already fired 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.270
 already dividing in two 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.509
 parts and here is my coconut milk 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 I hit the ground with a little water. I hit it. 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:47.250
 well concentrated and gave this much has to 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.530
 stay well focused well people 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.500
 concentrates even more concentrated and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.299
 You can leave as astor week and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.299
 said I'll make the application with 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:02.340
 brush even then the application starts 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:07.740
 throughout the scalp and also 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.780
 hair I forgot to talk but milk 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.520
 coconut is also suitable for people 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.180
 what 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.780
 people who have hair loss 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.780
 are suffering 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:14.980
 I'll wait 30 to 40 minutes. 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.340
 hydration will apply rinse with 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.310
 with the coconut milk later in 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.000
 chicago and I'll be right back with him after he's dry. 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.359
 for you to see the result of it I get 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.420
 I returned with my curly humid conditions and has 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:37.569
 finished and combed hairstyle that I 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.069
 I did this one here with two little 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:47.980
 two tic tac flowers and here on the side 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:50.019
 souto volume good people spent tent vale 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.669
 the penalty 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.689
 at least one to two times in the 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.109
 week 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.930
 make a hydration with coconut milk 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:05.260
 There are people who use milk from the bottle but 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.579
 I prefer to use coconut in your preference. 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.430
 do the whole process 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:13.449
 tap penella and then make the application 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.639
 but for those who do not have the time or not 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:18.699
 have very easily in coconut can find 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:22.240
 to be doing with a bottle of milk 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:24.639
 even at the time of application of the milk 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.949
 hair corrected since it had only washed 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.169
 he with shampoo did not even 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.610
 then at the time of the application of 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.680
 coconut has been fixed 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.840
 after I got the date that the 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.680
 I conditioned that you took out the stiffness and hair 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.310
 stayed but I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:48.120
 plus an alternative tip and treatment 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.120
