will<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.989> $20<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.289> wrong<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.460> means

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
will be $20 so wrong so that means

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
will be $20 so wrong so that means
people<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.180> buy<00:01:03.589> thousands<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.799> thousands

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
people can buy thousands and thousands

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.399 
people can buy thousands and thousands
of<00:01:05.309> pieces<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.450> manufacture<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.229> right

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
of pieces so you manufacture them right

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.640 
of pieces so you manufacture them right
here<00:01:07.680> yes<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.760> right<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.409> with

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
here yes all right so this one is with

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.039 
here yes all right so this one is with
triple-a<00:01:11.070> battery<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.670> let's<00:01:12.270> try<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> do

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
triple-a battery so let's try to do

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.609 
triple-a battery so let's try to do
unboxing<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> take<00:01:14.610> off<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.619> there

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
unboxing so you can take off the there

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
unboxing so you can take off the there
and<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.700> also<00:01:18.119> compare<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and we can also compare with the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.399 
and we can also compare with the
previous<00:01:19.320> one

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
previous one

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.470 
previous one
let's<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.250> also

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.610 

so<00:01:30.480> what's<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> difference<00:01:30.990> between<00:01:31.290> those

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
so what's the difference between those

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.870 
so what's the difference between those
two<00:01:32.900> actually<00:01:33.900> they're<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:35.010> performance<00:01:35.580> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
two actually they're the performance of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.990 
two actually they're the performance of
this<00:01:36.510> two<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.620> them<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.820> say

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
this two if it is them you can say

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.640 
this two if it is them you can say
owning<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.630> few<00:01:40.040> kiss<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.310> different<00:01:42.650> so

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
owning a few kiss was different so

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.130 
owning a few kiss was different so
there's<00:01:43.980> a<00:01:44.100> fewer<00:01:44.760> keys<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.390> bit<00:01:45.510> yes

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
there's a fewer keys a little bit yes

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.320 
there's a fewer keys a little bit yes
it's<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> light<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.760> what<00:01:47.940> what<00:01:48.210> is

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
it's just a light on so what what is

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.140 
it's just a light on so what what is
taken<00:01:48.690> away<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.140> moved<00:01:49.490> we<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.730> take<00:01:51.000> away

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
taken away and moved we just take away

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.710 
taken away and moved we just take away
here<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> study<00:01:52.890> part<00:01:53.190> but<00:01:54.060> also<00:01:54.360> saying

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
here for the study part but also saying

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
here for the study part but also saying
you<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.650> one<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:55.980> be<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.280> line<00:01:56.550> but

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
you know this one will be for line but

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.660 
you know this one will be for line but
study<00:01:57.720> part<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.410> out<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.530> study<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
study part I are out of study is the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.240 
study part I are out of study is the
idea<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.690> can<00:02:00.990> still<00:02:01.290> use<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.800> linear

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
idea so you can still use I a linear

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.210 
idea so you can still use I a linear
function<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.910> F<00:02:03.030> tonight<00:02:03.680> alright<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.070> in

right<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.290> let<00:02:34.500> let<00:02:34.860> me<00:02:34.890> show<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
right so let let me show the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.700 
right so let let me show the
demonstration<00:02:35.520> here<00:02:36.330> let's<00:02:37.230> try<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
demonstration here let's try it on the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.270 
demonstration here let's try it on the
windows<00:02:38.100> 10<00:02:38.850> over<00:02:39.630> here<00:02:39.890> why<00:02:40.890> does<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.130> know

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
windows 10 over here why does it know

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.280 
windows 10 over here why does it know
windows<00:02:41.640> 9<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:44.820> know<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.660> right<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.260> can

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
windows 9 you know so right here you can

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.250 
windows 9 you know so right here you can
use<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.830> here<00:02:50.010> yes<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:53.570> basically<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.780> idea<00:02:54.810> is

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
use it here yes so basically the idea is

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.890 
use it here yes so basically the idea is
you<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.440> move<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.460> around<00:02:56.550> like<00:02:56.880> Wii<00:02:57.210> Remote

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
you just move it around like Wii Remote

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.520 
you just move it around like Wii Remote
yes<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.010> click<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.640> you<00:03:00.020> turn<00:03:01.020> around<00:03:01.050> to

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
type something yeah and you can go for

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.830 
type something yeah and you can go for
example<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.380> search<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.090> recite<00:03:06.390> ramela

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840

so<00:03:15.990> how<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.320> battery<00:03:16.650> life<00:03:16.680> with<00:03:17.010> these<00:03:17.160> two

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
so how is battery life with these two

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.580 
so how is battery life with these two
small<00:03:17.820> batteries<00:03:18.210> so<00:03:18.660> if<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.020> can<00:03:19.230> use<00:03:19.380> this

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
small batteries so if you can use this

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.290 
small batteries so if you can use this
triple-a<00:03:20.040> battery<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.460> can<00:03:20.580> use<00:03:20.760> at<00:03:21.030> least

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300
