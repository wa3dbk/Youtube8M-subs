once again oh my god that is so stupid
those<00:05:16.820> easily<00:05:17.210> could<00:05:17.360> have<00:05:17.419> been<00:05:17.570> turnovers

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
those easily could have been turnovers

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.240 
those easily could have been turnovers
this<00:05:18.320> guy<00:05:18.470> could<00:05:18.530> have<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.889> ball<00:05:19.070> right<00:05:19.220> now

driving<00:05:19.789> on<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:19.970> last<00:05:20.180> possession<00:05:20.360> and<00:05:20.900> I've

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
driving on the last possession and I've

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.080 
driving on the last possession and I've
more<00:05:21.919> than<00:05:22.039> likely<00:05:22.220> with<00:05:22.520> a<00:05:22.550> loss<00:05:22.760> because<00:05:22.910> he

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
more than likely with a loss because he

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.909 
more than likely with a loss because he
would<00:05:23.210> just<00:05:23.300> milked<00:05:23.690> it<00:05:23.810> kicked<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.590> field<00:05:24.770> goal

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
would just milked it kicked a field goal

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.060 
would just milked it kicked a field goal
and<00:05:25.220> won<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.120> game<00:05:26.440> so<00:05:27.440> we<00:05:27.620> get<00:05:27.770> him<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:27.950> use

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
and won the game so we get him to use

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.680 
and won the game so we get him to use
two<00:05:28.250> of<00:05:28.280> his<00:05:28.490> timeouts<00:05:28.700> because<00:05:29.030> Romo<00:05:29.240> decided

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
two of his timeouts because Romo decided

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.390
