00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.670
 there are good showers sometimes and from 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.299
 errors commenting on a modern gameplay 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.160
 warfare 3 arkham on confirmed and confirmed 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.760
 this video has something very special very 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.429
 new on my channel very changes or if 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.320
 changes or why or why have I gotten myself 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.590
 to play in the level games 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.560
 advanced comillas quotes that is to say ni 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.869
 spurts of cows or nonsense by the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.600
 style because because I'm up to the 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.360
 balls of what the fucking assassins 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.670
 come for the fucking red dots 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.100
 that the plane pulls is cold so I 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.530
 I take this kind of game mode and I 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.870
 saving all the inconvenience what I 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.020
 encouraged to do this apart from those 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.570
 discomfort of players cited while with 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.480
 killer and blind eye then 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.760
 this end of the past weekend I do not know when 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.890
 this would go up but one of these purposes 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.680
 the final cap de madrid was held 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.860
 rivas vaciamadrid in which I saw play 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.729
 competitive at an extreme level to a 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.190
 very good level an expert level and 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.130
 as you will see in this game I take it 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.380
 to learn little by little and with my 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.330
 pp 90 silenced with autumn camouflage 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.110
 kill right and left to annihilate 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.000
 enemies seek to be response and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.710
 have fun have fun and enjoy something 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.039
 I have a hard time doing when I 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.320
 they are playing the balls all the time 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.340
 with blind eye killer and streaks by the 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.020
 shit style 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.179
 in this game and to my surprise 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.100
 first game I do in advanced 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.290
 first game 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.600
 triumph ponle quotes because there is no 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.350
 streaks it costs me a lot more to kill sometimes 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.780
 but this game I finish it 23 2 a 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.500
 very high average for what I am 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.710
 and a huge impressive satisfaction 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.880
 of having done things right I do not have 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.590
 raised at this time play 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.080
 competitive seriously I do not even have 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.459
 no such plan like that for 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.060
 get in and has received many 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.250
 invitations but he gave his goats me 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.519
 our games because I think that 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.140
 the games in which he took me good 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.580
 low deaths of that good average 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.569
 they serve to demonstrate how good a 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.010
 player mostly without gusts since 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.010
 killing only with the gun and not even 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.739
 with a specialist because you really see the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.560
 level that each one has and also in 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.930
 public is to say that the condition leaves 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.819
 Much to be desired 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.109
 3 organic the creators these of 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.120
 shit activision 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.420
 we have to swallow and hold and if we 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.310
 like to keep playing if you can not 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.299
 hold on and pull you in here is almost 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.840
 triple low that almost in red had to 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.840
 hospital 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.290
 farias apart 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.800
 we see that the game is 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.870
 developing very fast and in fact going to 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.850
 end here I will not move from here and 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.200
 so that I do not move and have to 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.270
 Spend the time fast because you know that 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.430
 I do not usually change to camp for 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.170
 we wanted to be the only time to change 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.430
 my life to sack is in the competitive in 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.860
 the youtubers tournament against 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.690
 subscribers and little more a little more 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.900
 as you see the children are doing 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.360
 the ridicule totally carry only 13 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.540
 badges obtained by 51 of us 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.710
 and we are going out with us 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.870
 I say my team that was playing 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.730
 totally alone that from time to time 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.740
 because it's good to meditate because 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.920
 so they do not have anyone's help and see if 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.200
 you're really good 'bad bank' painful 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.540
 so so so so good 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.510
 If you want more gameplays this mode 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.660
 game between an end or a level 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.500
 advanced 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.500
 up there light 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.720
 tell me and I will show you without further delay 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.660
 well as we see the game in it's not going to 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.780
 last much longer because we are 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.450
 solving at a breathtaking speed like 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.650
 I said before but I do not like hard 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.750
 so that we get bored sporting comments 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.270
 list and you know that for me it has to 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.430
 be animated and that is all the time 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.050
 I'm going to try and that's what 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.600
 that I try to get bored and 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.850
 well this has been all I say goodbye here 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.280
 killing a guy with the holographic sight 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.590
