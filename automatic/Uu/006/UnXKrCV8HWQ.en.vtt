00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.770 
away
but<00:01:33.340> there's<00:01:33.550> no<00:01:33.700> rhyme<00:01:33.910> or<00:01:34.090> reason<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.570> I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
but there's no rhyme or reason to it I

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.800 
but there's no rhyme or reason to it I
mean<00:01:34.900> you<00:01:35.050> can<00:01:35.080> sit<00:01:35.440> there<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.650> take<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.100> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.930 

put<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.930> all<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.560> rows<00:01:41.770> if<00:01:42.040> you<00:01:42.130> want<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.460> I<00:01:42.700> find

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
put it all in rows if you want to I find

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.130 
put it all in rows if you want to I find
it<00:01:43.119> really<00:01:43.240> doesn't<00:01:43.660> matter<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:46.030> there<00:01:46.600> we<00:01:46.720> go

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
it really doesn't matter so there we go

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.560 
it really doesn't matter so there we go
we<00:01:47.290> got<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.619> all<00:01:47.710> in<00:01:47.740> here<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.280> then<00:01:49.150> because

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
we got it all in here and then because

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.960 
we got it all in here and then because
my<00:01:49.960> other<00:01:50.410> cat's<00:01:50.800> learned<00:01:51.160> but<00:01:51.400> this<00:01:51.700> little

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
my other cat's learned but this little

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.550 
my other cat's learned but this little
kitten<00:01:52.150> here<00:01:52.420> still<00:01:52.780> doesn't<00:01:53.110> quite<00:01:53.229> get<00:01:53.410> the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
kitten here still doesn't quite get the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.499 
kitten here still doesn't quite get the
idea<00:01:53.860> not<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.460> jump<00:01:54.820> around<00:01:54.910> and<00:01:55.210> play<00:01:55.300> in<00:01:55.330> the

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
idea not to jump around and play in the

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.520 
idea not to jump around and play in the
best<00:01:55.690> so<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:57.300> use<00:01:58.300> these<00:01:58.450> popsicle<00:01:58.990> sticks<00:01:59.229> and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
best so I use these popsicle sticks and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.130 
best so I use these popsicle sticks and
the<00:02:00.369> reason<00:02:00.700> why<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.180> cats<00:02:01.690> do<00:02:01.990> not<00:02:02.020> like

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the reason why is cats do not like

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.270 
the reason why is cats do not like
popsicle<00:02:05.140> sticks<00:02:05.350> being<00:02:05.619> in<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.860> garden

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
popsicle sticks being in the garden

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.300 
popsicle sticks being in the garden

because they like to lay around or if

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.919 
because they like to lay around or if
they<00:02:09.459> decide<00:02:09.850> that<00:02:09.880> it's<00:02:10.209> someplace<00:02:10.540> they

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
they decide that it's someplace they

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.370 
they decide that it's someplace they
want<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.320> use<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.340> bathroom<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:13.260> they<00:02:14.260> don't

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
want to use the bathroom in they don't

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.720 
want to use the bathroom in they don't
like<00:02:14.620> having<00:02:14.920> to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.640 

move<00:02:20.300> things<00:02:20.569> out<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.930> way<00:02:21.080> where<00:02:21.500> these

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
move things out of the way where these

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.260 
move things out of the way where these
popsicle<00:02:22.190> sticks<00:02:22.430> are<00:02:22.550> not<00:02:22.700> comfortable<00:02:23.210> for

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
popsicle sticks are not comfortable for

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.930 
popsicle sticks are not comfortable for
them<00:02:23.450> delay<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.870> between<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.800> when<00:02:25.760> this

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
them delay in between and when this

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.340 
them delay in between and when this
starts<00:02:26.180> growing<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.630> actually<00:02:26.810> removed<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
starts growing I actually removed the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.870 
starts growing I actually removed the
popsicle<00:02:27.860> stick<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.459> only<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.850> a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
popsicle stick so this is only for a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.630 
popsicle stick so this is only for a
short<00:02:29.150> time<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.980> put<00:02:30.980> them<00:02:31.040> all<00:02:31.160> in<00:02:31.370> here

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.860 

so<00:02:38.640> now<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> also<00:02:39.030> had<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.240> lot<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.480> people<00:02:39.660> ask<00:02:39.780> me

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
so now I also had a lot of people ask me

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.300 
so now I also had a lot of people ask me
what<00:02:40.140> was<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> deal<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.830> popsicle

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
what was the deal with the popsicle

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.160 
what was the deal with the popsicle
sticks<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.000> reason<00:02:42.270> why<00:02:42.390> if<00:02:42.960> you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
sticks and this is the reason why if you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.570 
sticks and this is the reason why if you
were<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> cat<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.980> wouldn't<00:02:44.250> really<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
were a cat you wouldn't really have a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.100 
were a cat you wouldn't really have a
place<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.850> come<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.240> lay<00:02:45.330> down<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.960> that's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
place to come and lay down in and that's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.810 
place to come and lay down in and that's
mainly<00:02:46.320> what<00:02:46.650> my<00:02:46.800> cats<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.160> always<00:02:47.370> done<00:02:47.640> is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
mainly what my cats have always done is

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.150 
mainly what my cats have always done is
they<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.240> lay<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.720> dirt<00:02:48.950> if<00:02:49.950> it's

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
they like to lay in the dirt if it's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.130 
they like to lay in the dirt if it's
cool<00:02:50.400> or<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:51.300> warm<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.810> Sun<00:02:51.990> themselves

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
cool or if it's warm to Sun themselves

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.010 
cool or if it's warm to Sun themselves
so<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.490> have<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.730> all<00:02:53.880> done<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.330> hemmed<00:02:54.540> down

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
so we have that all done we hemmed down

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.930 
so we have that all done we hemmed down
we<00:02:55.230> haven't<00:02:55.440> packed<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:55.890> pretty<00:02:56.160> good<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
we haven't packed in pretty good and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:09.869 
we haven't packed in pretty good and
then<00:02:57.090> we're<00:02:57.210> just<00:02:57.360> going<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.540> water<00:02:57.750> them<00:02:57.900> in

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.470 

give<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.540> second<00:03:10.900> let<00:03:11.019> them<00:03:11.109> soak<00:03:11.319> in

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.750 

I<00:03:14.620> just<00:03:15.620> keep<00:03:15.800> them<00:03:15.920> good<00:03:16.129> and<00:03:16.340> kind<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.550> damp

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
I just keep them good and kind of damp

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.550 
I just keep them good and kind of damp
until<00:03:17.209> they<00:03:17.360> start<00:03:17.629> sprouting<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.200> then<00:03:18.349> just

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
until they start sprouting and then just

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.890 
until they start sprouting and then just
