00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
an issue that we found was more

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.419 
an issue that we found was more
meaningful<00:00:54.480> than<00:00:54.960> having<00:00:55.320> clean<00:00:55.530> clothes<00:00:55.890> or

construction of shoes and fuse those

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.380 
construction of shoes and fuse those

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
together into sort of a hybrid we were

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.850 
together into sort of a hybrid we were
looking<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.810> something<00:01:16.140> simple<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:16.770> also

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
something that would be desirable when

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.999

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and sole concepts we all got together

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.569 
and sole concepts we all got together
and<00:01:31.020> said<00:01:31.439> okay<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> like

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.429 
we were looking at the one piece and
with<00:01:50.039> that<00:01:50.219> we<00:01:50.430> were<00:01:50.549> thinking<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.030> slip<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.509> but

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
with that we were thinking a slip on but

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.200 
with that we were thinking a slip on but
we<00:01:52.590> realized<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.039> it<00:01:53.219> needed<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.729> fastening

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
we realized that it needed a fastening

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.090 
we realized that it needed a fastening
system<00:01:54.570> after<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:54.960> eliminated<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.560> idea<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
system after we eliminated the idea of a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.849 
system after we eliminated the idea of a
one-piece<00:01:56.310> shoe<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.109> we<00:01:58.229> wanted<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.680> do

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
one-piece shoe so what we wanted to do

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.370 
one-piece shoe so what we wanted to do
was<00:01:59.520> create<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.180> fastening<00:02:00.840> system<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
was create this fastening system that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.469 
was create this fastening system that
when<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> open<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.460> gives<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.240> more

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
when you open it up it gives you more

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.719 
when you open it up it gives you more
area<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.140> put<00:02:04.320> your<00:02:04.469> foot<00:02:04.679> in<00:02:04.859> and<00:02:05.100> take<00:02:05.609> your

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
area to put your foot in and take your

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.139 
area to put your foot in and take your
foot<00:02:05.939> out<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.359> then<00:02:07.310> by<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.369> strapping<00:02:09.000> this

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
foot out and then by it strapping this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
foot out and then by it strapping this
over<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.690> clipping<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.190> your

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
over and clipping it on you have your

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.130 
over and clipping it on you have your
shoe<00:02:11.670> fastened<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.390> your<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.780> you're<00:02:12.930> ready

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
shoe fastened in your and you're ready

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.140 
shoe fastened in your and you're ready
to<00:02:13.320> go<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:14.130> actually<00:02:14.790> started<00:02:15.060> with

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
to go we actually started with

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.640 
to go we actually started with
electronic<00:02:15.570> waste<00:02:15.720> did<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.320> bunch<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.500> material

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
electronic waste did a bunch of material

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.780 
electronic waste did a bunch of material
studies<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.220> how<00:02:17.460> we<00:02:17.520> can

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
studies on how we can

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.850 
studies on how we can
we<00:02:17.909> gather<00:02:18.239> wiring<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.930> use<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.260> components

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
we gather wiring and use the components

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.559 
we gather wiring and use the components
but<00:02:20.370> from<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.879> we've<00:02:21.090> learned<00:02:21.239> we<00:02:21.360> didn't

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
but from that we've learned we didn't

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.330 
but from that we've learned we didn't
want<00:02:21.719> to<00:02:21.780> take<00:02:21.989> material<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.890> make<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.189> into

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
want to take material and make it into

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.759 
want to take material and make it into
something<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.730> didn't<00:02:24.060> belong<00:02:24.359> in<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.500> after

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
something that didn't belong in so after

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.009 
something that didn't belong in so after
we<00:02:25.859> went<00:02:25.950> through<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.909> most<00:02:27.150> ridiculous<00:02:27.840> end

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
we went through the most ridiculous end

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.599 
we went through the most ridiculous end
of<00:02:28.230> huge<00:02:28.709> stick<00:02:28.950> tires<00:02:29.159> you<00:02:29.310> said<00:02:29.459> why<00:02:29.519> don't

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
of huge stick tires you said why don't

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:30.920 
of huge stick tires you said why don't
we<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.849> look<00:02:30.030> at<00:02:30.090> bicycle<00:02:30.510> tires<00:02:30.689> because

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
we just look at bicycle tires because

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.199 
we just look at bicycle tires because
bicycle<00:02:31.319> tires<00:02:31.530> are<00:02:31.739> more<00:02:31.980> relevant<00:02:32.879> in<00:02:33.000> Haiti

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
bicycle tires are more relevant in Haiti

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.460 
bicycle tires are more relevant in Haiti
anyway<00:02:33.540> because<00:02:33.780> they're<00:02:34.109> more<00:02:34.260> flexible

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
anyway because they're more flexible

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.839 
anyway because they're more flexible
which<00:02:34.859> is<00:02:34.950> better<00:02:35.069> for<00:02:35.250> children's<00:02:35.700> foot

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
which is better for children's foot

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.580 
which is better for children's foot
development<00:02:36.299> they're<00:02:36.689> easy<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.019> cut<00:02:37.200> with<00:02:37.230> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
development they're easy to cut with a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.649 
development they're easy to cut with a
knife<00:02:37.650> or<00:02:38.189> with<00:02:38.489> scissors<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.540> also

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
knife or with scissors you can also

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.210 
knife or with scissors you can also
Pierce<00:02:39.989> them<00:02:40.170> really<00:02:40.379> easily<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.739> sew<00:02:41.069> them

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
Pierce them really easily and sew them

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.000 
Pierce them really easily and sew them
to<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.459> shoe<00:02:41.780> bicycle<00:02:42.780> tires<00:02:42.989> meant<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.470> stand

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
to the shoe bicycle tires meant to stand

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.250 
to the shoe bicycle tires meant to stand
long<00:02:44.750> crazy<00:02:45.750> terrains<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.209> situations<00:02:48.209> so<00:02:48.629> it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
long crazy terrains and situations so it

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.619 
long crazy terrains and situations so it
just<00:02:49.590> made<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.829> lot<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.040> sense<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.480> bring<00:02:51.480> this

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
just made a lot of sense to bring this

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.009 
just made a lot of sense to bring this
through<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:53.670> already<00:02:53.849> has<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.239> rough<00:02:54.540> surface

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
through it already has the rough surface

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.839 
through it already has the rough surface
biters<00:02:55.620> are<00:02:55.680> never<00:02:55.829> gonna<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.099> same<00:02:56.189> every

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
biters are never gonna be the same every

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.309 
biters are never gonna be the same every
pair<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.180> these<00:02:57.299> shoes<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.599> is<00:02:57.989> gonna<00:02:58.260> be

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
pair of these shoes that is gonna be

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.420 
pair of these shoes that is gonna be
given<00:02:58.409> if<00:02:58.620> someone's<00:02:58.919> gonna<00:02:59.010> be<00:02:59.129> completely

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
given if someone's gonna be completely

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.039 
given if someone's gonna be completely
individual<00:02:59.970> them<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:00.569> they're<00:03:00.750> going<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.959> be<00:03:01.019> a

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
individual them so they're going to be a

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.360 
individual them so they're going to be a
little<00:03:01.230> interior<00:03:01.530> snake<00:03:01.889> receives<00:03:02.159> and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
little interior snake receives and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.909 
little interior snake receives and
little<00:03:02.549> differences<00:03:02.909> between<00:03:03.060> each<00:03:03.359> pair<00:03:03.659> and

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
little differences between each pair and

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.869 
little differences between each pair and
whatever<00:03:04.919> you<00:03:05.129> step<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.489> ground<00:03:05.700> you're

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
whatever you step on the ground you're

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:06.860 
whatever you step on the ground you're
gonna<00:03:06.030> leave<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.209> different<00:03:06.329> footprint<00:03:06.780> than

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
gonna leave a different footprint than

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.080 
gonna leave a different footprint than
somebody<00:03:07.169> else<00:03:07.349> we<00:03:08.040> wanted<00:03:08.549> materials<00:03:09.000> that

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
somebody else we wanted materials that

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.899 
somebody else we wanted materials that
were<00:03:09.209> locally<00:03:09.689> available<00:03:10.129> bikes<00:03:11.129> are<00:03:11.519> used

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
were locally available bikes are used

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.509 
were locally available bikes are used
quite<00:03:12.209> often<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:12.989> Haiti<00:03:13.260> for<00:03:13.489> transportation

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
quite often in Haiti for transportation

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.110 
quite often in Haiti for transportation
so<00:03:15.120> there<00:03:15.269> are<00:03:15.379> unused<00:03:16.379> bicycle<00:03:16.889> tires<00:03:17.129> one

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
so there are unused bicycle tires one

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.089 
so there are unused bicycle tires one
bicycle<00:03:18.659> with<00:03:18.870> two<00:03:19.049> tires<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.620> make<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.889> pair

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
bicycle with two tires can make a pair

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.610 
bicycle with two tires can make a pair
of<00:03:20.129> shoes<00:03:20.430> what<00:03:21.120> we<00:03:21.239> wanted<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.599> do<00:03:21.900> was<00:03:22.349> use

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
of shoes what we wanted to do was use

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.550 
of shoes what we wanted to do was use
the<00:03:22.650> shoe<00:03:23.099> as<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.519> platform<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.810> unite<00:03:25.379> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
the shoe as a platform to unite the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.289 
the shoe as a platform to unite the
country<00:03:25.949> under<00:03:26.159> something<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.760> they<00:03:26.909> could

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
country under something that they could
