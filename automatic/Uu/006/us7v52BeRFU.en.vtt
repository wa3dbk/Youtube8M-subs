00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 I cry for those who went to Brazil 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.819
 during this clear weekend 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.580
 Imagine Brazil is not so many hours 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.910
 three to rio de janeiro a little more and one 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.710
 it goes north but the seats are 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.570
 little ones one the truth that does not know 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.220
 how to sit after a couple of hours 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.760
 He does not know how to stretch his legs and a lot 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.760
 less sleep 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.099
 especially when one is getting more 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.769
 big and more chubby but good we have 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.300
 the solution there are some planes for super 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.750
 super millionaires that yes the problem is 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.750
 turn it off to see 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.200
 normal enjoy a plane trip the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.800
 trips are usually long and the place is 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.410
 small and uncomfortable many millionaires 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 they opted for private jets but 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.850
 they were not satisfied either 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.250
 used to move in large 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.670
 groups had to reduce the number of their 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.260
 comitivas when moving to other countries 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.629
 They also had to endure long 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.450
 technical scales due to low autonomy 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.670
 of these aircraft and for the airs of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.110
 oil and gas these limitations 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.270
 they were unacceptable because this is that many 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.000
 they started buying airplanes that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.340
 used for transporting passengers 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.160
 and not just the biggest ones in the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.190
 market like the boeing 747 airbus a380 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.630
 so the magnates decided to start 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.580
 negotiate directly with 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.340
 manufacturers so that that team in their 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.490
 aircrafts tailored to your tastes there 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.310
 airplanes with showers bathrooms own toilets 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.460
 of a five- star hotel two- bed 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.790
 squares and spacious meeting rooms and 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.640
 even with room walldorf such a plane 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.150
 It can cost around 300 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 million dollars and since 1997 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.369
 airbus sold around 170 worldwide 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.150
 neither so much nor not luxury and 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.150
 extravagance in the air 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.360
 they're going to have a lot of clear money for that 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:17.080
 we are far better seats 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.090
 we will continue traveling uncomfortably 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.090
 let's show the journalist
