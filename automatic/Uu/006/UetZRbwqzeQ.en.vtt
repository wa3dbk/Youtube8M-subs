there's<00:00:26.699> two<00:00:27.180> links<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> lite

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
there's two links one is the lite

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.710 
there's two links one is the lite
version<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:29.760> other<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> medium

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
version the other one is the medium

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.280 
version the other one is the medium
version<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.590> medium<00:00:32.099> version<00:00:32.930> um<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
version this is the medium version um I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.650 
version this is the medium version um I
think<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> lite<00:00:35.610> version<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:36.149> takes<00:00:36.450> off<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
