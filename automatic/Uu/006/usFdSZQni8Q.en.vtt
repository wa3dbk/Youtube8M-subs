00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello everyone with you fish show and today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.240
 blood lad bloody review 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.680
 I don't need to say vampire day already 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.719
 was you saying that for each species 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.370
 evil will be only one day yes 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.670
 so yesterday was a werewolf day 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.710
 bloody guys and werewolves are there and this is not 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.150
 just a review is an express review for you 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.970
 probably wondering what it is therefore 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.519
 I will immediately tell you a review of the first series if 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.350
 You can say so, of course I will see 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.390
 we all recommend them before 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.090
 Well, I will ripen only the first series 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.969
 so the reviews are shorter they are easy to watch and 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.930
 deal by the way and they also give some 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.930
 anime 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.390
 so begin the world of demons inhabited 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.670
 demons who would doubt and the rest 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 unclean divided into many 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.559
 territories and in each territory there are 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 your boss stas hereditary vampire boss 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.800
 one of the territories 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.500
 but unlike the same Alucard not 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.879
 such a vampire how we know them he does not 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.050
 drinking human blood 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.030
 and he is a fan of it from the Japanese 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.420
 cultures that is in particular from anime and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.670
 manga them i mean these every thing 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.750
 derived from the world of people from japan for 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 he is very expensive 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.650
 well, really he is obsessed with Japanese 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.689
 culture and still all the time din 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.790
 the prefix but this is also part of the Japanese 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.740
 culture anyway but in general the whole 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.200
 cultures and in general it is not culture 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.960
 I guess I don't know. Don't beat me for it. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.500
 and one day about a miracle on the territory of this 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.150
 fetishist attack hits girl 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.409
 human which the right hand finds 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.270
 staza deck 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.799
 he is to call dracula younger and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.479
 says the boss here is such a thing here girl 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.970
 human 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.050
 real estas so fucked up says 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.790
 enter and stones 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.640
 but to himself thinks such a girl by Jacquet 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.100
 blah blah blah looking fuyumi so called this 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.560
 the girl already devoured the plants left from 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.030
 her only a couple of bones well worth it 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.130
 turn away for a couple of minutes and the guest is already 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.950
 safely faded eras that inward 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.140
 carnivorous plants in total 100 shocked 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.960
 I would even say he is 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.630
 Ie in afig and here he discovers 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.610
 that fuyumi did not die her soul calmly 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.800
 sitting in the corner and just like on request 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.770
 our attack is absolutely naked 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.270
 Stas decides to return Fuyumi her body for 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.190
 that he just needs to understand what 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.190
 the devil brought a man into the world of demons and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.690
 what kind of goblin can help get her body back 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.300
 the only problem is that the world of demons 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.190
 definition is populated only by forests and this 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.230
 will not be much to the quickie quest 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.070
 especially when you come across 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.140
 different pit that is a weed itself Stein 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.360
 you just watched the pilot issue 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.120
 express review and if you like it 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.140
 like and write about it in 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.920
 comments to know whether it is worth it at all 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.920
 do such reviews
