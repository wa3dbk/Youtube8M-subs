00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
have so out of those two dresses I did

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.390 
have so out of those two dresses I did
purchase<00:03:46.980> one<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:48.540> will<00:03:48.750> see<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.920> final

purchase one and you will see the final
decision<00:03:51.180> when<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.570> take<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.440> footage<00:03:52.769> for<00:03:53.070> the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
decision when I take the footage for the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.620 
decision when I take the footage for the
way<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:56.010> think<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:56.790> about<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.090> we're

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630
