00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
technology and two years ago we sought

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.990 
technology and two years ago we sought
to<00:00:48.320> understand<00:00:48.710> more<00:00:48.980> about<00:00:49.039> how<00:00:49.460> consumers

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
to understand more about how consumers

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.750

were<00:00:50.149> using<00:00:50.570> that<00:00:50.989> digital<00:00:51.440> technology<00:00:52.010> so

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
were using that digital technology so

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.970 
were using that digital technology so
naturally<00:00:52.969> we<00:00:53.570> went<00:00:53.780> on<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.989> road<00:00:54.140> visiting

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
naturally we went on the road visiting

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.819 
naturally we went on the road visiting
with<00:00:55.100> publishers<00:00:55.690> developers<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.960> gamers<00:00:57.320> to

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
with publishers developers and gamers to

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.639 
with publishers developers and gamers to
ask<00:00:57.949> how<00:00:58.280> we<00:00:58.339> could<00:00:58.789> make<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.390> PSB<00:00:59.719> better<00:01:00.350> and
