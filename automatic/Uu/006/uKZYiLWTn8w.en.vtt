00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.599
 djen last weekend 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.700
 there have been two incidents about which to me 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.349
 known with the participation of Ukrainian 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.509
 the prime minister who is actively 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.369
 interacts with the us and the minister 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.830
 foreign affairs which is also active 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.720
 interacts with us both made a row 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.550
 to say the least non-standard sharp 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.630
 statements 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.699
 the prime minister called russia and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.099
 pro-Russian citizens are not 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.760
 Your people agree with this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.590
 assessment 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.870
 or maybe you are disturbed by such 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.360
 statements of such expressions are you 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.430
 would expect from a US ally and the Minister 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.590
 Foreign Affairs called Putin a word 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.719
 which I just can not repeat here 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 at our briefing oh well honey you 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.210
 obviously want to say it yes no i won't 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 I will give you this opportunity 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.530
 thank you i will refrain 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.570
 I will not repeat it is permissible 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.070
 to whose officials are you 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.379
 keep using such 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.200
 I would like to know expressions 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.930
 expressions are acceptable I think that is very 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.780
 important and I would like to remind you 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.970
 it is important for all of you to remember 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.700
 than the foreign minister was busy 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.950
 when he said this he personally went out to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.020
 place of events at the Russian embassy and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.360
 took measures to calm 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.640
 the protesters and successfully 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.860
 that is, he was there and called for 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.259
 calm and peaceful resolution 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.570
 Regarding the value used by them 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.189
 words i would advise to refer to 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.470
 Ukrainians for clarification 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.720
 but I believe that the context in which were 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.619
 used these words has important 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.329
 meaning we want Ukraine to be 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.560
 access to extra gas 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.479
 if they are required 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.250
 as you all know natural gas 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.560
 transported by pipeline 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.560
 and Western Europe through Ukraine to Russia 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.680
 I was chosen carousel that voted 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.850
 children and even residents of moscow and 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.740
 St. Petersburg 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:17.950
 I'm sorry I do not really imagine what 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:20.170
 such an electoral roundabout I know at all 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.550
 you read it yourself are not very familiar with this 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.350
 I will definitely clarify the term 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.450
 that is, you are sure that people did not drive 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.180
 circle on toy horses lurking in 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.310
 late yes no I think it is not 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.880
 about it they have there their methods of conducting 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.100
 election you all know victoria well and 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.320
 surely that when she was 23 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.540
 For 8 months she lived on board 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.550
 russian ship and maybe recognized pam 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.810
 certain lex do you mean that 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.980
 Our prejudice relates to Russia 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.170
 to drum the ship she could find out 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.410
 Russian profanity but she 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.240
 swore in English she ok it's me 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.240
 the bird is already clear 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:13.280
 these photos wait world media they 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.069
 were on twitter and they are in 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.469
 open access in the pictures we see that 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.010
 these people are judged by their appearance clearly 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:25.519
 have a collar russia and this you call 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.689
 evidence and 7 to 12 years 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.700
 you do not want to say that 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.709
 us government with russian intelligence 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.879
 so on now depends on photos 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.049
 The cat posted on the Internet, these pictures from 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.329
 open sources 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.650
 make your own conclusions you know 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.019
 comments of the Russian Deputy Prime Minister 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.879
 Dmitry Rogozin about sanctions in 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.980
 regards to the space program he 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:50.000
 offered us to deliver astronauts on 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.859
 ms with the help of trampoline 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.629
 it missed but it is obvious that 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.090
 american russian projects in 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.159
 space industry are interconnected and you 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.930
 actually give that after the sanction 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.849
 Russia will not continue to help you 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.129
 let astronauts let me 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.810
 Get acquainted in more detail and it looks like 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.379
 will give them the opportunity to break through 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.239
 industries 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.680
 this is a very entertaining comment 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.090
 the next question but still you agree 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.799
 so that Russians have the right to demand 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.750
 money for goods sold 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.609
 matt i will happily handle this 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.019
 when I get back to my office 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.550
 is it a coincidence that both times 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.560
 Ukrainian authorities sent troops 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.229
 eastern Ukraine immediately after the visit to 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.940
 Kiev from to put representatives of the United States 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.009
 I think you just repeat the words 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.650
 foreign minister laurel 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.919
 there was again a state of color what next 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.139
 the question is complete but are you sure that 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.970
 the instigators are the separatists and 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.930
 nothing of the sort comes along 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.599
 about the Kiev forces 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.849
 as we see from the incidents about which 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.400
 we say every day they seem 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.259
 always the instigators in the trunk 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.490
 his cars were found portable 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:57.169
 anti-aircraft missile systems in general 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.210
 the question is whether these 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.050
 people are men journalists so 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.479
 it is 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.090
 but the question is what are you government 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.280
 us believe some message or this 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.949
 Ukrainian authorities specifically 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.960
 confirmed to you all this information and so 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.820
 reported our employees are on 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.889
 Ukraine who have contacts with 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.469
 local authorities 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.020
 and they believe that all these messages that those 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:24.909
 people carried weapons all this true 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.400
 the fight promises that before twitter and you 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.159
 declared that the Russians were the first to shoot 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.969
 This is a pretty serious accusation. 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:36.370
 would like to know dance on me 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:38.499
 seem reliable statements of Russian 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.779
 that the aggressor was someone else or 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:45.370
 Ukrainians considering what exactly Russians 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:47.199
 entered the base but Russia is not 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.389
 stated she said it was 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.250
 provocation then how do you claim that 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.289
 You obviously Russia and about this, too, 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.930
 mentioned think we are ready to go to 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.569
 next question 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.969
 Russia was accused but no explanation 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.310
 given if you have any concerns on 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.289
 about possible interpretations conflicts 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.839
 or about nepotism in which you 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.740
 often blame the Russians no he 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:10.330
 private person 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.999
 good but then Russian and Ukrainian 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.589
 oligarchs who control it all 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:17.409
 they are also private individuals 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:20.650
 correctly of course we would not 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:22.689
 regarding the same category to me 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.490
 I wonder if the concern is about 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.789
 how Russians and Ukrainians will accept you 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.310
 participation in this son of the usa vice president 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:50.649

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:54.490
 no fear come in this is our typist
