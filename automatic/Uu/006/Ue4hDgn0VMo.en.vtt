00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.870
 Good afternoon, everybody, I want to show you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.740
 small reviewer 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 phoenix charger 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:18.050
 called she 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:21.210
 a re c 2 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.970
 advanced multi charger 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.849
 Charger 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.769
 what is good with what is 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:35.930
 universal and used for charging 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:41.190
 lithium-ion battery size 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:44.610
 18:50 16 340 14500 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.870
 and of the greatest 26 650 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.050
 These are batteries that have a diameter 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.270
 26 millimeters and a capacity of about 5,000 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.430
 milliamper hours themselves are a big device 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.000
 also charges nickel metal hydride 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.000
 battery size two and three a and c 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:14.220
 therefore accordingly has a voltage 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.280
 charge 42 volts per battery and 1 and 5 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.509
 volts per battery respectively 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.240
 changing and the charge current it is at 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:30.360
 18:50 battery charge 1 amp 4 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.470
 channel that is for each channel 1 amp 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.460
 current and battery charge size 2a 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.810
 and 3a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:51.860
 it is 0.5 amperes per channel that is 4 by sex 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:53.970
 ampere device has comfortable 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.119
 spring frequent contacts 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.159
 yes that provide good 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.920
 battery connection both protected and 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.539
 unprotected remind maybe someone not 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.330
 knew yes even then the battery is protected they 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.170
 for 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.340
 and a couple of millimeters and all of it 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.730
 charging device 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.830
 they become here everything is universal 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:28.630
 and everything fits like this 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.470
 it becomes us immediately 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.260
 magic socket and even about nutrition 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.530
 it means the charger is completed 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.310
 two cords is a 220 volt power cord 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.970
 AC and here 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:51.459
 connects and power is indicated here 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.080
 12-24 volts that is to charge 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.930
 batteries from the onboard network 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.480
 car from the appstore and separately goes 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.020
 but unfortunately now it is not there just 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.709
 show well the opportunity is there in 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.709
 this power supply 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:18.540
 then turn on the network immediately see so 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.540
 magic trick 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:28.150
 where our focus is not focused yes there is 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.239
 we can see the active channels then 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.940
 there is and here we have 1 2 3 4 by zeros 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:38.680
 accordingly do not work to the top 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.019
 battery charge indicator when u 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.680
 us the battery is charged here we see it 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.500
 battery 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.269
 more charged already flashing 3 dice and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.500
 respectively, voltage 41 volts 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.670
 shows the device has 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.180
 automatic battery shutdown when 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.519
 reaching voltage on element 42 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.330
 Volt respectively the device can 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.570
 charge for 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.440
 protected protected and unprotected 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.860
 the battery disconnects the device as 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.890
 think and friends 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.269
 principle nothing special except 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.550
 excellent quality 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.310
 this charger 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.960
 no longer different but basically nothing 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.840
 and do not need it convenient to get comfortable 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.260
 shoot there is a great bright such 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.520
 blue backlit screen displaying 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:37.560
 the information body is made 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.310
 from such a rough slightly plastic 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.520
 pretty decent quality in principle 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:50.460
 All good charging current to quality 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.930
 food is nothing more like to say 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.480
 only that one price of it 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.160
 devices here it is just not here 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.650
 simple price of this charger 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.110
 devices let's say it starts from 40 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.080
 dollars I specifically looked at 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.280
 the Internet and the most cheaper it is on the site 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.500
 aliexpress this device I found for 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:17.350
 39 dollars and higher respectively with us 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.710
 retail price retail 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.160
 prices can reach 50 60 and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.280
 more even across and pain that is 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.740
 the device is not cheap and they pour every 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.840
 will already decide for themselves whether it is worth 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:37.810
 buy him a given charger 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.730
 what's the point like for example what is it 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.340
 the device provides 4 channels to 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.680
 current 1 amp that is, yes it is good she 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.280
 powerful but high quality it is possible to charge 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.770
 at the same time four batteries are different in 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.770
 bullets for capacity all that 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.410
 voltage but again, useful is necessary 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.990
 will be the one who has such a cook 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.060
 banks yes that is inside each of these 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.680
 here 's a battery 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.240
 who travels a lot 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.460
 bat battery that is at the same time 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.430
 you can charge the 4 who may be 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.260
 their professional field 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.370
 uses these batteries and him 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.900
 necessary daily and efficiently and for 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.280
 1 device, I think better let's say 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.520
 so maybe not the best just 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.360
 alternative on principle will cost 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.729
 It can be twice cheaper price well 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.490
 about 20-30 dollars cheaper you do not 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:38.060
 find who uses 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:40.400
 Well, lanterns but lovers there like me 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.360
 maybe someone needs this 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:48.050
 Charger 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:50.240
 who does not need it is possible 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.750
 everything will be unnecessarily still dimensions 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.000
 small daoud take on the road then 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.479
 Still, it has certain dimensions 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.340
 already and let's say compare it to the charger 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.380
 device is small here on one channel 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.050
 there are such well, a maximum of two then 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:10.520
 Two times in three they will be in place 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:14.750
 borrow less so who will do 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:18.590
 decide yourself the question is what is it 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.530
 phoenix and the very name of this company 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.389
 already assumes a certain level 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.590
 prices 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:26.870
 so if you want to have 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.900
 quality goods put money 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.700
 have if no one can find 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.450
 a lot of alternatives to this 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:38.150
 prices device 2 times lower than I 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:41.630
 checked already have 4 to Chinese mom 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.520
 Charging on the functionality is exactly the same 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.740
 external similarity here is the quality she 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.449
 held hands not to distinguish now if it were not 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:52.310
 here it is etiquette to the name phoenix 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:55.810
 for no one would say anything but the price 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.810
 while it was 2 times lower 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:02.930
 perhaps all I wanted to say to everyone 

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:06.250
 thanks for watching subscribe to 

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.250
 my channel bye
