00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.530
 in case a person 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.760
 things that 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.169
 cause in people 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.219
 but there are a considerable number of questions 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.279
 as it turned out still quite well in 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.389
 framework organized 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.099
 component group is also about ways 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.679
 mappings 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:18.550
 collection 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.830
 film company which is in debt 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.009
 of the company 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.029
 given the price 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.050
 only these instructions are different 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.599
 enough 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.419
 I tried to be seen 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.340
 first case 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.020
 use layers 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.000
 who enter the stage 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.510
 and figure it out 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.340
 combine groups 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.990
 and market components 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.380
 and yuar 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 means and for this follows that it is not necessary 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.760
 it has a scene where there are different 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 Board games 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.250
 I remember that there is 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.690
 respectively naumova 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.030
 those scene where just from the whole object is shown 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.510
 but we will consider 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.140
 expiration 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.680
 turkey scenes where 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.030
 objects shown partially 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.770
 here they are just for us it will be 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.160
 be of interest 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.680
 respectively 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.140
 I have now opened tursynbek 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.760
 something is hidden 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.790
 i.e. other hidden objects 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.460
 I do not see 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.729
 only internal stuffing and floors 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.400
 what else what 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.380
 if you all see the turbine objects but 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.860
 I'm sure they are coming 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.380
 structures 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.620
 with open flies in ives 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.910
 yuar discovered that i have in it 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.970
 word in this scene 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.929
 preserved modern 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.959
 Inclusion settings included typicality 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.390
 that is, visible and invisible seventy 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.050
 its 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.880
 only 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.320
 Apparently not only a correspondent can 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 cook from kenya 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.879
 to 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.909
 that is, let's say Pochayev's 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.670
 as part of the future mother-in-law scene and back 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.639
 like that 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.269
 the scene will be understood 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.569
 dream state preservation because 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.599
 we are not 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.429
 she was updated so she remembered 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:27.990
 Nhodkinskaya key 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.239
 even on Nightingale 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.649
 mean percentage 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.609
 Imagine that I want to add pictures 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.219
 inter object 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.150
 FC Poltava and so that it does not appear on 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.459
 only in public place 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.909
 order 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.040
 let us suppose 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.369
 I want to 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.369
 conditions 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.809
 yourself where is shown just heard 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.979
 reflecting create some kind of new object 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.979
 I don't know, let's do it 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.679
 this is such a country thing 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.629
 I chose the first 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.179
 as for the packaging of this amount 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:16.489
 her 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.670
 now i guess u have other scenes 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.940
 it will not be he is not needed nobody needs 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.769
 just for a word 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.169
 there is even such freedom 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.639
 same 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.329
 material 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.959
 remind ways of concrete 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.289
 strengthened even sure and do something 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:38.549
 I didn't need it at all 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.269
 in order to avoid 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.259
 it is necessary to just become Estonia 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.099
 and if i am now 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.229
 there will be only 13 00 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:50.209
 how much silence which is sharply current 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.199
 which all courts 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.319
 i.e 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.229
 decide 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.049
 this task can be very simple 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.369
 assign him that layer 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.999
 which this scene is not displayed 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.999
 that is, besides weak 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.779
 writer switching others everything in it 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:10.009
 disappears 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.089
 this way and i can 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.449
 but create it in different scenes 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.659
 necessary objects let's work 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.059
 spanish many years on it not even plans 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.650
 were 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.350
 I do not know what's with the three-dimensional model 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.360
 where only furniture is displayed 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.960
 but we still have no order 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.140
 there are no other layer on these objects 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.729
 scenes he will not appear 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.370
 on record trotsenko how 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.650
 see what condition applies 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.050
 yes you can 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.050
 delete objects no they need 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.490
 You can certainly allocate 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.330
 content directly objects to watch 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.990
 what kind of oil they are subject to but also 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.150
 There are sich this such 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.379
 with us and so on 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.690
 my name is Kara 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.379
 is she canceled 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:02.259
 belt 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.039
 and here on the right clicking on that Kumkol 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.819
 recruit Cape Verde 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.020
 accordingly and now 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.610
 that defeat 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.839
 models 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.339
 but ian himself 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.259
 set materials even more true 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:16.490
 to tell 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.539
 monterrey why materials because 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.749
 click on the icon 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:23.009
 average advice 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.550
 on her 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.680
 opposite the name that such 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.219
 want legs 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:29.749
 choose 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:31.610
 skin layer 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.849
 which me now what warmth sometimes 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.849
 subject well transparency 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.449
 not so i will see right away that i have 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:43.589
 lies alone 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:44.740
 wherein 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.270
 if i take away the bottom line 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.479
 back to normal 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.659
 the scene where she has all my stuff 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:53.839
 or already 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.150
 including such a barrier or skirt 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.150
 what condition does not apply 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.319
 but all is not smooth 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.550
 use everyone know him and memorization 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.039
 in some customize the display styles on 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.979
 they need to say shevchishin 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.860
 in principle constantly 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.340
 and probably all prices
