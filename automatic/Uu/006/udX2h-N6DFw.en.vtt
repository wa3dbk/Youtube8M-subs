 thanks to people like the dream of the ilicitano botanist santiagos was born 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.230
 it is becoming a reality 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.110
 and the phoenix dactylifera

 dates if it is female and females only 4% of the world five months

 impossible and it is in a bone of Latinos who are beaten after their 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.280
 impact like those of dark brown green color here remained 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.740

 the carrycot and the art ain 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:39.959
 doha look at the forum all 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.149
 of the date palm this excessive power 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:46.630
 it can be varied if harvested rk 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.210
 in that sense he recalled that the chaos commented the hotel in its perfect state 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.540
 despise taken from the track the cool fresh branch a delicious 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.210
 the freshly harvested date 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.539
 wants very little to remain a delicacy 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.249
 if practically nothing or really is we the only thing we do is like 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.440
 you see 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.810
 what is done is a second selection that I'm not going to make of palmero corte is 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.030
 a very tired job and then he makes a first screen of what is 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.399
 practically and edible that is seen at a glance 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.769
 and the girls what they do here is select a little the difference between 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.599
 what are the dates that will go directly to the final consumer to 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.719
 any of us 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.769
 for those dates that we can because a little racist chefs do 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.019
 a very different treatment of Latin let's do something so although 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.730
 to remember the ground 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.020
 the citrus aroma or the unctuousness of the date and the touch of getafe for example 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.700
 expresses 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.810
 It is a little bit a tribute to the halls of Santiago 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.370
 the dates that these are giving 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.379
 much to do to haute cuisine 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.549

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.790
 where Rodrigo de la Calle was informed, it was also a piece where

 this excellent cook rises an exquisite restaurant 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:01.120
