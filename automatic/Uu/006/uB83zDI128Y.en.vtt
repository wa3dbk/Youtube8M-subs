00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
should be high because i was actually a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.450 
should be high because i was actually a
for<00:00:35.040> failed<00:00:35.340> attempt<00:00:35.930> but<00:00:36.930> yeah<00:00:38.510> all<00:00:39.510> right<00:00:39.750> I

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460

for failed attempt but yeah all right I
yeah<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.360> least<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.660> did<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.960> twice

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.549 
and I think there was a little bit of a
d<00:00:44.550> sink<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.539> might<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> little<00:00:46.200> bit<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> all

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
