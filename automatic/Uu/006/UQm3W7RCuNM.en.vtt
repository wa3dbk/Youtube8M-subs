 one month they went from painting nothing more and 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.310
 nothing less than the Antarctic 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.420
 we go with fanny miranda so that we 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.420
 tell what happens for her 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.360
 hello I lisboa this recipe I'm going to 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.070
 present a success story in June 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.810
 last year we visited this school 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.970
 because they presented us with a project 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.100
 rainwater harvesting was just 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.690
 a model later we return when 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.000
 had installed this system and today 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.280
 we are back because five students 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.930
 managed to visit Antarctica thanks to 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.030
 this project that benefited your school 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.950
 and also from the community we are going to see the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.720
 history 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.580
 karla wheelock the first woman 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.380
 Latin American in conquering the summit 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.200
 of Mount Everest and in these glaciers 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.390
 of the south pole ana laura néstor raúl 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.170
 arturo and joseph angel winners 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.920
 Contest of Cecu to Antarctica 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.200
 the objective really is to raise awareness 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.110
 to young people from the effects that the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.250
 climate change is causing the az 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.830
 make them recognize that their action has 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.840
 a positive impact they acted before 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.490
 the lack of water in your community with the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.650
 help from his teacher installed this 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.750
 collection system rainwater and 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.570
 the school stopped suffering the shortage 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.229
 of the vital liquid by rain to 14,000 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.780
 liters four minutes by precipitation 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.690
 clear of moderate intense when it 's a 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.740
 rain with less abundance are captured 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.930
 up to seven thousand liters 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.119
 thus they undertook the great journey says 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.189
 carla that to 100 years and so it was full 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.090
 level but now with warming 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.040
 global there were no longer parts of land and 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.380
 the penguins their feet of the penguins 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.689
 they were already very hurt because there was 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.720
 on the rocks to see the pollution 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.290
 that also changes us put us to 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.800
 think more leaves me very 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.920
 a great learning because I already know what 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.200
 what I do here, maybe it will be passed on 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.080
 when we were walking in the beauty no 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.430
 the melting of the glaciers was 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.640
 surprising and in truth reflections 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.760
 because it drains a lot of water and then 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.210
 you say that we provoke it if the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.190
 poles were made this sea ​​level 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.130
 will increase and that will cause 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.990
 that the zones are below the level of 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.180
 sea is flooded 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.400
 the expedition took place from 27 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.260
 December to January 7 and today Karla 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.390
 wheelock visit CECU to motivate 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.100
 the rest of the students the project of 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.260
 rainwater collection will be replicated in the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.770
 community health center and 80 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.770
 more houses 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.400
 and so far my report we see the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.580
