this has been surprisingly durable right
now<00:05:36.250> I'm<00:05:36.400> going<00:05:36.550> to<00:05:36.610> throw<00:05:36.759> it<00:05:36.909> directly<00:05:37.090> up<00:05:37.599> in

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
now I'm going to throw it directly up in

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.649 
now I'm going to throw it directly up in
the<00:05:38.110> air<00:05:38.259> and<00:05:38.650> it's<00:05:39.550> going<00:05:39.639> to<00:05:39.699> land<00:05:39.939> on<00:05:40.240> grass

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
the air and it's going to land on grass

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.559 
the air and it's going to land on grass
or<00:05:41.050> mulch<00:05:41.409> I'm<00:05:42.310> not<00:05:42.460> going<00:05:42.639> to<00:05:42.699> do<00:05:42.849> concrete

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 
or mulch I'm not going to do concrete

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.330 
or mulch I'm not going to do concrete
yet<00:05:43.750> because<00:05:44.080> that<00:05:44.349> that's<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.919> probably<00:05:45.310> the

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
yet because that that's the probably the

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.249 
yet because that that's the probably the
point<00:05:45.639> where<00:05:46.389> I<00:05:46.419> see<00:05:46.750> it<00:05:46.840> failing<00:05:49.169> so<00:05:50.169> we're

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
point where I see it failing so we're

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:51.779 
point where I see it failing so we're
going<00:05:50.349> to<00:05:50.439> make<00:05:50.560> sure<00:05:50.800> it's<00:05:51.009> working<00:05:51.069> one<00:05:51.610> more

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
going to make sure it's working one more

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.360 
going to make sure it's working one more
time<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.840> seems<00:05:53.229> to<00:05:53.409> be<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:53.830> we<00:05:54.159> are<00:05:54.279> just

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
time it seems to be and we are just

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.100 
time it seems to be and we are just
going<00:05:54.550> to<00:05:54.610> toss<00:05:54.759> this<00:05:55.000> straight<00:05:55.779> up<00:05:55.960> in<00:05:56.080> the

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
going to toss this straight up in the

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.309 
going to toss this straight up in the
air<00:05:57.360> it's<00:05:58.360> going<00:05:58.539> to<00:05:58.569> hopefully<00:05:58.810> not<00:05:59.139> get

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 
air it's going to hopefully not get

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:05.749 
air it's going to hopefully not get
stuck<00:05:59.590> in<00:05:59.740> a<00:05:59.800> tree<00:06:02.939> okay<00:06:03.939> I<00:06:03.969> lost<00:06:04.360> in<00:06:04.479> the<00:06:04.569> Sun<00:06:04.750> I

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
stuck in a tree okay I lost in the Sun I

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.439 
stuck in a tree okay I lost in the Sun I
thought<00:06:06.759> that's<00:06:06.849> going<00:06:07.060> to<00:06:07.120> hit<00:06:07.210> me<00:06:07.300> in<00:06:07.389> the

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
thought that's going to hit me in the

still works what we're going to do is we
are<00:06:22.410> going<00:06:22.530> to<00:06:22.890> do<00:06:23.070> the<00:06:23.690> same<00:06:24.690> kind<00:06:25.050> of<00:06:25.200> toss<00:06:25.470> up

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
are going to do the same kind of toss up

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.320 
are going to do the same kind of toss up
in<00:06:26.070> the<00:06:26.220> air<00:06:27.650> and<00:06:28.820> this<00:06:29.820> time<00:06:30.060> we're<00:06:30.180> going<00:06:30.270> to

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
in the air and this time we're going to

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.830 
in the air and this time we're going to
do<00:06:30.540> it<00:06:30.690> on<00:06:31.670> concrete<00:06:32.670> now<00:06:32.940> this<00:06:33.180> is<00:06:33.480> probably

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
do it on concrete now this is probably

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.510 
do it on concrete now this is probably
the<00:06:34.020> point<00:06:34.320> where<00:06:34.470> it's<00:06:34.620> going<00:06:34.950> to<00:06:35.070> fail<00:06:37.520> and

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290 
I'm hesitant to even do this because

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.830 
I'm hesitant to even do this because
it's<00:06:40.620> already<00:06:40.830> seen<00:06:41.070> so<00:06:41.250> much<00:06:41.370> damage<00:06:41.760> as<00:06:42.180> you
