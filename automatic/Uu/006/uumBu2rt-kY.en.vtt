range<00:00:59.289> though<00:01:00.289> long<00:01:00.559> distance<00:01:01.039> may<00:01:01.280> be<00:01:01.339> a

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
range though long distance may be a

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.250 
range though long distance may be a
little<00:01:01.879> weaker<00:01:02.210> than<00:01:02.389> some<00:01:02.629> other<00:01:02.839> assault

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
little weaker than some other assault

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.920 
little weaker than some other assault
rifles<00:01:03.319> it's<00:01:04.190> still<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.430> very<00:01:04.729> strong<00:01:04.930> assault

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.690 
rifles it's still a very strong assault
rifle<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.560> what<00:01:06.799> I<00:01:06.830> love<00:01:07.070> about<00:01:07.190> this<00:01:07.460> weapon

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
rifle and what I love about this weapon

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.170 
rifle and what I love about this weapon
is<00:01:08.060> that<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:08.390> basically<00:01:08.840> has<00:01:09.110> no<00:01:09.350> recall

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
is that it basically has no recall

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.390 
is that it basically has no recall
shooting<00:01:11.180> at<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.360> rate<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.920> 769<00:01:12.920> rounds<00:01:13.250> per

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
shooting at a rate of 769 rounds per

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.240 
shooting at a rate of 769 rounds per
minute<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:14.030> sa80<00:01:14.690> 5s<00:01:15.440> fire<00:01:15.800> rate<00:01:16.040> is

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
minute the sa80 5s fire rate is

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.490 
minute the sa80 5s fire rate is
considered<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.120> be<00:01:17.240> exceptionally<00:01:18.020> high<00:01:18.320> in

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
considered to be exceptionally high in

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.180 
considered to be exceptionally high in
his<00:01:18.590> class

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
his class

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.460 
his class
therefore<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:19.940> guns<00:01:20.180> ability<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:21.020> very

therefore the guns ability is very

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.290 
therefore the guns ability is very
versatile<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.490> weapon<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.060> gets

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
versatile and is a weapon that gets

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.570
