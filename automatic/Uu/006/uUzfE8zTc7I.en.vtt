 concert companionship 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.049
 all this created an atmosphere of the present 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:23.910
 holiday 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.660
 the purpose of which was to stop 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.540
 believers for further 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.340
 missionary service 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.340
 but sent by lord 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.940
 engaged in this service 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.030
 since this system is carrying the sixth 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.030
 sessions and around the world just cause 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.580
 I and I know that preaching is important 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.080
 very diverse ways in their 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.790
 the mayorâ€™s life by that light 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.780
 goes out of our lives since 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.430
 Syria ending workplace 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.900
 street trolley 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.269
 but naturally 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.869
 direct recognition of a person to children 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.769
 and this is her English west I 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.079
 I guess, that 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.219
 uah it's a few of these people 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.319
 but nevertheless we have here also 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.029
 band obs 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:23.999
 tons of people shared themselves for several months 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.459
 to devote ourselves completely in the morning 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.679
 till evening to and preach 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:29.419
 gospel 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:30.539
 I think that 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.269
 this is very important urgent all the more 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.039
 one of the main aspects that we are to you 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.639
 industrial production of our generation 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.729
 the generation that lives with us 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.569
 they won't live anymore 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.719
 they will live before us and after us there is always no 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.719
 it is even to hear commitments 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.340
 The first thing that impresses me is 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.049
 sessions 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.609
 powerful presence of the holy spirit 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.279
 the bush is here at this place 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.809
 the question is felt 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.489
 which leading leading 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.669
 in all in all stripes 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.649
 here to me of course 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.019
 doubt 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.179
 but strong emotion 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.249
 strong feelings of experience 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.689
 I am glad that 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:12.799
 our churches 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:13.989
 it happens 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.999
 there is no such event 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.429
 so that's all that was said on 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:20.819
 what new understanding of that 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.309
 reassessing the progress of such balls a new approach to 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:24.469
 to the ministry 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.739
 try reached your time 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.739
 I think it will be possible 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.879
 but left behind 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.090
 I let my generation reach it 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.919
 always me 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.919
 any generation on topical 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.079
 anytime overtaking 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.309
 because there is nothing else 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.529
 the impossible 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:47.939
 generations 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.119
 but for this we exist 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:51.819
 at this time to achieve it 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.969
 generations as well 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.109
 really it's real 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.559
 because god bless him 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:59.699
 I consider that 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.739
 the collection is all real 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.639
 but still not out 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.389
 I liked it very much 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.389
 unforgettable impressions on the very 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.169
 business 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.219
 impressions are very bad 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.579
 this fact shareholders once 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.669
 during the conference i 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.279
 but it will appear very soon very soon 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.279
 it really affect the conference 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:25.639
 but even that amount which 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.400
 present this conference think that 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.400
 yes if all that will be implemented 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.499
 what was home here i think that 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.499
 Transbaikal region, he stressed little 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.559
 conquer 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.559
 but you know just like earthly paradise 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.120
 quite real it's real enough 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.010
 Well, not on their own but to his words 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.330
 real hotel 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
 if god reached us 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.340
 those that I may be specifically for 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.690
 I will say myself who used to think she was 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.870
 this is an incorrigible person 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.159
 oh i think that 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.900
 nothing is impossible for god 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.749
 conference ended 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:10.419
 but what the participants got 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.580
