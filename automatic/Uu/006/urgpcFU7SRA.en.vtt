00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.090
 hello to all of works tells me about 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.040
 administered on the kayak page and 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.010
 luckily it can simplify them a bit 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.240
 what is to deactivate the extra 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.520
 what we are going to do is log 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.110
 directly by the launcher and is 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.240
 tie the part of the black screen that 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.340
 a lot of people said it's very complicated 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.740
 but we're going to need some agility 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.370
 yes 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.630
 we have here the 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.660
 the cadiz is very open 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.969
 and when the extra packard just appears 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.910
 when it disappears we come and fix the 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.100
 yes and we do not pass quickly when 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 the loading screen appears then 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.810
 come on we did not know check 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.830
 but fiction 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.550
 I hope it appears on the screen 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.080
 load already we come and we passed to so no 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.570
 we can let it happen here because if 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.910
 happens from this this point we disconnect 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.640
 something 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.780
 now we open the xxv ​​air 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.780
 disable extra 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.640
 in addition the process 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.760
 let's go look for the white bread properties 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.420
 further down we find the three 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.509
 With 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.010
 the blank process is mentioned more 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.970
 integers at the end of the process 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.680
 according to close 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.680
 with this we can close the extra 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.150
 Hermine it 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.520
 we inject the envelope 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.630
 in the same second button miscellaneous a 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.399
 sector in our intranet 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.299
 What happens sometimes is that the game 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.600
 closes if with this with this method if the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.930
 game is going to close a couple of times but 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.930
 good 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 we enter 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.470
 process t 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.099
 with this you can close this 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.099
 we solve the pp 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.640
 we wait for it to load 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.630
 Well I hope you enjoy it if you 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.870
 liked please subscribe to my channel 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.850
 that is taking videos clarifying use of 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.850
 hacks and possible tutorials
