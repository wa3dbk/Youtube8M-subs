00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.960
 hello people how we met but that 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.279
 be perfect because I am very happy 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.880
 because I just unlock those 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 instants in 96 the new one is there's no 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.689
 because they are giving you a new 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.489
 I do not care, I really do not care 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.739
 know why he healed me 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.840
 I wanted the 96 because I wanted to continue 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.870
 when the company several 4 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.340
 something put together that I do not use commonly 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.760
 in any other game but here what 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.750
 It causes no confusion in certain 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.070
 things and how to unlock weapons 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.350
 when it comes to the galvos boys no 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.120
 it's about the gallons being that 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.080
 they took the same game because in 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.479
 the least is commented is the experience 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.820
 that has got three gallons of 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.250
 sniper or kill six people 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.010
 per for per gallon or that would be 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.540
 18 in total in a single round as a tram 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.070
 and that you get those from london you can 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.420
 get from different rounds the only thing 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.369
 yes you have to get to it 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.640
 round is what is being asked that is a 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.759
 death with the dmr or the rifle that already 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.500
 I have spoken that they are automatic 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.970
 death with the shotgun and a death with 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.000
 the 64 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.690
 here the good of death 94 and get 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 also the last of what was needed 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.460
 in each round and nothing else I need 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.250
 what is death with the dmr that here 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.119
 I'm going there that is the rifle this 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.340
 I really had video cut because 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.360
 tied as seven times continuous with 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.760
 to get that damn thing out 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.290
 when not so many were 23 but already 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.480
 you know waited because I was watching the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.250
 point to which takes more in the middle and so 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.090
 that I'm not going to get it anymore so 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.090
 I was worrying 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.460
 possible forgiveness continued after that 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.590
 here I came to this area I see there are two 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.450
 is a little person on the right side and the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.520
 first seven dead we are not tall no 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.350
 you can not see yourself dies like that 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.790
 was and already at the end died villa del 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.070
 they killed me it does not matter because it came I have 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.840
 got death contain me 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.300
 you only need death with the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.890
 shotgun so I proceeded I took my 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.920
 shotgun that never grabbed the shotgun 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.970
 that I had as I have I think like ten 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.550
 deaths 11 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.320
 here I was frightened at a time because 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.320
 arrived later 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.140
 and we are going to kill 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.660
 no no no no no that was the coyotera well 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.640
 I said where the fuck also snippert 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.100
 and I was kind of desperate because I did not 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.250
 found so that the game ended is 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.890
 lynching by saying cellay yes to all his 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.360
 creditors because I did not get my sniper 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.520
 I wanted to I do where my is 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.140
 nobody but I came to the menu 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.120
 of this once I start looking 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.400
 well I got everything then where are 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.650
 I had not noticed my and the Peruvian 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.750
 unlockable there already went out and it was where 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.940
 I could breathe a little more where I got my 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.960
 tone of voice where I said good that you give 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.310
 it's in more because I'm not 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.860
 unblock in the moment I want to 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.170
 see my sniper there but it was 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.090
 unlocked so here I share 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.520
 besides a small a small part of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.440
 what this is nor did I lose here another has 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.270
 nothing else with the measure x8 I thought that 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.850
 it did not make me at the moment 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.260
 when it comes with x8 it's a request what 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.660
 that is pretty accurate almost not 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.450
 they have the deflection of the bullet and that is 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.790
 quite comfortable and there was nothing else 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.190
 as for 10 deaths 11 but it has been 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.040
 great a little late and pretty 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.500
 pretty accurate we can that little 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.910
 part is how to unlock the sniper as 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.920
 Unlock is known but if you liked it 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.930
