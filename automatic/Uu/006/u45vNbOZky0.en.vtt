accordingly<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.710> probably<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.010> most

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
accordingly is is it's probably the most

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.009 
accordingly is is it's probably the most
important<00:00:29.699> part<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> stand<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:30.689> I'm

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
important part of the stand up if I'm

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.470 
important part of the stand up if I'm
being<00:00:31.260> driven<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.679> my<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:32.070> side<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.730> I

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
being driven on my right side and I

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.299 
being driven on my right side and I
choose<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:33.989> an<00:00:34.140> outside<00:00:34.530> leg<00:00:34.770> stand<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.190> on

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
choose to do an outside leg stand up on

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.819 
choose to do an outside leg stand up on
my<00:00:35.430> left<00:00:35.730> well<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.110> pressure<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.739> on

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
my left well then all the pressure is on

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
my left well then all the pressure is on
my<00:00:37.950> right<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.640> than<00:00:38.760> likely<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:39.210> going

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
my right and more than likely I'm going

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.869 
my right and more than likely I'm going
back<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> ground<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.129> finding<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
back to the ground so finding and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.209 
back to the ground so finding and
identifying<00:00:41.969> where<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> pressure<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
identifying where the pressure is in the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.209 
identifying where the pressure is in the
stand<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.640> process<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.360> very<00:00:46.230> important<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
stand up process is very important the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.770 
stand up process is very important the
drill<00:00:47.489> we're<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.030> right<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:48.510> is

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
drill we're going to do right now is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.900 
drill we're going to do right now is
rets<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> place<00:00:49.890> pressure<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.700> we're

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
rets going to place pressure and we're

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.950 
rets going to place pressure and we're
going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> choose<00:00:51.300> between<00:00:51.570> middle<00:00:54.079> right<00:00:56.960> or

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
going to choose between middle right or

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.490 
going to choose between middle right or
left<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.210> there's<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.690> wrong<00:01:01.230> way

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
left and there's not really a wrong way

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.609 
left and there's not really a wrong way
to<00:01:01.789> line<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.210> long<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> pressure<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.470> on

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
to line up as long as the pressure is on

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
to line up as long as the pressure is on
that<00:01:04.769> portion<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> body<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.150> we're<00:01:06.270> gonna

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
that portion of the body so we're gonna

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.609 
that portion of the body so we're gonna
start<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> center<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.299> got<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.140> got

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
start with the center the I got I got

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
start with the center the I got I got
rhett<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.159> Diego<00:01:11.970> putting<00:01:12.390> pressure<00:01:12.659> on

rhett and Diego putting pressure on
Dustin<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.040> Kaiser<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:15.090> good<00:01:15.689> pressure

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
Dustin and Kaiser here good pressure

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
Dustin and Kaiser here good pressure
good<00:01:16.500> pressure<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> feels<00:01:17.580> like

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
good pressure that's what it feels like

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
good pressure that's what it feels like
when<00:01:18.240> somebody's<00:01:18.600> lined<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
when somebody's lined up right in the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
when somebody's lined up right in the
middle<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.490> exactly<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
middle of you that's exactly what it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.270 
middle of you that's exactly what it
feels<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.720> heavy<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.740> heavy<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
feels like it's heavy it's heavy you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
feels like it's heavy it's heavy you
feel<00:01:23.549> weighed<00:01:23.850> down<00:01:24.409> alright<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.770> what

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
feel weighed down alright so what

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.830 
feel weighed down alright so what
they're<00:01:26.070> gonna<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:27.360> they<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> hit

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
they're gonna do is when they go to hit

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.780 
they're gonna do is when they go to hit
their<00:01:28.020> stand<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:28.740> whether<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.610> right

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
their stand up now whether it's a right

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.210 
their stand up now whether it's a right
leg<00:01:30.060> inside<00:01:30.750> leg<00:01:30.990> left<00:01:31.259> leg<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.650> outside<00:01:32.009> leg

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
points the pressures in the middle okay

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.810 
points the pressures in the middle okay
they're<00:01:37.229> gonna<00:01:37.320> hit<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> stand<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.700> hit

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
they're gonna hit a stand up as they hit

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.170 
they're gonna hit a stand up as they hit

BAM<00:01:42.180> they're<00:01:42.540> finding<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.049> pressure

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
BAM they're finding that pressure

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.580 
BAM they're finding that pressure
they're<00:01:43.829> finding<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.430> pressure

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
they're finding that pressure
