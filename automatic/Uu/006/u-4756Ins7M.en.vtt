00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.829
 this is how after planting an outdoor plant 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 after planting a plant means moving a place 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.130
 can be for aesthetic reasons or for the health of the plant 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.070
 this task requires some care 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.320
 that the life of the plant take risks and it is necessary to take the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.319
 necessary precautions 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.319
 to prevent it from suffering irreparable damage 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.170
 As a first step it is necessary to avoid breaking the burial 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.239
 that is, the ball is earth that covers the roots 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.740
 so that the handling is easier 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.390
 was waiting around the bush to let loose the small 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.110
 Then we proceed to wrap the burial with a strong plastic a score of 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.810
 guerrillas in it 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.020
 and if you take care carefully without haste to prevent it from breaking 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.620
 the earth which will be transferred to the plant 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.490
 it must be well prepared 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.570
 mixed with organic matter to give it the necessary nutrients 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.660
 as natural as possible avoiding using filters 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.640
 although you will not need much water in winter you should water it to maintain the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 humidity 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
 i 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.490
 sun
