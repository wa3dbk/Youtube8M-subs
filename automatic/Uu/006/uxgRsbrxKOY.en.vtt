00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
ideas what better place to do it than in

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.590 
ideas what better place to do it than in
something<00:02:22.010> that's<00:02:22.100> architectural<00:02:22.819> e<00:02:22.880> bizarre

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
something that's architectural e bizarre

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.140 
something that's architectural e bizarre
as<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.410> belt<00:02:24.620> it's<00:02:24.800> much<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.550> cabin

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
as for the belt it's much like a a cabin

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.910 
as for the belt it's much like a a cabin
I<00:02:26.240> built<00:02:26.480> off<00:02:26.780> or<00:02:27.020> make<00:02:27.140> magazine<00:02:27.350> in<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.709> video

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
I built off or make magazine in a video

I built off or make magazine in a video
waist<00:02:28.130> back<00:02:28.340> called<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.730> guy<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.940> get<00:02:29.150> away

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
waist back called the guy to get away

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.380 
waist back called the guy to get away
basically<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.740> took<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.100> cabin<00:02:31.580> flip<00:02:32.240> it

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
basically we took that cabin flip it

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.570 
basically we took that cabin flip it
upside<00:02:32.750> down<00:02:32.780> change<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.830> contours<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.550> a

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
upside down change the contours of it a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.250 
upside down change the contours of it a
little<00:02:34.730> bit<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.060> hung<00:02:35.540> her<00:02:35.630> from<00:02:35.660> ceiling

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
little bit and hung her from ceiling

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.460 
little bit and hung her from ceiling
couldn't<00:02:36.800> be<00:02:36.920> simpler<00:02:37.959> now<00:02:38.959> we<00:02:39.020> added<00:02:39.380> this

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
couldn't be simpler now we added this

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.930 
couldn't be simpler now we added this
piece<00:02:39.770> here<00:02:40.040> made<00:02:40.280> out<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.489> plywood<00:02:40.610> for

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
piece here made out of plywood for

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.610 
piece here made out of plywood for
triangulation<00:02:41.330> where<00:02:41.750> we<00:02:41.840> first<00:02:42.080> built<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
triangulation where we first built the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.530 
triangulation where we first built the
crunk<00:02:42.830> bunk<00:02:43.130> we<00:02:43.640> found<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.270> was<00:02:44.300> kind<00:02:44.510> of

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
crunk bunk we found that it was kind of

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.290 
crunk bunk we found that it was kind of
swaying<00:02:44.810> side<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.230> side<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.709> not<00:02:45.770> so<00:02:46.010> stable

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
swaying side to side and not so stable

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.460 
swaying side to side and not so stable
you<00:02:47.300> know<00:02:47.330> maybe<00:02:47.600> some<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:47.930> your<00:02:48.050> into<00:02:48.290> that

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
you know maybe some of your into that

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.410 
you know maybe some of your into that
that<00:02:48.830> motion<00:02:49.070> want<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.730> effect<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.269> don't

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
that motion want that effect but I don't

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.449 
that motion want that effect but I don't
mind<00:02:50.510> get<00:02:50.690> seasick<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.260> we<00:02:51.380> built<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.769> drill

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
mind get seasick so we built this drill

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.740 
mind get seasick so we built this drill
a<00:02:52.489> couple<00:02:52.580> holes<00:02:52.880> here<00:02:53.300> for<00:02:53.480> decorative

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
a couple holes here for decorative

at<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.290> workshop<00:03:09.470> we<00:03:09.890> place<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.310> windows<00:03:10.640> in

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
at the workshop we place the windows in

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.460 
at the workshop we place the windows in
the<00:03:10.850> position<00:03:11.239> we<00:03:11.330> wanted<00:03:11.630> them<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.900> against

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
the position we wanted them in against

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.620 
the position we wanted them in against
the<00:03:12.620> plywood<00:03:13.040> trace<00:03:13.610> them<00:03:13.820> out<00:03:13.970> took<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.269> jigsaw

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
the plywood trace them out took a jigsaw

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.840 
the plywood trace them out took a jigsaw
cut<00:03:15.260> out<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.440> silhouette<00:03:15.950> trimmed<00:03:16.610> them<00:03:16.730> in

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850
