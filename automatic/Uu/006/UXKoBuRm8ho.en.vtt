eighth inch opening and it plugs into

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.840 
eighth inch opening and it plugs into
the<00:01:33.509> side<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.869> computer<00:01:34.500> or<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> laptop<00:01:35.460> or

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the side of your computer or a laptop or

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
the side of your computer or a laptop or
whatever<00:01:36.240> you're<00:01:36.390> using<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> USB<00:01:37.350> which

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
whatever you're using with the USB which

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.870 
whatever you're using with the USB which
makes<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.540> much<00:01:39.689> simpler<00:01:40.400> now<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.460> would

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
makes it so much simpler now you would

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.080 
makes it so much simpler now you would
think<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.770> pocket<00:01:44.159> pod<00:01:44.340> has<00:01:44.640> USB

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
think that the pocket pod has USB

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.350 
think that the pocket pod has USB
opening<00:01:45.750> um<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:47.399> would<00:01:47.460> record<00:01:47.820> directly<00:01:48.030> from

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
opening um it would record directly from

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.870 
opening um it would record directly from
the<00:01:48.630> pocket<00:01:49.020> Todd<00:01:49.229> will<00:01:49.470> know<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.520> need<00:01:50.700> one

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the pocket Todd will know you need one

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.190 
the pocket Todd will know you need one
of<00:01:50.909> these<00:01:51.920> like<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.070> said<00:01:53.310> there's<00:01:54.030> about<00:01:54.420> $30

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
of these like I said there's about $30

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.280 
of these like I said there's about $30
and<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:55.649> work<00:01:56.310> pretty<00:01:56.549> good<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.049> you<00:01:58.049> also

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
and they work pretty good and you also

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.940 
and they work pretty good and you also
need<00:01:59.240> one<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.270> these<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.439> foot<00:02:01.740> long

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
it's two jacks connected together by one

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.500 
it's two jacks connected together by one
wire<00:02:10.270> one<00:02:11.200> more<00:02:11.470> thing<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:13.410> need<00:02:15.330> budget<00:02:16.330> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
wire one more thing you need budget a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.630 
wire one more thing you need budget a
cable<00:02:17.080> for<00:02:17.350> your<00:02:17.470> guitar<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.010> usually

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
cable for your guitar that you usually

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:44.729 
cable for your guitar that you usually
hook<00:02:18.850> up<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:36.390> works<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:43.020> highly<00:02:44.020> recommend<00:02:44.530> that

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
hook up to works I highly recommend that

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.780 
hook up to works I highly recommend that
you<00:02:45.060> put<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.300> AC<00:02:46.840> adapter<00:02:47.800> into<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.610> it's

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
you put the AC adapter into it it's

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.590 
you put the AC adapter into it it's
9-volt<00:02:49.920> goes<00:02:50.920> into<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.370> back<00:02:51.550> because<00:02:52.030> it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
9-volt goes into the back because it

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.420 
9-volt goes into the back because it
doesn't<00:02:53.140> really<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.590> good<00:02:53.950> battery<00:02:54.400> life

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
doesn't really have a good battery life

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.229 
doesn't really have a good battery life
we<00:02:55.180> uses<00:02:55.600> four<00:02:56.530> triple-a<00:02:57.070> batteries<00:02:57.580> but<00:02:57.970> they

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
we uses four triple-a batteries but they

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.380 
we uses four triple-a batteries but they
uses<00:02:58.780> them<00:02:58.930> up<00:02:59.080> pretty<00:02:59.350> fast<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.830> I<00:03:00.390> recommend

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
uses them up pretty fast so I recommend

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.510 
uses them up pretty fast so I recommend
plugging<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:01.930> into<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.350> wall<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.800> getting
