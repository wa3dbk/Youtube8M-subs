 With new eyes 

00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:08.850
 Whoever comes to Rome always thinks about eating a good pizza 

00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:13.138
 Therefore, today I want to take you to one of the most special pizzerias in the city 

00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:15.165
 Accompany me! 

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:19.566
 But what makes this pizzeria so special?

 Let's check!

 We are now going to know 

00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:41.272
 the heart of every pizzeria is the pizza maker, the most important part 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.409
 But also the cook, the chef, the waiters 

00:00:44.587 --> 00:00:47.587
 and all the people who are part of this beautiful project 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.680
 "The Inn of the Sunflowers" 

00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:52.502
 This is the initiative of a group of parents 

00:00:52.577 --> 00:00:54.577
 who have children with down syndrome 

00:00:54.627 --> 00:00:59.467
 Here, in an environment of great charity and joy 

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:02.656
 these young people are helped to enter the world of work 

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:09.529
 "La locanda dei girasoli" is located in the traditional Roman quarter of Quadraro 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.450
 a stone's throw from the Numidio Quadrato subway station 

00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:18.872
 It is a typically Roman place, ideal for spending an evening with the family 

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.891
 or organize an event with friends 

00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:29.383
 Very beautifull! 

00:01:30.304 --> 00:01:32.544
