00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.540
 for the central view we are with erick 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.460
 elias and mauritius castle is an honor 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.380
 for me to be able to talk with you 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.630
 also count a little bit like it 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.880
 they had already dubbed some 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.800
 animated movies but this one that marked 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.030
 for you the difference is the first 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.030
 Once it's my turn to do a program 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.180
 antagonistic character that carries the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.900
 overweight of the protagÃ³nico with which 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.900
 for me it was amazing to me that 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.480
 outside one of the two characters 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.530
 main for me is the great 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.900
 difference that there is in the movie 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.309
 Yes , of course I took earlier this job 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.570
 because if this is the character it is very 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.880
 it is very changeable it has many 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.170
 personalities is a scientist has 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.210
 many nuances and for me it was a challenge 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.229
 incredible very entertaining very funny 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.759
 and I had done nothing else the 1 - I'm 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.890
 like the same line as what I already 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.560
 one and we believe as the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.450
 voice tone search sometimes not in 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.039
 television without the theater the creation of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 a character because you can see how he walks 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.939
 as I'm going to do to go as 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.850
 create something visual here is like with the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.470
 pure voice go find the way and what 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.960
 I did in the first hour as I continue 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.190
 with that line and I let myself have fun 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.470
 I had a great time in the recordings 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.000
 then it was four or five days of 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.340
 pure fun ok 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.799
 obviously from the 1st the voice there is a 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.869
 big change between these two movies 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.709
 when there is the one you were not daddy and now 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.929
 you are already dad the change this sense to 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.390
 do the dubbing of the movie yes I think 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.909
 What is it 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.880
 1 I remember when I was recording 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.800
 always thought of me in my daughter lowered 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.070
 that you like when when you hear this you 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.959
 will have fun when he sees his fall 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.120
 hot cakes or like I was very 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.440
 present in me in the recordings and by 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.550
 another side because I already had a little more 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.260
 of villa had already seen more cartoons 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.800
 and I 've already seen how they were bending 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.150
 it was like more is soaked 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.560
 what are the doubles not and the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.780
 cartoons and I liked it very much 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.820
 really compared to what you see my 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.150
 daughter is visually is well parents 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.070
 that's why I recommend people to 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.260
 children and adults because it is impressive 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.950
 see in third dimension of all these 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.350
 colors and food this living is called 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.380
 the super mutant flip block or diatonic 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.310
 dynamic duplicated meal hour or 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.200
 abbreviating the mother 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 and in your house once only your children 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.190
 they are bigger then what do they think 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840
 for example of your work in dubbing 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.090
 and so good they loved the idea that 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.920
 just like me to start and 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.390
 always the villains suddenly in many 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.680
 movies the villains are suddenly 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.739
 much more entertaining than 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.430
 protagonists not in this case but but 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.720
 cruella deville island is the most villainous 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.280
 remembered from history and I believe no 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.920
 plus 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.750
 it was called was the weak and the characters 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.060
 of the Dalmatian couple did not improve 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.230
 as they were called then it is the best 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.930
 proof that suddenly a good 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:29.750
 villain character is much more likely 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:32.569
 that the nutritious bars the sap of my 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.970
 company I learned that the food of 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.880
 fadas blood bridge is more 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.680
 delicious and rich than normal food 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.970
 Well, it will usually look for space to 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.140
 central but if they can send you a 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.030
 I greet the readers of the magazine 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.800
 I would greatly appreciate the central 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.180
 central magazine as it gave them gentlemen or 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.100
 castle and I invite you to see me from 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.320

 to know immediately who I was 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.310
 I assure you it is very fun and cheap 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.570
