00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.940 
potential here that I could be the one
playing<00:01:59.060> for<00:01:59.329> a<00:01:59.359> quarter<00:01:59.749> pot<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.259> just<00:02:00.469> don't

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
playing for a quarter pot I just don't

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.889 
playing for a quarter pot I just don't
think<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.189> based<00:02:01.969> on<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.209> way<00:02:02.299> my<00:02:02.479> opponent's

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
think so based on the way my opponent's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.580 
think so based on the way my opponent's
playing<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.670> far<00:02:04.999> I<00:02:05.299> think<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.840> somebody<00:02:06.200> has

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
playing so far I think that somebody has

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.249 
playing so far I think that somebody has
at<00:02:06.859> least<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.189> two<00:02:07.369> three<00:02:07.639> but<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.690> think<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.110> might

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
at least a two three but I think I might

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.040 
at least a two three but I think I might
be<00:02:09.290> good<00:02:09.500> for<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.770> flush<00:02:10.040> and<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:11.690> pot<00:02:11.930> is

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
be good for the flush and that pot is

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.400 
be good for the flush and that pot is
four<00:02:12.320> thousand<00:02:12.860> now

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
four thousand now

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.720 
four thousand now
I'm<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.580> not<00:02:14.730> leaving<00:02:15.060> here<00:02:16.190> alright<00:02:17.190> let's

pause it right there we'll see what they

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.310 
pause it right there we'll see what they
