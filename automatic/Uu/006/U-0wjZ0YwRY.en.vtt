00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.930
 today 4 August 2014 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.750
 I'm here with a samsung galaxy s 51 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.420
 sound of two and a headset and a 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.390
 sony x vacations and other 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.939
 You're looking at a plate with 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.320
 and they 'll figure out what I'm going 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.320
 test today right? 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.760
 exactly the resistance to submersion 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.550
 their 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.350
 the three devices have a protection that 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.110
 you can leave it up to 30 minutes 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.469
 dipped in a meter of water 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.719
 well here we do not even have two fingers 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.840
 and water, or is it to go to all? 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.980
 bravely resisted this test before 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.870
 I wanted to show that the devices are 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.120
 operating systems running right 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.260
 I will show here that the fence is 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.150
 closed 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:18.549
 ok closed to entering water as manufacturer 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 suggests here also the fact of given and it 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.280
 You'll be the first to take a dip. 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.820
 in the water 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:37.049
 we have z2 he has postage here 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:40.479
 completely closed or 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.049
 running until then and will also give 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.049
 a dive 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.860
 I do not know if you noticed when S5 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.200
 fell into the water he did not activate anything 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.500
 the touch stopped working but it did not 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.420
 left the screen z2 is something I do not 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.659
 I like it when I go to take a shower, I want to 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.520
 see something and it gets full 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.229
 completely crazy any droplet 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.950
 that falls into it it interprets as touch 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.710
 and here we have the big sony 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.130
 wait for two is also closed 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.680
 here it is also closed 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:28.100
 everything worked so far and I also 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.100
 I'll dip him in the opaque 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.400
 Look, he also activated the screen as 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.160
 if there was a top it will appear 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.210
 a black screen now left I'm going to take 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.210
 he from the water then 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.330
 look at the s5 even with a few drops 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.030
 on the screen he does not interpret droplets 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.340
 how I touch and I can move the screen 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.470
 normal 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.840
 use it and another one as you are seeing it 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.870
 is making several commands as if the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:21.769
 on the screen were touches and here 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.810
 we have the z2 looks just have ignoring my 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.410
 Touch the screen. I'm going to give a cleaner. 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:34.269
 better and now it has started responding 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.269
 nor knife on my screen that 12 and another 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:48.790
 and ds5 fails only its use is still giving 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.380
 touches the screen as if someone were 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.380
 pressing something 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.750
 good first basic test did not let 30 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.580
 minutes was not a meter of water I had 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.860
 to make a quick cut in the recording 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.050
 Because I got a call and then it's over. 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.090
 messing up my book I'm not going 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.810
 show the following now I'll get it 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.670
 here ox perez is another and I will play a 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.709
 bit of water on his screen for you 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.780
 see how he interprets this as 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:22.960
 he also starts opening several 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.170
 menus playing as if water were 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:32.470
 on touches on the screen the same thing as with 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:34.660
 the two only then that propaganda of the 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.610
 rodents a man in the bathtub using the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.669
 device is not much like that 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.310
 if you try in Bahia it's try to use it 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.750
 in the bath and drops a droplet of water goes 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:50.470
 get in the way thinking it's a 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:54.070
 touch now not only look the same thing 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.110
 they are water resistant but this does not 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.930
 It means that you have peace of mind there 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.290
 to use a shower in the sauna in a 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.050
 bathtub in the pool because any is 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.300
 goal the holder of water to fall on the screen 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.470
 he will interpret as touch and this 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.470
 will not let you use the device 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.470
 naturally
