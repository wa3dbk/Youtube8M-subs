00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 and that people smith this I hope that 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.580
 you are all very good at everything 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.240
 case the form we find ourselves today 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.800
 for the very last episode of this round 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.719
 two hundred euros guys because like 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.360
 you can see on my balance it's me 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.760
 remains exactly 3 cents so 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.020
 so that's saying that I still have 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.850
 that slab so it's pretty annoying but 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.359
 but listen to it's life and like me 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.699
 said a lot of subscribers on 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.899
 twitter it's true it's very very 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.640
 hard to bet on this world cup 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.230
 there are results here that we 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.239
 expects outright not at all and that's it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.989
 it shows that each team has its own 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.840
 luck so 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.789
 so that's it's good it's good 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.780
 for the teams but after for us 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.739
 who pay it's true that's when 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.500
 even a lot more annoying 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.210
 So here we have three cents left 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.550
 so I think it's better 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
 stop there as I play like as 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.820
 I told you once I 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.469
 will be at zero euro I will start over 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.090
 I stop now and I think that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.440
 it's better it's a lot wiser to 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.449
 stop now is to continue 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.559
 continue continue because because 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.930
 it's not worth it but I regret 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.979
 still a lot of having to have done 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.260
 this bet on on nigeria because 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.390
 it's true it was 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.640
 I was really very very confident and 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.830
 to see them draw against 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.060
 iran what I was worse than disgust 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.920
 so in any case I do not really know what 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.820
 I'm going to do like as a series what to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.530
 ready because it's true that since 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.270
 I had had site this new idea of 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.770
 series and I was doing an episode by 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.660
 day 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.990
 well here I have not I do not think about 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.640
 something else after May but since I have 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.670
 a subscriber who gave me is credible 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.680
 that vic van challenge fader dedication to 3060 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.960
 that makes me really happy that 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.790
 you give me credit elsewhere it's 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.770
 a game it's a it's a guy who 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.780
 had already loaned me jesé rodríguez at 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.790
 very early money game so 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.440
 so here it is really super great 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.130
 guys and I really wanted to thank 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.900
 so I was thinking of doing a review of 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.350
 man of the match pay straws 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.479
 sorry and here and then I do not know what 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.520
 I'm going to do it right now I have 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.120
 really no idea but listen on 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.520
 will see what I'm going to find a 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.290
 in any case I hope this 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.489
 series will have pleased you and me 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.810
