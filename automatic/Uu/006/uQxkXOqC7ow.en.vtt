wanted to create a red mixer and I

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.989 
wanted to create a red mixer and I
started<00:00:57.199> with<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.379> really<00:00:58.010> light<00:00:58.339> kind<00:00:58.819> of

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
started with a really light kind of

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.259 
started with a really light kind of
pinky<00:00:59.780> peach<00:01:00.109> color<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:01.429> was<00:01:01.579> building<00:01:02.120> up

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
pinky peach color and was building up

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.540 
pinky peach color and was building up
from<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:03.589> really<00:01:03.949> just<00:01:04.400> wasn't

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
from that and it really just wasn't

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.730 
from that and it really just wasn't
blending<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.730> way<00:01:07.820> I<00:01:07.850> wanted<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.740> so

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
blending the way I wanted it to so

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.710 
blending the way I wanted it to so
really<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:10.130> ended<00:01:10.520> up<00:01:10.610> covering<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.180> most<00:01:11.540> of

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
really I ended up covering that most of

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.470 
really I ended up covering that most of
that<00:01:11.870> lighter<00:01:12.200> color<00:01:12.760> with<00:01:13.760> copics<00:01:14.270> you

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
that lighter color with copics you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.470 
that lighter color with copics you
remember<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.140> can<00:01:15.320> always<00:01:15.760> go<00:01:16.760> darker<00:01:17.240> so

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
remember you can always go darker so

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.380 
remember you can always go darker so
when<00:01:17.960> in<00:01:18.080> doubt<00:01:18.110> just<00:01:18.590> kind<00:01:19.580> of<00:01:19.700> start<00:01:20.120> light

about this stamp set is there are

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.570 
about this stamp set is there are
several<00:01:41.540> little<00:01:41.960> faces<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.040> can<00:01:43.220> stamp

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
several little faces that you can stamp

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.540 
several little faces that you can stamp
on<00:01:43.880> any<00:01:44.660> of<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:45.020> or<00:01:45.230> most<00:01:45.770> of<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.070> images<00:01:46.460> I

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
on any of the or most of the images I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.640 
on any of the or most of the images I
guess<00:01:46.730> I<00:01:46.850> should<00:01:47.030> say<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.960> give<00:01:48.320> them<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.500> little

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
guess I should say to give them a little

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.560 
guess I should say to give them a little
bit<00:01:48.800> of<00:01:48.920> character<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.700> chose<00:01:50.060> one<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.330> the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
bit of character so I chose one of the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.720 
bit of character so I chose one of the
little<00:01:51.170> face<00:01:51.470> images<00:01:52.070> they're<00:01:52.310> from<00:01:52.610> the

little face images they're from the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.220 
little face images they're from the
stamp<00:01:52.940> set<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.390> stamped<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.870> right<00:01:54.050> on<00:01:54.200> my

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
stamp set and stamped it right on my

mixing bowl and added some little pink
cheeks<00:01:56.450> there<00:01:56.840> I'll<00:01:57.170> finish<00:01:57.980> coloring<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:58.850> the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090

colors<00:02:03.380> there<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:04.030> then<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.060> will<00:02:05.450> move<00:02:05.630> on<00:02:05.960> to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
colors there and then I will move on to

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.150 
colors there and then I will move on to
coloring<00:02:07.820> in<00:02:08.410> some<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.619> rest<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:10.009> the

more<00:02:13.489> than<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:14.150> usually<00:02:14.540> do<00:02:14.989> sometimes<00:02:15.500> that

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
more than I usually do sometimes that

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.770 
more than I usually do sometimes that
happens<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.340> color<00:02:16.549> coloring<00:02:17.360> doesn't<00:02:17.659> go

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
happens the color coloring doesn't go

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.899 
happens the color coloring doesn't go
quite<00:02:18.079> the<00:02:18.230> way<00:02:18.409> you<00:02:18.530> want<00:02:18.769> it<00:02:18.829> to<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.670> if<00:02:19.790> you

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
quite the way you want it to but if you

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.670 
quite the way you want it to but if you
stick<00:02:20.209> with<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.659> usually<00:02:20.870> can<00:02:21.230> salvage

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
stick with it you usually can salvage

the image I'm going to color the eggs
Brown<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:26.769> decided<00:02:27.769> that<00:02:27.920> would<00:02:28.069> give<00:02:28.250> them<00:02:28.310> a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
Brown I decided that would give them a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.130 
Brown I decided that would give them a
little<00:02:28.760> bit<00:02:29.000> more<00:02:29.180> character<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.659> help<00:02:29.989> them

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
little bit more character and help them

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.569 
little bit more character and help them
show<00:02:30.349> up<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.620> little<00:02:30.799> bit<00:02:30.980> more<00:02:31.159> than<00:02:31.400> maybe

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
show up a little bit more than maybe

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.759 
show up a little bit more than maybe
coloring<00:02:32.120> them<00:02:32.329> with<00:02:32.989> just<00:02:33.260> some<00:02:33.439> really

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
coloring them with just some really

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.679 
coloring them with just some really
really<00:02:34.159> light<00:02:34.540> gray<00:02:35.540> markers<00:02:36.909> to<00:02:37.909> give<00:02:38.540> them

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
really light gray markers to give them

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.569 
really light gray markers to give them
some<00:02:38.870> shadowing<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:39.530> not<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.739> lot<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:39.980> color<00:02:40.250> so

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
some shadowing but not a lot of color so

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.369 
some shadowing but not a lot of color so
I<00:02:40.609> like<00:02:41.000> those<00:02:41.269> Browns<00:02:41.599> for<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.079> to<00:02:42.260> give

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
I like those Browns for that to give

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.670 
I like those Browns for that to give
some<00:02:42.620> brown<00:02:42.829> eggs<00:02:43.099> and<00:02:43.489> then<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.409> colored<00:02:45.409> the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
some brown eggs and then I colored the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.890 
some brown eggs and then I colored the
ends<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.099> rolling<00:02:46.400> pin<00:02:46.670> with<00:02:47.060> red<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.690> kind

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.539 
ends of the rolling pin with red to kind
of<00:02:47.959> coordinate<00:02:48.319> with<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.620> mixer<00:02:49.010> there<00:02:49.250> and

of coordinate with the mixer there and

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.890 
of coordinate with the mixer there and
then<00:02:49.670> I'll<00:02:49.790> color<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.299> rest<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739

fairly<00:03:08.329> white<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.200> just<00:03:09.680> took<00:03:09.829> some<00:03:09.889> very<00:03:10.549> very

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
fairly white I just took some very very

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.539 
fairly white I just took some very very
light<00:03:11.120> cool<00:03:11.420> gray<00:03:11.659> markers<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.409> or<00:03:12.680> warm<00:03:13.370> gray

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
light cool gray markers the or warm gray

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.129 
light cool gray markers the or warm gray
markers<00:03:13.939> rather<00:03:14.239> in<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.780> w0<00:03:15.620> 0<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.129> w1<00:03:16.639> and

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
markers rather in the w0 0 and w1 and

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.349 
markers rather in the w0 0 and w1 and
barely<00:03:18.139> added<00:03:18.620> color<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.819> flour<00:03:20.060> it's

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
barely added color to the flour it's

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.289 
barely added color to the flour it's
enough<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.959> give<00:03:21.199> it<00:03:21.230> just<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:22.220> tint<00:03:22.609> of<00:03:22.790> color

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
enough to give it just a tint of color

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.259 
enough to give it just a tint of color
but<00:03:23.569> not<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.840> whole<00:03:24.139> lot<00:03:24.349> then<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.639> decided<00:03:26.120> to

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
but not a whole lot then I decided to

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.960 
but not a whole lot then I decided to
color<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.560> flour<00:03:27.829> bag<00:03:28.099> and<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.699> didn't

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
color in the flour bag and I didn't

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.939 
color in the flour bag and I didn't
really<00:03:29.180> like<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.510> first<00:03:29.750> color<00:03:30.049> combination

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
really like the first color combination

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.849 
really like the first color combination
I<00:03:31.040> came<00:03:31.220> up<00:03:31.400> with<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:32.329> I<00:03:32.690> went<00:03:33.560> ahead<00:03:33.620> and

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
I came up with so I went ahead and

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.349 
I came up with so I went ahead and
stamped<00:03:34.069> it<00:03:34.280> again<00:03:34.549> and<00:03:34.760> colored<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.209> in<00:03:35.299> with

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
stamped it again and colored it in with

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.890 
stamped it again and colored it in with
some<00:03:35.840> blues<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:37.790> fact<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.180> had<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.389> stamp<00:03:38.750> it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
some blues and in fact I had to stamp it

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.020 
some blues and in fact I had to stamp it
two<00:03:39.169> more<00:03:39.319> times<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.829> first<00:03:40.010> one<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.459> blended

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
two more times the first one I blended

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.909 
two more times the first one I blended
it<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:41.329> much<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.840> started<00:03:42.199> to<00:03:42.260> bleed<00:03:42.590> out

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
it so much that it started to bleed out

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.119 
it so much that it started to bleed out
of<00:03:43.250> side<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.970> lines<00:03:44.650> because<00:03:45.650> I'm<00:03:45.799> using

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129
