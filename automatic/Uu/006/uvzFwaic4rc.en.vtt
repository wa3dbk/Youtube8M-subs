00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.530 
because it helps get the percussive
sound<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.760> metal<00:02:22.760> riff<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.180> you're

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
sound of this metal riff and you're

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.940 
sound of this metal riff and you're
going<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.720> be<00:02:23.780> doing<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:24.020> G<00:02:24.230> power<00:02:24.470> cord<00:02:24.860> if

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
going to be doing a G power cord if

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.620 
going to be doing a G power cord if
you've<00:02:25.069> never<00:02:25.160> done<00:02:25.280> power<00:02:25.640> cores<00:02:25.910> before<00:02:26.270> it

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
you've never done power cores before it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.360 
you've never done power cores before it
always<00:02:26.930> looks<00:02:27.140> like<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.319> shape<00:02:27.709> first

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
always looks like this shape first

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.760 
always looks like this shape first
fingers<00:02:28.730> going<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.970> go<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.780> gene<00:02:30.020> third

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
fingers going to go here the gene third

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.940 
fingers going to go here the gene third
fret<00:02:31.100> then<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.670> get<00:02:31.819> two<00:02:31.970> fingers<00:02:32.360> lined<00:02:32.569> up

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
fret then you get two fingers lined up

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.059 
fret then you get two fingers lined up
two<00:02:33.950> frets<00:02:34.160> higher<00:02:34.400> one<00:02:35.090> string<00:02:35.420> across<00:02:36.069> and

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
two frets higher one string across and

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.520 
two frets higher one string across and
you<00:02:37.160> get<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> power<00:02:37.610> cord<00:02:38.080> some<00:02:39.080> people<00:02:39.319> play<00:02:39.470> it

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you get a power cord some people play it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.870 
you get a power cord some people play it
with<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.769> two<00:02:39.950> notes<00:02:40.360> are<00:02:41.360> played<00:02:41.480> by<00:02:41.600> three

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
with just two notes are played by three

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.280 
with just two notes are played by three
choose<00:02:43.880> whichever<00:02:44.150> one<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.540> easiest<00:02:44.900> for<00:02:45.140> you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
choose whichever one is easiest for you

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.020 
choose whichever one is easiest for you
for<00:02:46.069> now<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.370> doesn't<00:02:46.610> really<00:02:46.760> make<00:02:46.970> a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
for now it doesn't really make a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.120 
for now it doesn't really make a
difference<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:48.850> from<00:02:49.850> this<00:02:50.000> G<00:02:50.209> note<00:02:51.130> you're

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
difference and from this G note you're

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.650 
difference and from this G note you're
then<00:02:52.250> going<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.459> do<00:02:52.549> this<00:02:52.700> sort<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.180> spastic

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
then going to do this sort of spastic

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.449 
then going to do this sort of spastic
finger<00:02:54.049> thing<00:02:54.260> with<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.470> first<00:02:54.769> finger<00:02:55.069> where

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
finger thing with the first finger where

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.650 
finger thing with the first finger where
it's<00:02:55.549> going<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.700> be<00:02:55.819> lifting<00:02:56.209> on<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.569> off

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
it's going to be lifting on and off

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.869 
it's going to be lifting on and off
different<00:02:57.470> notes<00:02:57.650> now<00:02:58.190> let<00:02:58.340> me<00:02:58.370> demonstrate

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.910 

see<00:03:03.879> how<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.150> moved<00:03:04.360> around<00:03:04.659> the<00:03:04.959> two-finger

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
see how it moved around the two-finger

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.380 
see how it moved around the two-finger
stay<00:03:06.159> in<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.310> same<00:03:06.459> place<00:03:06.519> or<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.030> one<00:03:07.180> if<00:03:07.299> you

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
stay in the same place or the one if you

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.729 
stay in the same place or the one if you
using<00:03:07.659> one<00:03:07.690> now<00:03:13.080> what<00:03:14.080> I'm<00:03:14.140> doing<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.530> I'm

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
using one now what I'm doing is I'm

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:15.990 
using one now what I'm doing is I'm
moving<00:03:15.099> through<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.340> couple<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.670> course<00:03:15.849> I'm

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
moving through a couple of course I'm

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.470 
moving through a couple of course I'm
basically<00:03:16.510> going<00:03:20.670> we're<00:03:21.670> doing<00:03:21.909> it<00:03:22.000> all<00:03:22.180> power

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
basically going we're doing it all power

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.530 
basically going we're doing it all power
cords

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.699 

now<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.560> slide<00:03:28.920> from<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.310> second<00:03:30.439> back<00:03:31.439> down

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
now that slide from the second back down

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.559 
now that slide from the second back down
to<00:03:32.219> up<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.670> third<00:03:32.819> down<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.299> second

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
to up to the third down to the second

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.089 
to up to the third down to the second
again<00:03:33.750> it's<00:03:34.049> quite<00:03:34.230> difficult<00:03:34.469> requires<00:03:34.980> a

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
again it's quite difficult requires a

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.709 
again it's quite difficult requires a
bit<00:03:35.219> of<00:03:35.250> strength<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.150> might<00:03:36.420> need<00:03:36.569> to

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:36.719 
bit of strength so you might need to

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.390 
bit of strength so you might need to
work<00:03:36.930> on<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.379> and<00:03:37.709> don't<00:03:37.920> worry<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:38.189> you<00:03:38.250> do

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
work on that and don't worry if you do

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.649 
work on that and don't worry if you do
because<00:03:38.579> many<00:03:38.760> people<00:03:38.849> get<00:03:39.180> stuck<00:03:39.390> on<00:03:39.510> that

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
because many people get stuck on that

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.110 
because many people get stuck on that
one<00:03:39.810> as<00:03:39.930> well<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:41.700> play<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:42.000> riff

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
one as well and to play the riff

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.839 
one as well and to play the riff
properly<00:03:42.560> let's<00:03:43.560> play<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.799> together<00:03:43.950> nice<00:03:44.579> and

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
properly let's play it together nice and

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.030 
properly let's play it together nice and
slowly<00:03:45.090> all<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.599> riff<00:03:46.439> so<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.799> should<00:03:46.950> have

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
slowly all the riff so you should have

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.770 
slowly all the riff so you should have
worked<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.430> two<00:03:47.549> sections<00:03:47.819> here's<00:03:48.480> how<00:03:48.659> it

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
worked on the two sections here's how it

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.030 
worked on the two sections here's how it
sounds<00:03:49.140> when<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.290> put<00:03:49.530> them<00:03:49.650> all<00:03:49.859> together

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
sounds when you put them all together

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.949 
sounds when you put them all together
I'll<00:03:50.400> play<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.609> slow<00:03:50.909> can<00:03:51.359> you<00:03:51.480> play<00:03:51.689> along
