might<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.319> lot<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.619> schools<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.009> athletes<00:01:38.550> I

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
might a lot of schools have athletes I

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.609 
might a lot of schools have athletes I
think<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.690> know<00:01:39.810> how<00:01:39.899> to<00:01:39.959> play<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.200> what's<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
think we know how to play for what's the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.410 
think we know how to play for what's the
difference<00:01:40.979> what<00:01:41.580> they<00:01:41.700> was<00:01:41.819> an<00:01:41.910> athlete<00:01:42.060> them

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
difference what they was an athlete them

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.070 
difference what they was an athlete them
you<00:01:42.539> got<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.140> got<00:01:43.200> these<00:01:43.380> combine

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
you got you got these combine

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.710 
you got you got these combine
to<00:01:44.290> run<00:01:44.470> fast<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.100> Jonah<00:01:45.850> jump<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:46.660> are

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
to run fast and Jonah jump I and are

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.870 
to run fast and Jonah jump I and are
freakishly<00:01:47.020> athletic<00:01:47.260> I<00:01:47.590> think<00:01:47.860> even<00:01:48.790> though

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
freakishly athletic I think even though

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.160 
freakishly athletic I think even though
we<00:01:49.030> may<00:01:49.150> not<00:01:49.180> be<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.480> most<00:01:49.510> athletic<00:01:50.080> players

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
we may not be the most athletic players

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.080 
we may not be the most athletic players
I<00:01:50.530> think<00:01:50.800> we<00:01:50.890> know<00:01:51.040> how<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.250> play<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.490> game<00:01:51.730> and

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
I think we know how to play the game and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.190 
I think we know how to play the game and
we<00:01:52.180> daughter<00:01:52.360> line<00:01:52.600> up<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:52.930> play<00:01:53.020> football

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
we daughter line up and play football

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.260 
we daughter line up and play football
because<00:01:53.530> honestly<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:54.310> can<00:01:54.730> run<00:01:54.910> all<00:01:54.940> summer

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
because honestly you can run all summer

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.640 
because honestly you can run all summer
and<00:01:55.420> you<00:01:55.600> can<00:01:55.720> lift<00:01:55.870> weights<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.290> be<00:01:56.380> strong

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
and you can lift weights and be strong

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.370 
and you can lift weights and be strong
but<00:01:56.980> when<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:57.970> comes<00:01:58.120> down<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:59.080> do<00:01:59.200> all

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
but when it comes down to it you do all

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.950 
but when it comes down to it you do all
that<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:01.060> apply<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.390> on<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.570> football<00:02:01.930> field

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
that to apply it on the football field

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.600 
that to apply it on the football field
and<00:02:02.320> that's<00:02:02.500> what<00:02:02.650> it's<00:02:02.740> about<00:02:02.830> they<00:02:03.430> could

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
and that's what it's about they could

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.250 
and that's what it's about they could
think<00:02:03.730> about<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.300> mean<00:02:04.480> and<00:02:04.900> there's<00:02:05.050> always

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
think about it I mean and there's always

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.810 
think about it I mean and there's always
exceptions<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.100> rules<00:02:06.310> but<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.610> think

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
exceptions to the rules but you think

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.000 
exceptions to the rules but you think
about<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.120> best<00:02:07.330> football<00:02:07.570> players<00:02:07.960> do<00:02:08.890> the

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
on some people in the past where I think

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.780 
on some people in the past where I think
that's<00:04:08.470> going<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:08.890> case<00:04:09.040> anymore<00:04:09.340> I

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
that's going to be the case anymore I

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.949 
that's going to be the case anymore I
don't<00:04:10.030> think<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.270> I<00:04:10.360> think<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:10.660> start<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.900> look

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
don't think so I think you start to look

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.390 
don't think so I think you start to look
at<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.110> National<00:04:11.500> landscape<00:04:11.680> but<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.190> think

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
at the National landscape but I think

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.770 
at the National landscape but I think
that<00:04:12.580> what<00:04:12.819> we<00:04:12.940> did<00:04:13.090> last<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.450> typically

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
that what we did last I typically

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.809 
that what we did last I typically
realized<00:04:14.170> we're<00:04:14.380> pretty<00:04:14.650> good<00:04:14.739> i<00:04:14.920> mean<00:04:15.130> we

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
realized we're pretty good i mean we

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.490 
realized we're pretty good i mean we
have<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:16.000> good<00:04:16.150> football<00:04:16.510> team<00:04:16.540> where<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:17.290> play

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
have a good football team where we play

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.319 
have a good football team where we play
well<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:17.859> if<00:04:17.980> we<00:04:18.070> do<00:04:18.160> not<00:04:18.280> do<00:04:18.669> i<00:04:18.880> don't<00:04:19.090> think

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
well and if we do not do i don't think

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.050 
well and if we do not do i don't think
that<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:20.590> know<00:04:20.739> coming<00:04:21.340> into<00:04:21.430> this<00:04:21.609> season<00:04:21.850> I

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
that you know coming into this season I

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.790 
that you know coming into this season I
think<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.450> we<00:04:22.540> are<00:04:22.690> pretty<00:04:22.990> well<00:04:23.230> respected

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
think that we are pretty well respected

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.730 
think that we are pretty well respected
in<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:24.660> think<00:04:25.660> people<00:04:25.810> do<00:04:26.110> know<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.530> know<00:04:26.650> what

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
in I think people do know you know what

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.650 
in I think people do know you know what
we're<00:04:26.890> capable<00:04:26.919> of<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:27.760> but<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.120> think<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.540> one

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
we're capable of so but I think the one

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.120 
we're capable of so but I think the one
thing<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:28.930> we<00:04:29.169> had<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.500> our<00:04:29.590> advantage<00:04:29.800> when

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
thing that we had to our advantage when

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.680 
thing that we had to our advantage when
I<00:04:30.190> take<00:04:30.370> last<00:04:30.550> year<00:04:30.760> was<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:30.940> best<00:04:30.970> example<00:04:31.600> we

capone after that we start of all we
start<00:04:57.910> practice<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.450> well<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:59.500> sounds<00:04:59.830> so

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
start practice and well and it sounds so

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.240 
start practice and well and it sounds so
cliched<00:05:00.430> but<00:05:00.960> we<00:05:01.960> really<00:05:02.620> took<00:05:02.740> advantage<00:05:02.890> of

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
cliched but we really took advantage of

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
game and that's what I think that's why

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.270 
game and that's what I think that's why
I<00:05:05.800> on<00:05:05.950> Saturday<00:05:06.340> we<00:05:06.460> come<00:05:06.640> out<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.789> little<00:05:06.910> fast
