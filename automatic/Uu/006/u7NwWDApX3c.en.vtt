00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
black ops 2 this glitch isn't out of map

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.180 
black ops 2 this glitch isn't out of map
that's<00:00:11.639> what's<00:00:11.820> classed<00:00:12.150> as<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.960> it's<00:00:13.259> still

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
that's what's classed as but it's still

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.860 
that's what's classed as but it's still
inside<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.639> mouth<00:00:14.940> if<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.240> make<00:00:15.420> sense<00:00:15.599> so

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
inside the mouth if that make sense so

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.870 
inside the mouth if that make sense so
it's<00:00:16.020> an<00:00:16.080> inside<00:00:16.440> outside<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:17.039> map<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.730> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it's an inside outside of map and as you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.240 
it's an inside outside of map and as you
see<00:00:18.060> I'm<00:00:18.359> actually<00:00:18.750> stood<00:00:19.199> here<00:00:19.410> killing<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
see I'm actually stood here killing the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.189 
see I'm actually stood here killing the
zombies<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:20.820> they<00:00:21.000> pile<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:21.750> next<00:00:21.930> to

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
zombies as they pile up right next to

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.950 
zombies as they pile up right next to
this<00:00:22.320> bit<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.859> there<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.369> also<00:00:23.490> two<00:00:24.210> spots<00:00:24.840> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
this bit and there is also two spots to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.960 
this bit and there is also two spots to
actually<00:00:25.380> get<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.949> zombies<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.580> pile<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.800 
first one is actually what you just saw
and<00:00:29.189> you're<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.910> back<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:30.570> as<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and you're going back to now as the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.229 
and you're going back to now as the
camera<00:00:31.260> path<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.859> pans<00:00:32.099> back<00:00:32.399> over<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
camera path like pans back over here and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.120 
camera path like pans back over here and
the<00:00:33.630> other<00:00:33.750> spot<00:00:34.020> you'll<00:00:34.170> see<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> minute<00:00:34.559> so

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
the other spot you'll see in a minute so

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.200 
the other spot you'll see in a minute so
anyway<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> walk<00:00:35.820> towards<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
anyway you want to walk towards the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.520 
anyway you want to walk towards the
warden's<00:00:36.630> office<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.170> you've<00:00:37.320> noticed

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
warden's office and if you've noticed

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.010 
warden's office and if you've noticed
you<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.219> jump<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.450> little<00:00:39.719> bit

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
you can actually jump up this little bit

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.020 
you can actually jump up this little bit
where<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> fence<00:00:40.559> ism<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
where the fence ism and it's not out the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
where the fence ism and it's not out the
map<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.690> jump<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> right<00:00:43.800> spot

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
map but if you jump up in the right spot

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.610 
map but if you jump up in the right spot
and<00:00:44.280> hold<00:00:44.489> forward<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:45.719> actually<00:00:45.899> get

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and hold forward you will actually get

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.040 
and hold forward you will actually get
pushed<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.190> through<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.969> actual<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.719> bit

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
pushed up through the actual like bit

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.080 
pushed up through the actual like bit
that's<00:00:49.230> there<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> little<00:00:49.920> more<00:00:50.850> bill

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that's there like the little more bill

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.209 
that's there like the little more bill
so<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> bed<00:00:52.260> tipped<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.800> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
so it's like a bed tipped up you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
so it's like a bed tipped up you
actually<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:53.640> pushed<00:00:53.910> through<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.719> if

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
actually get pushed through that and if

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.229 
actually get pushed through that and if
you<00:00:54.989> stand<00:00:55.260> close<00:00:56.010> enough<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.579> far<00:00:57.090> enough

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you stand close enough but far enough

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
you stand close enough but far enough
away<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.960> makes<00:00:58.170> sense<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.590> not<00:00:58.620> too

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
away if that makes sense or not too

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.950 
away if that makes sense or not too
close<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.160> not<00:00:59.460> too<00:00:59.520> far<00:00:59.850> away<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.600> zombies

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
close but not too far away the zombies

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.840 
close but not too far away the zombies
will<00:01:00.989> actually<00:01:01.440> pull<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.100> there<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
will actually pull up right there you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.080 
will actually pull up right there you
can<00:01:03.000> kill<00:01:03.239> them<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.539> collect<00:01:04.199> power-ups<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
can kill them all collect power-ups and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.789 
can kill them all collect power-ups and
it's<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.360> quite<00:01:06.930> good<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it's just quite good really and then the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.250 
it's just quite good really and then the
next<00:01:07.979> spot<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.909> will<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.570> later<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.049> in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
next spot you will see like later on in

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.660 
next spot you will see like later on in
the<00:01:10.350> video<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.860> gotta<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.490> drop

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

you're in that vet you can't actually
get<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.509> glitch<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.930> total<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.500> you
