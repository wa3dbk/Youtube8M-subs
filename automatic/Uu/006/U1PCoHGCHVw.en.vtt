00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.450 
today and we're going to accent
something<00:01:12.350> really<00:01:12.590> cool<00:01:12.770> off<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.220> low<00:01:13.340> B

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460

something really cool off the low B
Street

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.719 

now<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.840> technique<00:01:23.320> behind<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:24.189> I'm

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
now the technique behind that is I'm

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.090 
now the technique behind that is I'm
focusing<00:01:25.360> on<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.810> low<00:01:25.990> string<00:01:26.320> em<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.979> know

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
focusing on the low string em you know

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.190 
focusing on the low string em you know
and<00:01:27.310> it's<00:01:27.430> very<00:01:27.490> palm-muted<00:01:28.329> so<00:01:28.869> that<00:01:28.990> way<00:01:29.110> it

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
and it's very palm-muted so that way it

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.300 
and it's very palm-muted so that way it
stays<00:01:29.350> nice<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.770> tight<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.040> then<00:01:30.159> I'm<00:01:30.220> going

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
stays nice and tight and then I'm going

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.010 
stays nice and tight and then I'm going
to<00:01:30.369> accent<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.030> full<00:01:31.240> chord<00:01:31.540> when<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.840> comes

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
to accent the full chord when it comes

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.090 
to accent the full chord when it comes
around<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.530> makes<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.799> a<00:01:32.830> little<00:01:32.920> bit

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
around and it makes it a little bit

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.410 
around and it makes it a little bit
heavy

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.540 

now<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.780> timing<00:01:42.230> of<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:42.560> basically<00:01:43.340> I'm

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
now the timing of this basically I'm

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.830 
now the timing of this basically I'm
thinking<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:47.030> know<00:01:47.120> and<00:01:47.360> kind<00:01:47.660> of<00:01:47.690> that

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
thinking you know and kind of that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.180 
thinking you know and kind of that
accent<00:01:48.350> with<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:48.590> right<00:01:48.770> hand<00:01:49.010> would<00:01:49.160> be

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
accent with that right hand would be

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.980 
accent with that right hand would be
what<00:01:49.460> my<00:01:49.580> downstroke<00:01:50.000> would<00:01:50.120> be<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.780> always

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
what my downstroke would be that always

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.480 
what my downstroke would be that always
helps<00:01:51.290> me<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.530> think<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.800> tapping<00:01:52.190> on<00:01:52.220> my<00:01:52.340> leg

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
helps me to think of tapping on my leg

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.930 
helps me to think of tapping on my leg
or<00:01:52.640> any<00:01:52.820> sense<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.120> rhythm<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.420> respect

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
or any sense of rhythm in that respect

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.250 
or any sense of rhythm in that respect
because<00:01:55.940> ultimately<00:01:56.450> at<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.810> end<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.170> day

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
because ultimately at the end of the day

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.340 
because ultimately at the end of the day
this<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.590> gotta<00:01:57.830> be<00:01:58.010> fast<00:01:58.870> not<00:01:59.870> faster<00:02:00.260> not

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
this is gotta be fast not faster not

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.280 
this is gotta be fast not faster not
around

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.290 

and<00:02:05.380> then<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.590> talk<00:02:05.830> into<00:02:06.040> it

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.660 

imagine<00:02:09.229> if<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.380> had<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.530> sing<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.250> we're

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
imagine if you had to sing it but we're

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.500 
imagine if you had to sing it but we're
working<00:02:10.940> towards<00:02:11.360> something<00:02:11.570> here<00:02:11.810> so

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.930 

now<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> really<00:02:17.250> cool<00:02:17.400> way<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.610> form

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
now this is a really cool way to form

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.580 
now this is a really cool way to form
some<00:02:18.120> basic<00:02:18.390> power<00:02:18.569> chords<00:02:18.840> my<00:02:18.930> root<00:02:19.170> note<00:02:19.200> is

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
some basic power chords my root note is

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.100 
some basic power chords my root note is
on<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.040> fifth<00:02:20.250> string<00:02:20.780> let's<00:02:21.780> drop<00:02:22.049> down

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
on the fifth string let's drop down

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.259 
on the fifth string let's drop down
there

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.750 

Roland

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.680 

you're<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.849> difference<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.330> when<00:02:33.540> it's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
you're the difference there when it's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:45.380 
you're the difference there when it's
you<00:02:34.170> know<00:02:34.290> not<00:02:34.500> pom<00:02:34.800> muted<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.340> Tommy

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.940 

and<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.510> keeps<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.900> really<00:02:47.200> really<00:02:47.740> heavy

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
and that keeps it really really heavy

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.280 
and that keeps it really really heavy
when<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.220> do<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.850> let's<00:02:49.810> take<00:02:49.990> about

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
when you do that and let's take about

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.410 
when you do that and let's take about
how<00:02:50.500> we<00:02:50.560> could<00:02:50.830> take<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.070> into<00:02:51.940> something

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
how we could take that into something

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.740 
how we could take that into something
that<00:02:52.450> sounds<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.140> little<00:02:53.230> bit<00:02:53.380> more<00:02:53.560> like<00:02:57.750> so

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
that sounds a little bit more like so

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.110 
that sounds a little bit more like so
I'm<00:02:59.110> doing<00:02:59.800> all<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.310> now<00:03:00.490> on<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> higher

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
I'm doing all of that now on a higher

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.670 
I'm doing all of that now on a higher
octave<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.780> we're<00:03:01.930> going<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.080> continue<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.650> a

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
octave and we're going to continue on a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.560 
octave and we're going to continue on a
build<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.100> riff<00:03:03.250> here<00:03:03.460> so<00:03:04.000> I'm<00:03:04.270> just<00:03:04.390> going<00:03:04.510> to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
build a riff here so I'm just going to

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.850 
build a riff here so I'm just going to
turn<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.990> can<00:03:05.110> see<00:03:05.260> my<00:03:05.380> body<00:03:05.590> I'm

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
turn so you can see my body I'm

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.590 
turn so you can see my body I'm
executing<00:03:06.310> everything<00:03:06.730> exactly<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.390> same

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
executing everything exactly the same

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.720 
executing everything exactly the same
but<00:03:07.810> hardest<00:03:08.590> part<00:03:08.800> is<00:03:08.920> I'm<00:03:09.040> only<00:03:09.220> focusing<00:03:09.640> on

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
but hardest part is I'm only focusing on

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.760 
but hardest part is I'm only focusing on
those<00:03:09.970> two<00:03:10.180> dudes<00:03:10.390> you're<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.660> industry

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.070 

so<00:03:17.700> I'm<00:03:17.970> going<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.210> throw<00:03:18.420> some<00:03:18.690> notes<00:03:18.900> in

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
so I'm going to throw some notes in

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.210 
so I'm going to throw some notes in
there<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.380> I'm<00:03:19.440> going<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.590> basically<00:03:19.950> work

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
there and I'm going to basically work

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.220 
there and I'm going to basically work
down

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:35.839 

maybe<00:03:27.590> think<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:27.980> something<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:28.400> that

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.059 

and<00:03:36.659> maybe<00:03:36.810> no<00:03:37.019> particular<00:03:37.349> order<00:03:37.590> but

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
and maybe no particular order but

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:49.930 
and maybe no particular order but
obviously<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.609> chords<00:03:38.879> I'm<00:03:38.999> here

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.160 

you

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.380 

and<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:57.860> in<00:03:57.980> itself<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.460> really<00:03:58.520> tricky<00:03:59.090> when

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
and that in itself is really tricky when

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:08.610 
and that in itself is really tricky when
you<00:03:59.480> kick

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.839 

because<00:04:09.620> you're<00:04:09.769> really<00:04:10.010> focusing<00:04:10.579> on<00:04:10.670> that

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
because you're really focusing on that

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.280 
because you're really focusing on that
accent<00:04:11.180> it's<00:04:11.360> Trump<00:04:11.629> but<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.900> know<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.049> want

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
accent it's Trump but you know you want

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.240 
accent it's Trump but you know you want
to<00:04:12.319> break<00:04:12.500> it<00:04:12.620> up<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.829> you<00:04:12.890> want<00:04:13.069> to<00:04:13.129> throw

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
to break it up and you want to throw

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.500 
to break it up and you want to throw
some<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.549> those<00:04:13.609> hammered<00:04:14.000> notes<00:04:14.180> in<00:04:14.359> there

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
some of those hammered notes in there

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.960 
some of those hammered notes in there
now<00:04:14.959> this<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.500> in<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.890> key<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.220> E<00:04:16.430> minor<00:04:16.639> and

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
now this is in the key of E minor and

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.430 
now this is in the key of E minor and
you<00:04:17.359> know<00:04:17.449> we've<00:04:17.600> got<00:04:17.630> some<00:04:17.810> scale<00:04:18.199> shapes

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
you know we've got some scale shapes

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.129 
you know we've got some scale shapes
that<00:04:18.560> we're<00:04:18.709> outlining<00:04:22.750> we're<00:04:23.750> all<00:04:23.900> going<00:04:24.080> to

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
that we're outlining we're all going to

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.779 
that we're outlining we're all going to
work<00:04:24.320> when<00:04:24.560> we<00:04:24.680> resolve<00:04:25.009> to<00:04:25.100> that<00:04:25.310> basic<00:04:25.639> a

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
work when we resolve to that basic a

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.240 
work when we resolve to that basic a
power<00:04:26.030> chord<00:04:26.330> there<00:04:26.509> so<00:04:26.690> in<00:04:27.590> context<00:04:28.160> here

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
power chord there so in context here

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.080 
power chord there so in context here
we've<00:04:28.370> taken<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.850> heavier<00:04:30.940> range<00:04:31.940> in

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
we've taken this heavier range in

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.610 
we've taken this heavier range in
practice<00:04:32.509> right<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.050> want<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.320> put<00:04:33.470> this

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
practice right and we want to put this

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.650 
practice right and we want to put this
on<00:04:33.800> power<00:04:34.610> chords<00:04:34.910> on<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.090> fifth<00:04:35.300> string<00:04:35.389> and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
on power chords on the fifth string and

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.939 
on power chords on the fifth string and
work<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.960> in<00:04:36.050> with<00:04:36.139> some<00:04:36.320> different<00:04:36.620> notes<00:04:36.770> and

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
work it in with some different notes and

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.560 
work it in with some different notes and
be<00:04:37.039> inspired<00:04:37.400> by<00:04:37.699> the<00:04:37.759> riff<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.180> way<00:04:38.360> and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
be inspired by the riff that way and

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.600 
be inspired by the riff that way and
that's<00:04:39.080> a<00:04:39.229> cool<00:04:39.440> way<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.710> practice<00:04:40.220> sometimes

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
that's a cool way to practice sometimes

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.790 
that's a cool way to practice sometimes
it's<00:04:40.820> not<00:04:40.970> learning<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:42.020> material<00:04:42.500> but<00:04:42.650> how

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
it's not learning the material but how

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.290 
it's not learning the material but how
to<00:04:42.860> practice<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.310> material<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.940> how<00:04:44.240> to

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
to practice the material and how to

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.150 
to practice the material and how to
practice<00:04:44.539> it<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:44.900> far<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.320> focusing<00:04:46.009> on<00:04:46.039> the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
practice it so far is focusing on the

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.360 
practice it so far is focusing on the
low<00:04:46.310> strings<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:51.380> building<00:04:51.770> up<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:51.889> stamina

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
low strings and building up the stamina

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.830 
low strings and building up the stamina
and<00:04:52.520> then<00:04:52.729> now<00:04:52.910> we're<00:04:53.090> taking<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.419> same<00:04:53.570> chord

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
and then now we're taking the same chord

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.999 
and then now we're taking the same chord
focusing<00:04:54.229> on<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.380> high<00:04:54.500> string<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:54.979> let's

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
focusing on the high string so let's

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:03.330 
focusing on the high string so let's
keep<00:04:55.340> it<00:04:55.520> you<00:04:55.639> know<00:04:55.759> keep<00:04:56.030> school

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.860 

you<00:05:03.670> know<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:03.970> that's<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.270> great<00:05:04.600> way<00:05:04.660> to

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
you know and that's a great way to

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.050 
you know and that's a great way to
practice<00:05:05.440> your<00:05:05.470> doing<00:05:06.400> different<00:05:06.790> muscles

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
practice your doing different muscles

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.670 
practice your doing different muscles
with<00:05:07.180> your<00:05:07.300> right<00:05:07.450> hand<00:05:07.630> standing<00:05:08.470> up<00:05:08.590> and

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
with your right hand standing up and
