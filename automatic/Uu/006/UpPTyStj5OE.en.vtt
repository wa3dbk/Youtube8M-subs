00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
here we get we get some aletto see I

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.920 
here we get we get some aletto see I
think<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.439> time<00:02:14.620> just

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
think it's time just

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.199 
think it's time just
using<00:02:15.230> coins<00:02:15.500> when<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.769> open<00:02:16.640> packs<00:02:16.879> I<00:02:17.030> think

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
using coins when I open packs I think

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.000 
using coins when I open packs I think
it's<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.510> lot<00:02:17.659> better<00:02:17.780> cuz<00:02:18.079> coins<00:02:18.379> are<00:02:18.500> cheaper

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
it's a lot better cuz coins are cheaper

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.819 
it's a lot better cuz coins are cheaper
but<00:02:20.709> yeah<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:22.040> general<00:02:23.000> I've<00:02:23.150> w<00:02:23.599> know<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.959> used

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
but yeah and general I've w know I used

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.470 
but yeah and general I've w know I used
to<00:02:24.920> be<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.189> excited<00:02:25.549> about<00:02:25.640> opening<00:02:25.700> packs<00:02:26.180> but

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
to be so excited about opening packs but

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.599 
to be so excited about opening packs but
I've<00:02:27.019> just<00:02:27.230> lost<00:02:27.409> that<00:02:27.650> thrill<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.370> not

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
I've just lost that thrill it's not

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.429 
I've just lost that thrill it's not
because<00:02:28.939> I've<00:02:29.060> opened<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:29.599> many<00:02:29.629> packs<00:02:30.019> at<00:02:30.260> all

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
because I've opened so many packs at all

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.569 
because I've opened so many packs at all
it's<00:02:30.680> just<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:31.359> don't<00:02:32.359> know<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:33.340> nothing<00:02:34.340> to

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
it's just I don't know it's nothing to

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.250 
it's just I don't know it's nothing to
do<00:02:34.700> with<00:02:34.819> me<00:02:34.939> being<00:02:34.969> bored<00:02:35.329> of<00:02:35.599> I<00:02:35.810> think<00:02:36.139> since

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
do with me being bored of I think since

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.470 
do with me being bored of I think since
I<00:02:36.439> started<00:02:36.739> buying<00:02:36.980> coins<00:02:37.310> now<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.909> think

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
I started buying coins now I think

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.149 
I started buying coins now I think
that's<00:02:38.569> totally<00:02:38.959> changing<00:02:39.379> my<00:02:39.439> whole<00:02:39.590> idea<00:02:39.889> on

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
that's totally changing my whole idea on

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.949 
that's totally changing my whole idea on
getting<00:02:40.459> fifa<00:02:40.760> because<00:02:41.389> suppose<00:02:41.689> you<00:02:41.810> get

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
getting fifa because suppose you get

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.110 
getting fifa because suppose you get
banned<00:02:42.170> for<00:02:42.590> having<00:02:43.519> too<00:02:43.609> many<00:02:43.700> coins<00:02:43.969> that
