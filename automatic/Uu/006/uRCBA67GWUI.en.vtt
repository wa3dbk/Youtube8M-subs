00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:10.130
 Miyamoto is of Hello Genjiyama low Director 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:12.470
 This time I have two of my working illustrators behind me to use them 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.260
 I bought an item 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.100
 Bavern 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.660
 Air Mac Time Capsule 3 terabytes 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.660
 I want to open it immediately 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:35.400
 Here is the body and there power cable 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.400
 Contains the configuration guide you peel off the seal is are stuck 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.650
 It is beautiful 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.640
 It is stuck also there 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:48.570
 This weight is 1.48kg and it is not so heavy 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.300
 There are apple marks on the top and apple marks on the bottom 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.230
 There is a place to discharge air here 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.440
 Here's the status light and back 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.579
 Three Gigabit Ethernet lans 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:09.369
 usb 2.0 port is one one gigabit ethernet 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.560
 waan port There is a place to plug in the power cable to the lower one and the most 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.000
 so 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:19.250
 It is about this time capsule beamforming function 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.090
 If you judge that there are iphones and Macs around here , I will concentrate on sending radio waves there 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.909
 Will give 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:29.580
 It was for us skip the more clearly strong radio waves by virtue of this beam-forming function 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.910
 This is a hard disk built- in wi-fi router 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.780
 It can be much less also be used as storage 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:42.780
 If you are a Mac user, use the time machine to back up 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:47.250
 With network hard disk function, you can share data with multiple PCs 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.570
 There are 3 anths like 2.4 ghz in this 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.930
 5 ghz like 3 bottles 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.740
 A total of six antennas are mounted at the top 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:01.540
 The speed is up to 1.3 gbps 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.970
 From now on mac pro and imac which use this time machine in the week 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.410
 I'm thinking of connecting and using 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.369
 This is safe because the data of the two illustrators has not been backed up yet 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.560
 is 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.080
 so 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.080
 Thank you very much and look forward to next time 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.670
