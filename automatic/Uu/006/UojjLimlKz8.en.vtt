sometimes<00:00:36.860> disabling<00:00:37.860> UAC<00:00:38.489> fixes<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
sometimes disabling UAC fixes it for the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.450 
sometimes disabling UAC fixes it for the
standard<00:00:40.379> user<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:40.980> should<00:00:41.219> hopefully

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
standard user but this should hopefully

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.490 
standard user but this should hopefully
take<00:00:41.850> care<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.329> without<00:00:43.079> having<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
take care of it without having to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.220 
take care of it without having to
disable<00:00:44.040> UAC<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.629> first<00:00:45.840> thing<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.050> want

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
disable UAC so the first thing you want

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.020 
disable UAC so the first thing you want
to<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.649> make<00:00:47.070> sure<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.700> Flash

so we'll go through and agree one main
thing<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.580> need<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.909> remember<00:01:12.380> where

thing here is we need to remember where
we<00:01:13.560> installed<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.549> I'm<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
we installed it so I'm just going to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.370

probably<00:01:54.479> also<00:01:54.960> update<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.759> our

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
probably also update one of our

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.609 
probably also update one of our
knowledgebase<00:01:57.270> articles<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.380> find

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
knowledgebase articles so you can find

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.520 
knowledgebase articles so you can find
it<00:01:58.770> there<00:01:58.799> too<00:01:59.720> eventually<00:02:00.720> what<00:02:01.289> we'd<00:02:01.440> like

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it there too eventually what we'd like

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.740 
it there too eventually what we'd like
to<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.009> fix<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.490> Installer<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.390> we'll

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
to do is fix the Installer and we'll

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.510 
to do is fix the Installer and we'll
work<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.110> doing<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.710> soon<00:02:04.830> as<00:02:04.950> possible

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
work on doing that as soon as possible

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.820 
work on doing that as soon as possible
and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.840> won't<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.590> stuff

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
and then you won't have to do this stuff

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.160 
and then you won't have to do this stuff
at<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.100> but<00:02:08.399> until<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.600> batch<00:02:09.899> file

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
