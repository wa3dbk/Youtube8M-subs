00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.049
 honorable councilors dear friends 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.889
 It is an honor to witness the great 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:17.440
 commitment manifested in this 67th 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:21.970
 ordinary national council for each 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:25.119
 of you live two intense days of 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.950
 extraordinary union work whose 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.310
 goal has been met 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.930
 integrate the request list issued by 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.870
 the demands of our colleagues 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.620
 workers 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.960
 The request document will serve as a guide and 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.440
 back 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 for negotiating improvements to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.570
 our collective bargaining agreement the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.829
 voice of the working base once more 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.899
 has been heard 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:02.350
 The challenges we face are enormous 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 and the revision of the labor pact will be in 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.480
 a certainly complex environment 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.910
 in political matters in economic matters 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.900
 and union which demands to give the best 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:21.070
 from each one of us 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.070
 this reality demands of those who integrate 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.910
 this great organization encourage the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.260
 unity and we always support so that 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.780
 we can get more and negotiate the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.470
 media 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.170
 that popular adage that points out that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.850
 union makes the force is more valid 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:49.640
 that never and today I allow myself to reinforce it 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:53.680
 telling them that the unit does not talk 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.680
 is practiced sr 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.600
 it did not happen 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.100
 This is dear fellow union 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.190
 national insurance workers 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.150
 Social commitment to an open dialogue 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.600
 Constructive and height transparent 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.910
 with the institutional authorities is 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.580
 evident that the times of 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.240
 confrontation as the only way to 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.170
 clarify differences left behind 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.960
 We will encourage speech 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.410
 understanding and negotiation before 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.670
 to reach the force we will be firm in 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.860
 what is not negotiable and we will know 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.250
 strengthen the institute at all times 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.290

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.349

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.350

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.350

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.120
 for the aforementioned 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.030

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.240
