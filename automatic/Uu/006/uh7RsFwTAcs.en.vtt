00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
okay so here is the main auxiliary unit

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.829 
okay so here is the main auxiliary unit
kind<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.970> just<00:00:06.150> tucked<00:00:06.450> underneath<00:00:06.690> the

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
kind of just tucked underneath the

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.950 
kind of just tucked underneath the
fender<00:00:07.230> here<00:00:13.219> so<00:00:14.219> it's<00:00:14.400> hard<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.730> see<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.299> part

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
fender here so it's hard to see but part

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.950 
fender here so it's hard to see but part
of<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> pump<00:00:16.379> right<00:00:16.680> there<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.250> where<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
of the pump right there is where the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.160 
of the pump right there is where the
coolant<00:00:18.960> lines<00:00:19.730> come<00:00:20.730> from<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.840> actually

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
coolant lines come from it's actually

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.650 
coolant lines come from it's actually
the<00:00:22.350> portion<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> gas<00:00:23.730> right<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.790 

air<00:00:27.660> intake<00:00:28.460> exhaust<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.289> go<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.710> take

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
air intake exhaust so if we go and take

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.569 
air intake exhaust so if we go and take
a<00:00:31.949> look<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> top<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:34.219> you<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.460> I've

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
a look at the top here you can see I've

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.750 
a look at the top here you can see I've
got<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> couple<00:00:36.360> new<00:00:36.660> lines<00:00:36.960> installed<00:00:37.760> right

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
got a couple new lines installed right

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.330 
got a couple new lines installed right
so<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.210> actually<00:00:39.420> come<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.350> from<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
so they actually come up from the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
so they actually come up from the
axillary<00:00:41.820> unit<00:00:42.270> down<00:00:44.570> across<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:47.070> they

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
axillary unit down across and then they

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.619 
axillary unit down across and then they
actually<00:00:49.340> kind<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:51.739> sneak<00:00:52.739> into<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.850> new<00:00:54.239> spot

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
actually kind of sneak into a new spot

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.299 
actually kind of sneak into a new spot
there<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.140> would<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.829> had<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> blank

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
there that would have just had a blank

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.590 
there that would have just had a blank
drawing<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:57.000> before

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
drawing it there before

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.569 
drawing it there before
maybe<00:00:58.350> check<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.859> car<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.160> might<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.489> able

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
maybe check your car you might be able

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.069 
maybe check your car you might be able
to<00:00:59.789> see<00:01:00.239> where<00:01:00.480> they're<00:01:00.600> supposed<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> come

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
to see where they're supposed to come

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.369 
to see where they're supposed to come
through<00:01:01.699> here<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:03.719> bit<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> our<00:01:04.080> work

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
through here is a little bit of our work

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.859 
through here is a little bit of our work
here

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
here

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
here
that's<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.340> pump<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.880> little<00:01:12.390> bit

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that's the pump and it's a little bit

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.580 
that's the pump and it's a little bit
dark<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:16.229> whole

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
dark to see here but there is a whole

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.999 
dark to see here but there is a whole
bunch<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.369> new<00:01:17.520> lines<00:01:18.680> kind<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.799> tucked

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
bunch of new lines kind of tucked

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.719 
bunch of new lines kind of tucked
underneath<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.860> two<00:01:23.220> new<00:01:23.430> lines

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
underneath here so we have two new lines

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.550 
underneath here so we have two new lines
going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> heater<00:01:25.110> core<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:27.409> then<00:01:28.409> we

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
going to the heater core and then we

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.760 
going to the heater core and then we
have<00:01:28.740> two<00:01:29.640> new<00:01:29.820> lines<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:31.409> come

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
have two new lines that actually come

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.030 
have two new lines that actually come
out<00:01:31.890> from<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> firewall<00:01:33.650> let<00:01:34.650> me<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.860> come

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
out from the firewall let me just come

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.350 
out from the firewall let me just come
round<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.460> side<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.240> give

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
round with this side see if I can give

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.319 
round with this side see if I can give
you<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> better<00:01:36.750> shot<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:37.820> if<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.939> look<00:01:39.150> on

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you a better shot now if you look on

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.410 
you a better shot now if you look on
your<00:01:39.659> cars<00:01:40.079> you'll<00:01:40.740> probably<00:01:41.009> notice<00:01:41.420> that

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
your cars you'll probably notice that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.420 
your cars you'll probably notice that
there's<00:01:42.659> something<00:01:43.439> missing<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.070> there's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
there's something missing here there's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.230 
there's something missing here there's
actually<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:45.540> valve<00:01:46.430> that's<00:01:47.430> used<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> control

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
actually a valve that's used to control

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.620 
actually a valve that's used to control
the<00:01:48.390> flow<00:01:49.700> from<00:01:50.700> factory<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.450> now

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the flow from factory and that's now

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.639 
the flow from factory and that's now
gone<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.820> one<00:01:54.000> hose<00:01:54.360> left<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.350> remove

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
gone I just have one hose left to remove

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.520 
gone I just have one hose left to remove
which<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:57.259> right<00:01:58.259> this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
which is this one here right this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.249 
which is this one here right this
controlled<00:01:59.460> electronic<00:02:00.210> valve<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.780> mounted

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
controlled electronic valve that mounted

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.819 
controlled electronic valve that mounted
just<00:02:02.250> down<00:02:02.520> below<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.229> opened<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
just down below and then that opened and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.150 
just down below and then that opened and
closed<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.460> flow<00:02:06.090> valve<00:02:06.770> one<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.950> lines

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
closed the flow valve one of the lines

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.710 
closed the flow valve one of the lines
going<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.849> heater<00:02:09.060> core<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.599> other

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
going up to the heater core the other

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.460 
going up to the heater core the other
one<00:02:09.899> coming

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
one coming

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.050 
one coming
the<00:02:10.530> engine<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.220> kind<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.700> basically

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the engine so that is kind of basically

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.790 
the engine so that is kind of basically
the<00:02:15.210> how<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.510> cooling<00:02:15.960> system<00:02:16.350> runs<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.680> it

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
the how the cooling system runs on it

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.170 
the how the cooling system runs on it
now<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.610> may<00:02:18.570> not<00:02:18.920> seem<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.160> much<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.700> to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
now it may not seem like much just to

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.680 
now it may not seem like much just to
kind<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.510> quickly<00:02:21.750> look<00:02:22.050> at<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:23.450> trust<00:02:24.450> me

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
kind of quickly look at it but trust me

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.950 
kind of quickly look at it but trust me
it<00:02:24.840> was<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> fair<00:02:25.980> amount<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.340> adventure<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.930> try

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
it was a fair amount of adventure to try

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.750 
it was a fair amount of adventure to try
and<00:02:28.590> get<00:02:28.680> these<00:02:28.800> new<00:02:29.010> hoses<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.640> stuff

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
and get these new hoses and stuff

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.090 
and get these new hoses and stuff
installed<00:02:30.500> especially<00:02:31.500> since<00:02:31.740> they<00:02:31.920> don't

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
installed especially since they don't

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.640 
installed especially since they don't
actually<00:02:32.400> come<00:02:32.880> with<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.750> know<00:02:33.870> instructions

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
actually come with you know instructions

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
for the first time so a little bit of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.180 
for the first time so a little bit of
work<00:02:39.990> left<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.380> do

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
work left to do

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.490 
work left to do
just<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.820> kind<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.180> tie<00:02:42.390> up<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.750> loose<00:02:42.810> ends<00:02:43.350> on

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
just a kind of tie up that loose ends on

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.030 
just a kind of tie up that loose ends on
here<00:02:44.100> there's<00:02:44.730> actually<00:02:45.450> also<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.140> an

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
here there's actually also a an

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.150 
here there's actually also a an
electronic<00:02:47.670> plug<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:49.350> would<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.740> gone<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
electronic plug that would have gone to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.090 
electronic plug that would have gone to
the<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.330> valve<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:51.870> well<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.890> kind

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
the to the valve as well it's just kind

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.550 
the to the valve as well it's just kind
of<00:02:53.190> dropped<00:02:53.430> down<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.840> can't<00:02:55.200> really<00:02:55.350> show

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
of dropped down so I can't really show

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.640 
of dropped down so I can't really show
it<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.880> plan<00:02:57.150> will<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.690> order

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
it to you but the plan will be to order

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.550 
it to you but the plan will be to order
a<00:02:58.830> blank<00:02:59.190> plug<00:02:59.520> from<00:02:59.700> Howdy<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.900> put<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.350> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
a blank plug from Howdy just put to the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.930 
a blank plug from Howdy just put to the
rubber<00:03:01.740> stoppers<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.490> end<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.850> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
rubber stoppers in the end of it and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.280 
rubber stoppers in the end of it and
then<00:03:03.030> plug<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:04.080> not

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
then plug it in so that it's not

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.970 
then plug it in so that it's not
actually<00:03:06.860> exposed<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.130> elements<00:03:08.250> anymore
