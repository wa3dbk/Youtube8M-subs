00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you prefer or just regular salt I don't

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.300 
you prefer or just regular salt I don't

have any kosher salt here with me right

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.880 
have any kosher salt here with me right
now<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.909> works<00:01:48.500> just<00:01:49.500> about<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> teaspoon

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
now so this works just about a teaspoon

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.560 
now so this works just about a teaspoon
and<00:01:50.720> then<00:01:51.720> some<00:01:51.869> fresh<00:01:51.990> cracked<00:01:52.320> pepper<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
and then some fresh cracked pepper I

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.910 
and then some fresh cracked pepper I
like<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> lot<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> cracked<00:01:55.020> pepper<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.530> on

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
like a lot of cracked pepper or so on

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.050 
like a lot of cracked pepper or so on
and<00:01:56.070> i'll<00:01:56.130> probably<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.460> tables<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.969> new

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and i'll probably go tables for the new

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.700 
and i'll probably go tables for the new
year<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.390> we're<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.290> mix<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.469> back

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
year or so we're going to mix this back

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350 
year or so we're going to mix this back
up<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.189> go<00:01:59.219> back<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.090> make<00:02:00.210> up

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.139 
up and we go back out there and make up
the<00:02:00.450> patties<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:02.520> meat<00:02:02.670> will<00:02:02.790> hold<00:02:02.939> its<00:02:03.090> shape

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the patties the meat will hold its shape

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.149
