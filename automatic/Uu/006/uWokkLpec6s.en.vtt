00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.550
 whats new 4 daisies on sample race 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.490
 2013 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:15.269
 considering the wishes of our customers 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:18.690
 it means we changed the crane place plastic 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.779
 made from food inanimate systole he 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.859
 more reliable since plastic 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 taps 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.039
 firstly deform composing in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.840
 second ultraviolet rays always 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.790
 when plastic is destroyed in the second 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.760
 made more powerful and reliable legs 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:47.250
 honey extractors now they are from the profile overlap 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.370
 so she became very tough and third 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.559
 we have done now on her and the covers 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.949
 i.e. here open close here 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.010
 so i love 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.989
 and in what configurations is 4 frame 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.600
 us 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:12.119
 4 frame honey extractor drive with 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.119
 electrically driven at 12 volts a 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.009
 also bitch don't care 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.110
 soloists driven by 220 volts 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.790
 which you can see for an hour 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.689
 installation all honey extractor with 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:31.159
 electric drives are not necessarily handbrake 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.040
 driven in case of all sorts 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.979
 abnormal situations such as the absence 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.229
 the stresses of the forces of atoms walk 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.780
 because every minute of the tile yes we all 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.700
 we know that 6 and 8 frame mida noggano 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.939
 Romanov's self revolving cassette 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.329
 and what is the mechanism of revolutions of 4 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.329
 framework 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.560
 Sorry because of the small diameter 4 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.110
 frame honey extractors automatically 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.150
 unfold it is impossible here 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.940
 so cancer unscrewing pumped one 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.250
 side we need each frame 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.310
 deploy for this we and pushes back 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.760
 side a couple dude well my among again 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.580
 offer grids and so happens with 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.270
 each 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:28.740
 cassette and so easy just very fast 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:32.330
 what about after that 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.330
 and including 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.579
 here time ends sounds strong and 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.579
 one side ad. 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:22.519
 after that the bieber sang and wrap 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:25.909
 that 's how we knit what's the advantage 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:30.170
 your mina novak main advantage 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:35.170
 the fact that our mida is like honey 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:38.590
 pump out much faster and why 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.200
 honey extractor is arranged in such a way that 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.590
 honeycomb falls squarely on the set from 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.650
 it is not possible to pass through 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.470
 As a result, we can pump out at full 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.920
 revs immediately dry one side and 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.220
 then 2 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.209
 the second advantage is that all 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.239
 kind of vodka 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.780
 usually have a bonus one in order 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.510
 that it was based was selected 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.129
 let the trouble of vodka if you do flat 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:17.750
 she will sag in our case 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:22.550
 made honey extractor equal so the axis 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.419
 relies on the truth about her at the bottom of communication with 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.720
 this we have the opportunity to do but 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.030
 flat because of this we have increased 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.039
 honey pocket up to 40 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.039
 by 4 to 40 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:44.420
 kilogram but it became obvious and many 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:50.000
 make now we no secret of galvanizing 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:54.860
 we have food stainless steel 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.490
 noisy sweet we have stainless steel faucet 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.500
 latch unlike balls through 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:05.120
 which follows very badly 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:11.390
 we have legs made tall so you can 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:13.220
 was put your cubo 30 thanks 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.710
 big for a full comprehensive answer 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.870
 Now I understand why 4-frame 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.800
 annual to granovsky enjoy great 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.360
 manâ€™s demand please 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.360
 ask more questions
