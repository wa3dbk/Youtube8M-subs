p.m.<00:03:08.750> around<00:03:09.140> but<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.440> think<00:03:09.739> if<00:03:10.190> you've<00:03:10.400> got

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
p.m. around but I think if you've got

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.490 
p.m. around but I think if you've got
two<00:03:10.880> three<00:03:11.150> kids<00:03:11.420> like<00:03:11.600> that's<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:12.050> really<00:03:12.350> good

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
two three kids like that's a really good

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.380 
two three kids like that's a really good
way<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.800> take<00:03:13.040> advantage<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.760> some<00:03:13.970> savings

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
way to take advantage of some savings

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.390 
way to take advantage of some savings
too<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.560> something<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.250> can

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
too so that's something that you can

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.170 
too so that's something that you can
look<00:03:16.550> into

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
look into

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.500
