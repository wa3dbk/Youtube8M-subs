we're here at the garage mahal at the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.170 
we're here at the garage mahal at the
farm<00:00:21.800> in<00:00:22.040> summer<00:00:22.310> town<00:00:22.610> and<00:00:22.910> we're<00:00:23.029> going<00:00:23.150> to

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
farm in summer town and we're going to

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.410 
farm in summer town and we're going to
be<00:00:23.330> converting<00:00:23.869> this<00:00:24.340> Mercedes<00:00:25.340> to<00:00:25.790> we're

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
be converting this Mercedes to we're

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.240 
be converting this Mercedes to we're
actually<00:00:26.570> adding<00:00:26.960> a<00:00:27.200> separate<00:00:27.590> fuel<00:00:27.740> system

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
actually adding a separate fuel system

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.210 
actually adding a separate fuel system
so<00:00:28.940> that<00:00:28.970> it<00:00:29.119> can<00:00:29.360> run<00:00:29.600> on<00:00:29.660> pure<00:00:30.440> vegetable<00:00:30.740> oil

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
so that it can run on pure vegetable oil

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.799 
so that it can run on pure vegetable oil
Jason's<00:00:31.789> going<00:00:31.940> to<00:00:32.029> be<00:00:32.090> showing<00:00:32.239> us<00:00:32.480> how<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.629> do

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
Jason's going to be showing us how to do

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.510 
Jason's going to be showing us how to do
that<00:00:32.930> just<00:00:33.199> a<00:00:33.320> few<00:00:33.350> minutes<00:00:33.650> so<00:00:34.550> we'll<00:00:34.730> be<00:00:34.879> back

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
that just a few minutes so we'll be back

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.310 
that just a few minutes so we'll be back
so<00:00:37.520> what<00:00:37.790> we<00:00:37.879> have<00:00:38.030> here<00:00:38.300> is<00:00:38.330> everything<00:00:39.199> we

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
so what we have here is everything we

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.500 
so what we have here is everything we
need<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.739> convert<00:00:40.460> this<00:00:40.610> mercedes-benz<00:00:41.150> to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
need to convert this mercedes-benz to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.619 
need to convert this mercedes-benz to
run<00:00:41.660> a<00:00:41.690> vegetable<00:00:42.170> oil<00:00:42.370> in<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.000> design<00:00:44.360> that

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
run a vegetable oil in the design that

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.850 
run a vegetable oil in the design that
that<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.220> have<00:00:46.220> come<00:00:46.400> up<00:00:46.550> with<00:00:46.580> for<00:00:47.120> doing<00:00:47.330> it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
that I have come up with for doing it

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.890 
that I have come up with for doing it
we've<00:00:48.860> got<00:00:49.040> an<00:00:49.190> in-tank<00:00:49.460> fuel<00:00:49.489> warmer<00:00:50.210> which

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
we've got an in-tank fuel warmer which

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.090 
we've got an in-tank fuel warmer which
is<00:00:51.940> there<00:00:52.940> too<00:00:53.180> is<00:00:53.479> to<00:00:53.809> start<00:00:54.530> warming<00:00:54.710> up<00:00:54.949> the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
is there too is to start warming up the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.530 
is there too is to start warming up the
fuel<00:00:55.309> as<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:55.580> comes<00:00:55.760> out<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.059> tank<00:00:56.269> to<00:00:56.390> make

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
fuel as it comes out of the tank to make

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.689 
fuel as it comes out of the tank to make
sure<00:00:56.720> that<00:00:56.900> it's<00:00:57.019> not<00:00:57.470> too<00:00:57.680> cold<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.400> even<00:00:58.610> be

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
sure that it's not too cold to even be

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.079 
sure that it's not too cold to even be
pumped<00:00:59.089> and<00:00:59.839> then<00:01:00.670> then<00:01:01.670> there's<00:01:01.909> the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
pumped and then then there's the

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.770 
pumped and then then there's the
vegetable<00:01:02.510> oil<00:01:02.690> filter<00:01:03.699> this<00:01:04.699> this<00:01:05.510> will<00:01:05.659> take

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
vegetable oil filter this this will take

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.740 
vegetable oil filter this this will take
care<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.200> any<00:01:06.650> sediment<00:01:07.159> or<00:01:07.460> other<00:01:07.640> junk<00:01:08.630> that

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
care of any sediment or other junk that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.210 
care of any sediment or other junk that
gets<00:01:08.960> in<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.140> tank<00:01:09.380> after<00:01:10.450> we<00:01:11.450> pre<00:01:11.659> filter<00:01:12.220> and

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
gets in the tank after we pre filter and

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.040 
gets in the tank after we pre filter and
this<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:14.240> very<00:01:14.390> important<00:01:14.720> because<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.990> is

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
this is very important because it is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.140 
this is very important because it is
also<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.350> water<00:01:15.680> separator<00:01:16.220> that's<00:01:16.700> that's

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
also a water separator that's that's

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150 
also a water separator that's that's
very<00:01:17.240> important<00:01:17.810> because<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:18.830> want<00:01:18.920> any

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
very important because you want any

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.630 
very important because you want any
water

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
water

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.850 
water
and<00:01:21.510> then<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:22.080> heat<00:01:22.229> exchanger<00:01:22.380> here

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and then we have the heat exchanger here

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.920 
and then we have the heat exchanger here
is<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> flat<00:01:23.340> plate<00:01:23.610> braised<00:01:24.180> heat<00:01:24.420> exchanger

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
is the flat plate braised heat exchanger

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.969 
is the flat plate braised heat exchanger
that's<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.030> hot<00:01:27.210> coolant

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
that's going to take the the hot coolant

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
that's going to take the the hot coolant
kind<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> funny<00:01:29.220> say<00:01:29.400> hot<00:01:29.580> coolant<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
kind of funny say hot coolant but the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.420 
kind of funny say hot coolant but the
engine<00:01:31.710> coolant<00:01:32.010> is<00:01:32.070> going<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.250> run<00:01:32.400> through

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
engine coolant is going to run through

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.040 
engine coolant is going to run through
two<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.940> these<00:01:33.090> pipes<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> fuel<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.900> going

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
two of these pipes in the fuel is going

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.290 
two of these pipes in the fuel is going
to<00:01:34.110> run<00:01:34.229> through<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.500> other<00:01:34.650> tube<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.300> and

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
to run through the other tube and and

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.730 
to run through the other tube and and
then<00:01:36.479> transfer<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:36.930> heat<00:01:37.080> into<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.440> fuel

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
then transfer that heat into the fuel

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.749 
then transfer that heat into the fuel
this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> where<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> main<00:01:39.650> heat<00:01:40.759> transfer

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
this is where the main heat transfer

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.499 
this is where the main heat transfer
takes<00:01:41.790> place<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> whole<00:01:42.750> system<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.610> we

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
takes place for the whole system and we

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.510 
takes place for the whole system and we
also<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.990> coil<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.680> copper<00:01:46.710> pipe<00:01:47.220> here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
also have this coil of copper pipe here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.109 
also have this coil of copper pipe here
10<00:01:48.210> feet<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:49.070> three-eighths<00:01:50.070> coil<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:51.000> going

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
10 feet of three-eighths coil it's going

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.850 
10 feet of three-eighths coil it's going
to<00:01:51.180> wrap<00:01:51.360> around<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:51.840> filter<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to wrap around this filter will get to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.590 
to wrap around this filter will get to
see<00:01:53.009> how<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> works<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.420> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
see how that works and that this is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600 
see how that works and that this is
going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.840> help<00:01:55.320> maintain<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.890> heat<00:01:56.310> that's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
going to help maintain the heat that's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.040 
going to help maintain the heat that's
the<00:01:56.820> vegetable<00:01:57.270> oil<00:01:57.360> got<00:01:57.600> when<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.930> went

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
the vegetable oil got when it went

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.779 
the vegetable oil got when it went
through<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.229> exchanger<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.070> hold<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.759> there

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
through the exchanger and hold it there

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.570 
through the exchanger and hold it there
while<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.390> engine<00:02:00.509> draws<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:02.220> fuel<00:02:02.430> from

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
while the engine draws the fuel from

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.990 
while the engine draws the fuel from
this<00:02:02.789> filter<00:02:03.149> reservoir<00:02:04.729> have<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:05.940> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
this filter reservoir have to have a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.719 
this filter reservoir have to have a
fuel<00:02:06.240> selector<00:02:06.509> valve<00:02:07.100> in<00:02:08.100> order<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.489> switch

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
fuel selector valve in order to switch

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
fuel selector valve in order to switch
between<00:02:09.030> diesel<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.690> vegetable<00:02:10.080> oil<00:02:10.350> when

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
between diesel and vegetable oil when

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.620 
between diesel and vegetable oil when
the<00:02:10.560> time<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.769> right<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.130> back<00:02:11.459> again<00:02:11.670> when

the time is right and back again when

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.780 
the time is right and back again when
it's<00:02:12.780> time<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.959> stop<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.760> a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
it's time to stop and so this is a

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.250 
it's time to stop and so this is a
motorized<00:02:15.470> fuel<00:02:16.470> selector<00:02:16.680> valve<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.870> keeps

got a three-way brass valve to determine

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.800 
got a three-way brass valve to determine
which<00:02:24.989> way<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:26.220> return<00:02:26.579> fuel<00:02:26.879> goes<00:02:27.120> either

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
which way the return fuel goes either

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.869 
which way the return fuel goes either
back<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.349> diesel<00:02:28.650> tank<00:02:28.890> or<00:02:29.129> right<00:02:29.700> back

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
back to the diesel tank or right back

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.640 
back to the diesel tank or right back
into<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> supply<00:02:30.420> side<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.079> it's<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.319> secret

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
into the supply side and it's the secret

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.550 
into the supply side and it's the secret
of<00:02:31.769> having<00:02:32.220> two<00:02:32.430> tanks<00:02:32.849> on<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.230> return<00:02:34.230> fuel

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.380 
follow this confusing mess of clamps and
hoses<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.900> wires<00:03:39.230> everywhere<00:03:39.850> basically<00:03:40.850> we

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
hoses and wires everywhere basically we

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.110 
hoses and wires everywhere basically we
got<00:03:41.600> this<00:03:42.230> this<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.370> original<00:03:43.760> diesel

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
got this this is the original diesel

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.240 
got this this is the original diesel
fuel<00:03:44.330> line<00:03:44.570> I<00:03:44.840> mean<00:03:45.440> we<00:03:45.530> replace<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:46.040> but<00:03:46.130> this

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
fuel line I mean we replace it but this

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.890 
fuel line I mean we replace it but this
is<00:03:46.310> where<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.670> diesel<00:03:47.000> line<00:03:47.150> comes<00:03:47.420> in<00:03:47.630> from

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
is where the diesel line comes in from

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.770 
is where the diesel line comes in from
the<00:03:48.470> fuel<00:03:48.680> tank<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.390> selector

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
the fuel tank and this is the selector

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.450 
the fuel tank and this is the selector
valve<00:03:50.930> that<00:03:51.230> we<00:03:51.320> showed<00:03:51.530> earlier<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:52.040> chooses

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
valve that we showed earlier it chooses

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.020 
valve that we showed earlier it chooses
and<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.390> this<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.590> line<00:03:54.770> that<00:03:54.950> goes<00:03:55.030> leads

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
and so this is the line that goes leads

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.230 
and so this is the line that goes leads
to<00:03:56.210> the<00:03:56.330> engine<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:57.460> this<00:03:58.460> is<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.790> line<00:03:58.970> from

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
to the engine and this is the line from

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.640 
to the engine and this is the line from
the<00:03:59.390> vegetable<00:03:59.840> oil<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:02.260> actually<00:04:03.260> starts

the vegetable oil that actually starts

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.080 
the vegetable oil that actually starts
here<00:04:03.860> this<00:04:03.890> comes<00:04:04.250> from<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.520> vegetable<00:04:04.910> oil

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
here this comes from the vegetable oil

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.910 
here this comes from the vegetable oil
tank<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:05.660> goes<00:04:05.810> into<00:04:05.990> our<00:04:06.170> heat<00:04:06.350> exchanger

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
tank and it goes into our heat exchanger

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.900 
tank and it goes into our heat exchanger
and<00:04:06.950> comes<00:04:07.250> back<00:04:07.490> out<00:04:07.810> goes<00:04:08.810> into<00:04:08.840> our<00:04:09.260> filter

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
and comes back out goes into our filter

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.970 
and comes back out goes into our filter
comes<00:04:10.910> back<00:04:11.180> out<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.720> goes<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.560> selector

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
comes back out and goes to the selector

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.530 
comes back out and goes to the selector

from the engine comes back out through
here<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:22.330> it's<00:04:23.330> our<00:04:23.510> three<00:04:23.720> way<00:04:23.870> valve<00:04:23.900> which

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
here and it's our three way valve which

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.550 
here and it's our three way valve which
right<00:04:25.130> now<00:04:25.160> is<00:04:25.570> choosing<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.600> return<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.320> fuel

right back into the supply line this is

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.710 
right back into the supply line this is
the<00:04:29.690> supply<00:04:30.020> line<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.440> engine<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:31.720> then

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
the supply line to the engine and then

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.810 
the supply line to the engine and then
if<00:04:32.870> we<00:04:33.020> turn<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.440> this<00:04:33.590> way<00:04:33.650> then<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.550> fuel

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
if we turn it this way then the fuel

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.220 
if we turn it this way then the fuel
would<00:04:35.000> then<00:04:35.120> go<00:04:35.300> back<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.720> diesel<00:04:36.050> tank

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
would then go back to the diesel tank

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.310 
would then go back to the diesel tank
that's<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.590> purge<00:04:36.800> in<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.040> air<00:04:37.930> our<00:04:38.930> coolant

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
that's the purge in the air our coolant

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.850 
that's the purge in the air our coolant
lines<00:04:40.060> we<00:04:41.060> tapped<00:04:41.330> off<00:04:41.540> of<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:41.990> cylinder<00:04:42.830> head

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
lines we tapped off of the cylinder head

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.909 
lines we tapped off of the cylinder head
here<00:04:43.280> that<00:04:43.490> this<00:04:44.150> this<00:04:44.510> hose<00:04:44.780> goes<00:04:45.200> into<00:04:45.620> the

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
here that this this hose goes into the

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.159 
here that this this hose goes into the
cabin<00:04:46.310> heater<00:04:46.460> we<00:04:47.090> put<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.300> tee<00:04:47.510> fitting<00:04:47.930> and

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
cabin heater we put a tee fitting and

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.880 
cabin heater we put a tee fitting and
little<00:04:48.590> adapter<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.390> that<00:04:50.390> sends<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:51.710> hot

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
little adapter and that sends the hot

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.270 
little adapter and that sends the hot
water<00:04:52.450> first<00:04:53.450> to<00:04:53.690> our<00:04:53.720> coil<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:54.980> goes<00:04:55.130> around

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
water first to our coil that goes around

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.760 
water first to our coil that goes around
our<00:04:55.669> heater<00:04:55.850> to<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.750> mean<00:04:57.080> around<00:04:57.320> our<00:04:57.440> filter

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
our heater to I mean around our filter

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.760 
our heater to I mean around our filter
to<00:04:58.550> keep<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.180> oil<00:04:59.210> hot<00:04:59.540> that's<00:04:59.780> in<00:04:59.960> there<00:05:00.169> and

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
to keep the oil hot that's in there and

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.770 
to keep the oil hot that's in there and
then<00:05:00.890> after<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.220> it<00:05:01.520> comes<00:05:01.730> out<00:05:01.910> goes<00:05:02.750> into

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
then after that it comes out goes into

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.719 
then after that it comes out goes into
our<00:05:03.140> heat<00:05:03.260> exchanger<00:05:03.800> in<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:03.979> top<00:05:04.190> comes<00:05:04.550> out

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
our heat exchanger in the top comes out

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.080 
our heat exchanger in the top comes out
the<00:05:04.880> bottom<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:06.110> then<00:05:06.260> heads<00:05:06.669> under<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.880> car

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
the bottom and then heads under the car

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.680 
the bottom and then heads under the car
and<00:05:08.450> then<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.290> goes<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:09.740> tank<00:05:10.070> in<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.030> back

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
and then it goes to the tank in the back

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.710 
and then it goes to the tank in the back
and

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
and

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.900 
and
through<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.620> fuel<00:05:13.830> pick<00:05:14.040> up<00:05:14.220> and<00:05:14.790> then

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
through the the fuel pick up and then

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.460 
through the the fuel pick up and then
comes<00:05:15.120> back<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.540> there's<00:05:15.810> another<00:05:16.020> hose<00:05:16.230> that

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
comes back and there's another hose that

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.370 
comes back and there's another hose that
we've<00:05:17.100> got<00:05:17.310> connected<00:05:17.760> in<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.390> corner<00:05:19.260> over

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
the the car goes through our little

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.300 
the the car goes through our little
heated<00:05:42.420> pickup<00:05:42.840> comes<00:05:43.080> back<00:05:43.350> out<00:05:43.560> back

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
heated pickup comes back out back

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.430 
heated pickup comes back out back
towards<00:05:44.670> the<00:05:44.730> engine<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.660> this<00:05:45.930> is<00:05:46.080> our<00:05:46.170> fuel

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
towards the engine and this is our fuel

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.960 
towards the engine and this is our fuel
line<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.770> comes<00:05:46.920> out<00:05:47.100> of<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.280> fuel<00:05:47.490> tank

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
line that comes out of the fuel tank

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.840 
line that comes out of the fuel tank
here<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.420> it's<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.290> front<00:05:49.530> so<00:05:50.520> that's<00:05:50.700> it

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
here and it's to the front so that's it

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.000 
here and it's to the front so that's it
for<00:05:50.880> there<00:05:51.240> then<00:05:52.170> we<00:05:52.260> have<00:05:52.410> one<00:05:52.560> little<00:05:52.680> switch

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
for there then we have one little switch

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.320 
for there then we have one little switch
on<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.280> dashboard<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.820> was<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.120> only<00:05:54.210> thing

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
on the dashboard that was the only thing
