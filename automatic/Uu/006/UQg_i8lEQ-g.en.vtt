some medicine I had to take when I had
pneumonia<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:22.110> long<00:01:22.320> time<00:01:22.560> ago

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
pneumonia a long time ago

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
pneumonia a long time ago
we<00:01:23.340> dropped<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> blenders<00:01:24.090> strainer<00:01:24.509> type

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.390 
we dropped the blenders strainer type
thing<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.619> put<00:01:25.830> ice<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.250> mine

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
thing in and then I put ice in mine

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
thing in and then I put ice in mine
because<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.750> way<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.170> about

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
because the the way that I think about

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.060 
because the the way that I think about
it<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.009> ice<00:01:29.189> helps<00:01:29.640> soak<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.119> some<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
it is the ice helps soak up some of the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.710 
it is the ice helps soak up some of the
solar<00:01:32.070> stuff<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> make<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:33.090> fruity<00:01:33.689> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
solar stuff to make it not as fruity I
