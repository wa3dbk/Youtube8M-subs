00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
that would ever come up is because you

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.390 
that would ever come up is because you
either<00:00:25.140> ran<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.770> little<00:00:25.890> quicker<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.829 
inspectors but he comes over and there's
two<00:00:49.650> rotors<00:00:49.979> in<00:00:50.129> sight<00:00:50.339> that<00:00:50.519> blower<00:00:50.790> and<00:00:51.150> you

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
two rotors in sight that blower and you

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.780 
two rotors in sight that blower and you
take<00:00:52.019> a<00:00:52.049> measurement<00:00:52.440> off<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.670> if

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
take a measurement off of it to see if

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.000 
take a measurement off of it to see if
that<00:00:54.089> we<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.479> rotor<00:00:55.170> that's<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.619> designed

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
that we have a rotor that's not designed

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.549 
that we have a rotor that's not designed
for<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.369> blower<00:00:56.790> itself<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:57.780> ways<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
for that blower itself there are ways to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.890 
for that blower itself there are ways to
manipulate<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.400> rules<00:00:59.640> or<00:01:00.059> cheat<00:01:00.479> and<00:01:00.690> that's

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
manipulate the rules or cheat and that's

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.660 
manipulate the rules or cheat and that's
what<00:01:01.049> they<00:01:01.199> thought<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.619> we<00:01:01.769> were<00:01:01.890> doing<00:01:02.220> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
what they thought that we were doing it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.100 
what they thought that we were doing it
didn't<00:01:02.879> find<00:01:03.059> anybody<00:01:03.330> we<00:01:03.510> don't<00:01:03.540> cheat<00:01:03.900> over

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
didn't find anybody we don't cheat over

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.750 
didn't find anybody we don't cheat over
here<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.530> work<00:01:04.680> real<00:01:04.920> hard<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.489> just

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
here we just work real hard that's just

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.890 
here we just work real hard that's just
one<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> things<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.450> they<00:01:06.600> check

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
one of the things that they check

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.300 
one of the things that they check
another<00:01:07.320> thing<00:01:07.560> they<00:01:07.710> come<00:01:07.890> over<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.159> they

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
another thing they come over and they

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.100 
another thing they come over and they
always<00:01:08.610> mess<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.060> especially<00:01:09.540> our<00:01:09.689> team<00:01:09.960> as

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
always mess with especially our team as

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.870 
always mess with especially our team as
soon<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.439> start<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> run<00:01:10.920> good<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:11.700> come

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
soon as we start to run good they come

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
soon as we start to run good they come
over<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.270> think<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.720> nitromethane<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
over and I think we have nitromethane in

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.020 
over and I think we have nitromethane in
our<00:01:13.740> tank<00:01:13.980> so<00:01:14.160> they<00:01:14.280> come<00:01:14.460> over<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.850> their

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
our tank so they come over with their

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
our tank so they come over with their
with<00:01:15.690> all<00:01:15.840> their<00:01:16.020> testers<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:16.770> test<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
with all their testers and they test it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.700 
with all their testers and they test it
and<00:01:17.700> they<00:01:17.790> don't<00:01:17.970> find<00:01:18.210> nuttin<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:19.620> they

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and they don't find nuttin and then they

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.810 
and they don't find nuttin and then they
come<00:01:19.860> over<00:01:20.040> they<00:01:20.160> look<00:01:20.340> at<00:01:20.430> our<00:01:20.550> computer

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
come over they look at our computer

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.790 
come over they look at our computer
system<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.540> our<00:01:21.630> field<00:01:21.990> management<00:01:22.350> system

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
system in our field management system

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.170 
system in our field management system
they'll<00:01:23.010> also<00:01:23.160> come<00:01:23.520> over<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.880> they'll<00:01:23.970> pull

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
they'll also come over and they'll pull

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.850 
they'll also come over and they'll pull
our<00:01:24.330> cylinder<00:01:24.750> heads<00:01:24.900> off<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.500> they'll<00:01:25.680> check

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
our cylinder heads off and they'll check

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710 
our cylinder heads off and they'll check
our<00:01:26.070> bores<00:01:26.370> they'll<00:01:27.120> see<00:01:27.300> it<00:01:27.360> they'll<00:01:27.540> measure

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
our bores they'll see it they'll measure

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
our bores they'll see it they'll measure
how<00:01:27.990> far<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.350> piston<00:01:28.740> goes<00:01:29.100> down<00:01:29.280> they'll

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
how far the piston goes down they'll

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.830 
how far the piston goes down they'll
check<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> stroke<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.450> sure<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.780> our

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
check the stroke to make sure that our

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.560 
check the stroke to make sure that our
that<00:01:31.710> our<00:01:31.740> engine<00:01:32.340> displacement<00:01:32.580> our<00:01:33.210> cubic

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that our engine displacement our cubic

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.260 
that our engine displacement our cubic

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
will see the faster we go the more we'll

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.830 
will see the faster we go the more we'll
see<00:01:38.190> those<00:01:38.340> guys<00:01:38.550> over<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:39.120> that's<00:01:39.659> just

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
see those guys over here that's just

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.800 
see those guys over here that's just
