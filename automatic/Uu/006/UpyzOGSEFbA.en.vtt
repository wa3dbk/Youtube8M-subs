injector<00:01:52.110> open<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.860> close<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.520> will

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
injector open do not close it it will

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969 
injector open do not close it it will
close<00:01:53.939> itself<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.380> someone<00:01:55.799> asked

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.469 
me that question last time after it
ejects<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.560> automatically<00:01:59.070> closes<00:01:59.399> itself<00:01:59.939> so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
ejects it automatically closes itself so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.209

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
would show the hacks working but after

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.020 
would show the hacks working but after
saving<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.349> file<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.069> realizing<00:02:52.730> how<00:02:52.849> bad

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
saving the file and realizing how bad

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.599 
saving the file and realizing how bad
the<00:02:53.239> audio<00:02:58.780> so<00:03:00.129> starting<00:03:01.129> it<00:03:01.189> wouldn't<00:03:01.430> let<00:03:01.489> me

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
the audio so starting it wouldn't let me

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.709 
the audio so starting it wouldn't let me
close<00:03:01.909> it<00:03:02.150> cuz<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.989> program's<00:03:03.349> a<00:03:03.469> biatch<00:03:03.709> um

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:04.719 
close it cuz the program's a biatch um
