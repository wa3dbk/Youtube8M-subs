00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.260
 compressed air is perhaps a serious one 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.900
 alternative to dry ice or all 2 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.550
 we find out how cold this is now 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.529
 compressed air spray is and whether it is 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.140
 cool a processor or overclock 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.029
 the warning can be sure 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.060
 Hold vertically is on the compressed air 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.189
 spray note but real men hold 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.699
 not to this instruction because of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.899
 Cooling can not be talked about 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.210
 so now we sprinkle these 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.340
 innocent graphics card to learn 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.990
 how cold air is actually when 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.990
 these are applied correctly 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.870
 to minus 18 degrees shows our infrared 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.130
 Measuring device to a water cooling can there 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.140
 ever can not keep up 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.510
 at this point again the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.580
 Mandatory warning apply 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.320
 at home, compressed air please according to regulation 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.500
 and do not try these 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.340
 according to our safety regulations 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.629
 very strict 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.600
 For example, we leave the trials 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.920
 of interns by listening now know 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.950
 you certainly like in dubai 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.720
 artificial snow is generated now 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.470
 follows the experiment on the living object 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.540
 So a core 2 duo e6600 is the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.390
 processor cold shows the bios with the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.560
 Reference cooler a temperature from 27 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.869
 degrees celsius 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.640
 this is how the further protective measures look 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.500
 but not for the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.810
 interns but for the processor 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.759
 if you believe that we are now pressurized 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.070
 improperly they hit the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.259
 understood wikipedia for me 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.509
 quote in many technical processes 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.460
 compressed air is used for cooling 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.880
 Well, if that's not technical 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.220
 Processes before we turn the power button 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.770
 Let's cool down the processor a little 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.369
 so that he does not suffer shock and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.590
 freezes wikipedia has been right 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.289
 and compressed air is actually suitable 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.470
 for cooling in the bios is a cpu 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.660
 Temperature around 17 to 19 degrees Celsius 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.700
 appropriate 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.740
 but now we want to know it well and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.910
 also measure the temperature directly 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:18.680
 the processor is minus 21 degrees celsius 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.680
 an impressive value for compressed air 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.750
 What exactly happens, we can not 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.360
 explain the processor reached 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.230
 suddenly 95 degrees celsius and the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.240
 Protective mechanism turned off pc 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.380
 be aware that radioactive noise 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.380
 right after the trial
