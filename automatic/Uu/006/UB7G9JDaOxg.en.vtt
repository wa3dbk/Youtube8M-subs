 like most without 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.520
 Irish team 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.100

 by turning the video like that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.409
 half an hour behind and a terrific moment 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.409
 Sebastian Larson 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.070

 one more thing and here is a fraction 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.220
 was the defense of the irish team johan l 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.220
 mander scores his goal 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.709

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.519
 square and head punches hands 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.760

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.000
 match

 james mcclin was very active and left 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.909

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.909
 teams in this episode 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.010
 struck maybe not so 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.930
 tricky crawling turning the same time 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.790
 hit the goalkeeper and here already of course 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.790
 All questions where mind Ford

 Anders Svensson scores gates 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.810
 home team and do not understand what 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.640
 the goalkeeper put down near the ball from himself 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.030
 angle 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.030
 one 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.590
 the Swedes, by the way, could have taken away the pain 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.819
 weighty victory of his Zlatan Ibrahimovic 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.740
 gets his second half moment 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.840
 after discount and wonder 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.720
 but failed to hush up to snatch forward 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.850
 forward and knock on goal 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.870
 formats Sweden team leader 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.909
 but the Irish 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.829
 it could have turned out nights if 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.640
 had time for this discount 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:47.690
 Robbie kin buran discount he did not have time

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.890
 it's good that the goalkeeper of the national team of Sweden 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.550
 jumped form for the Irish team 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.990
 otherwise there would be an injury 2121 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.720
 Swedish national team for the fourth time 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.320
