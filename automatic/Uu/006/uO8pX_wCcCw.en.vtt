front and a rear a differential feed is
designed<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:26.099> both<00:00:26.340> work<00:00:26.670> together

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
designed that they both work together

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.370 
designed that they both work together
but<00:00:27.750> slightly<00:00:28.199> different<00:00:28.380> speeds<00:00:29.029> on<00:00:30.380> the

but slightly different speeds on the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.290 
but slightly different speeds on the
side<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.890> your<00:00:32.070> serger<00:00:32.489> you'll<00:00:32.700> find<00:00:33.000> two

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
side of your serger you'll find two

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.200 
side of your serger you'll find two
dials<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:34.770> first<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:35.969> with

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
dials the first one is all to do with

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.630 
dials the first one is all to do with
your<00:00:36.570> stitch<00:00:36.840> length<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.410> I've<00:00:38.309> got<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> little

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
your stitch length and I've got a little

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.030 
your stitch length and I've got a little
sample<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.620> closer<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:43.040> one

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
sample here so the closer it is it's one

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.560 
sample here so the closer it is it's one
and<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:46.410> more<00:00:46.590> space<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.280> want<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.450> your

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
and the more space you want for your

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.729 
and the more space you want for your
stitching<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:51.140> now<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
stitching is going to be for now for the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.939 
stitching is going to be for now for the
second<00:00:53.699> dial<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.350> controls<00:00:55.770> your

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
second dial this is what controls your

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
second dial this is what controls your
differential<00:00:56.579> feed<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.300> your<00:00:57.329> fabrics<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
differential feed for your fabrics that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.160 
differential feed for your fabrics that
you're<00:00:58.199> using<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.489> these<00:00:59.969> two<00:01:00.210> diagrams<00:01:00.660> here

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you're using and these two diagrams here

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.529 
you're using and these two diagrams here
this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.129> telling<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:03.149> need<00:01:03.329> more

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
this is telling you you need more

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.899 
this is telling you you need more
stretch<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.229> your<00:01:04.320> fabric<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.670> will

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
stretch in your fabric so what you will

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.710 
stretch in your fabric so what you will
do<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.330> move<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.540> dial<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:08.119> perhaps<00:01:09.119> two<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
do is move your dial to perhaps two and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.530 
do is move your dial to perhaps two and
it<00:01:10.320> goes<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:10.770> naught<00:01:11.010> point<00:01:11.250> seven<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.270> two

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it goes from naught point seven to two

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.660 
it goes from naught point seven to two
so<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.380> important<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.010> actually<00:01:14.369> test

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
so it is important you actually test

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
so it is important you actually test
before<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> actually<00:01:15.330> go<00:01:15.900> ahead<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:17.130> your

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
before you actually go ahead and do your

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.710 
before you actually go ahead and do your
work<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.850> need<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.420> sewing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
work that you need to on your sewing

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289 
work that you need to on your sewing
project<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.740> second<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.610> telling<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
project the second one is telling you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.230 
project the second one is telling you
that<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:22.409> too<00:01:22.740> much<00:01:23.060> compression<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
that there's too much compression and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510 
that there's too much compression and
you<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> release<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.340> all

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you want to release that so it's all

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.600 
you want to release that so it's all
about<00:01:26.549> turning<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.630> dial<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.979> down<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
about turning this dial up and down and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.330 
about turning this dial up and down and
finding<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> correct<00:01:30.799> number<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.189> will

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
finding the correct number that will

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
finding the correct number that will
work<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> fabric<00:01:34.970> before<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> put<00:01:36.329> my

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
work with a fabric before I put my

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.929 
work with a fabric before I put my
presser<00:01:36.930> foot<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.460> want<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.759> give<00:01:38.909> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
presser foot on I just want to give you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.510 
presser foot on I just want to give you
a<00:01:39.060> quick<00:01:39.299> demonstration<00:01:39.509> how<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.560> two<00:01:41.040> feed

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a quick demonstration how the two feed

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.990 
a quick demonstration how the two feed
dogs<00:01:41.820> work<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:43.229> would<00:01:43.409> align<00:01:44.280> your<00:01:44.460> fabric<00:01:44.850> on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
dogs work you would align your fabric on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.910 
dogs work you would align your fabric on
the<00:01:45.240> first<00:01:45.450> feed<00:01:45.720> dog<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.710> said<00:01:46.770> before

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the first feed dog and as I said before

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.130 
the first feed dog and as I said before
they<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:47.970> different<00:01:48.329> speeds<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:48.899> they

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
they go at different speeds but they

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.530 
they go at different speeds but they
work<00:01:49.380> together<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:50.790> happen<00:01:51.329> is

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
work together so what will happen is

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.280 
work together so what will happen is
that<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.350> sew<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.950> thirst<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:54.290> natural

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that as you sew your thirst one natural

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.929 
that as you sew your thirst one natural
stretches<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:55.860> fabric<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.340> little<00:01:56.460> bit<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
stretches your fabric a little bit and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.789 
stretches your fabric a little bit and
it's<00:01:57.119> traveling<00:01:57.329> at<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> faster<00:01:58.049> speed<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's traveling at a faster speed to the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.330 
it's traveling at a faster speed to the
rear<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.820> rear<00:02:00.060> kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.920> controls<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.159> by

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
rear and the rear kind of controls it by

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.080 
rear and the rear kind of controls it by
bringing<00:02:03.060> itself<00:02:04.040> with<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> timing<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.060> make

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
bringing itself with the timing to make

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.969 
bringing itself with the timing to make
sure<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.960> don't<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.619> dress<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
sure that you don't get this dress that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.000 
sure that you don't get this dress that
will<00:02:08.340> happen<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.330> wasn't<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.899> feed<00:02:10.229> dogs

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
will happen if there wasn't to feed dogs

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.820 
will happen if there wasn't to feed dogs
now<00:02:13.010> go<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.280> do<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.490> tester<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.530> then<00:02:15.530> get<00:02:15.710> my

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
now go to do a tester and then get my

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.370 
now go to do a tester and then get my
fabric<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.360> dials<00:02:17.780> at<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.960> side<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.320> the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
fabric and the dials at the side of the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.160 
fabric and the dials at the side of the
machine<00:02:18.710> have<00:02:19.070> been<00:02:19.340> set<00:02:19.670> on<00:02:19.880> naught<00:02:20.870> point

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
machine have been set on naught point

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.910 
machine have been set on naught point
seven<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:23.360> stitch<00:02:23.810> length<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.410> can<00:02:24.740> be

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
seven and the stitch length it can be

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.770 
seven and the stitch length it can be
whatever<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.520> want<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.910> be<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.330> me<00:02:26.450> for

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
whatever you want it to be for me for

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.800 
whatever you want it to be for me for
this<00:02:26.840> demonstration<00:02:27.050> I'm<00:02:27.800> using<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.160> on<00:02:28.250> four

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
this demonstration I'm using it on four

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.380 
this demonstration I'm using it on four
so<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:31.000> get<00:02:32.000> my<00:02:32.470> fabric<00:02:33.470> into<00:02:34.070> position<00:02:34.610> and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so I get my fabric into position and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.600 
so I get my fabric into position and
then<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.870> just<00:02:36.850> go<00:02:37.850> away

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.880 

and<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:44.250> stretch<00:02:45.250> fabric<00:02:45.490> and<00:02:46.680> as<00:02:47.680> you

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
and this is a stretch fabric and as you

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.270 
and this is a stretch fabric and as you
can<00:02:48.010> see<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.990> is<00:02:50.290> wavy<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.960> I<00:02:53.830> want<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.250> be

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
can see it is wavy and I want that to be

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.500 
can see it is wavy and I want that to be
flat<00:02:54.730> as<00:02:55.000> possible<00:02:56.940> if<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.060> just<00:02:58.210> turn<00:02:58.330> on<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
flat as possible if I just turn on the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.790 
flat as possible if I just turn on the
sides<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.930> probably<00:02:59.200> see<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.470> little<00:02:59.530> bit

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
sides you probably see it a little bit

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.910 
sides you probably see it a little bit
there<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.600> I'm<00:03:01.600> now<00:03:01.720> going<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.930> demonstrate<00:03:02.170> on

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
there so I'm now going to demonstrate on

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.720 
there so I'm now going to demonstrate on
a<00:03:02.980> second<00:03:03.730> piece<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.060> fabric<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.530> I'm<00:03:06.460> going

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
a second piece of fabric and I'm going

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.270 
a second piece of fabric and I'm going
to<00:03:06.790> change<00:03:07.330> my<00:03:07.750> differential<00:03:08.680> feed<00:03:09.040> which<00:03:09.250> is

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
to change my differential feed which is

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.840 
to change my differential feed which is
the<00:03:09.820> lower<00:03:10.000> wall<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.770> a<00:03:11.800> larger<00:03:12.250> number<00:03:12.280> and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
the lower wall to a larger number and

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.030 
the lower wall to a larger number and
I'm<00:03:13.000> just<00:03:13.180> going<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.540> be<00:03:13.630> using<00:03:13.960> two<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.860> that

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
I'm just going to be using two so that

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:25.610 
I'm just going to be using two so that
you<00:03:15.220> can<00:03:15.400> see<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.670> difference

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.720 

and<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:28.150> should<00:03:28.480> be<00:03:28.720> nice<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.880> flat<00:03:32.430> nice<00:03:33.430> and

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
and it should be nice and flat nice and

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.330 
and it should be nice and flat nice and
flat<00:03:34.170> now<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.319> is<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.530> benefit<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:35.920> having<00:03:36.160> a

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
flat now this is the benefit of having a

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.979 
flat now this is the benefit of having a
differential<00:03:36.849> feed<00:03:37.120> as<00:03:37.300> you<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.630> see<00:03:37.810> with

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
differential feed as you can see with

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.870 
differential feed as you can see with
the<00:03:38.080> first<00:03:38.290> tester<00:03:38.770> I<00:03:38.800> did<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:39.520> see<00:03:39.700> the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
the first tester I did you can see the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.790 
the first tester I did you can see the
waviness<00:03:40.360> that's<00:03:40.660> happening<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.350> fabric

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
waviness that's happening to the fabric

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.479 
waviness that's happening to the fabric
and<00:03:42.040> as<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:43.420> do<00:03:43.989> with<00:03:44.110> any<00:03:44.290> practice<00:03:44.860> run<00:03:45.100> you

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
and as you do with any practice run you

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.100 
and as you do with any practice run you
just<00:03:45.670> need<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:45.940> make<00:03:46.060> sure<00:03:46.300> that<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> settings

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
just need to make sure that the settings

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.229 
just need to make sure that the settings
on<00:03:47.319> your<00:03:47.380> differential<00:03:48.220> feed<00:03:48.459> will<00:03:48.790> give<00:03:49.030> you

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
on your differential feed will give you

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.870 
on your differential feed will give you
the<00:03:49.630> flatter<00:03:49.930> edge<00:03:50.680> here<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.640> is<00:03:51.760> what

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
the flatter edge here and that is what

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.170 
the flatter edge here and that is what
you're<00:03:52.000> looking<00:03:52.090> for<00:03:53.280> I'm<00:03:54.280> now<00:03:54.550> doing<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.910> test

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
you're looking for I'm now doing a test

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.540 
you're looking for I'm now doing a test
sample<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.750> fan<00:03:56.260> woven<00:03:56.739> fabric<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:57.400> is

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
sample on a fan woven fabric and this is

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.699 
sample on a fan woven fabric and this is
an<00:03:57.640> organza<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.480> my<00:03:58.840> setting<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.380> still<00:03:59.590> out

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
an organza and my setting is still out

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:00.449 
an organza and my setting is still out
too

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
too

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:12.210 
too
so<00:04:01.000> let's<00:04:01.269> see<00:04:01.450> what<00:04:01.600> happens<00:04:01.989> here<00:04:10.170> later<00:04:11.220> and

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
so let's see what happens here later and

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.670 
so let's see what happens here later and
as<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:12.549> can<00:04:12.700> see<00:04:12.760> with<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.660> fan<00:04:13.870> one<00:04:14.080> there<00:04:14.440> is

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
as you can see with the fan one there is

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.400 
as you can see with the fan one there is
a<00:04:14.860> lot<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.760> what<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.269> call<00:04:16.510> blocking<00:04:16.870> on<00:04:17.350> the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
a lot of what you call blocking on the

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.740 
a lot of what you call blocking on the
edge<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.780> I'll<00:04:19.900> get<00:04:20.169> another<00:04:20.200> sample<00:04:21.100> and

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
edge and I'll get another sample and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.260 
edge and I'll get another sample and
I'll<00:04:22.750> change<00:04:23.050> my<00:04:23.260> setting<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:24.700> differential

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
I'll change my setting the differential

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.710 
I'll change my setting the differential
feed<00:04:25.419> setting<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.560> that<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:27.550> going<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.820> be<00:04:28.000> not

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
feed setting and that is going to be not

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.750 
feed setting and that is going to be not
0.7<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:30.370> we<00:04:30.490> should<00:04:30.669> see<00:04:31.770> difference<00:04:32.770> in

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
0.7 and we should see difference in

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.510 
0.7 and we should see difference in
power<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.270> differential<00:04:34.900> feeling<00:04:35.370> candle<00:04:36.370> to

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
power the differential feeling candle to

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.030 
power the differential feeling candle to
fabric

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.110 

okay<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.840> as<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.050> can<00:04:46.170> see<00:04:46.230> we've<00:04:46.560> got<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.680> nice

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
okay and as you can see we've got a nice

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.379 
okay and as you can see we've got a nice
beautifully<00:04:48.120> finished<00:04:48.840> edge<00:04:49.110> as<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:51.060> can<00:04:51.210> see

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
beautifully finished edge as you can see

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.080 
beautifully finished edge as you can see
with<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.870> fine<00:04:52.169> woven<00:04:52.590> fabric<00:04:53.100> when<00:04:53.639> I<00:04:53.669> had<00:04:53.940> it

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
with the fine woven fabric when I had it
