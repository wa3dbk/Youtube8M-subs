it's the morning of day 9 and today
that's<00:00:14.030> pretty<00:00:14.300> cold<00:00:14.540> when<00:00:15.350> I<00:00:15.410> woke<00:00:15.620> up

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
that's pretty cold when I woke up

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.910 
that's pretty cold when I woke up
temperature<00:00:16.460> was<00:00:16.640> in<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:16.880> mid-teens<00:00:17.360> so<00:00:17.990> that

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
temperature was in the mid-teens so that

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.970 
temperature was in the mid-teens so that
has<00:00:19.100> obviously<00:00:19.760> some<00:00:20.439> impact<00:00:21.439> on<00:00:21.650> things<00:00:22.090> I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
has obviously some impact on things I

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.830 
has obviously some impact on things I
visited<00:00:24.980> again<00:00:25.100> this<00:00:25.430> morning<00:00:25.850> the<00:00:26.270> shot<00:00:26.570> that

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
visited again this morning the shot that

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.090 
visited again this morning the shot that
I've<00:00:26.930> been<00:00:27.110> trying<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.010> get<00:00:28.220> I<00:00:28.630> think<00:00:29.630> I<00:00:30.100> just

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
I've been trying to get I think I just

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.740 
I've been trying to get I think I just
can't<00:00:31.340> quite<00:00:31.550> find<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:31.910> foreground<00:00:32.239> I<00:00:32.419> want

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
can't quite find the foreground I want

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.010 
can't quite find the foreground I want
with<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.500> lens<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:33.920> have<00:00:34.129> currently<00:00:34.989> so<00:00:35.989> I

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
with the lens I have currently so I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.590 
with the lens I have currently so I
might<00:00:36.260> put<00:00:36.500> that<00:00:36.530> on<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.190> try<00:00:38.059> to<00:00:38.090> get<00:00:38.300> next

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
might put that on the try to get next

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.389 
might put that on the try to get next
year<00:00:38.780> list<00:00:39.230> with<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.340> more<00:00:41.120> wide<00:00:41.329> angle<00:00:41.630> lens<00:00:42.399> so

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
year list with a more wide angle lens so

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.950 
year list with a more wide angle lens so
where<00:00:43.550> does<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:43.670> put<00:00:43.790> me<00:00:44.000> for<00:00:44.480> this<00:00:44.540> trip<00:00:44.690> so

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
where does that put me for this trip so

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.010 
where does that put me for this trip so
far<00:00:44.989> well<00:00:45.590> I<00:00:46.120> still<00:00:47.120> got<00:00:47.180> a<00:00:47.300> couple<00:00:47.510> places<00:00:47.720> I

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
far well I still got a couple places I

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
reflection shots in the river and since

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.540 
reflection shots in the river and since
the<00:00:52.520> sunny<00:00:52.820> that<00:00:53.239> should<00:00:53.450> be<00:00:53.540> good<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.520> also<00:00:55.520> I

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
want to explore to the canyon over on

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.670 
want to explore to the canyon over on
east<00:00:57.140> side<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.380> park

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
east side of the park

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:09.190 
east side of the park
so<00:00:57.920> that's<00:00:58.579> all<00:00:58.700> I'm<00:00:58.760> gonna<00:00:58.850> be<00:00:58.940> doing<00:00:59.120> today

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
of the park and I came to some of these

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.670 
of the park and I came to some of these
little<00:01:13.939> canyons<00:01:14.360> over<00:01:14.479> here<00:01:14.840> just<00:01:15.259> to<00:01:15.380> see<00:01:15.590> if

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
little canyons over here just to see if

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.960 
little canyons over here just to see if
I<00:01:15.770> could<00:01:15.830> find<00:01:16.159> something<00:01:16.400> interesting<00:01:16.640> to

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
I could find something interesting to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.149 
I could find something interesting to
photograph<00:01:17.360> all<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.439> snow<00:01:18.649> we've<00:01:18.799> had<00:01:18.830> the

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
photograph all the snow we've had the

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.850 
photograph all the snow we've had the
past<00:01:19.430> couple<00:01:20.000> days<00:01:20.270> it's<00:01:21.259> already<00:01:21.590> melted

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
past couple days it's already melted

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.670 
past couple days it's already melted
away<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.750> that<00:01:23.750> has<00:01:23.960> sent<00:01:24.170> water<00:01:24.380> damp

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
away and that has sent water damp

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.170 
away and that has sent water damp
through<00:01:24.890> some<00:01:25.040> these<00:01:25.159> canyons<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.850> it

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
through some these canyons and it

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.370 
through some these canyons and it
created<00:01:26.509> some<00:01:26.600> really<00:01:26.810> interesting<00:01:26.990> mud

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
created some really interesting mud

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.320 
created some really interesting mud
textures<00:01:27.890> that's<00:01:28.670> really<00:01:28.880> what<00:01:29.000> I'm<00:01:29.090> looking

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
textures that's really what I'm looking

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.029 
textures that's really what I'm looking
for<00:01:29.539> if<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.840> get<00:01:30.049> some<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.200> those<00:01:30.320> mud<00:01:30.590> textures

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
for if I get some of those mud textures

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.130 
for if I get some of those mud textures
and<00:01:31.369> find<00:01:32.000> some<00:01:32.149> subjects<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:32.570> put<00:01:32.720> up<00:01:32.810> against

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
and find some subjects to put up against

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.570 
and find some subjects to put up against
it<00:01:33.259> I<00:01:33.380> think<00:01:33.649> it<00:01:33.740> might<00:01:33.830> look<00:01:33.979> kind<00:01:34.039> of<00:01:34.220> cool<00:01:34.399> I

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
it I think it might look kind of cool I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.429 
it I think it might look kind of cool I
did<00:01:35.450> find<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.689> few<00:01:35.810> areas<00:01:35.960> look<00:01:36.229> pretty

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
did find a few areas look pretty

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:36.999 
did find a few areas look pretty
promising

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
promising

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.320 
promising
the<00:01:37.100> only<00:01:37.220> thing<00:01:37.430> is<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.580> light<00:01:37.789> wasn't<00:01:38.180> quite

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
the only thing is the light wasn't quite

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.230 
the only thing is the light wasn't quite
right<00:01:38.539> it<00:01:39.020> was<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:39.470> midday<00:01:39.950> light<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.580> being

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
right it was in midday light and being

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.490 
right it was in midday light and being
hit<00:01:41.420> by<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.569> direct<00:01:41.810> light<00:01:41.990> which<00:01:42.170> isn't<00:01:42.409> such

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
hit by the direct light which isn't such

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.469 
hit by the direct light which isn't such
a<00:01:42.619> good<00:01:42.770> thing<00:01:42.920> if<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:43.789> get<00:01:43.940> some<00:01:44.119> candy<00:01:44.450> and

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
a good thing if I get some candy and

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.300 
a good thing if I get some candy and
reflected<00:01:44.960> light<00:01:45.110> on<00:01:45.259> them<00:01:45.380> might<00:01:46.009> be<00:01:46.039> kind<00:01:46.250> of

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
reflected light on them might be kind of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.490 
reflected light on them might be kind of
cool<00:01:46.390> why<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.450> plan<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.899> head<00:01:48.080> back<00:01:48.289> down

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
cool why the plan is to head back down

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.960 
cool why the plan is to head back down
to<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.590> canyon<00:01:48.860> again<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:49.369> see<00:01:49.670> if<00:01:49.759> I<00:01:49.819> can

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
to the canyon again and see if I can

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.609 
to the canyon again and see if I can
find<00:01:50.179> some<00:01:50.479> reflections<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.110> can<00:01:51.259> shoot<00:01:51.440> in<00:01:51.530> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
find some reflections I can shoot in the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.460 
find some reflections I can shoot in the
water<00:01:51.830> either<00:01:52.670> with<00:01:52.789> my<00:01:52.909> 6<00:01:53.119> by<00:01:53.240> 17<00:01:53.690> or<00:01:54.049> my<00:01:54.200> 8<00:01:54.350> by

causing some nice little turbulence
which<00:02:19.720> will<00:02:20.020> be<00:02:20.170> kind<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.410> interesting<00:02:20.940> unlike
