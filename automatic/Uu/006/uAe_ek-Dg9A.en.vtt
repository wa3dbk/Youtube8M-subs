00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.819
 hi friends and friends today I'm going to 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:08.190
 teach how to make this monkey that can 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.870
 serve both to hang on the tree 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.610
 like to decorate a leg of a 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.949
 garland for the door which is what 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.550
 I 'm going to teach you in one more project 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.980
 ahead what we need is going to be 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:29.849
 some tape wired here we have as 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 a wire cited above and below and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.460
 it's easier to work also we're going 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.010
 to look for some golden thread like 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.160
 this 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.440
 yes to tie and make for if we are going to 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.170
 do to hang up then we put him 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.129
 as a bow to hang from the tree 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.190
 and if we do not just do it like this 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:58.519
 that is going to be where I'm going to hit it later 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.479
 to the garland as you see is a very 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:05.239
 very simple that is what we do 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:08.030
 we grasp that our tape depends on the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.140
 size that we'll want to do 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.490
 leave the tail and this one long of the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.060
 size we want 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.060
 we are going to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.009
 join here 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.380
 then we are accommodating them because 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.659
 it's with 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.860
 with wire so it's easy to accommodate 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:35.170
 let's make an ear 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.170
 so let's accommodate 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.520
 let's make the other side another little ear 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.180
 then we are going to accommodate him well 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:56.030
 stay if it's bigger greatest good 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:58.460
 the little ears we go here joining the middle 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.450
 there we have a little bow with two little ears 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.350
 if we want to make the other little ears 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.909
 we simply make another one here below 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.909
 and we take it back 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.990
 if we are accommodating 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.410
 see how it is going 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:24.160
 Here we are joining the environment and we 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.160
 another orejita more 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.909
 from the other side 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.600
 Then it fits well if each little ear 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.069
 so that they are good here is where 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.519
 we can tie with this crime 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.849
 If here we can treat it and we leave it a 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.249
 bow to hang it later in this 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.380
 case how did I do this which is what 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:55.450
 I simply made 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.890
 here 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.890
 I was 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:07.200
 sorry is down here simply 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:11.120
 go to the middle to join them and do the 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.850
 part of the medium that remains 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.730
 more neat 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.880
 whether it's just good maybe it's not late 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.480
 but they are simply going to accommodate 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.480
 ears 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.270
 if they are going to accommodate 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.240
 and the tail of the little tail that remains 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.330
 of the tie and they are going to hit back with a 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.640
 little dot of silicone and they will stay 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.490
 A) Yes 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.010
 she is alone she says small but if they do 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.580
 with bigger ties with little ears more 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.209
 great you will be more colorful 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.590
 they still see as I tell them it 's very very 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.430
 simple 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.890
 simply accommodate after this opens 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:03.750
 that takes well a form of monito and 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.750
 is ready 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.940
 Christ our little monkey hope that 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.070
 have liked you liked and do what 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.070
 See you on the next project
