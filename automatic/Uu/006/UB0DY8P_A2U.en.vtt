 he wanted to get up not today he did not want to come 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.460
 we were trying to wake up 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:40.369
 but a little if they are only disparate 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.369
 I did it but there you are the blender 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.210
 that are going to dream in this event the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.030
 several that always for the coming out the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.470
 cowboys in this opportunity are going to 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.200
 be doing the gentlemen are 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.630
 strong and courageous which is another of the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.299
 adventures they propose 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.030
 in this case unique to the rose that is 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.970
 our protagonist of this adventure 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.670
 Its mission is to deliver loyal to the king 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.099
 austin a message sent to him by the queen 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.290
 is there and for that you must go through a 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.280
 lot of difficulties like a swamp 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.099
 stinky a gatekeeper and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.540
 good to achieve the goal so I 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.099
 I think they are going to have a lot of fun and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.510
 will go well because the boys 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.950
 It is a very interesting adventure 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.050
 true the backyardigans have been made 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.910
 famous because just backyard means 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.200
 backyard then are the friends 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.390
 that always meet in the yard 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.580
 back and create a new story and I 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.830
 I've been illustrating in the cut 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.540
 commercial because I have no children 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.010
 little children or nephews who saw 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.690
 with me then I'll know a little more 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.239
 of banking so you 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.580
 converted and the true and some 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.090
 way I think I do not know if it coincides with me 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.000
 open in some way all between the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.019
 year and the 34 years that we him 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.310
 too many of us have been walking away 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.280
 we have dreamed about these stories well 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.290
 5 lovely dolls 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.489
 considerations in reality totally 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.380
 totally I think we all went through 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.190
 that stage and we imagined up elements 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.770
 or we grabbed a broom from a house and 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.630
 we imagined it was a horse and the 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.160
 truth is that it is very interesting in 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.500
 these times that while 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.239
 the technology is great and brings a 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:31.430
 heap of information do not lose that is 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:33.110
 that little seed of imagining playing dreaming me 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.319
 It seems that it is very important and also 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.130
 that the batteries transmit those 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.280
 adventures always a few values ​​of 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.080
 friendship solidarity sharing that is so 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.549
 important what I told you about the 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.590
 backyardigans develop a lot the 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.360
 creativity and imagination in the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.069
 total children and you said it in 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.349
 times where technology seems 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.000
 having made them vicious of all 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.430
 little children who are caught in front of a 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.260
 apparatus all day this well with this 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.090
 they return to the games that we 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.170
 we practice where we were young 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.849
 so is 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.730
 that's the wonder but look at that 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.060
 some way I tell you by santiago that 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.060
 they 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:18.070
 as it was projected in the gardens 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.070
 in some way seeing the chapter 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.190
 from time to time big time 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.900
 adventures this then is something that is 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.300
 totally I think that also every 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.170
 character as he has a personality 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.250
 different 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:40.150
 children identify and assume the role of 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.590
 or from tyrone and they travel in that adventure 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.470
 assuming one of the characters I think 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.000
 that the proposal is very nice because they are 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.310
 all different as all of us what 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.920
 we are then we can can have the 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.630
 identification with the one who is more shy 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.730
 the one that is more unruly the one that feels 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.420
 princess and that seems to me that's what 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.450
 was the presumable staging is a 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.820
 challenge 2 because you have to somehow 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:12.040
 reproduced try to resemble the 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.650
 chapter I have 20 hate in this 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.850
 and this link totally this is the 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.740
 software is very interesting 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.280
 technologically also because we have 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.410
 a projection that introduces us into that 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.800
 world and it helps us generate the 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.650
 transition between 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.620
 what they are dreaming of and take it to the 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.139
 reality is very interesting the way in 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.539
 that is developing and counting 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.580
 visually the show that would have 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.650
 to tell us where when they show up 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.380
 where tickets are bought good 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.740
 we will be in it 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:49.730
 Maria Angola Convention Center 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.070
 Saturday 5 to Tuesday 8 three functions 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.620
 The tickets can be purchased daily 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.720

 also at the center's ticket office 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.920
 conventions and we wanted to thank 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.080
 god and plaza that is the producer that 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.740
 allows us to be here in Lima 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.650
 sharing the stage with all of them 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.540
 broad will be provided so that the 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.760
 imagination and the dreams of the gardens 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.090
 They unfold as they only know 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.950

 lazy doubts and whale now let's go
