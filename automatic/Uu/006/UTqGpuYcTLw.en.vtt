and<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.820> way<00:03:58.030> we<00:03:58.510> figure<00:03:58.840> out<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.170> this<00:03:59.350> is

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
and the way we figure out that this is

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:08.090 
and the way we figure out that this is
gallery<00:03:59.950> 1<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.580> we<00:04:00.970> can<00:04:01.150> click<00:04:01.450> right<00:04:02.170> here<00:04:03.780> and

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.830 

insert<00:04:09.100> our<00:04:09.310> gallery<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.910> we<00:04:10.330> can<00:04:10.510> see<00:04:10.660> that

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
insert our gallery and we can see that

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.110 
insert our gallery and we can see that
the<00:04:10.959> ID<00:04:11.140> equals<00:04:11.739> 1<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.280> that's<00:04:12.820> where<00:04:13.030> that

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
the ID equals 1 and that's where that

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.840 
the ID equals 1 and that's where that
number<00:04:13.270> comes<00:04:13.570> from<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:15.610> put<00:04:15.760> the

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
number comes from so just put the

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.400 
number comes from so just put the
corresponding<00:04:16.450> number<00:04:16.720> in<00:04:16.840> there<00:04:19.080> once<00:04:20.080> we<00:04:20.230> do

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
corresponding number in there once we do

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.600 
corresponding number in there once we do
that<00:04:20.680> we<00:04:20.859> can<00:04:21.010> click<00:04:21.280> publish

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
that we can click publish

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.540

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
for it but that is how you make it

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.349 
for it but that is how you make it
and<00:04:54.559> if<00:04:55.559> you<00:04:55.739> made<00:04:55.919> it<00:04:56.039> the<00:04:56.489> proper<00:04:56.879> width

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:57.359 
and if you made it the proper width

00:04:57.359 --> 00:04:59.509 
and if you made it the proper width
which<00:04:57.839> I<00:04:58.019> didn't<00:04:58.349> you'd<00:04:58.709> see<00:04:58.919> this<00:04:59.069> arrow<00:04:59.339> on

which I didn't you'd see this arrow on
this<00:04:59.639> other<00:04:59.819> side<00:05:00.089> too<00:05:00.619> but<00:05:01.619> that's<00:05:01.829> basically

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
this other side too but that's basically

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.399 
this other side too but that's basically
