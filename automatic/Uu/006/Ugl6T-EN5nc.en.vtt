00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello today this is about 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.990
 sweet potatoes i find these tubers 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.990
 are worth a mention 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.449
 What are sweet potato sweet potatoes 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.039
 we have with the potatoes 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.689
 especially in Germany in this country 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.090
 only know the white potatoes 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.899
 names and just this tuber shape 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.399
 together 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.559
 basically it is also a complete one 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.390
 other plant the potato we 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.640
 Solanum, which is known here 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.820
 topel rose and the sweet potato belongs 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.850
 to the species homo yes bad ass so something 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.710
 completely different, at least botanically 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.210
 Consider what the effect for the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.070
 people are very similar to man 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.629
 Think it a potato and choose 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.939
 they potato for a reason 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.159
 but what is better about why should 

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:53.869
 to eat the sweet potato 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.150
 The sweet potato usually has one 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:58.100
 stronger and predominantly sweet aroma 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.110
 As the name implies reminds one 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.339
 Bit of some pumpkins and 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.560
 other kukaduh pumpkin has more aroma 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.270
 Variety There are different varieties 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.680
 have one to another essential 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.659
 more deviant taste than her 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.380
 Potatoes we know the white ones 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.909
 potatoes and they have yes 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.130
 color variations that cuts on 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.049
 we'll see how you get in it later 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.939
 orange there are also red and purple and 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.770
 so on, in my opinion 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.520
 just a lot prettier but that should 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.390
 no reason to eat them alone 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.909
 but especially is the potato 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.009
 interesting if you have problems with the 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.810
 Digestion has bowel problems Crohn's disease 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.469
 infestations in general one 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.259
 vulnerable 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:39.079
 because the sweet potato contains no 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.210
 gluco alkaloids sounds crazy 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.280
 complicated luckow alkaloids are the ones 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.229
 substances in the shell and in the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.060
 green spots with the white potatoes 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.950
 is that where possibly europe 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.229
 still said eating a little 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.380
 I give it the right luckow alkaloid 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.149
 are toxic in too large quantities and you 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.609
 are certainly not expect to even a 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.920
 to eat potatoes with peel and the 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.090
 gluco alkaloid proportion of potatoes 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.799
 We also went on eating here 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.209
 Bred back is a good thing 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.030
 Nevertheless, you make sense as possible 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.319
 largely to renounce 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.729
 The sweet potato has these problems 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.290
 not at all how can you easily 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.510
 even with shell food tastes very good 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.880
 and the sweet potato also contains none 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.760
 anti-nutrients in the form of lek thielen 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.860
 lectins are similar to gluten 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.450
 they can damage the intestinal walls and 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.610
 ineffective we are so the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.470
 Benefits of sweet potato and as I said 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.060
 But they are something culinary 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.950
 not unlike the potato, the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.200
 will know Germany and what can 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.790
 you actually do everything you want 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.680
 the normal potato can do too 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.120
 that she is a bit sweet 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.940
 Do not take it easy as a consultant 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.590
 use or as baked potatoes one 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.410
 can do a lot more with it 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.700
 because of this slightly sweetish aroma one 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.800
 can be for many desserts and cake 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.300
 use is very interesting very much 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.850
 so versatile indeed 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.220
 more versatile than those in Germany 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.600
 common potato it grows with us 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.190
 not that is a pity she is one 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.540
 import product and there must be as always 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.100
 Everyone decides whether or not he can do it 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.200
 I can find the answer there 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.040
 a very nice way the sweet potato 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.720
 know 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.490
 the first time prepared a very 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.290
 easy preparation by the man 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.940
 really easy to see how it tastes 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.070
 this potato and let's take a look 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.630
 now on 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.510
 First of all, the oven at 200 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.920
 Pre-heat degrees celsius 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.630
 that they are the sweet potatoes these 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.340
 I just cut open lengthwise 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.830
 this will enlarge the surface 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.470
 you get a uniform even 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.630
 Sometimes you have to look at the result 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.910
 and if they have lain longer what 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.800
 when importing is not unusual 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.060
 they turn a little firmer woody 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.280
 they actually taste good too 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.500
 not so good at this one 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.820
 That may not be the case 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.680
 you can use it to smear mother with it 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.720
 or with olive oil that's a bit easier 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.340
 when life is already fluid 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.340
 tastes both 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:55.420
 then with a little salt pepper and 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.140
 to taste with garlic 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:03.069
 season and then put on a grate 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.970
 then put this for 30 to 40 minutes 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.730
 in the hot oven behind 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.439
 The potatoes then look so nice 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.420
 baked so you can get them out of the 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.660
 spoon or slice into slices 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.370
 or small press that as you like 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.680
 fit all sorts of rumors that it 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.510
 their much-cited versatility 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.330
 the potato also for the 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.860
 sweet potato is in this case for 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.860
 for example, red cabbage and meatloaf 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:37.389
 that was my short presentation of the 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.199
 sweet potato my favorite roll around 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.000
 to be honest 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.590
 it contains similar to the white one 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.199
 Potato which spread in Germany 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.060
 potato around 20 percent carbs 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.680
 in the form of strength who sport so much 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.110
 drives or works hard physically 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.879
 can become so very effective and delicious 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.800
 I can only supply with glucose 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.810
 guess the sweet potato times 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.460
 to try out how it really tastes 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.199
 fantastic and it never hurts his 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.169
 to expand culinary houses 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.759
 Have fun while enjoying your meal 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.030
 thanks for watching and until the next 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.030
 times
