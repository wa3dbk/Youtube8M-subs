00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello friends welcome to a new appointment 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.649
 with our beloved chess in this 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.170
 occasion we will have a position is a 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.840
 beautiful position with some resources 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.020
 tactics of network destruction 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.480
 refuge of pawns on both sides I think 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.750
 that you will like a lot on the part of 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 Black is a very simple position 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.960
 to solve and if you happen to move the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.019
 white is a bit harder but 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.020
 very beautiful and with a little practice 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.020
 as well 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.200
 easy but fine for the video try 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.160
 analyze for you the position if not 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.310
 You know, I'll explain it to you right now if 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.370
 touch move the black is worth the play 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:53.480
 correct of blacks would be sacrifice 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.220
 of tower destroying the refuge of the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:02.600
 pawns that protect the king 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:05.520
 tower for 2 is worth and now the threat 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.980
 evidently to any play of the 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.180
 black of the white that is not eating the 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.050
 tower the next black play is check 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050
 mate and so much 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.040
 with 1 checkmate tower as it counted 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.410
 1 checkmate is worth 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.260
 with which White does not have left 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.840
 no choice but to capture the king tower 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.840
 unemployed and now the black ones with 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.110
 tower 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.650
 to 8 check that White has to go back 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.510
 to go back and now the black tower 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.140
 tip checkmate the aura 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.140
 we return to the position 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.910
 and now if you have to move to the white 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.640
 they also have a tactical resource 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.480
 to win the game and they should not 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.480
 neglect because 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.050
 thank you they have checkmate we have already 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.820
 seen in two moves so the action 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.110
 of white has to be blunt 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.770
 and very and very forceful because it would be the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.930
 Take the right move, then sacrifice 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.799
 of tower tower by 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.799
 g7 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.200
 Okay, now you will say to me well then 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.290
 it seems that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.349
 that can continue checkmate the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 black they had but if tower by a 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.410
 two for the next checkmate 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.900
 comes 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.180
 tower by h 7 since the king can not 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.930
 capture the tower because obviously 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.940
 is defended by the bishop and neither 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.190
 can capture with the horse because 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.950
 obviously this horse is nailed 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.190
 for this white bishop and can not 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.090
 capture the tower with which the blacks 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.760
 they have to do king g8 still not him 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.840
 have given not given him time to do the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.500
 Checkmate and now Lady G3 and the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.870
 blacks have no choice but to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.410
 cover with the horse with the jump of 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.920
 horse and now White has 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.470
 a checkmate in one very well had in 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.580
 and if you want to give it very quickly 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:42.920
 because the correct movement is tower h 8 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:46.760
 checkmate is protected by the bishop 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.530
 they could also give it to the lady lady or 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:56.989
 Jorge 4 would cover himself with the bishop and lady 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.390
 by g5 a little bit longer just for 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.760
 that you can see that you can also find 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.040
 the lady although I already tell you that the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.410
 correct movement is from the tower the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.640
 we return to the position where white 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.640
 capture with the tower 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.940
 here 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.960
 let's not make a mistake of position because 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.960
 then we would 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.140
 we see that it is not possible when 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.969
 we captured with the g7 tower come to give 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.000
 Checkmate then wings 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:42.580
 Blacks practically 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.090
 before this move that we have commented on 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.970
 good sacrifice of the capture of ph 7 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.300
 they have no choice but to capture the 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.030
 tower 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.539
 who have sacrificed white now 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.610
 the white lady g4 check the lady is not 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.510
 can capture because the horse returns 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.230
 to be nailed 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:08.660
 king h 8 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:10.670
 Lady 5 and practically wings 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.320
 blacks have to leave because the 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.240
 threat of 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.240
 of lady 7 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.780
 Checkmate could not capture with the 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.720
 horse 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.190
 because he is nailed by the asylum another 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.700
 time 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.020
 the teacher defended by the bishop 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.220
 White 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.110
 so Black does not have any more 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.819
 remedy to leave or they can capture 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.009
 this bishop loses the lady already 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.009
 below all the memories come 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.699
 or they could also do king g7 vale but 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.210
 that's not enough because I wanted to forgive 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.090
 say king g8 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:00.580
 would come lady 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:04.240
 h 6 and now nobody can save them 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:10.250
 of what is coming the threat is 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:12.860
 bishop for h 7 bone or capture this 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.530
 bishop and lose the lady and lose the 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.690
 departure or if you try any other 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.350
 played for example checkmate this 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.950
 who have here simply the 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:28.440
 threat 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:33.510
 is checkmate because at last by check h7 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:37.350
 and now if horse by h7 leaves 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:40.520
 large open diagonal for the lady who 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.520
 finish with a checkmate 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.080
 and yes 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.250
 king h 8 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.250
 Well, simply 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.100
 with bishop by efe 6 check 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.889
 blacks have no choice but to do 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.159
 by 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:07.240
 by efe 6 and now the speaker would finish 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:09.719
 with a precise checkmate of bishop g6 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.719
 check 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:15.030
 stecyl can not be captured because it 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:20.910
 are giving check white 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:24.450
 king g8 and the white top as lady h 7 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:28.080
 Checkmate good friends, well, if you have 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:30.960
 liked this beautiful video with these 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:35.300
 great plays do I like and we 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.300
 we see in the following greetings to all
