00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.150
 stroke mechanics 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.269
 What would it be like to throw 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.299
 a ball a tip toe relationship 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:18.869
 knee hip shoulder keep flexed 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.980
 not lower arm near the racket tale 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.869
 high poll 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.939
 this would be an initial stance for you 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 get hit 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.710
 so at the beginning we recommend the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 person did what simply to do the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.199
 that this high spin the racket 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.360
 back 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.030
 he will worry only after hitting 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.710
 in the ball a second stage we go 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.030
 try to work on this g 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.800
 after we already know the position 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 you already know how to give the money and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 put the racket back 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.309
 the next point of the beat and acqua there 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.199
 that's what people call if you 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.210
 hit a formation that you would have to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.660
 with the palm of your hand and then the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 Brazil makes you follow the ball and make 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.750
 here is the rotation of the shoulder elbow and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750
 Doll 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.119
 you would place that pen on the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.330
 now you know how to do this exercise 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.100
 You know which is the time you hit 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.509
 a ball in front of your body and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.149
 ends the movement up here that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.930
 you hit came with the second ball 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:36.710
 sequence would be you from split 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:41.759
 there the money of the palace and hit the ball 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.800
 I down and hit a ball 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.679
 the movement of legs in sneakers is 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.450
 very important we end up 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.470
 moved the feet much more than the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.300
 arm 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 so I 'm going to give you some exercises now 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.679
 to show you 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.420
 this is an important detail for 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.950
 train to anticipate when the ball 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.300
 pinged on your court 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.300
