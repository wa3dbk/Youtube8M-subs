 It's good to win today, I'll show you 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:14.690
 here how to set up the 3g in cinema box 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.100
 whether it be with lining I see things in which the 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.189
 my fantasy 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.990
 so using in 3g mode on mk fp I use 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:26.329
 also on cable and internet from 2 to 5 megs 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.029
 there is another 3g here we have internet 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.230
 clear simple is that of 60 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.180
 cents per day 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.550
 so it's very simple but it's running 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.829
 cool but when you lock it because the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.829
 sign here from home does not get legal clear 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.829

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:52.429

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.719

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.200

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.420

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.470

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:55.340

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:13.310
 of its clear and clear access control

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:35.860
 the channels that the band liked very much and I 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.860

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.890
 The cable does not always take a hundred, but you 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:11.600
 do not touch the cable rj notice using the order 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:17.830
 in which the team keeps rolling 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.830
 calm of class
