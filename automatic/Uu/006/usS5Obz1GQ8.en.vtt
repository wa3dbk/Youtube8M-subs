guide line to show the center of the
face<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.499> we'll<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.550> another<00:00:41.820> cross<00:00:42.329> line

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
face and we'll do another cross line

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.430 
face and we'll do another cross line
where<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.199> eyes<00:00:43.350> might<00:00:43.769> go<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:45.120> nose<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.839> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
where the eyes might go the nose and the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.970 
where the eyes might go the nose and the
mouth<00:00:47.179> you<00:00:48.179> want<00:00:48.359> to<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.749> divide<00:00:49.469> your<00:00:49.710> face

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
mouth you want to just divide your face

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.610 
mouth you want to just divide your face
up<00:00:50.309> into<00:00:50.850> three<00:00:51.120> sections<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.289> you'll<00:00:52.440> have

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
up into three sections so you'll have

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.219 
up into three sections so you'll have
your<00:00:52.800> hairline<00:00:53.339> here<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.929> we'll<00:00:55.050> add

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
your hairline here actually we'll add

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.110 
your hairline here actually we'll add
one<00:00:55.499> more<00:00:55.530> line<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.159> where<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.729> hairline

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
one more line in where the hairline

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.719 
one more line in where the hairline
would<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> would<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.309> three

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
would go and then you would have three

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.559 
would go and then you would have three
equal<00:01:00.120> parts<00:01:01.489> then<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.789> start<00:01:03.120> working<00:01:03.329> on

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
equal parts then we can start working on

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:05.750 
equal parts then we can start working on
the<00:01:03.749> eyes<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.800> eyes<00:01:04.949> are<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> be

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the eyes so the eyes are going to be

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.499 
the eyes so the eyes are going to be
kind<00:01:06.120> of<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.540> oval<00:01:07.229> shapes<00:01:08.930> oval<00:01:09.930> shapes<00:01:11.509> and

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
kind of like oval shapes oval shapes and

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.600 
kind of like oval shapes oval shapes and
then<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.710> circles<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> eyes

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
then you can do the circles and the eyes

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.350 
then you can do the circles and the eyes
and<00:01:16.219> then<00:01:17.219> we<00:01:17.430> would<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:18.060> bit<00:01:18.329> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and then we would have a little bit of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.109 
and then we would have a little bit of
an<00:01:18.570> eyebrow<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:20.219> arched<00:01:20.579> eyebrows

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
an eyebrow just little arched eyebrows

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.749 
an eyebrow just little arched eyebrows
and<00:01:22.079> then<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.289> couple<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.710> little<00:01:23.039> lines<00:01:23.250> just

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and then a couple of little lines just

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.179 
and then a couple of little lines just
to<00:01:23.969> define<00:01:24.360> where<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.960> lids<00:01:25.380> would<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:28.189> then

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to define where the lids would go then

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.800 
to define where the lids would go then
we'll<00:01:29.340> start<00:01:29.549> working<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> nose<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.630> we'll

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
we'll start working on the nose so we'll

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
we'll start working on the nose so we'll
bring<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.409> bit<00:01:31.649> of<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.860> line<00:01:32.100> down<00:01:32.430> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
bring a little bit of a line down and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.289 
bring a little bit of a line down and
then<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> little<00:01:33.960> bit<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.619> curved<00:01:34.890> line<00:01:35.299> for

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
then a little bit of a curved line for

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
then a little bit of a curved line for
the<00:01:36.390> nose<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:39.649> then<00:01:40.649> we'll<00:01:41.159> work<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the nose and then we'll work on the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.359 
the nose and then we'll work on the
mouth<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.270> you'll<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.539> do<00:01:42.990> two<00:01:43.920> more<00:01:44.159> little

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
mouth so you'll just do two more little

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.490 
mouth so you'll just do two more little
curved<00:01:44.700> lines<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.990> curl<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
curved lines like this kind of curl the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.719 
curved lines like this kind of curl the
ends<00:01:46.799> up<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.130> ends<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.729> lips<00:01:49.609> bring<00:01:50.609> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
ends up at the ends of the lips bring it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.789 
ends up at the ends of the lips bring it
down<00:01:50.969> and<00:01:51.359> then<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.810> bring<00:01:52.109> a<00:01:52.380> little

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
down and then you can bring a little

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.859 
down and then you can bring a little
line<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> middle<00:01:53.700> center<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> mouth

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
line for the middle center of the mouth

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.099 
line for the middle center of the mouth
like<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:57.149> some<00:01:57.420> lines<00:01:57.659> coming

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
like this and then some lines coming

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.580 
like this and then some lines coming
down<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.880> might<00:02:00.030> want<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.359> draw<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
down you might want to draw at this

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
down you might want to draw at this
point<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.159> couple<00:02:02.640> little<00:02:02.789> lines<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.630> neck

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
point a couple little lines for the neck

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.289 
point a couple little lines for the neck
and<00:02:04.560> then<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.369> start<00:02:05.609> working<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and then we can start working on the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.389 
and then we can start working on the
hair<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.380> hair<00:02:07.560> doesn't<00:02:07.829> need<00:02:08.070> to<00:02:08.220> be

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
hair and the hair doesn't need to be

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.740 
hair and the hair doesn't need to be
that<00:02:08.670> difficult<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:10.410> could<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
that difficult you could just do a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.039 
that difficult you could just do a
series<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:13.159> swirly<00:02:14.159> lines

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
series of swirly lines

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.959 
series of swirly lines
maybe<00:02:17.049> have<00:02:17.349> some<00:02:17.379> hair<00:02:17.769> coming<00:02:18.099> down<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:18.790> a

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
maybe have some hair coming down here a

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.920 
maybe have some hair coming down here a
little<00:02:19.359> bit<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.900> line<00:02:20.109> for<00:02:20.439> the<00:02:20.530> ear<00:02:21.930> some

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
little bit of a line for the ear some

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.130 
little bit of a line for the ear some
hair<00:02:23.170> coming<00:02:23.709> up<00:02:23.890> here<00:02:24.400> come<00:02:25.209> down<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.900> just

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
hair coming up here come down and just

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.899 
hair coming up here come down and just
think<00:02:26.230> about<00:02:26.560> where<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.099> hairline<00:02:27.489> would<00:02:27.730> be

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
think about where the hairline would be

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.059 
think about where the hairline would be
and<00:02:28.180> again<00:02:28.750> keeping<00:02:29.109> in<00:02:29.230> mind<00:02:29.439> remembering

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
and again keeping in mind remembering

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.770 
and again keeping in mind remembering
that<00:02:30.189> you<00:02:30.370> would<00:02:30.519> normally<00:02:31.060> go<00:02:31.239> back<00:02:31.450> and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
that you would normally go back and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.009 
that you would normally go back and
erase<00:02:32.049> these<00:02:32.439> guidelines<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.870> they

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
erase these guidelines because they

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.309 
erase these guidelines because they
would<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.349> done<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.739> pencil<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:37.170> we'll<00:02:38.170> add

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
would be done in pencil and we'll add

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.500 
would be done in pencil and we'll add
just<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.739> couple<00:02:38.980> more<00:02:39.280> lines<00:02:39.609> another<00:02:40.180> line

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
just a couple more lines another line

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.080 
just a couple more lines another line
here<00:02:40.870> for<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.230> ear<00:02:42.090> line<00:02:43.090> here<00:02:44.700> few<00:02:45.700> more

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
here for the ear line here few more

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.589 
here for the ear line here few more
spikes<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.810> hair<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.849> that's<00:02:49.060> how<00:02:49.299> you<00:02:49.359> would

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
spikes of hair and that's how you would

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.200 
spikes of hair and that's how you would
draw<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.870> face
