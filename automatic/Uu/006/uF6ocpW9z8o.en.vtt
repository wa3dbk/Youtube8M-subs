talking about the galaxy's to andrea's
recently<00:00:29.220> then<00:00:29.400> oh<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> US<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.539> now

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
recently then oh in the US and now

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.200 
recently then oh in the US and now
they're<00:00:30.869> coming<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.320> two<00:00:31.560> new<00:00:31.920> versions

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
they're coming with two new versions

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.729 
they're coming with two new versions
that's<00:00:33.210> only<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> right<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.440> well<00:00:34.590> in

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that's only in the right now so well in

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.319 
that's only in the right now so well in
Korea<00:00:35.180> but<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.630> first<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:38.280> galaxy<00:00:38.790> s2

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
Korea but the first one is the galaxy s2

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.760 
Korea but the first one is the galaxy s2
LTE<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.559> obviously<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.210> an<00:00:42.840> LTE<00:00:43.350> device

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
LTE and obviously that is an LTE device

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.490 
LTE and obviously that is an LTE device
so<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.399> will<00:00:44.610> get<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.420> 40<00:00:45.719> HP<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.110> nothing

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
so you will get like 40 HP is nothing

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.470 
so you will get like 40 HP is nothing
and<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.789> locate<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and that one is here on locate on the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.240 
and that one is here on locate on the
left<00:00:48.719> side<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.770> they<00:00:49.860> got<00:00:50.010> more

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
left side you can see that they got more

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.760 
left side you can see that they got more
around<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> edges<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.629> compare<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
around the edges if we compare it to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.369 
around the edges if we compare it to
this<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.610> bad<00:00:53.850> boy<00:00:54.059> which<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.840> basically

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this other bad boy which is basically

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
this other bad boy which is basically
the<00:00:55.649> galaxy<00:00:56.340> s2<00:00:56.899> HD<00:00:57.899> LT<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.699> basically

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the galaxy s2 HD LT now that basically

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.880 
the galaxy s2 HD LT now that basically
means<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.899> comes<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.379> much<00:01:01.649> higher

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
means that it comes with a much higher

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.679 
means that it comes with a much higher
resolution<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.750> 1280<00:01:03.750> x<00:01:04.350> 720<00:01:05.220> resolution<00:01:05.689> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
resolution at 1280 x 720 resolution and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.929 
resolution at 1280 x 720 resolution and
HD<00:01:07.650> resolution<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> super<00:01:09.360> amoled<00:01:09.750> screen

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
HD resolution on a super amoled screen

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.490 
HD resolution on a super amoled screen
4.65<00:01:12.619> 465<00:01:13.619> inch<00:01:13.979> screen<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.869> kind<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.170> insane

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
4.65 465 inch screen it's kind of insane

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
4.65 465 inch screen it's kind of insane
and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.640> think<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.759> HD

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and I think that I think that this HD

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.520 
and I think that I think that this HD
phone<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.490> galaxy<00:01:23.490> s2<00:01:23.810> HD<00:01:24.810> LTE<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
phone in the galaxy s2 HD LTE have a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
phone in the galaxy s2 HD LTE have a
little<00:01:25.860> big<00:01:26.009> screen<00:01:26.400> comparing<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
little big screen comparing to the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.370 
little big screen comparing to the
galaxy<00:01:27.810> s2<00:01:28.049> LTE<00:01:28.880> but<00:01:29.880> seriously<00:01:30.240> 1280<00:01:30.810> x<00:01:30.990> 720

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
galaxy s2 LTE but seriously 1280 x 720

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.460 
galaxy s2 LTE but seriously 1280 x 720
so<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.159> 720<00:01:32.790> resolution<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> galaxy<00:01:34.110> s2

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so it's 720 resolution on the galaxy s2

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.899 
so it's 720 resolution on the galaxy s2
HD<00:01:35.070> LTE<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.420> pretty<00:01:37.320> goddamn<00:01:37.740> awesome

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
HD LTE that is pretty goddamn awesome

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.090 
HD LTE that is pretty goddamn awesome
you<00:01:38.909> should<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.329> about<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:40.200> about<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
you should know about all about the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.819 
you should know about all about the
stacks<00:01:41.340> already<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:43.020> they're<00:01:43.350> probably<00:01:43.590> some

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
stacks already but they're probably some

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.550 
stacks already but they're probably some
machine<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.369> say<00:01:44.640> i<00:01:44.970> think<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.840> big<00:01:46.049> machine<00:01:46.320> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
machine just say i think a big machine I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.649 
machine just say i think a big machine I
mean<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.250> obviously<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> specs<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.630> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
mean the obviously the specs are kind of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.010 
mean the obviously the specs are kind of
the<00:01:48.720> same<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> galaxy<00:01:49.770> s2<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:51.180> but

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the same to the galaxy s2 right now but

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.539 
the same to the galaxy s2 right now but
with<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.439> big<00:01:52.649> screen<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> probably<00:01:53.369> get<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
with this big screen you probably get a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.280 
with this big screen you probably get a
little<00:01:53.759> bigger<00:01:53.909> battery<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.170> bit

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
little bigger battery and a little bit

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.709 
little bigger battery and a little bit
processor<00:01:55.860> processor<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> 1.5

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
processor processor here we get a 1.5

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.510 
processor processor here we get a 1.5
gigahertz<00:01:57.899> dual-core<00:01:58.200> processor<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.189> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
gigahertz dual-core processor and I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
gigahertz dual-core processor and I
think<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.360> overclocked<00:02:00.899> Calchas

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
think you can like overclocked Calchas

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.039 
think you can like overclocked Calchas
22<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.939> sure<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.960> be

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
22 that but sure if it's going to be

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
22 that but sure if it's going to be
stable<00:02:04.290> clock<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.460> get<00:02:05.610> stable

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
stable clock but here you can get stable

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.479 
stable clock but here you can get stable
with<00:02:06.299> five-year<00:02:06.750> game<00:02:07.020> from<00:02:07.229> 145<00:02:07.890> years<00:02:08.129> dual
