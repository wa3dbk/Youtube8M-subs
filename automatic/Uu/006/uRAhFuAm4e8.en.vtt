00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 good guys today I 'm going to bring you a 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.240
 small tutorial so that we wake up 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.140
 our engine or the motorcycle that with the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.480
 volume keys 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.800
 several things you have to have the module 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.750
 purposely blocked 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.510
 you have to be a root user and you have to have 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.730
 installed the application x has for 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.529
 better that is this incognito that we will see 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.550
 down here 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.550
 to see if he focuses the camera 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.150
 It is this track next puzzle 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.740
 Youtube 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.480
 and we would need this why why 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.739
 we open this we leave 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.559
 these options you see first if when not 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.820
 we do not can download for free so much 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.710
 by google chrome like from the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.210
 computer and just the only thing that 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.329
 we have to do is give frank the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.460
 word 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.910
 and install I'm not going to give because I 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.160
 I have installed 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.970
 and once this law is restarted jce 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.940
 the device when the rays 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.710
 we go back to the application and here where 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.770
 puts downloads 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.270
 let's look for gravity bot and the double k 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 which would mean kitkat we would give 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.619
 and we just slide and unload 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.869
 once we have it downloaded what 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.510
 we install with one application or another 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.120
 application any 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:32.310
 and this icon will appear 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.400
 that we will see it here next to google + and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.150
 google hangout 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.190
 this is the east that is up if you 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.840
 dais you are not going to be able to open it because 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.870
 because we have to give it first 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.200
 module permissions what we will do then 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.200
 we just go to x own 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.570
 and where it puts modules we will all 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.009
 those that we have downloaded simply 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.310
 all we have is to use the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.939
 option is this and it will ask us to restart 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.130
 the phone when we restart already 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.200
 we will be inside this application or 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.630
 be down to this application and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.360
 we can select it and we 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.880
 we will find with these menus little to 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.220
 I will be doing little videos so we can see 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.200
 sorry we discovered a little bit the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.120
 functions of each of them but what 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.810
 what we have to do is from below where 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.150
 put actions on navigation buttons 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.010
 we see that all of these are the menus that 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.620
 we can enable read these three buttons 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.319
 below touch time simply 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.220
 we look for the volume and here below 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.739
 we see that he wakes up with buttons from the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.200
 default volume will be disabled 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.810
 all we have to do is to 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.230
 activate it reactivated we leave for another 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.349
 we restart the device 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.090
 and as you can see , just by pressing the 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.510
 low volume key 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.120
 is already unlocked is not winning and 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.180
 of grown-ups and awakened and if we press the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.930
 volume button up 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.200
 same 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.630
 You see then, it's simple, so we are not button 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.910
 If we have also lost the warranty already 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.640
 it does not cover us and so on, there we have it 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.270
 I hope I have served you and see you 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.270
 in the next video
