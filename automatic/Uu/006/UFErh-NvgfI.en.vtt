and<00:04:31.730> you<00:04:32.480> can<00:04:32.630> do<00:04:32.720> with<00:04:32.870> it<00:04:32.900> what<00:04:33.200> you<00:04:33.230> want<00:04:33.650> so

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
and you can do with it what you want so

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.270 
and you can do with it what you want so
you<00:04:34.310> have<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.610> find<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:35.000> balance<00:04:35.270> between

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
you have to find that balance between

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.740 
you have to find that balance between
keeping<00:04:37.280> your<00:04:37.550> subscribers<00:04:38.030> happy<00:04:38.390> but<00:04:38.660> at

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
keeping your subscribers happy but at

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.540 
keeping your subscribers happy but at
the<00:04:38.810> same<00:04:38.990> time<00:04:39.169> keeping<00:04:39.470> yourself<00:04:39.950> happy<00:04:40.340> and

the same time keeping yourself happy and

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.360 
the same time keeping yourself happy and
I<00:04:40.820> believe<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.090> once<00:04:41.390> you<00:04:41.480> can<00:04:41.660> do<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:41.840> then

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
I believe that once you can do that then

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.530 
I believe that once you can do that then
you'll<00:04:43.370> find<00:04:43.700> more<00:04:43.970> success<00:04:44.120> with<00:04:44.390> your
