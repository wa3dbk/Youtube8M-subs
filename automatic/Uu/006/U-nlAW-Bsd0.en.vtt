tale
that<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:07.020> personally<00:00:07.890> use<00:00:08.280> every<00:00:09.059> time<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.719> use<00:00:10.290> a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
that I personally use every time I use a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.910 
that I personally use every time I use a
cucumber<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.719> lately<00:00:12.719> every<00:00:13.349> time<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.830> do

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
cucumber and lately every time that I do

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.450 
cucumber and lately every time that I do
it

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
it

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.939 
it
I<00:00:14.490> keep<00:00:15.030> thinking<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.509> myself<00:00:15.660> why<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.800> that

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
I keep thinking to myself why is it that

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.790 
I keep thinking to myself why is it that
we<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.900> something<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.230> found<00:00:19.500> really

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
we do this something that I found really

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.340 
we do this something that I found really
interesting<00:00:20.130> lately<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.230> discovering<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
interesting lately is discovering the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.400 
interesting lately is discovering the
reasons<00:00:22.769> why<00:00:23.070> old<00:00:23.699> house<00:00:24.119> wives<00:00:24.449> tales<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
reasons why old house wives tales and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.450 
reasons why old house wives tales and
things<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.920> learned<00:00:26.160> from<00:00:26.279> your

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
things that you learned from your

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.880 
things that you learned from your
grandmother<00:00:27.060> work<00:00:27.420> we're<00:00:28.109> discovering<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
grandmother work we're discovering the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.529 
grandmother work we're discovering the
science<00:00:29.250> behind<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> that's<00:00:30.240> really

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
science behind it now and that's really

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.900 
science behind it now and that's really
cool<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> things<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.730> haven't

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
cool but one of the things we haven't

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970 
cool but one of the things we haven't
quite<00:00:33.210> figured<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.719> yet<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.290> seems<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> me

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
quite figured out yet it seems to me

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.639 
quite figured out yet it seems to me
anyway<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.640> whether<00:00:36.540> cutting<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> tip<00:00:37.440> off

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
anyway is whether cutting the tip off

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.520 
anyway is whether cutting the tip off
the<00:00:37.680> end<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> cucumber<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.170> rubbing<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the end of a cucumber and rubbing is the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.720 
the end of a cucumber and rubbing is the
removed<00:00:40.860> part<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.989> big<00:00:43.200> part<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.890> that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
removed part on the big part if that

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.970 
removed part on the big part if that
actually<00:00:45.149> takes<00:00:45.390> out<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> bitterness<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
actually takes out the bitterness from a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.549 
actually takes out the bitterness from a
cucumber<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.180> I'll<00:00:48.510> show<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.780> exactly<00:00:49.230> what<00:00:49.530> I

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
cucumber so I'll show you exactly what I

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.830 
cucumber so I'll show you exactly what I
mean<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.550> may<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.969> too<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> know

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
exactly what I'm talking about cut off

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.099 
exactly what I'm talking about cut off
the<00:00:54.960> tip<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> cucumber<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.660> rub<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> in

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the tip of the cucumber and I rub it in

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.049 
the tip of the cucumber and I rub it in
a<00:00:58.170> circular<00:00:58.620> motion<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:59.010> this<00:01:01.879> now<00:01:02.879> what's

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
a circular motion like this now what's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.390 
a circular motion like this now what's
happening<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.619> looks<00:01:04.920> almost<00:01:05.159> like

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
happening here is it looks almost like

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.740 
happening here is it looks almost like
saliva<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.780> coming<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.380> spit<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.750> it's

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
saliva is coming out like spit it's it's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.420 
saliva is coming out like spit it's it's
foamy<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> white<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:13.290> leaves<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.040> rim

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
foamy and white and it leaves just a rim

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.530 
foamy and white and it leaves just a rim
of<00:01:14.700> nastiness<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> rabid<00:01:16.920> cucumber

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
of nastiness like a rabid cucumber

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.920 
of nastiness like a rabid cucumber
attacking<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.720> hands<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> wipe<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
attacking your hands so you wipe that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.289 
attacking your hands so you wipe that
off<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.710> hypothetically<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.090> did

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
off and hypothetically what I just did

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.999 
off and hypothetically what I just did
there<00:01:24.360> according<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> learned<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
there according to what I learned when I

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.890 
there according to what I learned when I
was<00:01:26.100> young<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.210> removed<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
was young is I just removed all the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.980 
was young is I just removed all the
bitterness<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.799> cucumber<00:01:29.869> now<00:01:30.869> if

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
bitterness out of this cucumber now if

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.020 
bitterness out of this cucumber now if
you<00:01:31.110> look<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.409> online<00:01:31.829> does<00:01:32.430> doing<00:01:32.850> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you look up online does doing this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
you look up online does doing this
removes<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> bitterness<00:01:34.020> there's<00:01:34.320> two

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
removes the bitterness there's two

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:35.690 
removes the bitterness there's two
schools<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.430> thought

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
schools of thought

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
schools of thought
one<00:01:36.030> says<00:01:36.299> absolutely<00:01:37.020> yes<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.680> all

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
one says absolutely yes I do this all

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.130 
one says absolutely yes I do this all
the<00:01:37.920> time<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.970> other<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.299> says<00:01:39.509> no<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the time the other one says no that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.190 
the time the other one says no that
makes<00:01:40.350> no<00:01:40.560> sense<00:01:40.590> whatsoever<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> bitterness

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
makes no sense whatsoever the bitterness

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.429 
makes no sense whatsoever the bitterness
tasting<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.100> because<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.149> an<00:01:45.240> enzyme<00:01:45.810> that's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
tasting is because of an enzyme that's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.580 
tasting is because of an enzyme that's
present<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.640> cucumber<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.380> can't

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
present in the cucumber and you can't

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.499 
present in the cucumber and you can't
remove<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.009> by<00:01:50.159> doing<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:51.270> there's

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
remove it by doing that then there's

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.289 
remove it by doing that then there's
also<00:01:51.689> some<00:01:52.049> folks<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.619> say<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.090> cut

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
also some folks that say that if you cut

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.590 
also some folks that say that if you cut
off<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.960> stem<00:01:55.290> side<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:56.820> will<00:01:57.060> work<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.479> you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
off the stem side that will work if you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080 
off the stem side that will work if you
cut<00:01:57.810> off<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.140> blossom<00:01:58.619> side<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.670> will<00:01:59.880> work

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
cut off the blossom side that will work

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.660 
cut off the blossom side that will work
so<00:02:00.710> what<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:01.829> doing<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.549> I'm

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
so what I'm doing right now is I'm
