first moments I remember I when I went
underwater<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.840> realized<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.950> there<00:02:29.099> is

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
underwater I realized that there is

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.210 
underwater I realized that there is
something<00:02:29.580> very<00:02:30.150> special<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.900> what<00:02:31.440> world

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
something very special that what world

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.339 
something very special that what world
is<00:02:32.489> different<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:35.599> special<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.989> it's

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
is different is special and it's

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.940 
is different is special and it's
impressive

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
impressive

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.640 
impressive
plus<00:02:38.190> there<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.489> challenge<00:02:38.940> always<00:02:39.650> but

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
plus there is a challenge always but

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.770 
plus there is a challenge always but
surely<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.519> biggest<00:02:41.730> challenge<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.720> that

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
surely the biggest challenge is that

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.360 
surely the biggest challenge is that
this<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.920> grand<00:02:44.160> canal<00:02:44.549> in<00:02:45.110> February
