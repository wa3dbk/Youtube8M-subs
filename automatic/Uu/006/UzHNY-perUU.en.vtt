00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
video well in this slow motion video you

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.970 
video well in this slow motion video you
can<00:00:19.699> see<00:00:19.880> very<00:00:20.060> clearly<00:00:20.449> a<00:00:20.779> right<00:00:21.410> leg<00:00:21.650> of<00:00:21.830> a

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
can see very clearly a right leg of a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.460 
can see very clearly a right leg of a
right<00:00:22.010> um<00:00:22.369> fast<00:00:22.699> bowler<00:00:23.000> is<00:00:23.539> clearly<00:00:23.900> stepping

right um fast bowler is clearly stepping

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.980 
right um fast bowler is clearly stepping
behind<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:25.340> ball<00:00:25.820> increase<00:00:26.210> which<00:00:26.869> is

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
behind the ball increase which is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.820 
behind the ball increase which is
nothing<00:00:27.199> but<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.680> a<00:00:27.890> back<00:00:28.369> leg

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830

now let's learn what actually is a
written<00:00:45.300> crease<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.839> how<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.649> deals<00:00:46.949> with<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
written crease and how it deals with the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.479 
written crease and how it deals with the
back

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.299 

well<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.079> picture<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:53.010> very

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
well in this picture you can see very

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.060 
well in this picture you can see very
clearly<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:54.180> big<00:00:54.960> straight<00:00:55.350> line<00:00:55.590> which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
clearly a big straight line which is of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.200 
clearly a big straight line which is of
two<00:00:56.280> 44<00:00:56.730> centimeters<00:00:57.230> just<00:00:58.230> parallel<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.769> wide

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
two 44 centimeters just parallel to wide

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
two 44 centimeters just parallel to wide
joining<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> popping<00:01:00.660> crease<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.110> bowling

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
joining the popping crease and bowling

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.460 
joining the popping crease and bowling
crease<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.219> nothing<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> rate<00:01:03.540> increase

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
crease is nothing but the rate increase

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.170 
crease is nothing but the rate increase
so<00:01:06.470> what<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.100> batted<00:01:07.580> Noble<00:01:09.310> well<00:01:10.310> if<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.880> back
