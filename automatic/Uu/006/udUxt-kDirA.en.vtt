00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.319
 or not 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.719
 and 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.770
 in this recharging we have chrono 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.810
 trigger a game of 95 that was 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.000
 developed and published by square aura 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.560
 square enix the title is a rpg that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.270
 originally came out for the super 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.929
 nintendo and later in versions for 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.369
 the playstation nintendo 10 ios and android 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.840
 this game is considered by many the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.879
 best of all time and there is a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.290
 sustenance behind that affirmation 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.290
 chrono trigger was the most 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.390
 sold in 1995 and the credits include 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.239
 to three well-known legendary designers 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.670
 as the wing team johor and creator of 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 dragon quest akira toriyama known for 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.960
 his work in rare dragon ball poll 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.449
 and hironobu sakaguchi creator of the series 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.770
 final fantasy chrono trigger 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.090
 develops in a world similar to the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.829
 Earth and the characters travel 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.539
 constantly through time to 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.219
 get new team to be allies 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.960
 simply to advance the story 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.220
 that show the disasters that occur 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 when the time has been altered 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.880
 then the times that can be 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 visit are a similar to the middle ages 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.649
 where there are knights royalty and magic 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.420
 and another similar to a dystopian future and 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.210
 post apocalyptic where there is so much 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.680
 humans as robots in total there are seven 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.390
 characters that you can play and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.159
 they belong to the different 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.460
 in order are chrono mal and luca robbery 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.869
 rock and magos RodrÃ­guez was a game 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.550
 huge for its time and can 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.190
 considered one of the ancestors of what 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.930
 which is the genre rpg now although there 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.729
 so many amazing things about this title 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.490
 our favorite part are the details 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.560
 in itself each era is very well defined 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.300
 and has its own essence as well as the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.130
 they also have the characters by 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.930
 example if the future is dystopian and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 terrible the average age is everything 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.360
 opposite and if chrome silent she is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.070
 totally chaotic besides this the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 game is so detailed that it has 13 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.240
 possible late 14 in the version for 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.100
 10 and the result depends on how 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.780
 moment the player has arrived at the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.940
 final battle and what he has done in 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 her although the graphs are in 2d and 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.209
 they are very basic compared to what 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.440
 what is done now the truth is that the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.320
 level of detail they had seems 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.489
 time was more than impressive 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.959
 we come to the end of recharging by the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.580
 next wednesday we will return with what 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.920
 better from another video game greetings to 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.690
 larry arturo navarro iker see you 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.070
 they wanted to see this game recharged 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.080
 like chrono trigger what 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.910
 consider the best rpg
