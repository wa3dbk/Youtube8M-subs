00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 very good guys this is called william 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.520
 and presented the like I'm where 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.200
 they taught one of new assaults that 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.330
 will come the battleship of origin of taking 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.950
 king in this live cinema unlike 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.660
 last week they did not give many 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.160
 things mainly showed all the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.260
 skills of the three not their classes 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.390
 the artifacts finally involved what 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.670
 they are and what they do and the rest was more 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.470
 that everything that prevent new assault and more 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.390
 forward not to relive their classes but 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.680
 with respect to the artifacts these in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.599
 a completely new edition for 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.250
 our arsenal are like objects 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 specific to each class and just like 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.460
 the armors have defense so 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 will affect the light of our 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.969
 character and we'll have to get one of 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.129
 more quantity to increase our light 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.559
 for now we only know artifacts 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.510
 rare but also and legendary this 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.430
 edit is called the striped sheet comes 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.170
 with discipline and strength an ability 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.579
 to increase one of these two and another 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.320
 skill that reaches us and generate 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.449
 orbs of light when defeating enemies with 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.370
 melee of sun damage according to 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.750
 bongi all the artifacts will come with 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.750
 skills to generate orbs of light 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.129
 with thousand grenades and others at the head is 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.829
 possible that the legendary look with 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.180
 more skills even the artifacts and the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.250
 skills of his classes are what 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.990
 they mainly revealed this lighting 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.730
 later in the assault it was also seen 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.370
 for very little time gameplay of one of 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.390
 the players using a sword this 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.040
 it's a legendary weapon that goes on the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 heavy section for now we do not know 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.360
 if it is the only one or there will be more of these but 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.500
 so we saw the football derosa although 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.450
 when you start using it to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.490
 block enemy attacks after 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.619
 a while is spent or we do not know 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.440
 exactly how ammunition works or 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.450
 energy of this weapon I believe and this alone 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.000
 Assumption that pick up heavy ammunition 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.890
 loads the energy of the sword and this you 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.360
 allows you to use it until you spend it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.820
 attacks and blockages that he gives with the sword 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.619
 will spend the energy in terms of assault 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.759
 those of Bonn have already commented as the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.259
 feedback from players has 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.540
 influenced the network assaults and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.070
 possessed these will change the encounters 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.600
 that is to say that if for example in the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.670
 first phase of front until some cabal 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.890
 Maybe the next time you play in 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.780
 this same phase have possessed or a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.270
 full tank or even enemies 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.710
 fighting between them this is to help 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.330
 they do not feel so repetitive 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.580
 when we have done so many 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.289
 times the assault itself seemed very 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.970
 fun in crime looks very easy 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.680
 but that was because the players 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.649
 they were at level 40 and the assault of 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.580
 level 36 so I could see this jump 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.850
 it will be quite 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.440
 or maybe the final ecological mechanics 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.330
 it's also something new so that it does not 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.580
 feel like bullet sponges like 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.680
 other bosses the ones in this jump are the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.870
 brother shield 2 cabal that first 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.340
 we will face one by taking half 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.530
 of life will hide and the other will come out 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.690
 after doing the same thing with this one 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.800
 will also hide and finally we will have 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.260
 to face both at the same time 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.930
 when you defeat one, the one that remains 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.490
 makes it more difficult for example the red 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.560
 the brothers is the one who launches against 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.240
 the floor and the blue creates a kind of 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.400
 shield and launches missiles that fall from 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.890
 up when they defeated the blue red 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.060
 he grabbed his wings or rockets and took the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.459
 ability to launch against 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.260
 players this is just a look at how 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.610
 are the new rounds and now I have 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.020
 really want to play it 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.430
 I would like you to implement mechanical 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.770
 for the style to the assaults that already 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.570
 we have that's all for this video 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.160
 guys like I said they did not see many 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.750
 new features to analyze in this streaming 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.010
 more than the skills the subclasses 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.860
 who will make another video 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.330
 the artifacts as I explained them and then 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.890
 the weapons that used the assault were 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.990
 all ways but none exotic or 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.400
 something that will attract a lot of attention 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.110
 If you want to see the complete lighting, 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.090
 shall leave under harsh description 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.920
 about 40 minutes 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.510
 and other youtubers that were invited 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.819
 in the bonnie studios to try a 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.370
 little the dbc they also play with the 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.170
 subclasses made this jump and the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.300
 first mission to the dlc that is in fobos 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.760
 I'll leave some links to your videos to a 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.170
 description if you want to check the if 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.150
 well the style and I would like to know what 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.860
 they thought they liked the assault 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.349
 subclasses expected more from 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.780
 artifact we leave in the comments and 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.180
 nothing or just all guys this site 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.510
 for this video and do not feel up 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.510
 the next
