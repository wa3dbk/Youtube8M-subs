00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello I'm married I'm part of 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.440
 the artistic team brought life is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.059
 today on my model 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 Helen, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.360
 do a love hairstyle in a few 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.630
 moments 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.279
 so that's what you need for 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.619
 to wear love so a plate 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.529
 who feel average size 1 pay 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.859
 only to make separations deaths by 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.170
 wick of the lacc and a little gloss so 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.559
 I'm starting to do a 4 zone on my 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.130
 hair I know from the front of the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.130
 rear part 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.220
 so here at the level of separations to 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 forward and then separation 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.670
 horizontal ear to the rails so 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.620
 then I fix is very very slightly 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.780
 my hair which khaled ampeils I 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:07.160
 come make a vertical section like 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:13.490
 this has me smoothing plates I come 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:17.259
 first heat my wick and then I 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.259
 come I turn and I shoot at me 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.250
 as if I wanted to make a loop 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:31.000
 here and I drop second wick 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.000
 I warm up I turn 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.549
 and then I then drop all over the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.060
 hair I will proceed from the same 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.040
 way 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.869
 so I'm going to loop on 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.640
 the whole of the hair except the 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.380
 front part and some areas 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.820
 face contours is so now that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.549
 we have waved the whole of the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.110
 hair with the help of a globe this I 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.909

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.590
 full in order to really get some 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.590
 thing goes for them is very natural 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.760

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.470
 place loops I will take care of 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.990
 the front end and coming tasks 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.520

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:30.590
