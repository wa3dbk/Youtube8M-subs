00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.679 
have a new way of running things and
that's<00:03:51.389> how<00:03:51.569> we<00:03:51.750> change<00:03:52.459> leaders<00:03:53.480> which<00:03:54.480> is

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
that's how we change leaders which is

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.720 
that's how we change leaders which is
pretty<00:03:55.049> cool<00:03:55.500> because<00:03:55.889> you<00:03:56.370> don't<00:03:56.400> always

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
pretty cool because you don't always

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.710 
pretty cool because you don't always
have<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.209> play<00:03:57.450> as<00:03:57.629> your<00:03:57.780> po<00:03:57.959> Yan<00:03:58.939> and<00:03:59.939> it's<00:04:00.419> a

have to play as your po Yan and it's a

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.740 
have to play as your po Yan and it's a
really<00:04:00.930> good<00:04:01.230> idea<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.700> it's<00:04:02.939> in<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.540> new

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750

dungeons that you experience there will
be<00:04:07.159> you<00:04:08.159> could<00:04:08.340> actually<00:04:08.519> like<00:04:08.879> just<00:04:09.209> tell

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
be you could actually like just tell

be you could actually like just tell
your<00:04:09.659> partner<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.379> go<00:04:10.709> off<00:04:10.919> in<00:04:11.189> its<00:04:11.340> own

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
your partner to go off in its own

your partner to go off in its own
direction<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.750> could<00:04:12.900> swap<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.620> them<00:04:13.739> if<00:04:13.919> they

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
direction you could swap to them if they

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.640 
direction you could swap to them if they
find<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.609> steps<00:04:14.939> so<00:04:15.389> it's<00:04:16.079> actually<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.470> pretty

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
find the steps so it's actually a pretty

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.550 
find the steps so it's actually a pretty
cool<00:04:16.979> thing<00:04:18.079> you<00:04:19.079> can't

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
cool thing you can't

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.770 
cool thing you can't
ouch<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:20.250> can<00:04:20.430> actually<00:04:20.579> change<00:04:21.030> leaders<00:04:21.539> and

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
ouch you can actually change leaders and

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.409 
ouch you can actually change leaders and
dungeons<00:04:22.320> in<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.770> new<00:04:22.979> dungeons<00:04:23.669> but<00:04:24.300> you

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
dungeons in the new dungeons but you

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.460 
dungeons in the new dungeons but you
can't<00:04:24.690> do<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.349> new<00:04:25.530> ones<00:04:25.830> now<00:04:27.470> it's

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
can't do that in the new ones now it's

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
can't do that in the new ones now it's
pretty<00:04:29.370> good<00:04:29.849> because<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:31.229> can<00:04:31.770> tell<00:04:34.220> money<00:04:35.220> you

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
at a high enough level that I'm capable

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.800 
at a high enough level that I'm capable
of<00:04:46.740> making<00:04:46.800> or<00:04:47.400> mudkips<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.330> high<00:04:48.479> enough<00:04:48.690> level

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
of making or mudkips a high enough level

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.339 
of making or mudkips a high enough level
I'm<00:04:49.530> capable<00:04:49.919> of<00:04:50.870> making<00:04:51.870> them<00:04:52.169> evolve<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:55.020> I'm

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
I'm capable of making them evolve so I'm

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.680 
I'm capable of making them evolve so I'm
gonna<00:04:55.530> just<00:04:55.970> ever<00:04:56.970> loose<00:04:57.389> are<00:04:57.930> evolved<00:04:58.650> it's

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
gonna just ever loose are evolved it's

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.409 
gonna just ever loose are evolved it's
quite<00:05:00.690> simple<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:01.409> now<00:05:01.560> I'm<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.800> Marshtomp

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
quite simple so now I'm a Marshtomp

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.300 
quite simple so now I'm a Marshtomp
that's<00:05:03.419> pretty<00:05:03.840> much<00:05:04.020> this<00:05:04.380> process<00:05:05.130> of

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
that's pretty much this process of

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.110 
that's pretty much this process of
evolution<00:05:05.539> and

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
evolution and

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.170 
evolution and
I<00:05:07.470> kinda<00:05:08.470> like<00:05:08.680> being<00:05:09.010> a<00:05:09.100> budget<00:05:09.699> but<00:05:10.000> it's

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
I kinda like being a budget but it's

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.770 
I kinda like being a budget but it's
called<00:05:10.660> of<00:05:10.900> all<00:05:11.310> it's<00:05:12.310> worth<00:05:13.120> doing<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:15.780> one

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
called of all it's worth doing and one

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.400 
called of all it's worth doing and one
last<00:05:17.020> thing<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.590> talk<00:05:18.070> about<00:05:18.810> after<00:05:19.810> this<00:05:20.080> this

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
last thing I talk about after this this

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.659 
last thing I talk about after this this
is<00:05:20.560> my<00:05:20.740> last<00:05:21.010> video<00:05:21.580> of<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.870> walkthrough<00:05:23.669> that

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
is my last video of the walkthrough that

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.490 
is my last video of the walkthrough that
does<00:05:24.910> not<00:05:25.090> mean<00:05:25.419> I'm<00:05:25.630> not<00:05:25.870> gonna<00:05:26.169> do<00:05:26.350> any

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
does not mean I'm not gonna do any

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.790 
does not mean I'm not gonna do any
videos<00:05:27.040> but<00:05:27.460> any<00:05:27.729> videos<00:05:28.300> from<00:05:28.660> here<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:29.110> will

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
videos but any videos from here on will

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.980 
videos but any videos from here on will
probably<00:05:30.220> just<00:05:30.370> be<00:05:30.460> like<00:05:30.729> boss<00:05:31.060> battles<00:05:31.750> or

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
probably just be like boss battles or

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.580 
probably just be like boss battles or
something<00:05:32.530> because<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:34.419> post<00:05:34.720> game<00:05:35.139> is

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
something because the post game is

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.520 
something because the post game is
really<00:05:36.430> like<00:05:37.030> you<00:05:37.389> could<00:05:37.600> go<00:05:37.780> off<00:05:37.990> and<00:05:38.290> all

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
really like you could go off and all

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.250 
really like you could go off and all
different<00:05:39.100> paths<00:05:39.400> I<00:05:39.820> wish<00:05:40.510> I<00:05:40.660> could<00:05:40.840> show<00:05:41.229> you

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
different paths I wish I could show you

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.490 
different paths I wish I could show you
but<00:05:42.070> like<00:05:42.520> a<00:05:42.729> grid<00:05:43.419> of<00:05:43.600> like<00:05:43.810> what<00:05:44.139> you<00:05:44.289> could

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
but like a grid of like what you could

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.680 
but like a grid of like what you could
do<00:05:44.740> but<00:05:45.010> there's<00:05:45.610> so<00:05:45.940> many<00:05:46.090> different<00:05:46.660> things

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
do but there's so many different things

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.930 
do but there's so many different things
you<00:05:47.050> could<00:05:47.350> do<00:05:47.590> and<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:47.919> just<00:05:47.949> unlocks<00:05:48.610> all

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
you could do and it just unlocks all

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.820 
you could do and it just unlocks all
sorts<00:05:49.449> of<00:05:49.600> options<00:05:50.289> of<00:05:51.130> this<00:05:51.449> now<00:05:52.470> two<00:05:53.470> things

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
sorts of options of this now two things
