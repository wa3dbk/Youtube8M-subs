00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.230
 I understand that there are some 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:11.669
 problems in the haunted house in world 6 new 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.969
 Super Mario Bros 2 for the 3ds give 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:17.880
 That's why I'm going to make this world fast 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.890
 to solve 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.300
 I have problems with it at the beginning 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:29.919
 because the exit is really well hidden 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:43.870
 I'll show you the same as you all 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:46.149
 starred munich is still here 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.199
 a most usually still a gold 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:53.399
 block 1 gold head in there 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:59.309
 if mario is known here for a war 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.309
 up here we could be the first star 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:21.369
 If we take this gate you have the tenno 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:26.310
 You can fly kimaryo and up there 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.310
 to discover a little secret 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:38.520
 therefore, people give the game 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.520
 seem very important 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:57.200
 we go again into value 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:02:00.760
 the sign is gone as he would have the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.760
 press switch 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:28.180
 the door is a fake we go here 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.180
 We must hurry and find stars 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.260
 It's right at the exit 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.330
 we go in there so the sign here 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.330
 is 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.950
 oh here above, it is still something 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:12.939
 click on this switch from this one 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.939
 pit power becomes the first goal 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.799
 then we come to another room 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.299
 one more switch you can you the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.719
 you usually watch TV here 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:34.310
 you would go through the door now 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:39.349
 there you would come back to the main room 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:44.659
 but what many have seen is that 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:49.599
 here in switch appeared is the 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:59.450
 open a path to another door 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:04:01.250
 that was not all if you did not 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.439
 you can know quite a long time 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.519
 after the exit to the hotel have you 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.469
 we continue to graze 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.469
 thanks for seeing
