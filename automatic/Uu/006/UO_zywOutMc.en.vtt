00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.690
 finally it goes out again into the area here drives on the first appearances 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.369
 he prepares versatility - pro 4 as Honorary President 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.979
 From Franconia is more than a country the popular and 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.509
 the horse and rider learn real life Handball Ing 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.289
 first of all, there is enough for the general education that you can do 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.749
 just not only when riders but as often as possible with Buy 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:28.220
 on 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.069
 goes into the terrain goes 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.339
 Rumba also build trust between rider and horse 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 October 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.230
 here also from the world 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.630
 too much moved that the horse after the 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.500
 Each time the following one frightened or frightened, though the East 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.690
 to prepare you should after the election, first small laps 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.780
 to turn the call 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.310
 Also important is the control of the equipment 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.950
 for the Reitverein Hamm 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.850
 as direct candidates and wearing leggings at the front 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.660
 very important is the right idea that Martin Golling one 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.660
 properly irradiated material should be that with normal head or neck 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.580
 Attitude of the reader 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.960
 if I move the material in the length Martin fits that 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.630
 where the reins go 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.000
 the result below under the larynx 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.620
 If I go to the Martin Galaxies I will then connect to the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.250
 because this does not kink Martin Gaal if the material is too short 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.360
 is 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.130
 already with young horses like here with a three-year-old should be in the middle 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740
 you go into the terrain 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.929
 So, if possible, get one as early as possible 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.870
 with the boy driving into the terrain 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.390
 that of course with 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.530
 accordingly with for horses 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.460
 where the young horse 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.030
 is framed by a for driving or forward the left and right still 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.230
 an even older horse 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.560
 Percent the horse can and you can really do with three year old horses 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.299
 of making 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.299
 so she does not pity I tried everything 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.659
 so the three-year-old fourth will not only offer the site 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.009
 but also familiar with the First Obstacles 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.019
 the others meanwhile keep their horses loose on the playground 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.499
 that too is a good prophylactic when riding back into the field 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.739
 Rice has a tip for everyone 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.209
 then it goes on with leave work 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.340
 At the same time the riders can get back to the relief so the light seat 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.559
 should 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.559
 endanger because there in the wild 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.559
 The jump of Vegas is in the field still pursued from last year 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.149
 Nevertheless, he pray is then taken out of the pen 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:44.669
 it should be noted if it does not go if the launches phase the file 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.969
 and he's going to have this over here 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:53.319
 Percent you can already more with him the direction of movement with as in bath 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.589
 Honnef value percent not at a low point when we know outdoor area 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.779
 after two meters down 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:04.779
 one should make sure that in the landing phase or from bounce to the 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.010
 Landing did not disturb the movement that is the trains 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.630
 Relatively relaxed 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.739
 do not stay in the saddle 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.219
 and try to see that that works too 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.210
 all that does not mean jumping too far Vanity fair hold on to the reins 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.209
 the jumps further 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.209
 then it finally goes into the terrain 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.610
 especially highway bridges 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.329
 you should not exceed 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.399
 but better off and lead 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:32.430
 who descends 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.430
 But always must know that can also get off again 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.179
 this has to endure now 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:41.029
 you should 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.020
 Neuhausen 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.249
 No 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.499
 for the first of the rag quotes brings 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.499
 in demarcated ways 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.779
 Very important for sure-footedness is riding through maintenance 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.079
 she learns to perfectly "live her legs" here 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.579
 concentrates more and more 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.979
 the riders were astonished maybe she is her fourth field 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.739
 Often it comes in the area also to unforeseen encounters 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.569
 Tina wagon about 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.209
 but I would give some time to the contract and then to the horses and 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.659
 Show that, so we'll be fine 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.340
 Concerns are that she does not pass Fair Game One or is very coupe 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.710
 knows about strollers or playgrounds or cars or anything else 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.840
 which would thank also for men to stop or stop the prologue 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.419
 and really look 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.199
 the same goes for black ones 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.710
 which are usually fake here and not free in the area 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.309
 run around 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:43.479
 Caution is also required in association with foreign free-range horses 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.139
 in a pasture 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.729
 These can gallop away and thus make you think 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.180
 a very important aspect of surfing 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.180
 m is climbing he buys or goes downhill 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.559
 it is eating away 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.559
 Philip will naturally be nice on the hindquarters 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.610
 4 1 percent at the same time also meets conditions 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.610
 Percent is also similar to 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.130
 Percent BMW EADS bounce or even before you just do not bother the horse 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.400
 you have the horse 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.470
 in the end, with a little more on both trains land for help 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.939
 Kurt Beck charged 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.279
 in both directions so both uphill and better 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.879
 so well prepared victory in the first part on a free meadow nothing more 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.589
 In the way 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.190
 he buys it is for the fourth as well can b 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.340
 Food more exhausting
