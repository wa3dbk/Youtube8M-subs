about now this is where the gradient

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
steep certainly but it's hard enough to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.740 
steep certainly but it's hard enough to
feel<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.909> where<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.180> know<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
feel and this is where you know that the

feel and this is where you know that the
real<00:02:06.899> work<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.350> about<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.740> begin<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.149> to

real work is about to begin the way to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.699 
real work is about to begin the way to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
think about Southern Cross is to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.040 
think about Southern Cross is to
visualize<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.489> three<00:02:11.760> steps<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.930> are

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
visualize it as three steps there are

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.970 
visualize it as three steps there are
three<00:02:13.290> very<00:02:13.530> distinct

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
three very distinct

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.619 
three very distinct
sections<00:02:14.430> where<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.640> kicks<00:02:14.879> up<00:02:15.030> more<00:02:15.269> steeply

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
sections where it kicks up more steeply

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.839 
sections where it kicks up more steeply
but<00:02:16.230> they're<00:02:16.409> separated<00:02:17.010> by<00:02:17.040> three<00:02:17.400> sections

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
but they're separated by three sections

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.550 
but they're separated by three sections
of<00:02:18.000> gradual<00:02:18.450> climbing<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.140> do<00:02:19.319> get<00:02:19.500> some

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
of gradual climbing so you do get some

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.440 
of gradual climbing so you do get some
reprieve<00:02:20.159> from<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.549> steep<00:02:20.790> up<00:02:21.000> hills

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
reprieve from the steep up hills

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.449 
reprieve from the steep up hills
you've<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.290> conquered<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.890> first<00:02:23.129> of<00:02:23.310> those

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
you've just conquered the first of those

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.430 
you've just conquered the first of those
three<00:02:23.519> steps<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.420> you're<00:02:24.900> now<00:02:25.049> on<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.260> more

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
three steps and you're now on a more

three steps and you're now on a more
gradual<00:02:25.860> flat<00:02:26.190> section<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.569> see<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.810> car

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
gradual flat section you can see the car

uphill<00:02:32.340> sections<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.090> starts<00:02:33.540> when<00:02:33.750> you

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
uphill sections and it starts when you

you<00:04:25.970> kinds<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.540> hope<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.170> video<00:04:27.290> has

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
you kinds I hope that the video has

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.560 
you kinds I hope that the video has
helped<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:27.950> little<00:04:28.220> bit<00:04:28.370> in<00:04:28.820> terms<00:04:29.180> of<00:04:29.300> letting

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
helped a little bit in terms of letting

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.480 
helped a little bit in terms of letting
you<00:04:29.660> know<00:04:29.690> what<00:04:30.080> is<00:04:30.320> coming<00:04:30.530> for<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:31.100> on<00:04:31.280> race

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
you know what is coming for you on race

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.670 
you know what is coming for you on race
day<00:04:31.730> I<00:04:32.000> think<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.990> wrap<00:04:33.170> up<00:04:33.350> there<00:04:33.590> are<00:04:33.650> two

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
day I think to wrap up there are two

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.320 
day I think to wrap up there are two
things<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.280> want<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.430> say<00:04:34.640> about<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.970> climb

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
things I want to say about the climb

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.180 
things I want to say about the climb
the<00:04:35.390> first<00:04:35.660> is<00:04:35.840> concerning<00:04:36.260> pace<00:04:36.590> judgments

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
the first is concerning pace judgments

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.460 
the first is concerning pace judgments
and<00:04:37.970> that's<00:04:38.120> that<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.330> can<00:04:38.630> expect<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.260> lose

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
and that's that you can expect to lose

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.700 
and that's that you can expect to lose
between<00:04:40.100> 45<00:04:40.820> seconds<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.600> 90<00:04:42.020> seconds<00:04:42.470> per

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
between 45 seconds and 90 seconds per

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.950 
between 45 seconds and 90 seconds per
kilometer<00:04:43.370> on<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.640> climb<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.390> so<00:04:44.750> for

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
kilometer on the climb and so for

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.170 
kilometer on the climb and so for
example<00:04:45.410> if<00:04:45.740> your<00:04:45.920> target<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.760> run<00:04:46.910> 5

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
example if your target is to run 5

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.510 
example if your target is to run 5
minutes<00:04:47.570> ok<00:04:47.840> for<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.170> race<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.950> you<00:04:49.370> will

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
minutes ok for the race you you will

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.060 
minutes ok for the race you you will
probably<00:04:49.760> run<00:04:50.210> Southern<00:04:50.810> Cross<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.260> about<00:04:51.500> 6

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
probably run Southern Cross in about 6

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.890 
probably run Southern Cross in about 6
minutes<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.490> kilometer<00:04:52.970> particularly<00:04:53.540> on

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
minutes a kilometer particularly on

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.050 
minutes a kilometer particularly on
those<00:04:54.350> steeper<00:04:54.740> sections<00:04:55.160> near<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.490> top<00:04:55.700> and

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
those steeper sections near the top and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.790 
those steeper sections near the top and
so<00:04:56.450> just<00:04:56.630> take<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:56.990> into<00:04:57.170> account<00:04:57.290> when

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
so just take that into account when

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.050 
so just take that into account when
you're<00:04:57.860> setting<00:04:58.190> your<00:04:58.280> goal<00:04:58.550> for<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.910> whole

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
you're setting your goal for the whole

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.780 
you're setting your goal for the whole
race<00:04:59.330> the<00:05:00.140> second<00:05:00.500> point<00:05:00.710> also<00:05:00.980> concerns<00:05:01.550> pace

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
race the second point also concerns pace

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.670 
race the second point also concerns pace
judgement<00:05:02.270> but<00:05:02.420> it's<00:05:02.540> the<00:05:02.660> concept<00:05:03.200> and

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
judgement but it's the concept and

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.230 
judgement but it's the concept and
that's<00:05:03.830> that<00:05:03.980> you<00:05:04.130> must<00:05:04.370> focus<00:05:04.640> on<00:05:05.030> running

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
that's that you must focus on running

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.750 
that's that you must focus on running
over<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.810> hill<00:05:06.020> remember<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.310> the

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
over the hill remember that the the

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.970 
over the hill remember that the the
climb<00:05:08.000> starts<00:05:08.360> just<00:05:08.750> after<00:05:08.900> 10<00:05:09.320> cares<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:09.920> it

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
climb starts just after 10 cares and it

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.270 
climb starts just after 10 cares and it
ends<00:05:10.340> at<00:05:10.400> 13<00:05:10.850> cares<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.600> that<00:05:12.440> means<00:05:12.710> that

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
ends at 13 cares and that means that

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.860 
ends at 13 cares and that means that
you've<00:05:13.490> still<00:05:13.670> got<00:05:13.820> 8<00:05:13.970> caves<00:05:14.270> from<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.630> top

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
you've still got 8 caves from the top

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.630 
you've still got 8 caves from the top
and<00:05:15.050> so<00:05:15.230> it's<00:05:15.650> really<00:05:15.830> important<00:05:16.400> that<00:05:16.460> you

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
and so it's really important that you

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.850 
and so it's really important that you
conserve<00:05:17.060> energy<00:05:17.300> hold<00:05:17.990> yourself<00:05:18.440> back<00:05:18.500> at

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
conserve energy hold yourself back at

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.440 
conserve energy hold yourself back at
the<00:05:18.950> beginning<00:05:19.100> of<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.550> climb<00:05:19.760> when<00:05:20.120> it's<00:05:20.270> not

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
the beginning of the climb when it's not

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.870 
the beginning of the climb when it's not
as<00:05:20.600> steep<00:05:20.810> run<00:05:21.710> strongly<00:05:22.220> in<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.400> middle<00:05:22.670> and

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
as steep run strongly in the middle and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.190 
as steep run strongly in the middle and
towards<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.240> latter<00:05:23.420> parts<00:05:23.840> of<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:23.990> climb

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
towards the latter parts of the climb

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.710 
towards the latter parts of the climb
but<00:05:24.680> really<00:05:25.040> run<00:05:25.220> over<00:05:25.670> it<00:05:25.790> you've<00:05:26.300> got<00:05:26.450> a<00:05:26.480> nice

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
but really run over it you've got a nice

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.020 
but really run over it you've got a nice
descent<00:05:27.170> afterwards<00:05:27.830> save<00:05:28.280> yourself<00:05:28.670> up<00:05:28.850> and

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
descent afterwards save yourself up and

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.670 
descent afterwards save yourself up and
that's<00:05:29.180> really<00:05:29.270> where<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.750> should<00:05:30.110> start

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
that's really where the I should start

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.050 
that's really where the I should start
for<00:05:30.920> you<00:05:31.040> not<00:05:31.220> only<00:05:31.250> at<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.670> bottom<00:05:31.790> of

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
for you not only at the bottom of

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.270 
for you not only at the bottom of
Southern<00:05:32.360> Cross<00:05:32.570> I'll<00:05:33.560> be<00:05:33.740> looking<00:05:34.040> at<00:05:34.160> other

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
Southern Cross I'll be looking at other

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.400 
Southern Cross I'll be looking at other
segments<00:05:34.820> of<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:35.060> race<00:05:35.210> chapman's<00:05:35.720> peak<00:05:35.810> the

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
segments of the race chapman's peak the

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.470 
segments of the race chapman's peak the
curstyn<00:05:36.830> rush<00:05:37.010> bends<00:05:37.430> leading<00:05:38.000> up<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.150> top

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
curstyn rush bends leading up to top

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.600 
curstyn rush bends leading up to top
gate<00:05:38.720> as<00:05:39.200> well<00:05:39.260> as<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.680> last<00:05:39.860> segment<00:05:40.130> so<00:05:40.490> do

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
gate as well as the last segment so do

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.980 
gate as well as the last segment so do
join<00:05:40.850> me<00:05:41.030> in<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.210> next<00:05:41.240> few<00:05:41.600> weeks<00:05:41.630> for<00:05:41.930> that

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
join me in the next few weeks for that

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.590 
join me in the next few weeks for that
until<00:05:42.830> then<00:05:43.040> happy<00:05:43.550> tapering<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:44.300> good<00:05:44.480> luck

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
until then happy tapering and good luck

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.110 
until then happy tapering and good luck
with<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:44.810> training
