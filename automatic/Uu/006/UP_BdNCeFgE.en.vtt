00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
new integration it's been really

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.030 
new integration it's been really
difficult<00:06:12.610> for<00:06:13.270> me<00:06:13.510> to<00:06:13.600> keep<00:06:13.750> up<00:06:13.930> with<00:06:14.140> it<00:06:14.290> and

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
difficult for me to keep up with it and

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.710 
difficult for me to keep up with it and
I<00:06:15.160> want<00:06:15.490> to<00:06:15.669> do<00:06:15.790> more<00:06:15.970> things<00:06:16.030> with<00:06:16.330> it<00:06:16.540> and<00:06:16.690> I

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
I want to do more things with it and I

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.360 
I want to do more things with it and I
just<00:06:16.900> think<00:06:17.140> at<00:06:17.320> this<00:06:17.470> point<00:06:17.740> it<00:06:18.160> will<00:06:18.310> be

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
just think at this point it will be

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.340 
just think at this point it will be
easier<00:06:18.970> for<00:06:19.180> me<00:06:19.540> to<00:06:19.690> keep<00:06:19.810> up<00:06:19.990> with<00:06:20.140> all<00:06:20.320> of
