that one whole fruit actually my
favorite<00:00:23.849> fruit<00:00:24.119> next<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.929> muscadine

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
favorite fruit next to the muscadine

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.490 
favorite fruit next to the muscadine
from<00:00:25.949> down<00:00:26.130> south<00:00:26.509> and<00:00:27.509> it<00:00:27.900> tastes<00:00:28.289> rather

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
from down south and it tastes rather

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.390 
from down south and it tastes rather
like<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
like that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.369 
like that
now<00:00:30.240> last<00:00:30.750> time<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.199> talked<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.430> group<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
now last time I talked to this group I

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.290 
now last time I talked to this group I
said<00:00:34.379> well<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.829> said<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.190> contain<00:00:35.760> ellagic

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
said well it's said to contain ellagic

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.729 
said well it's said to contain ellagic
acid<00:00:37.129> but<00:00:38.390> this<00:00:39.390> time<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.140> say<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.500> contains

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
acid but this time I can say it contains

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.690 
acid but this time I can say it contains
about<00:00:41.309> 480<00:00:42.090> milligrams<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.620> ellagic<00:00:43.920> acid<00:00:43.950> per

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
about 480 milligrams of ellagic acid per

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.110 
about 480 milligrams of ellagic acid per
kilo<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> that's<00:00:46.140> significant<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.850> that's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
kilo and that's significant so that's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.299 
kilo and that's significant so that's
news<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> whole<00:00:49.260> thing<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.920> don't<00:00:50.100> want<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
news on the whole thing we don't want to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.330 
news on the whole thing we don't want to
talk<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.699> about<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.239> incredible<00:00:52.340> quantity

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
talk just about that incredible quantity

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.869 
talk just about that incredible quantity
of<00:00:53.609> vitamin<00:00:54.120> C<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.530> add<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.859> logic<00:00:56.430> acid

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
of vitamin C but now we add a logic acid

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.939 
of vitamin C but now we add a logic acid
and<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.719> add<00:00:57.930> quercetin<00:00:58.500> with

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and now we can add quercetin with

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.290 
and now we can add quercetin with
quantitative<00:00:59.820> data<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.449> believe<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:02.300> 240

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
quantitative data I believe it was 240

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.070 
quantitative data I believe it was 240
milligrams<00:01:03.960> per<00:01:04.590> kilogram<00:01:04.770> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:06.660> there

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080
