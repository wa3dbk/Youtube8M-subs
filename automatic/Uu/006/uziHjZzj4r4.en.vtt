flapped now personally I owns consider
this<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.630> feature<00:01:57.960> than

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
this to be more of a feature than

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.090 
this to be more of a feature than
anything<00:01:58.880> because<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.270> use<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.100> multi

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
anything because you can use the multi

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.800 
anything because you can use the multi
touch<00:02:02.280> functionality<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.540> thing<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
touch functionality on this thing a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.450 
touch functionality on this thing a
little<00:02:04.110> easier<00:02:04.500> without<00:02:04.649> having<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> pick<00:02:05.340> up

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
little easier without having to pick up

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.740 
little easier without having to pick up
your<00:02:05.579> hand<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.270> through<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> shape

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
your hand like you would through a shape

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.589 
your hand like you would through a shape
like<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.670> some<00:02:08.849> ways<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.239> actually

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
like this so in some ways it's actually

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.540 
like this so in some ways it's actually
helpful<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> design<00:02:10.619> but<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> definitely

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
helpful to the design but I definitely

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.930 
helpful to the design but I definitely
recommend<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> head<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
recommend that you head to it

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.670 
recommend that you head to it
apple<00:02:13.120> store<00:02:13.330> some<00:02:13.630> other<00:02:13.810> place<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.200> try<00:02:14.320> one

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
apple store some other place and try one

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.650 
apple store some other place and try one
of<00:02:14.710> these<00:02:14.830> things<00:02:15.070> out<00:02:15.310> for<00:02:15.490> yourself<00:02:15.660> because

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
of these things out for yourself because

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.660 
of these things out for yourself because
not<00:02:16.870> everyone<00:02:17.380> will<00:02:18.100> be<00:02:18.310> as<00:02:18.430> comfortable

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
not everyone will be as comfortable

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.430 
not everyone will be as comfortable
using<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.270> as<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.570> am<00:02:20.640> anyway<00:02:21.640> as<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.230> see

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
using this as I am anyway as you can see

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.670 
using this as I am anyway as you can see
here<00:02:23.830> if<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.950> open<00:02:24.250> up<00:02:24.310> another<00:02:24.460> webpage

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
