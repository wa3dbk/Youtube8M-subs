00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
on any location and the next part is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.029 
on any location and the next part is
actually<00:00:58.050> quite<00:00:58.230> far<00:00:58.469> away<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.949> just

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
actually quite far away but I just

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.219 
actually quite far away but I just
follow<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.789> bus<00:01:00.000> route<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.649> we'll<00:01:01.670> we<00:01:02.670> see<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
follow the bus route and we'll we see a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.490 
follow the bus route and we'll we see a
long<00:01:04.229> flying<00:01:05.090> route<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.170> gives<00:01:07.350> me

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
long flying route now so this gives me

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
long flying route now so this gives me
actually<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.070> opportunity<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.970> talk<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
actually the opportunity to talk a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
actually the opportunity to talk a
little<00:01:09.750> bit<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.740> wanna<00:01:10.890> say<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.670> video

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
well that's bridge now the next part is

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.580 
well that's bridge now the next part is
inducted<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.409> totin<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.989> let's<00:02:09.989> go<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.379> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
inducted on totin and let's go to it I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.320 
inducted on totin and let's go to it I
assume<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.250> how<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> go<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.090> it

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
assume you know how to go to it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
assume you know how to go to it
otherwise<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.500> just

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
otherwise you just

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
otherwise you just
go<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.160> green<00:02:14.490> light<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:15.510> actually

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
go to this green light it's actually

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.960 
go to this green light it's actually
green<00:02:16.050> when<00:02:16.290> power<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.100> enter<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
green when power is on you enter here to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.420 
green when power is on you enter here to
the<00:02:18.090> right<00:02:18.300> side<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.750> car<00:02:18.990> maze<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:20.130> go<00:02:20.280> as

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
the right side of the car maze you go as

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.580 
the right side of the car maze you go as
far<00:02:20.610> as<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.120> turn<00:02:21.390> left<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
far as you can you turn left and at the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.250 
far as you can you turn left and at the
first<00:02:22.890> opportunity<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:24.030> turn<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> right

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
first opportunity you turn to the right

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.910 
first opportunity you turn to the right
right<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:28.110> there<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.440> not<00:02:28.620> their<00:02:28.800> own

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
right here and there is not their own

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.730 
right here and there is not their own
totem<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.970> part<00:02:30.240> here<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.660> handle<00:02:31.530> and

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
totem this part here is the handle and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.700 
totem this part here is the handle and
it<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.220> spawn<00:02:32.550> either<00:02:32.910> right<00:02:33.480> here<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.960> this

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
it can spawn either right here on this

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.560 
it can spawn either right here on this
shelf<00:02:35.280> right<00:02:36.150> there

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
shelf right there

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.860 
shelf right there
I'm<00:02:37.500> actually<00:02:37.710> not<00:02:37.950> 100%<00:02:38.910> sure<00:02:39.000> about<00:02:39.360> this

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
I'm actually not 100% sure about this

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.360 
I'm actually not 100% sure about this
location<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.530> think<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:40.920> right<00:02:41.190> there

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
location but I think it's right there

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.970 
location but I think it's right there
maybe<00:02:41.850> it's<00:02:42.060> also<00:02:42.240> here<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:42.980> structure

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
maybe it's also here on this structure

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.700 
maybe it's also here on this structure
or<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.910> somewhere<00:02:45.210> around<00:02:45.300> here

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
or so it's somewhere around here

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.300 
or so it's somewhere around here
somewhere<00:02:46.710> around<00:02:46.800> here

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
somewhere around here

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.000 
somewhere around here
and<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:48.360> second<00:02:48.780> possible<00:02:49.320> spawn<00:02:49.590> location

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
and the second possible spawn location

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.070 
and the second possible spawn location
is<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.550> somewhere<00:02:51.030> here<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.630> don't<00:02:51.870> know<00:02:52.050> if

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
is so somewhere here I don't know if

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.310 
is so somewhere here I don't know if
it's<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.560> top<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.550> or<00:02:53.940> underneath<00:02:54.930> it

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
it's on top of this or underneath it

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.810 
it's on top of this or underneath it
because<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.740> actually<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.160> not<00:02:56.310> see<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.610> quite

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
because you actually do not see it quite

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.150 
because you actually do not see it quite
well<00:02:56.850> but<00:02:57.240> when<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.690> go<00:02:58.140> upstairs<00:02:58.350> it

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
well but when you just go upstairs it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.840 
well but when you just go upstairs it
says<00:02:59.490> press<00:03:00.120> button<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.930> pick<00:03:01.800> up<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.580> part

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
says press button to pick up the part

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.570 
says press button to pick up the part
and<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:04.050> third<00:03:04.290> possible<00:03:04.710> spawn<00:03:04.980> location<00:03:05.460> is

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
and the third possible spawn location is

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.970 
and the third possible spawn location is
here<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.420> thing<00:03:06.810> where<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.230> store<00:03:07.950> your

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
here and that thing where you store your

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.980 
here and that thing where you store your
documents<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.450> dunno

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
documents I dunno

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.110 
documents I dunno
do<00:03:10.230> not<00:03:10.440> know<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.770> word<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.880> you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
do not know the word for this but you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.240 
do not know the word for this but you
see<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.540> right<00:03:12.960> there

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
see it right there

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.120 
see it right there
so<00:03:14.250> one<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:14.940> here<00:03:15.660> rather<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.440> left<00:03:16.680> one<00:03:17.010> in

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
so one is here rather to the left one in

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.490 
so one is here rather to the left one in
the<00:03:17.220> middle<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.700> one<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.239> right<00:03:18.500> very

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
the middle and one to the right very

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.170 
the middle and one to the right very
easy<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:21.480> next<00:03:22.190> possible<00:03:23.190> not<00:03:23.670> possible

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
easy and the next possible not possible

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.390 
easy and the next possible not possible
the<00:03:24.330> next<00:03:24.510> part<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.860> will<00:03:26.040> have<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.220> look

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
the next part that we will have a look

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.940 
the next part that we will have a look
at<00:03:26.520> is<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.970> power<00:03:27.420> I'm<00:03:28.110> pretty<00:03:28.500> sure<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.860> have

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
at is in power I'm pretty sure you have

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.970 
at is in power I'm pretty sure you have
found<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.520> part<00:03:30.380> right<00:03:31.380> there<00:03:31.440> I'm<00:03:31.800> actually

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
found this part right there I'm actually

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.490 
found this part right there I'm actually
not<00:03:32.250> sure<00:03:32.520> about<00:03:32.940> one<00:03:33.330> spawning<00:03:33.989> location

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
not sure about one spawning location

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.410 
not sure about one spawning location
because<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:35.040> think<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.520> have<00:03:35.640> seen<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.150> once

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
because I think I have seen it once

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.530 
because I think I have seen it once
there<00:03:37.020> but<00:03:37.620> only<00:03:37.950> once<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.730> that's<00:03:39.300> kind<00:03:39.510> of

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
there but only once and that's kind of

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.240 
there but only once and that's kind of
weird<00:03:40.310> but<00:03:41.310> yeah<00:03:41.489> let's<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:41.910> point<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.270> out

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.949 

I'm<00:03:47.250> sorry<00:03:47.550> for<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.570> brakes

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
I'm sorry for the brakes

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:57.830 
I'm sorry for the brakes
whatever<00:03:49.940> alright<00:03:51.380> let's<00:03:52.380> go<00:03:52.530> up<00:03:52.680> here<00:03:56.840> all

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
whatever alright let's go up here all

right there we go so you exit you're the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.840 
right there we go so you exit you're the
reactor<00:04:00.840> room<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.230> go<00:04:01.380> up<00:04:01.620> here<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.130> then<00:04:02.730> you

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
reactor room you go up here and then you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.520 
reactor room you go up here and then you
can<00:04:03.030> actually<00:04:03.150> drop<00:04:03.450> down<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.959> can<00:04:03.989> drop<00:04:04.320> down

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
can actually drop down you can drop down

down right there or you can also just
drop<00:04:07.800> down<00:04:07.980> here<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:09.750> first<00:04:10.019> possible

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
drop down here and the first possible

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.050 
drop down here and the first possible
spawn<00:04:10.709> for<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.040> virus<00:04:11.400> are<00:04:11.610> right<00:04:12.600> there<00:04:12.840> and

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
spawn for the virus are right there and

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.030 
spawn for the virus are right there and
the<00:04:15.060> second<00:04:15.510> possible<00:04:15.989> spawn<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.650> when<00:04:16.980> you

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
the second possible spawn is when you

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.159 
the second possible spawn is when you
actually<00:04:17.160> go<00:04:17.459> inside<00:04:17.669> here<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.660> barrel

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
actually go inside here on this barrel

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.210 
actually go inside here on this barrel
right<00:04:19.799> here<00:04:21.109> another<00:04:22.109> third<00:04:22.590> one<00:04:22.830> I'm<00:04:23.010> not

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
right here another third one I'm not

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.080 
right here another third one I'm not
sure<00:04:23.550> but<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:24.060> think<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:25.140> right<00:04:25.590> here<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:26.700> top

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
sure but I think it is right here on top

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.090 
sure but I think it is right here on top
of<00:04:27.150> this<00:04:27.389> but<00:04:27.660> as<00:04:27.840> said<00:04:28.139> I've<00:04:28.350> only<00:04:28.590> gotten

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
of this but as said I've only gotten

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.750 
of this but as said I've only gotten
virus<00:04:29.730> once<00:04:30.150> here<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.160> this<00:04:32.160> was<00:04:32.340> quite<00:04:32.639> a

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
virus once here and this was quite a

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.850 
virus once here and this was quite a
long<00:04:32.940> time<00:04:33.120> ago<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:33.600> I'm<00:04:33.720> not<00:04:33.870> exactly<00:04:34.440> sure<00:04:34.620> if

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
long time ago so I'm not exactly sure if

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.480 
long time ago so I'm not exactly sure if
they<00:04:34.980> are<00:04:35.010> here<00:04:35.580> or<00:04:35.790> just<00:04:35.940> relying<00:04:36.360> on<00:04:37.490> this

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
they are here or just relying on this

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
well this temperature and RPM meter is

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.360 
well this temperature and RPM meter is
in<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.820> cabin<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.780> assume<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.860> know<00:05:10.889> how<00:05:11.310> to

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
in the cabin I assume you know how to

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.500 
in the cabin I assume you know how to
get<00:05:11.610> go<00:05:12.060> there

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
get go there

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.740 
get go there
you<00:05:12.960> best<00:05:13.530> go<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.740> this<00:05:14.280> green<00:05:14.880> light<00:05:15.120> between

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
you best go to this green light between

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.670 
you best go to this green light between
power<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:16.610> town<00:05:17.610> then<00:05:18.419> you<00:05:18.570> cross<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.380> street

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
power and town then you cross the street

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.950 
power and town then you cross the street
and<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.039> see<00:05:20.220> this<00:05:20.370> fire<00:05:20.639> there<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.750> go<00:05:21.900> to

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
and you see this fire there you go to

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.370 
and you see this fire there you go to
the<00:05:22.320> fire<00:05:22.590> and<00:05:22.889> there<00:05:23.340> is<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.580> cabin<00:05:23.940> and<00:05:24.380> here

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
the fire and there is the cabin and here

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.100 
the fire and there is the cabin and here
is<00:05:25.470> actually<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.889> last<00:05:26.100> part<00:05:26.630> in<00:05:27.630> this<00:05:27.840> either

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
is actually the last part in this either

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.439 
is actually the last part in this either
on<00:05:28.260> this<00:05:28.590> bed<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:28.860> think<00:05:29.280> maybe<00:05:29.760> it's<00:05:29.970> on<00:05:30.270> this

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
on this bed I think maybe it's on this

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.690 
on this bed I think maybe it's on this
little<00:05:30.720> table<00:05:31.110> I'm<00:05:31.380> I<00:05:31.740> don't<00:05:31.950> know<00:05:32.070> exactly

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
little table I'm I don't know exactly

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.680 
little table I'm I don't know exactly
but<00:05:32.789> um<00:05:34.039> somewhere<00:05:35.039> here<00:05:35.460> or<00:05:35.580> it's<00:05:36.180> on<00:05:36.389> that

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
but um somewhere here or it's on that

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.330 
but um somewhere here or it's on that
table<00:05:37.139> are<00:05:37.729> not<00:05:38.729> not<00:05:39.450> really<00:05:39.840> possible<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:41.160> see

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
table are not not really possible to see

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.490 
table are not not really possible to see
it's<00:05:41.460> in<00:05:41.700> the<00:05:41.820> fire<00:05:42.060> somewhere<00:05:42.570> or<00:05:43.080> maybe<00:05:43.349> it's

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
it's in the fire somewhere or maybe it's

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.409 
it's in the fire somewhere or maybe it's
possible<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.160> see<00:05:44.340> but<00:05:44.580> I<00:05:44.610> never<00:05:44.940> had<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.210> look

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
possible to see but I never had a look

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.270 
possible to see but I never had a look
at<00:05:45.599> it<00:05:45.750> but<00:05:46.289> yeah<00:05:46.860> that's<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.370> last<00:05:47.870> part<00:05:48.870> or

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
at it but yeah that's the last part or

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.900 
at it but yeah that's the last part or
possible<00:05:50.280> spawns<00:05:50.669> of<00:05:50.849> fire<00:05:51.330> table<00:05:52.169> or

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
possible spawns of fire table or

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.409 
possible spawns of fire table or
somewhere<00:05:53.910> there<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:55.220> and<00:05:56.220> then<00:05:56.700> you<00:05:57.150> go<00:05:57.360> to

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
somewhere there and and then you go to

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.960 
somewhere there and and then you go to
the<00:05:57.660> verge<00:05:57.979> workbench<00:05:58.979> let's<00:05:59.340> just<00:05:59.700> I<00:05:59.820> will

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
the verge workbench let's just I will

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.969 
the verge workbench let's just I will
look<00:06:00.090> at<00:06:00.270> that<00:06:00.479> the<00:06:00.990> videos<00:06:01.229> anyway<00:06:01.560> too<00:06:01.620> long

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
look at that the videos anyway too long

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.690 
look at that the videos anyway too long
already<00:06:03.710> kind<00:06:04.710> of<00:06:04.740> weird<00:06:04.950> I<00:06:05.070> didn't<00:06:05.400> think

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
already kind of weird I didn't think

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.110 
already kind of weird I didn't think
it'd<00:06:05.789> get<00:06:06.000> that<00:06:06.240> gets<00:06:06.810> dead<00:06:07.200> long<00:06:07.639> whatever<00:06:08.639> I

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
it'd get that gets dead long whatever I

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.270 
it'd get that gets dead long whatever I
think<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:09.870> can't<00:06:10.260> enter<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.830> workbench

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
think it can't enter the workbench

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.480 
think it can't enter the workbench
points<00:06:11.760> because<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.930> door<00:06:13.200> will<00:06:13.440> be<00:06:13.470> closed<00:06:14.190> I

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
points because the door will be closed I

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.460 
points because the door will be closed I
guess<00:06:15.950> but<00:06:16.950> it's<00:06:17.250> in<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:17.910> town<00:06:18.150> here<00:06:18.810> you<00:06:19.289> see

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
guess but it's in the town here you see

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.620 
guess but it's in the town here you see
the<00:06:19.560> bar<00:06:19.800> well<00:06:20.370> maybe<00:06:20.610> I<00:06:20.700> can<00:06:21.030> enter<00:06:21.450> it<00:06:21.620> yep<00:06:23.630> so

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
the bar well maybe I can enter it yep so

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.320 
the bar well maybe I can enter it yep so
here<00:06:24.900> you<00:06:25.080> entered<00:06:25.889> the<00:06:26.010> door<00:06:26.430> he<00:06:26.849> sees<00:06:27.120> them

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
here you entered the door he sees them

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.790 
here you entered the door he sees them
enough<00:06:27.570> to<00:06:27.720> the<00:06:27.840> left<00:06:28.080> and<00:06:28.289> here<00:06:28.560> is<00:06:28.680> the

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
enough to the left and here is the

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.950 
enough to the left and here is the
workbench<00:06:29.190> for<00:06:29.669> the<00:06:29.760> chat<00:06:30.000> gun<00:06:30.240> so<00:06:30.539> that<00:06:30.780> was
