00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 guards leave key inside the truck 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.509
 and the key has not been left inside 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.010
 of the good car what happened is that a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.870
 the unusual truck a truck 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.790
 prosegur that you would not imagine there is no 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.860
 nothing more secure and the guards should 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.870
 be very aware obviously because 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.140
 in there is money and they carry that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.210
 they carry a lot of money they are the ones that move 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.370
 money from one bank to another good 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.110
 look what happened there is the video 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.930
 but I'm sure he selects in there 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.010
 son 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.010
 safety 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.000
 is a video that is on youtube that is 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.390
 call for sure and safe and whoever speaks 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.520
 frank urbina who realized he had 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.720
 a lot of people watching what happened 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.879
 it was in the general street club 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.070
 valparaiso and the whole dead world of the 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.110
 laugh and realized that what was 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.320
 happening was this unusual scene two 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.120
 prosecutors guards trying to open 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.040
 the door with one with a lock for a 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.600
 no known side was over he says 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.010
 trying to put it in a space and the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.879
 another perched on the capo there what 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.259
 we would see then he decided to record 45 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.800
 seconds of this unusual scene 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.800
 let's listen 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.580
 and safety 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.460
 with my salary below 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.590
 good unusual in what happened but the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.180
 conclusion that brings this man out because 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.710
 the truth that no here does not come any 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.150
 interview to those affected to the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.460
 guards who had two and a half hours 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.470
 they did not manage to open the truck what is 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.270
 good because it shows how safe the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.730
 changing but surely they did not manage it 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.830
 open and went with a crane they had 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.210
 to bring it had to carry a crane 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.210
 and there they have to have it is 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.100
 let's say you do not have to have opened 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.009
 appears interviewed in a colonel in 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.810
 withdrawal of former head of special force from 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.310
 carabinero and says those trucks only 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.829
 they have only one key and you can not 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.200
 open from outside without her the driver 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.829
 you should never get off that's what the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.829
 error says
