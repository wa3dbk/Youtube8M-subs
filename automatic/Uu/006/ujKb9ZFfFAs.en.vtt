294 horsepower and 229 pounds of torque

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.209 
294 horsepower and 229 pounds of torque
so<00:00:30.660> let's<00:00:31.289> go<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.590> take<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> look<00:00:31.859> at<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so let's go and take a look at the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
so let's go and take a look at the
engines<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.780> from<00:00:34.050> them

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
engines and then we can see from them

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.310 
engines and then we can see from them
again<00:00:35.090> this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> engine<00:00:36.690> compartment<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
again this is the engine compartment of

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.030 
again this is the engine compartment of
the<00:00:37.350> retiro<00:00:38.040> rav4<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.210> 2012<00:00:39.899> version<00:00:40.260> more

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the retiro rav4 the 2012 version more

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280 
the retiro rav4 the 2012 version more
wraps<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.489> pretty<00:00:41.760> much<00:00:42.090> almost<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.930> same<00:00:43.110> in

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
wraps are pretty much almost the same in

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.170 
wraps are pretty much almost the same in
terms<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.219> way<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.579> engine<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.969> looks

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
terms of the way the engine and looks

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
terms of the way the engine and looks
and<00:00:45.390> feels<00:00:45.629> now<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.530> notice<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and feels now if you notice there are a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.750 
and feels now if you notice there are a
lot<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.270> call<00:00:48.450> crumple<00:00:48.930> zones<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
lot of what we call crumple zones and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.299 
lot of what we call crumple zones and
basically<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:51.030> happens<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.980> that's<00:00:52.980> more<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
basically what happens is that's more of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.000 
basically what happens is that's more of
a<00:00:53.399> safety<00:00:53.820> feature<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.780> when<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.440> vehicle

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
a safety feature that when the vehicle

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.459 
a safety feature that when the vehicle
in<00:00:56.460> does<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> front<00:00:57.449> end<00:00:57.629> clip<00:00:58.020> epic<00:00:58.260> collision

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
in does a front end clip epic collision

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.400 
in does a front end clip epic collision
it<00:00:59.059> crumples<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.570> an<00:01:00.750> accordion<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it crumples up like an accordion and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.160 
it crumples up like an accordion and
then<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.550> notice<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> internet<00:01:03.719> shares

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
then we notice that the internet shares

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
then we notice that the internet shares
off<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> falls<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.220> ground<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
off and it falls to the ground so it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.719 
off and it falls to the ground so it
doesn't<00:01:06.990> end<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:07.350> being<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.070> your<00:01:08.189> lap<00:01:08.369> when

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
doesn't end up being on your lap when

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.100 
doesn't end up being on your lap when
you're<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.150> into<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.510> front-end<00:01:09.990> collision

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you're going into a front-end collision

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.890 
you're going into a front-end collision
now<00:01:10.890> also<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.400> maximum<00:01:11.909> force<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.510> actually

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
now also the maximum force is actually

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.320 
now also the maximum force is actually
transferred<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:13.979> across<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.820> frame<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
transferred right across the frame of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.109 
transferred right across the frame of
the<00:01:15.360> unit<00:01:15.750> into<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> back<00:01:16.530> window<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the unit into the back window so it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.420 
the unit into the back window so it
doesn't<00:01:18.450> actually<00:01:18.570> caused<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.770> injury<00:01:20.189> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
doesn't actually caused your injury to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.990 
doesn't actually caused your injury to

now when it would be interesting and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.350 
now when it would be interesting and
useful<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.890> let's<00:03:02.280> say<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.520> stuck<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.180> snow

useful is let's say you stuck in snow

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.199 
useful is let's say you stuck in snow
and<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.870> wanted<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.260> engage<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.580> oil<00:03:05.970> drive

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
and you wanted to engage the oil drive

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.570 
and you wanted to engage the oil drive
system<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.950> all-wheel<00:03:08.310> drive

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
system because this all-wheel drive

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.000 
system because this all-wheel drive
system<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:09.450> not<00:03:09.690> always<00:03:10.020> writing<00:03:10.440> it's<00:03:10.680> only

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
system is not always writing it's only

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.860 
system is not always writing it's only
partially<00:03:11.700> running<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.360> save<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.750> on

partially running just to save you on
fuel<00:03:13.280> that's<00:03:14.280> why<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.519> fuel<00:03:14.820> economy<00:03:15.390> is

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
fuel that's why the fuel economy is

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.170 
fuel that's why the fuel economy is
pretty<00:03:15.780> good<00:03:15.959> on<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.320> vehicle<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.790> by
