obviously<00:00:41.900> you<00:00:42.110> mentioned<00:00:42.470> you<00:00:42.560> like<00:00:42.740> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
obviously you mentioned you like the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.860 
obviously you mentioned you like the
state<00:00:43.130> to<00:00:43.250> say<00:00:43.340> they<00:00:43.490> are<00:00:43.670> super<00:00:44.300> quick<00:00:44.480> said

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
state to say they are super quick said

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.410 
state to say they are super quick said
I'm<00:00:45.380> comparable<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.070> Finland<00:00:46.520> just<00:00:46.790> as<00:00:46.910> quick

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
I'm comparable to Finland just as quick

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.500 
I'm comparable to Finland just as quick
I<00:00:47.450> would<00:00:48.200> guess<00:00:48.410> even<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:48.830> little<00:00:49.010> quicker<00:00:49.510> last

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
I would guess even a little quicker last

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.270 
I would guess even a little quicker last
year<00:00:50.690> I<00:00:50.720> think<00:00:50.870> about<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.290> case<00:00:51.440> in<00:00:51.770> average

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
year I think about the case in average

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.460 
year I think about the case in average
speed<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:53.510> was<00:00:53.690> a<00:00:53.720> little<00:00:53.990> bit<00:00:54.110> quicker<00:00:54.350> than

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
speed it was a little bit quicker than

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.890 
speed it was a little bit quicker than
until<00:00:55.100> 9:00<00:00:55.280> but<00:00:55.490> Finland<00:00:56.000> has<00:00:56.510> another

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
until 9:00 but Finland has another

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.590 
until 9:00 but Finland has another
dimension<00:00:57.110> also<00:00:57.680> with<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.250> we<00:00:59.030> were<00:00:59.150> like

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
dimension also with the we were like

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.840 
dimension also with the we were like
kind<00:01:00.080> of<00:01:00.200> three<00:01:00.380> difficult<00:01:00.830> to<00:01:01.010> mature<00:01:01.400> so

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
kind of three difficult to mature so

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.990 
kind of three difficult to mature so
it's<00:01:02.600> it's<00:01:03.200> even<00:01:03.770> sometimes<00:01:04.280> more<00:01:04.370> impressive

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
it's it's even sometimes more impressive

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.870 
it's it's even sometimes more impressive
there<00:01:05.570> but<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.440> opposed<00:01:06.770> for<00:01:07.130> me<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:07.250> really

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
there but we opposed for me I really

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.880 
there but we opposed for me I really
mattered<00:01:08.180> right<00:01:08.210> know<00:01:08.900> exceeds<00:01:09.290> impressive

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
mattered right know exceeds impressive

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.410 
mattered right know exceeds impressive
stuff<00:01:10.100> from<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.340> especially<00:01:10.790> in<00:01:11.210> certain

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
stuff from you especially in certain

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.359 
stuff from you especially in certain
year<00:01:11.720> when<00:01:11.990> there<00:01:12.140> was<00:01:12.320> pretty<00:01:12.800> special

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
year when there was pretty special

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.040 
year when there was pretty special
you<00:01:13.910> always<00:01:14.030> want<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.479> get<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.660> win<00:01:14.810> under

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
you always want to get the win under

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.719 
you always want to get the win under
your<00:01:15.140> belt<00:01:15.290> said<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:15.800> have<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.950> heck<00:01:16.280> of<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.550> lead

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
your belt said you have a heck of a lead

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.340 
your belt said you have a heck of a lead
in<00:01:16.910> a<00:01:17.000> championship<00:01:17.420> but<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:17.990> guess<00:01:18.170> you're

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
in a championship but I guess you're

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.170 
in a championship but I guess you're
going<00:01:18.530> for<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.710> win<00:01:18.860> again<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.280> weekend<00:01:19.640> of

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
going for the win again this weekend of

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.999 
going for the win again this weekend of
course<00:01:20.479> that's<00:01:20.750> that's<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.259> target<00:01:21.470> I<00:01:21.800> mean

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
course that's that's the target I mean

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.670 
course that's that's the target I mean
it's<00:01:22.610> hard<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.180> say<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:23.900> will<00:01:24.350> be<00:01:24.470> possible

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
it's hard to say it will be possible

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.730 
it's hard to say it will be possible
like<00:01:25.580> like<00:01:26.210> always<00:01:26.420> now<00:01:26.720> I'm<00:01:26.960> used<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.290> have<00:01:27.530> to

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
like like always now I'm used to have to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.060 
like like always now I'm used to have to
start<00:01:28.460> first<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.060> it's<00:01:29.180> not<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:29.780> bad<00:01:30.070> but

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
start first and it's not so bad but

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.940 
start first and it's not so bad but
still<00:01:31.550> from<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.660> state<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.350> how<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.710> make

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
still from the state is how to make

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.400 
still from the state is how to make
difference<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:34.580> when<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:34.880> are<00:01:35.170> small<00:01:36.170> is

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
difference so when you are small is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.740 
difference so when you are small is
event<00:01:36.680> that<00:01:36.800> is<00:01:36.920> also<00:01:37.100> hard<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.520> compensate<00:01:38.360> it

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
event that is also hard to compensate it

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.320 
event that is also hard to compensate it
but<00:01:39.020> as<00:01:39.470> I<00:01:39.560> said<00:01:39.770> I<00:01:39.800> feel<00:01:40.100> really<00:01:40.250> good<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:40.550> like

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
but as I said I feel really good so like

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.440 
but as I said I feel really good so like
on<00:01:42.020> any<00:01:42.290> previous<00:01:42.860> event<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:43.640> gotta<00:01:43.850> start<00:01:44.180> with

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
on any previous event I gotta start with

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.220 
on any previous event I gotta start with
pushing<00:01:45.230> and<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:46.100> if<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.640> are<00:01:47.020> pretty<00:01:48.020> tight

net and there is many fast corners where

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.380 
net and there is many fast corners where
you<00:03:00.740> can<00:03:00.980> make<00:03:01.160> very<00:03:01.610> small<00:03:01.730> difference<00:03:02.240> but

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
you can make very small difference but

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.730 
you can make very small difference but
you<00:03:02.750> have<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.230> make<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.560> difference<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:05.030> order

society's<00:03:06.740> targeting<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.550> for<00:03:08.240> us<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.600> think

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
society's targeting to it for us I think

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.320 
society's targeting to it for us I think
is<00:03:08.930> more<00:03:09.260> targeting<00:03:10.190> survive<00:03:10.700> but<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.150> of

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
is more targeting survive but the of

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.270 
is more targeting survive but the of
course<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.720> would<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.170> have<00:03:12.800> good<00:03:13.010> speed

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
at the drag world I think it would be

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.010 
at the drag world I think it would be
better<00:03:17.210> surface<00:03:17.810> for<00:03:18.170> our<00:03:18.230> viewing<00:03:18.740> tires<00:03:19.100> so

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
better surface for our viewing tires so

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.430 
better surface for our viewing tires so

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
it take that what is a little bit that

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:17.129 
it take that what is a little bit that
little<00:06:09.939> bit<00:06:10.060> extra<00:06:10.330> to<00:06:10.569> beat<00:06:10.750> in<00:06:11.020> unity<00:06:16.139> please

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
little bit extra to beat in unity please

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.619 
little bit extra to beat in unity please
every<00:06:17.949> time<00:06:18.129> if<00:06:18.279> I<00:06:18.430> put<00:06:18.939> smaller<00:06:19.240> but<00:06:19.599> more

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
every time if I put smaller but more

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.809 
every time if I put smaller but more
speed<00:06:20.110> then<00:06:20.319> I<00:06:20.409> won't<00:06:20.680> go<00:06:20.860> more<00:06:21.039> sideways<00:06:21.580> so

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819 
speed then I won't go more sideways so

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:23.670 
speed then I won't go more sideways so
this<00:06:22.000> is<00:06:22.180> not<00:06:22.330> necessarily<00:06:22.839> working<00:06:23.080> so<00:06:23.469> I

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
this is not necessarily working so I

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.219 
this is not necessarily working so I
have<00:06:24.039> to<00:06:24.189> wait<00:06:24.339> until<00:06:24.580> 2017<00:06:25.479> rules<00:06:25.870> when<00:06:26.110> they

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
have to wait until 2017 rules when they

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:27.839 
have to wait until 2017 rules when they
have<00:06:26.319> more<00:06:26.439> power<00:06:26.680> maybe<00:06:27.069> that<00:06:27.370> will<00:06:27.520> help<00:06:27.699> me

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 
have more power maybe that will help me

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:28.810 
have more power maybe that will help me
but

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
but

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.340 
but
I<00:06:28.850> hope<00:06:29.330> I<00:06:29.480> don't<00:06:29.540> need<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.930> way<00:06:30.020> to<00:06:30.080> about

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
I hope I don't need the way to about
