00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
1800 is a well it's an English IPA but

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.410 
1800 is a well it's an English IPA but
it's<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.190> pretty<00:00:05.400> aggressive<00:00:05.549> one<00:00:06.089> if<00:00:06.270> you've

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
it's a pretty aggressive one if you've

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.940 
it's a pretty aggressive one if you've
looked<00:00:06.569> at<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.839> recipe<00:00:07.049> probably<00:00:07.710> aware<00:00:07.890> of

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
looked at the recipe probably aware of

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.970 
looked at the recipe probably aware of
that<00:00:08.450> we<00:00:09.450> were<00:00:09.599> looking<00:00:09.630> into<00:00:10.410> some

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
that we were looking into some

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.379 
that we were looking into some
historical<00:00:11.580> books<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.710> 34<00:00:13.710> years<00:00:13.889> ago<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.429> came

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
historical books I 34 years ago and came

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.730 
historical books I 34 years ago and came
across<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:16.020> recipe<00:00:16.260> for<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.539> ale<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
across this recipe for this ale the the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.759 
across this recipe for this ale the the
date<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.430> was<00:00:20.850> around<00:00:21.150> 1800<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.199> it's

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
date on it was was around 1800 and it's

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.189 
date on it was was around 1800 and it's
a<00:00:22.859> style<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.019> very

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
a style that that we think is very

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.900 
a style that that we think is very
interesting<00:00:25.350> because<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.250> highlights<00:00:26.430> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
interesting because it highlights you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.370 
interesting because it highlights you
know<00:00:27.000> some<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> beautiful<00:00:27.599> malts<00:00:28.170> that

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
know some of the beautiful malts that

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.620 
know some of the beautiful malts that
the<00:00:28.529> British<00:00:29.130> make<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.060> very<00:00:30.420> very

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the British make and the very very

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.840 
the British make and the very very
specific<00:00:31.289> character<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> hops<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.399> well<00:00:32.579> I

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
specific character of the hops as well I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.030 
specific character of the hops as well I
mean<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.630> still<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.809> big<00:00:33.989> beer<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.440> you're

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
mean it's still a big beer at you're

mean it's still a big beer at you're
talking<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:37.260> know<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.469> over<00:00:37.559> eight<00:00:37.770> percent

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
talking you know it's over eight percent

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.860 
talking you know it's over eight percent
bittering<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:41.360> last<00:00:42.360> time<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.690> had<00:00:42.809> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
bittering is is last time we had it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.569 
bittering is is last time we had it
tested<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> 80s

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
tested you know it was up in the 80s

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
tested you know it was up in the 80s
somewhere<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.719> there's<00:00:45.899> enough<00:00:46.110> mall<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
somewhere but there's enough mall to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
somewhere but there's enough mall to
back<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.920> certainly<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.910> Maris<00:00:48.210> Otter

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
back it up certainly the Maris Otter

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299 
back it up certainly the Maris Otter
that<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.809> use<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.230> make<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.590> beer<00:00:49.860> it's

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that we use to make that beer it's

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.150 
that we use to make that beer it's
incredibly<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.629> grainy<00:00:51.899> character<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.800> Maris

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
incredibly the grainy character of Maris

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.650 
incredibly the grainy character of Maris
Otter<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.270> know<00:00:54.449> you're

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
Otter is really there you know you're

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.260 
Otter is really there you know you're
using<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:56.309> know<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> bready<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> nutty

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
using it you know the bready the nutty

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
using it you know the bready the nutty
character<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.350> well<00:00:59.039> brewing

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
character it's all there well brewing

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.369 
character it's all there well brewing
with<00:01:00.090> some<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.329> these<00:01:00.390> English<00:01:00.719> hops<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
with some of these English hops some of

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.200 
with some of these English hops some of
those<00:01:01.469> aromas<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.850> lend<00:01:03.059> themselves

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
those aromas actually lend themselves

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.270 
those aromas actually lend themselves
extremely<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> those<00:01:04.470> Mulcair<00:01:05.070> occurs

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
extremely well to those Mulcair occurs

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.539 
extremely well to those Mulcair occurs
so<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> nose<00:01:06.360> you're<00:01:06.689> getting<00:01:07.280> super<00:01:08.280> rich

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
so in the nose you're getting super rich

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.500 
so in the nose you're getting super rich
malty<00:01:10.250> aroma's<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.790> hint<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
malty aroma's with just a hint of a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.810 
malty aroma's with just a hint of a
grassy<00:01:12.960> field<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.619> know<00:01:13.680> from<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.010> English

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
grassy field you know from the English

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.090 
grassy field you know from the English
hops<00:01:15.119> used<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> finishing<00:01:16.680> gravity<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
hops used but the finishing gravity is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.410 
hops used but the finishing gravity is
high<00:01:17.280> enough<00:01:17.430> there's<00:01:17.759> enough<00:01:18.000> residual

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
high enough there's enough residual

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.039 
high enough there's enough residual
sugar<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> hops<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:20.869> it's<00:01:21.869> not

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
sugar that the hops don't it's not

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
sugar that the hops don't it's not
overkill<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.860> found<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.310> old<00:01:23.460> recipe<00:01:23.939> we

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
overkill we found that old recipe we

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.580 
overkill we found that old recipe we
made<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> beer<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.200> liked<00:01:25.409> how<00:01:25.560> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
made the beer we really liked how it

turned out and the customers went nuts

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630 
turned out and the customers went nuts
for<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.950> certainly<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> first<00:01:29.280> three<00:01:29.430> times

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
for it certainly the first three times

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
decided to make it twice a year once in

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.490 
decided to make it twice a year once in
June<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.439> once<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.759> December<00:01:42.350> Christmas<00:01:43.350> time
