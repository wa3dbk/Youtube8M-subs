00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
glide gout and then you're like wait

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.170 
glide gout and then you're like wait
what<00:03:48.129> did<00:03:48.189> i<00:03:48.280> just<00:03:48.310> read<00:03:48.639> and<00:03:48.819> you<00:03:48.909> end<00:03:49.090> up

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
reading it like 20 bajillion times and

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.439

you're still like wait what did i read

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.770 
you're still like wait what did i read
so<00:03:53.229> what<00:03:53.889> I<00:03:53.919> like<00:03:54.189> to<00:03:54.220> do<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.879> it<00:03:55.209> keeps<00:03:55.629> me

very<00:03:55.810> focused<00:03:56.470> as<00:03:56.650> well<00:03:56.919> is<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.459> just<00:03:57.669> write

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
very focused as well is to just write

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.869 
very focused as well is to just write
like<00:03:58.509> keynotes<00:03:59.079> after<00:03:59.590> each<00:03:59.829> paragraph<00:04:00.340> or<00:04:00.639> so

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
like keynotes after each paragraph or so

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.569 
like keynotes after each paragraph or so
so<00:04:01.509> I<00:04:01.540> can<00:04:01.840> go<00:04:01.959> back<00:04:02.139> later<00:04:02.469> and<00:04:02.680> study<00:04:03.340> from

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
so I can go back later and study from

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.059 
so I can go back later and study from
that<00:04:03.819> and<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.209> helps<00:04:04.599> so<00:04:05.290> much<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.829> don't<00:04:05.919> even

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
that and it helps so much you don't even

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.849 
that and it helps so much you don't even
understand<00:04:06.609> who<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.540> next<00:04:07.780> college<00:04:08.500> study

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859

those of you who are taking math classes

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.399 
those of you who are taking math classes
or<00:05:11.069> statistics<00:05:11.759> I<00:05:11.970> took<00:05:12.300> statistics<00:05:13.199> my

what really helped me is obviously one

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.990 
what really helped me is obviously one
taking<00:05:18.690> book<00:05:18.990> notes<00:05:19.289> because<00:05:19.800> math<00:05:20.550> can<00:05:20.849> get

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
taking book notes because math can get

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.209 
taking book notes because math can get
really<00:05:21.599> confusing<00:05:22.050> really<00:05:22.590> fast<00:05:22.860> and

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
really confusing really fast and

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.279 
really confusing really fast and
especially<00:05:23.729> in<00:05:24.060> college<00:05:24.270> because<00:05:24.690> you're

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
especially in college because you're

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:26.839 
especially in college because you're
basically<00:05:25.710> going<00:05:25.889> to<00:05:26.009> teach<00:05:26.190> yourself<00:05:26.610> the

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
basically going to teach yourself the

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.580 
basically going to teach yourself the
professor<00:05:27.300> just<00:05:27.509> goes<00:05:27.750> over<00:05:27.960> like<00:05:28.259> the<00:05:28.349> main

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
professor just goes over like the main

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.189 
professor just goes over like the main
points<00:05:29.099> in<00:05:29.250> class<00:05:29.580> but<00:05:30.120> sometimes<00:05:30.840> it's<00:05:31.050> not

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
points in class but sometimes it's not

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.870 
points in class but sometimes it's not
very<00:05:31.379> clear<00:05:31.740> so<00:05:31.979> it's<00:05:32.130> very<00:05:32.340> important<00:05:32.819> that

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
very clear so it's very important that

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
it and what I like to do is put it on

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.649 
it and what I like to do is put it on
like<00:05:37.740> flash<00:05:38.219> cards<00:05:38.759> like<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.360> harder

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
like flash cards like the harder

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.020 
like flash cards like the harder
equations<00:05:40.229> that<00:05:40.469> are<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.650> bajillion<00:05:41.030> letters

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
equations that are a bajillion letters

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.629 
equations that are a bajillion letters
and<00:05:42.330> numbers<00:05:42.449> long<00:05:42.990> so<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.740> like<00:05:44.159> to<00:05:44.279> write<00:05:44.430> that

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
and numbers long so I like to write that

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.610 
and numbers long so I like to write that
out<00:05:44.669> and<00:05:45.090> on<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.300> other<00:05:45.449> side<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:46.139> will<00:05:46.229> have

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
out and on the other side I will have

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.559 
out and on the other side I will have
like<00:05:46.860> an<00:05:47.009> example<00:05:47.580> so<00:05:47.819> i<00:05:47.849> can<00:05:48.120> walk<00:05:48.330> myself

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
like an example so i can walk myself

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.300 
like an example so i can walk myself
through<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.259> steps<00:05:49.529> if<00:05:49.830> that<00:05:49.979> makes<00:05:50.190> any

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
through the steps if that makes any
