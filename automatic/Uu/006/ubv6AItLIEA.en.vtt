00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.299 
see how good this will be in the battle
I<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.750> indecent<00:00:31.470> amount<00:00:31.680> of<00:00:31.770> health<00:00:31.980> regen

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
I have indecent amount of health regen

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
I have indecent amount of health regen
so<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> wonder<00:00:33.149> if<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.390> will<00:00:33.540> huming<00:00:34.079> up<00:00:34.200> right

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
so I wonder if it will huming up right

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.860 
so I wonder if it will huming up right
away<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.460> don't<00:00:35.640> die<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.059> one<00:00:36.300> lion<00:00:36.660> I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
away and if we don't die of one lion I

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
away and if we don't die of one lion I
think<00:00:37.140> we're<00:00:37.289> gonna<00:00:37.410> die<00:00:37.679> because<00:00:38.399> he<00:00:38.670> is

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
think we're gonna die because he is

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.150 
think we're gonna die because he is
indeed<00:00:39.120> really<00:00:39.390> strong<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.440> our<00:00:40.679> health<00:00:40.920> regen

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
indeed really strong so our health regen

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.329 
indeed really strong so our health regen
is<00:00:41.489> doing<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:42.300> decent<00:00:43.109> well<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.159> our

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
is doing pretty decent well but our

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.790 
is doing pretty decent well but our
attack<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.089> not<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.870> want<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.230> see<00:00:46.559> in

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

console against a lion
of<00:02:05.009> course<00:02:05.640> we're<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:05.789> wearing<00:02:06.060> any<00:02:06.329> neck

plate<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:42.030> course<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.600> strongest<00:03:42.900> in<00:03:43.290> game

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
plate is of course the strongest in game

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.280 
plate is of course the strongest in game
so<00:03:44.670> we're<00:03:44.850> gonna<00:03:44.940> try<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.300> kill<00:03:45.630> one<00:03:45.660> panel

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
so we're gonna try to kill one panel

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.800 
so we're gonna try to kill one panel
with<00:03:46.650> necro<00:03:47.280> see<00:03:47.580> if<00:03:47.700> that's<00:03:48.120> possible<00:03:48.239> if<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
with necro see if that's possible if the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.160 
with necro see if that's possible if the
five<00:03:49.530> gears<00:03:49.860> indeed<00:03:50.310> better<00:03:50.970> I'm<00:03:51.330> not<00:03:51.360> better

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
five gears indeed better I'm not better

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.550 
five gears indeed better I'm not better
today<00:03:53.160> we're<00:03:53.340> gonna<00:03:53.459> find<00:03:53.820> out<00:03:54.200> today<00:03:55.200> we're

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
today we're gonna find out today we're

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.970 
today we're gonna find out today we're
gonna<00:03:55.739> see<00:03:56.100> if<00:03:56.670> I'm<00:03:56.880> right<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:57.510> not<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.350> say<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.680> am

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
gonna see if I'm right or not I say I am

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.979 
gonna see if I'm right or not I say I am
right<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.489> from<00:03:59.850> five<00:04:00.150> gear<00:04:00.450> is<00:04:00.600> indeed

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
right that from five gear is indeed

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.220 
right that from five gear is indeed
better<00:04:01.519> only<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:02.790> armor<00:04:03.239> wise<00:04:03.480> because<00:04:03.750> not

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
better only in armor wise because not

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.100 
better only in armor wise because not
every<00:04:04.560> sword<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:05.100> stronger<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.570> lot<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.959> the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
every sword is stronger but a lot of the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.500 
every sword is stronger but a lot of the
thoughts<00:04:07.380> are<00:04:07.560> indeed<00:04:07.800> stronger<00:04:08.160> then<00:04:09.060> four

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
thoughts are indeed stronger then four

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.630 
thoughts are indeed stronger then four

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
will we drop an HP last time we were 50%

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.970 
will we drop an HP last time we were 50%
so<00:04:45.150> let's<00:04:45.420> see<00:04:45.660> how<00:04:45.870> good<00:04:46.110> we<00:04:46.170> do<00:04:46.500> with<00:04:46.740> this

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
so let's see how good we do with this

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.310 
so let's see how good we do with this
combo<00:04:47.460> let's<00:04:48.090> hope<00:04:48.210> we<00:04:48.330> get<00:04:48.480> our<00:04:48.600> healing<00:04:49.020> soon

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
combo let's hope we get our healing soon

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.770 
combo let's hope we get our healing soon
to<00:04:49.500> max<00:04:49.800> health<00:04:50.190> well<00:04:51.000> we're<00:04:51.180> not<00:04:51.300> max<00:04:51.570> health

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
to max health well we're not max health

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.810 
to max health well we're not max health
quite<00:04:53.630> what<00:04:54.630> getting<00:04:54.840> there<00:04:55.170> one<00:04:55.500> day<00:04:55.740> come<00:04:56.610> on

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
quite what getting there one day come on

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.450 
quite what getting there one day come on
come<00:04:57.570> on

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
come on

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.920 
come on
keep<00:04:59.460> hitting<00:04:59.850> them<00:04:59.910> a<00:05:00.030> little<00:05:00.390> bit<00:05:00.510> like<00:05:00.720> this

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
keep hitting them a little bit like this

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.130 
keep hitting them a little bit like this
so<00:05:01.170> you<00:05:01.860> can<00:05:01.980> see<00:05:02.340> we<00:05:02.790> are<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.540> little<00:05:03.960> bit

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
so you can see we are a little bit

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.460 
so you can see we are a little bit
stronger<00:05:04.770> with<00:05:05.190> necro<00:05:05.910> in<00:05:06.270> total<00:05:07.230> because

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
stronger with necro in total because

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.410 
stronger with necro in total because
necro<00:05:08.010> has<00:05:08.250> more<00:05:08.460> defence<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.940> total<00:05:09.270> how<00:05:09.360> if

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
necro has more defence a total how if

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.810 
necro has more defence a total how if
you<00:05:09.540> could<00:05:09.660> see<00:05:09.870> in<00:05:10.230> total<00:05:10.740> necro<00:05:11.340> is<00:05:11.520> still

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
you could see in total necro is still

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.910 
you could see in total necro is still
better<00:05:12.060> than<00:05:12.360> every<00:05:12.870> other<00:05:13.020> armorer<00:05:13.530> in<00:05:13.680> game

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
better than every other armorer in game

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.680 
better than every other armorer in game
within<00:05:14.580> speed<00:05:15.120> wise<00:05:16.250> ignore<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:17.820> can<00:05:18.510> say

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
within speed wise ignore this I can say

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.000 
within speed wise ignore this I can say
ignore<00:05:19.260> this<00:05:19.440> armor

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
ignore this armor

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.950 
ignore this armor
so<00:05:20.250> what<00:05:20.430> max<00:05:20.670> health<00:05:20.940> I'm<00:05:21.150> gonna<00:05:21.390> attack<00:05:21.720> this

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
so what max health I'm gonna attack this

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.470 
so what max health I'm gonna attack this
panel<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.590> then<00:05:22.770> we<00:05:22.890> find<00:05:23.160> out<00:05:23.310> it's<00:05:24.000> indeed

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
panel and then we find out it's indeed

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.700 
panel and then we find out it's indeed
necro<00:05:25.520> well<00:05:26.520> indeed<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.330> showed<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:27.960> we<00:05:28.440> even

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
necro well indeed I showed you we even

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.530 
necro well indeed I showed you we even
watch<00:05:28.860> for<00:05:29.070> surfing<00:05:29.400> gear<00:05:29.550> it's<00:05:29.850> impossible

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
watch for surfing gear it's impossible

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.960 
watch for surfing gear it's impossible
to<00:05:30.720> solo<00:05:31.170> a<00:05:31.350> petal<00:05:31.950> so<00:05:32.400> let's<00:05:32.580> see<00:05:32.700> if<00:05:32.820> it's

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
to solo a petal so let's see if it's

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.780 
to solo a petal so let's see if it's
possible<00:05:33.030> with<00:05:33.600> combined<00:05:34.110> gear<00:05:34.410> so<00:05:35.280> let's<00:05:35.550> see

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
possible with combined gear so let's see

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.350 
possible with combined gear so let's see
can<00:05:36.660> we<00:05:36.690> do<00:05:36.930> this<00:05:37.170> I<00:05:37.400> think<00:05:38.400> nuts<00:05:38.790> this<00:05:39.300> is

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
can we do this I think nuts this is

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.150 
can we do this I think nuts this is
should<00:05:39.750> we<00:05:39.780> almost<00:05:40.170> make<00:05:40.320> health<00:05:40.620> again<00:05:40.920> we're

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
should we almost make health again we're

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.000 
should we almost make health again we're
the<00:05:41.310> same<00:05:41.520> health<00:05:41.850> rating<00:05:42.690> as<00:05:42.870> him<00:05:43.110> so<00:05:43.860> we

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
the same health rating as him so we

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.860 
the same health rating as him so we
gonna<00:05:44.250> keep<00:05:44.490> doing<00:05:44.550> these<00:05:45.030> circle<00:05:45.600> hits

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
gonna keep doing these circle hits

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.870 
gonna keep doing these circle hits
because<00:05:46.320> then<00:05:46.530> we<00:05:46.650> make<00:05:46.830> sure<00:05:47.040> we<00:05:47.220> always<00:05:47.460> hit

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
because then we make sure we always hit

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.060 
because then we make sure we always hit
him<00:05:48.030> because<00:05:48.810> he<00:05:48.960> will<00:05:49.110> knock<00:05:49.350> us<00:05:49.560> and<00:05:49.800> at<00:05:49.920> the

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
him because he will knock us and at the

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.820 
him because he will knock us and at the
moment<00:05:50.280> we<00:05:50.580> can<00:05:50.760> hit<00:05:51.000> him<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:51.330> now<00:05:52.230> it's

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
moment we can hit him and now it's

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.800 
moment we can hit him and now it's
possible<00:05:53.520> can<00:05:53.850> we<00:05:54.000> actually<00:05:54.150> do<00:05:54.480> this<00:05:54.630> oh

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
possible can we actually do this oh

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.160 
possible can we actually do this oh
really

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
really

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.160 
really
and<00:05:55.350> like<00:05:55.710> one<00:05:55.950> HP<00:05:56.130> left<00:05:56.660> in<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.810> end<00:05:57.960> foot

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
and like one HP left in the end foot

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.790 
and like one HP left in the end foot
pedal<00:05:58.470> pedal

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
pedal pedal

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.980 
pedal pedal
okay<00:05:59.220> we<00:05:59.340> got<00:05:59.460> a<00:05:59.490> heal<00:05:59.760> again<00:05:59.910> nice<00:06:00.570> healing

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
okay we got a heal again nice healing

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.710 
okay we got a heal again nice healing
time<00:06:01.200> I<00:06:01.470> think<00:06:02.010> we're<00:06:02.160> not<00:06:02.400> gonna<00:06:02.640> do<00:06:02.850> this<00:06:03.000> but

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
time I think we're not gonna do this but

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.670 
time I think we're not gonna do this but
we're<00:06:03.930> gonna<00:06:04.050> get<00:06:04.470> quite<00:06:04.980> really<00:06:05.700> close<00:06:06.680> but

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
we're gonna get quite really close but

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.490 
we're gonna get quite really close but
 one<00:06:08.610> HP<00:06:09.060> so<00:06:09.480> this<00:06:09.690> is<00:06:09.840> indeed<00:06:10.230> possible

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
 one HP so this is indeed possible

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.590 
 one HP so this is indeed possible
to<00:06:10.890> do<00:06:11.010> if<00:06:11.220> you<00:06:11.370> have<00:06:11.490> a<00:06:11.520> right<00:06:11.940> health<00:06:12.270> regen

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
to do if you have a right health regen

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.000 
to do if you have a right health regen
at<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:13.050> right<00:06:13.260> time<00:06:13.530> sir

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
at the right time sir

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.800 
at the right time sir
in<00:06:14.690> theory<00:06:15.690> it's<00:06:16.320> possible<00:06:16.470> to<00:06:16.980> do<00:06:17.100> this<00:06:17.810> logic

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
in theory it's possible to do this logic

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.980 
in theory it's possible to do this logic
it's<00:06:19.440> nuts<00:06:19.680> okay<00:06:20.550> I<00:06:20.850> hope<00:06:21.180> you<00:06:21.330> enjoy<00:06:21.690> it<00:06:21.750> and<00:06:21.900> I
