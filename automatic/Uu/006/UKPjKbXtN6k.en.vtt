00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:39.530
 Is not you but the voice of the Final Attack Ride flows as a voice 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:42.160
 The front and back are like this Let's check the voice

 Yes, it was two introductions of diend &amp; Kai Niyo in the special power screen of csm 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:27.200
