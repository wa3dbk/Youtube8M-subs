00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.259
 very good people of good to all and 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.920
 welcome to a new video in the mode 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.660
 of the world ' 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.289
 I'm going to show you today a little trick 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.560
 you've seen the cover about it 's free 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:19.230
 infinite as if free envelopes 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.240
 infinite for everyone for everyone 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.039
 so I'm going to teach you before 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.070
 I do not want to thank you for continuing 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.830
 being here as not and the truth that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.980
 this way because I love me 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.080
 love because also with this that you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.300
 I'm going to teach I think it's worth it 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.820
 you are going to have to spend coins because 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.190
 As always all my tips 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.809
 I will share it with you. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.800
 first of all also in the record where 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.930
 you have 17 won 8 draws and 319 lost 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.820
 that's the reason why they give me the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.980
 envelopes now I'm going to show you how I 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.859
 said the first thing you have to do if 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.590
 you want to do it since imagine the 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.059
 amount of money and coins that you are going 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.350
 to save since you're not going to have to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.110
 spend your coins 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.119
 for nothing that yes depending on the number 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.250
 of envelopes that you want then that is the 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.200
 time you are going to have to spend but 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.509
 let's see it the first thing you have to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.979
 do for all those who 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.110
 want to make it get out very many 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.119
 envelopes is to put it in the worst template 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.590
 that you have something, I am going to teach you 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.530
 for example all the players that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.899
 I have that they are the smallest in average 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.850
 I have put them and I have filled them 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.210
 contracts to more than 90 is not necessary 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.880
 fill the 90 but you can fill them all 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.920
 those that you want since for it 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.740
 we need to do the following myself now 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.400
 same I have four in the store and all 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.890
 they are free we are going to see it 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.780
 to see them look at me about I have four of 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.970
 those who give you a player who are 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.190
 by matches many of you at 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.250
 you know better and you have been able to 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.680
 check in yesterday in two pac opening that 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.250
 I did from live tweet I did it in 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.170
 direct I got a surprise many 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.470
 You already know but now I'm going to 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.480
 teach let's see how it is done 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.100
 very easy after doing that 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.440
 have a template full of contracts 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.980
 you do not have to fill it up but we 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.170
 we put in tournaments a player 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.330
 I think it's worth it, I think that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.890
 they will remove it because the truth that the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.709
 fifa is losing a lot very much 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.420
 money since for example I 'm not going 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.730
 to cheat and I 'm not going to spend coins 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.230
 in these players that can barely be 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.690
 sell or because I can not sell then 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.300
 for what 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.340
 why what is it that does not let me 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.000
 to be coins and it's already good you give 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.550
 play match you give to continue had 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 Four envelopes in the store is you give 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.990
 all accept against the tournament machine 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.860
 a player against the machine 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.710
 and look at how simple it is since in 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.240
 an hour or so you can get 99 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.970
 envelopes 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.850
 that's not going to leave players all 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.100
 good but it does not matter that of the 99 look 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.930
 here you quickly give the start and neither 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.180
 even start the game you give him 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.150
 to start to pause again and leave and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.890
 fast the game so easy is a 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.600
 bitch like that because you're going to spend time and 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.600
 in your markers will appear as 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.940
 that you have lost but good if the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.130
 people 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.200
 he does not like it to appear that to me 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.180
 neither the truth but it happened that 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.070
 spend me coins happened to spend me 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.590
 coins gives me the same as it appears in 310 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.190
 lost and that and that I do not care 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.980
 no matter have had four and now as 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.660
 You see, I have five so you can do it 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.610
 as many times as you want until 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.720
 surely patch in this since as 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.670
 I said the fifa will be losing 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.920
 a lot of money since the people who 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.690
 know this because logically I think that no 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.600
 will open on unless it is lined 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.040
 of coins or pasta and give equal and not 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.960
 I want to spend time but I get 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.870
 same spend an hour because or can 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.519
 teach the template that I have made 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.800
 that I have made the plant that I have 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.600
 done and everything with free envelopes 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.880
 Also, in case you do not believe it now 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.560
 then you will see the live that 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.350
 I did yesterday and you are going to see an envelope 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.230
 I'm going to let him also look 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.790
 what template do I have to boateng khedira 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.080
 podolski a dual came out yesterday too 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.150
 live 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:22.990
 sun los gómez adler I do not do what 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:26.170
 drowned host with book with this one jones and 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.670
 joao pereira and they look at all the players 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.340
 that I have also around here look 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.380
 Look look at this is Cristiano Ronaldo and 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.420
 as you already know here the players do not know 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.020
 you can buy this I have taken out in the 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.650
 second parties and you do not see he wanted her not 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.200
 You see I also wanted her I do not know if you remember 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.630
 in previous videos I said that the 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.340
 of the fifa would surely give me 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.110
 Christian when it could not be sold and 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.210
 the truth that I thank you for 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.470
 have given it to me in this way because if I 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.340
 it comes out in the other it would have 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.669
 discarded as I said in some video but 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.370
 good for you to see cristian or xavi 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.030

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.430
 Vctor valdés courtois that good series 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.500
 guzmán djukic joao moutinho and choose 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.590
 david villa hernandez 'chicharito' 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.960
 fernando towers with boots in 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.710
 silverstone in valbuena same le diamant 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.990

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.570
 number of players weeks the color 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.370

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.720

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.990
 verbal in montreal 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.840
 alexandre duck and macció or look at the 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.970
 number of players and all as 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.370
 free all free so take advantage 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.350
 do not hesitate to do this that nothing happens 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.720
 that yes you will have your matches 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.729
 lost but who cares you do not go 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.039
 to be worse for having 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.689
 Lost matches does not matter because no 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.219
 is going to lower the average or anything and I think 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:02.219
 which is worth it because you are going to 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:03.240
 save a lot of coins and I think that 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.360
 it's worth it because you're going to have 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.099
 your team is no longer will not be not 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.449
 as I said before this patch it 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.339
 because I think that shortly they will 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.729
 patch and so take advantage 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:16.080
 quickly and play games 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.150
 let's do it again so you can see 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.960
 Now I have five so you can see that 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.470
 it was given to me by nobody or anything 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.810
 to watch or to the game a player 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.060
 and we give you fast to accept to accept 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.400
 continue to depend as I said 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.260
 I've put 95 contracts to do it 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.730
 those 90 times not to do all five and 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.400

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.350

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.200
 that and soon if they do not remove it 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.670
 I'll upload some other direct and now 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.100
 after doing this to finish the 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:50.810
 video as I said I'll show you the 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:53.390
 little bit of how I get an envelope very very 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.850
 good also as you have seen Christian 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.680
 ronaldo that's the one I'm going to teach 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.270
 the free envelopes that there are very many 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.880
 You can also check people in 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.130
 tweets on many sites on twitter 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.040
 in all the sites have been spent 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.810
 many millions 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.170
 looking for a Christian and it has not come out 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.960

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.450

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.210

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.479
