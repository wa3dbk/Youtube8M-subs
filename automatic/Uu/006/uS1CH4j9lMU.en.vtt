I<00:02:44.970> think<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.810> bench<00:02:45.960> is<00:02:46.080> critical<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.560> our

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
I think the bench is critical to our

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.080 
I think the bench is critical to our
success<00:02:47.040> there's<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.580> can't<00:02:47.820> win<00:02:47.970> without

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
success there's we can't win without

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.870 
success there's we can't win without
them<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.080> they<00:02:49.320> are<00:02:49.500> probably<00:02:50.250> our<00:02:50.730> best

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
them and and they are probably our best

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.460 
them and and they are probably our best
asset<00:02:51.390> right<00:02:51.540> now<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.140> think<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.380> have

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
asset right now because I think we have

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.380 
asset right now because I think we have
the<00:02:52.530> best<00:02:52.680> depth<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.430> any<00:02:54.030> team<00:02:54.240> in<00:02:54.270> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the best depth of any team in the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.270 
the best depth of any team in the
country<00:02:54.420> we've<00:02:55.230> we've<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:55.710> got<00:02:55.890> some<00:02:55.920> really

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
country we've we've just got some really

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.980 
country we've we've just got some really
good<00:02:56.520> players<00:02:56.640> coming<00:02:57.000> off<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.270> bench<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.690> we

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
good players coming off the bench we we

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.890 
good players coming off the bench we we
get<00:02:58.110> better<00:02:58.410> offensively<00:02:59.690> coming<00:03:00.690> off<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
get better offensively coming off the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.350 
get better offensively coming off the
bench<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.410> think<00:03:01.740> that<00:03:02.130> they're<00:03:03.000> they're

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
bench so I think that they're they're

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.240 
bench so I think that they're they're
very<00:03:03.660> important<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:04.800> need<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.130> keep

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
very important and and we need to keep

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.080 
very important and and we need to keep
them<00:03:05.870> scoring<00:03:06.870> especially<00:03:07.620> hurry<00:03:08.220> there's<00:03:09.000> no
