00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.740
 youtube inspiration 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.629
 I'll show you how to do this today 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.099
 can make headband here and that 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.510
 suitable for my t-shirt what me 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.340
 you have seen recently 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.740
 maybe it's the same color 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 these are the rest of the t-shirt was 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.010
 I made hair here last time and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.210
 yes from the rest you can still such a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.400
 make cool hair band 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
 I'll show you how to do that now 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.000
 needs a bit of a t 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.500
 shirt so that's the hem with me 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.660
 I cut off last time as 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.969
 I have a t shirt itself designed me 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.079
 I also need a hair tie 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.329
 and a pair of scissors 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.520
 I cut off my t-shirt one 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.629
 about two centimeters wide 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.300
 strip off so just something like that is 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.940
 strip that I cut off here once 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.200
 cut along that way 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.260
 that's why it's important for you to do that before 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.329
 exactly on top of each other puts so synonymous 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.039
 just the strip will be when it is 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.320
 perfect right now it's not that bad 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.100
 but it should be evenly wide 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.100
 be about 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.620
 so that's the strip and the cutting edge 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:22.040
 I now apart at the side so 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:25.430
 on both sides so I two so 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.010
 strip and now I cut 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.320
 just again from my 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.990
 t-shirt his stripes off and do that 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.460
 same at the end i have four stripes 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.640
 but I only need 33 strips 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.229
 I agree and draws this long 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.920
 so that they pull together and so on 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.920
 grant 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.420
 the streaking here goes about it 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.860
 You can just go for the next one 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.860
 use bluetooth 11 project 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.519
 These are my three stripes 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.280
 and now my hair gum comes to me 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.890
 could now the strip so one 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.750
 Just touch on the hair tie here 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.750
 best with a double knot 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.880
 so now comes the next strip 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.880
 I could do that here as well 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:51.109
 In the third one, it's just like that here 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.409
 do not relax a job but a job 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:58.720
 solid double knot on it with 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:01.129
 are well secured at you the halimi 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.349
 so the hair tie I have to go somewhere now 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.939
 either short ingo or here 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.730
 For example, also stick to the table 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.260
 with the strip 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.819
 I 'm doing this with a strip now 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.349
 duct tape and now you just have to 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.349
 braid beautifully tight 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.739
 so far I have flowed now 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:49.250
 back off because now you have to first 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.250
 test how it covers my head 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.360
 and that should just with the hair elastic 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.750
 to fit together a head like that 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.000
 that suits me the same way and that's why 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.230
 I could just go here too 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.909
 again the ends 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.950
 So just make feather double knots 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.519
 and every single band is behind here 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.519
 balls 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.300
 so the bands are all offers and the 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.560
 reste I always have good double here 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.730
 I can do it now 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.730
 just cut off here 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.610
 so unfinished is the hair band made of fabric 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.290
 that really looks nice too 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.340
 you wear that on the hair so you 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.470
 either can top just like that 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.010
 Wear hairband or as a headband 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.420
 or if you ask for it several times 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.930
 one can also do something about the braid 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.670
 do 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.400
 So there are many again 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.870
 various possibilities 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.660
 if you like it then you can do it 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.250
 yes imitate and write but in 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.660
 the comments we you like that one 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.190
 Of course, this can also be done in different ways 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.380
 So, colors make of three 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.940
 different t shirts strip 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.410
 cut off but really takes old t 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.690
 shirts and can do that in three colors 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.000
 make or with two different ones 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.470
 colors or as it did 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.380
 in monochrome there are really many 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.790
 possibilities and always looks great 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.340
 If you like that then I am glad 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.830

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.220

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.270
 on my other bracelets and 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.760
