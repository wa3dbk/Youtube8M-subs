00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.080 
see the newness in the front end you
especially<00:02:44.709> see<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.129> use<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.430> LED<00:02:45.849> technology

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090

on<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.080> front<00:02:47.290> headlight<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.099> see<00:02:48.340> how<00:02:48.550> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
on the front headlight you see how the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.220 
on the front headlight you see how the
daytime<00:02:49.150> running<00:02:49.180> lights<00:02:49.720> are<00:02:49.989> being

something<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.290> basically<00:02:54.160> see<00:02:54.580> immediately

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
something you basically see immediately

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.060 
something you basically see immediately
as<00:02:55.269> an<00:02:55.420> icon<00:02:55.900> when<00:02:56.349> you<00:02:56.470> see<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.770> in<00:02:56.860> the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
traffic furthermore you see further down

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.339 
traffic furthermore you see further down
here<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.580> design<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.210> new<00:03:01.330> grille<00:03:01.600> we

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
here the design of the new grille we

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.500 
here the design of the new grille we
integrated<00:03:03.040> all<00:03:03.219> the<00:03:03.280> restrictions<00:03:03.909> as<00:03:04.299> far

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
integrated all the restrictions as far

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.629 
integrated all the restrictions as far
as<00:03:04.629> passions<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.140> safety<00:03:05.560> internal<00:03:06.400> safety

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
as passions of safety internal safety

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.910 
as passions of safety internal safety
everything<00:03:07.209> into<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.629> design<00:03:08.019> but<00:03:08.739> I

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
everything into this design but I

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.129 
everything into this design but I
believe<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.879> very<00:03:10.120> clever<00:03:10.389> way<00:03:10.719> that<00:03:10.989> we're

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
believe in a very clever way that we're

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.459 
believe in a very clever way that we're
actually<00:03:11.670> harking<00:03:12.670> back<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.909> the<00:03:13.870> tradition

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
actually harking back to the tradition

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.050 
actually harking back to the tradition
of<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.769> somewhat<00:03:15.159> larger<00:03:15.579> grill<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.939> the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
of a somewhat larger grill of the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.360 
of a somewhat larger grill of the
original<00:03:16.450> minis<00:03:16.749> and<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.469> way<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.680> believe<00:03:17.980> we

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
original minis and that way I believe we

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.809 
original minis and that way I believe we
strike<00:03:18.969> the<00:03:19.120> balance<00:03:19.299> between<00:03:19.540> heritage<00:03:20.409> and

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
strike the balance between heritage and

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.520 
strike the balance between heritage and
innovation<00:03:21.819> in<00:03:21.969> one<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.480> we've<00:03:22.930> managed<00:03:23.379> to

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
innovation in one and we've managed to

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.369 
innovation in one and we've managed to
keep<00:03:24.129> this<00:03:24.310> overhang<00:03:24.969> very<00:03:25.569> compact<00:03:26.109> very

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
keep this overhang very compact very

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.740 
keep this overhang very compact very

small as we move to the side view you
will<00:03:29.049> definitely<00:03:29.349> see<00:03:29.799> that<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.129> car<00:03:30.370> has

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
will definitely see that the car has

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.500 
will definitely see that the car has
