00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.580 
that works for me whether I'm wearing a
big<00:00:17.310> throw<00:00:17.730> which<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.660> wore<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.960> work<00:00:19.109> by<00:00:19.529> the

way with success or wearing my hair in
twists<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.150> twist<00:00:25.050> outs<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.980> formula<00:00:26.910> has

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
twists or twist outs this formula has

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.099 
twists or twist outs this formula has
worked<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.130> me<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.090> last<00:00:30.330> five<00:00:30.840> weeks
