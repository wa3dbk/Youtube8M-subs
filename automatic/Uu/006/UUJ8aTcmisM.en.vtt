00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
stone for all that to make it look more

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.369 
stone for all that to make it look more
of<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.430> city<00:00:59.760> type<00:01:00.090> map<00:01:00.420> instead<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.960> see<00:01:01.199> how

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
of a city type map instead of see how

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.810 
of a city type map instead of see how
it's<00:01:01.590> over<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.789> like

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it's over here and then I have like

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
it's over here and then I have like
another<00:01:03.210> building<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.840> having<00:01:04.080> grass<00:01:04.470> this

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
another building and having grass this

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.440 
another building and having grass this
area<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:05.549> done<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.970> that's<00:01:06.119> why<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.360> looks

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
area is not done so that's why it looks

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
area is not done so that's why it looks
like<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.500> replace<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> with

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
like that but replace all that with

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.840 
like that but replace all that with
stone<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:10.350> will<00:01:10.439> look<00:01:10.560> very<00:01:10.619> good<00:01:11.040> now<00:01:11.700> at

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
stone and it will look very good now at

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.300 
stone and it will look very good now at
the<00:01:12.000> end<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.360> your<00:01:12.570> roads<00:01:12.840> put<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.799> block<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the end of your roads put a block of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.469 
the end of your roads put a block of
sandstone<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.540> put<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.119> make<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
sandstone and then put this to make it

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.100 
sandstone and then put this to make it
look<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.640> streetlights<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.900> looks

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
look you know streetlights so it looks

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
look you know streetlights so it looks
better<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.560> hopefully<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.369> guys<00:01:23.460> got<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
better and hopefully you guys got the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.630 
better and hopefully you guys got the
design<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> road<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.259> once<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.369> have

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
design of the road and once you have

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.859 
design of the road and once you have
made<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.850> building<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.540> could<00:01:27.780> probably

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
made a building as you could probably

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
made a building as you could probably
tell<00:01:28.140> there's<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.560> lot<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.950> grass<00:01:29.310> around<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
tell there's a lot of grass around the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.569 
tell there's a lot of grass around the
building<00:01:30.390> almost<00:01:31.140> every<00:01:31.409> building<00:01:31.590> has<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
building almost every building has it it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.249 
building almost every building has it it
gives<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.030> better<00:01:33.150> look<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> another

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
gives it a better look to it another

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.539 
gives it a better look to it another
different<00:01:34.829> color<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> house<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
different color to the to the house it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.969 
different color to the to the house it
makes<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> stand<00:01:39.119> out<00:01:39.329> more<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:40.590> here

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
makes it stand out more and right here

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.310 
makes it stand out more and right here
is<00:01:41.130> another<00:01:41.880> style<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.899> with

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
is another style that you can do with

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
is another style that you can do with
the<00:01:43.439> grass<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:44.100> green<00:01:44.520> wool<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.030> then

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the grass it's green wool and then

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.630 
the grass it's green wool and then
normal<00:01:45.689> grass<00:01:45.930> which<00:01:46.680> looks<00:01:47.009> very<00:01:47.250> good<00:01:47.460> if

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
normal grass which looks very good if

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210 
normal grass which looks very good if
you<00:01:47.759> fly<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.130> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you fly up you can see that you know it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.920 
you fly up you can see that you know it
looks<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.549> normal<00:01:50.909> grass<00:01:51.090> instead<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> just

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
looks like normal grass instead of just

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.399 
looks like normal grass instead of just
