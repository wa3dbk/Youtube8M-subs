00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.550
 eleven thousand cans of tomato puree in the spuiplein in the hague the five band members 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.859
 of lpg plus some helping hands 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.539
 with the aim of creating the largest record sleeve ever made 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.460
 the idea came from keyboardist martin ter veen and guitarist anne van 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.380
 algae 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.980
 with a book full of sketches the thousands of sparkles are put in a form 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.849
 so that a kind of mosaic is created 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.289
 the image the five band members of lpg can only be seen from the height 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.170
 well we have 4 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 we made a big inconvenience 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.640
 in camps 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.770
 you can expect 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.170
 awkward for every one 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.740
 have a building plan there 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.000
 and that is and it was often open 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 b three must be a week 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.950
 but yes year in all shapes and sizes measured below 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.330
 only this piece can also be done separately 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.700
 on the way at least half fall with the women at the desk 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.070
 first we made the band mistakes 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.579
 out of the pan but the real paws up 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:11.850
 beaverwijk 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.130
 and then we made a very high contrast of this here 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.210
 and all of this was have 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 batch forward to find processed photoshop 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.140
 and try to enlarge it for five years 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.460
 actually came 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.580
 I found the map from 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.579
 the so-called artists have a lot of attention 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.789
 bath in sets some think the world is there to see others think it's one 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.410
 map of the Netherlands 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.290
 the band members continue to explain to the audience that it is a record cover 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 what came up but I wonder if it will work out well 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.430
 I assume we have been the player who knows how the tomatoes are the Christian ones 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.430
 standards in a way that we used as pixels by 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.270
 it's for the world 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.940
 after almost seven hours of extreme concentration and lack of strength, the eleven thousand 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.960
 turned out in the right order 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.640
 photographers row a box and brave his fear of heights and go with a platform 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.209
 to the top the artwork seems to have succeeded the kadijkweg 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.669
 there you become a garden 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.519
 order observers expect the sale from your employer 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.569
 after the photos are taken with the spuiplein as quickly as possible 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.600
 swept clean 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.829
 seven Russians possibly destroyed within a few minutes 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.250
 or they get a gigantic record cover and mention in the knowledge book 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.079
 agreement is not yet known 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.090
 the second album from lpg will be released next March
