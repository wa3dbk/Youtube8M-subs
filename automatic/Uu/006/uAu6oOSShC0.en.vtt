00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.900
 It comes in three colors for hair 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.369
 dark light brown or blond apart the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.439
 product this comes with a brush 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.449
 patented to which we will give double 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.189
 use also forget to use the gloves 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.800
 we do not want to touch directly the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.470
 chemicals and finally use a towel 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.070
 or old shirt that you do not mind if you 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.680
 harms 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.880
 do not be scared with this first step this 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 is what is going to give that natural touch 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.950
 and degraded when styling hair 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.930
 gently up the dye does not go 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.370
 to be left with a straight line 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.000
 this is exactly what we want 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.340
 avoid 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 we want the color to be gradually little to 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.930
 little is getting clearer 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.790
 after beating all your hair and staying 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.130
 ready for a halloween costume is 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.650
 time to mix the product if you're like 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.059
 I clueless have the instructions to 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.400
 hand to make sure you're mixing 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.170
 the product correctly but it is very 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.850
 easy since each product has its 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 number so it's not way to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.170
 get confused 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.760
 start with bottle number 1 and apply 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.990
 the powder decolorizer that has the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.750
 number 2 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.759
 close the bottle and shake it very well 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.720
 to mix it then add the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.210
 number 3 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.640
 equally shakes it very well then 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.259
 change the lid by the applicator so that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.710
 it's easier for you to apply it in the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.170
 brush 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.869
 now well in the fun part apply 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.330
 the product once again do not forget 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.520
 use your gloves 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.100
 do not do like me in this part of the video 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.070
 apply without fear the product in 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.770
 brush the more the better as the more 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.410
 product you have put faster will be 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.570
 the process starts by dividing the hair 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.270
 in half and throwing it forward 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.970
 little by little you are applying the product of 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.070
 the tips up you decide what 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.430
 so much you want to apply as it is to your 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.890
 taste 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.960
 I decided to apply the product until this 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.460
 level make sure both sides have 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.470
 the same amount of product and that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.540
 are at the same height we do not want a 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.990
 half hair lighter than the other 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.300
 Wait 10 minutes after 10 minutes 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.000
 little by little the product goes up to 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.040
 second level desired I apply it a 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.600
 little inclined as you can see because 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.000
 I had in mind to cut him a little 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.240
 stepped a cut was not needed 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.190
 urgent checking the color of the dye 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.650
 meanwhile you should also take in 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.870
 count the temperature where you are if 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.610
 it is very hot the chemical acts more 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.500
 fast instead if you are in full 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.800
 winter with a lot of cold in the room 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.040
 they will take longer 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.590
 and then to bathe make sure to remove 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.990
 the product totally so that it does not follow 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.880
 acting on your hair I needed 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.250
 urgently go to that I will cut the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.990
 tips was not due to the dye was something that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.870
 I had to do and I took advantage so that 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.150
 transformation out total then what 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.370

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.230
