out so for this tutorial you can do one

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.080 
out so for this tutorial you can do one
of<00:01:04.420> two<00:01:04.570> things<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:05.800> Jen's<00:01:06.369> earrings<00:01:06.880> are

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.120 
of two things so Jen's earrings are
sparkly<00:01:07.900> but<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.440> don't<00:01:08.530> necessarily<00:01:08.680> have

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
sparkly but you don't necessarily have

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
to make them Sparkle if you want to if

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.700 
to make them Sparkle if you want to if
you<00:01:11.890> opt<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.820> not<00:01:12.850> make<00:01:13.330> them<00:01:13.479> sparkly<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.530> can

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
you opt to not make them sparkly you can

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.230 
you opt to not make them sparkly you can
go<00:01:14.830> ahead<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.160> take<00:01:15.550> your<00:01:15.610> earring<00:01:15.910> back

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
go ahead and take your earring back

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.810 
go ahead and take your earring back
which<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.290> just<00:01:17.560> have<00:01:17.650> this<00:01:17.800> flat<00:01:18.340> little<00:01:18.520> disk

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
which I just have this flat little disk

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.680 
which I just have this flat little disk
and<00:01:19.119> that<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.300> has<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:20.320> part<00:01:20.530> where<00:01:20.710> your

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
and that it has the the part where your

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.030 
and that it has the the part where your
that<00:01:22.690> goes<00:01:22.869> inside<00:01:23.050> your<00:01:23.380> earring<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:23.830> then<00:01:23.979> I

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
that goes inside your earring and then I

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.530 
that goes inside your earring and then I
have<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.420> stopper<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.590> can<00:01:26.710> go<00:01:26.830> ahead<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.540> glue

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
have a stopper you can go ahead and glue

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.290 
have a stopper you can go ahead and glue
that<00:01:28.690> on<00:01:28.840> there<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:30.490> before<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.850> start<00:01:31.270> your

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
that on there but before you start your

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.749 
that on there but before you start your
project<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:31.990> definitely<00:01:32.380> suggest<00:01:32.800> warming<00:01:33.640> up

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
project I definitely suggest warming up

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.290 
project I definitely suggest warming up
your<00:01:33.910> glue<00:01:34.119> gun<00:01:34.149> before<00:01:34.869> you<00:01:35.910> start<00:01:36.910> cutting

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
your glue gun before you start cutting

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.150 
your glue gun before you start cutting
so<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:37.840> by<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:37.990> time<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.410> get<00:01:38.649> around<00:01:38.710> to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
so that by the time you get around to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.650 
so that by the time you get around to
gluing<00:01:39.759> your<00:01:40.229> earring<00:01:41.229> onto<00:01:41.679> the<00:01:41.979> felt<00:01:42.660> the

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
gluing your earring onto the felt the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.910 
gluing your earring onto the felt the

whenever<00:02:01.810> using<00:02:02.170> glitter<00:02:02.580> for<00:02:03.580> any<00:02:03.850> project<00:02:04.240> I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
whenever using glitter for any project I

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.900 
whenever using glitter for any project I
definitely<00:02:04.929> suggest<00:02:05.350> having<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:06.009> sheet<00:02:06.880> of

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
definitely suggest having a sheet of

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.740 
definitely suggest having a sheet of
paper<00:02:08.009> laid<00:02:09.009> down<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:09.670> when<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.539> have<00:02:10.630> your

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
paper laid down so when you have your

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.570 
paper laid down so when you have your
project<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.770> paper<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.190> can<00:02:12.310> pour<00:02:12.550> the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
project on the paper you can pour the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.850 
project on the paper you can pour the
glitter<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.180> when<00:02:13.930> you're<00:02:14.050> finished<00:02:14.470> you

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
glitter and when you're finished you

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.140 
glitter and when you're finished you
just<00:02:15.550> open<00:02:16.060> up<00:02:16.180> your<00:02:16.360> vial<00:02:16.990> or<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.680> container

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
just open up your vial or your container

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.780 
just open up your vial or your container
fold<00:02:19.150> your<00:02:19.330> piece<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.569> paper<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:20.020> half<00:02:20.290> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
fold your piece of paper in half and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.260 
fold your piece of paper in half and
then<00:02:21.790> you'll<00:02:22.209> be<00:02:22.330> able<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.709> pour<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:24.270> the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
then you'll be able to pour the the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.930 
then you'll be able to pour the the
unused<00:02:26.140> glitter<00:02:26.410> back<00:02:26.770> into<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.130> vial<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.849> you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
unused glitter back into the vial so you

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.100 
unused glitter back into the vial so you
don't<00:02:28.090> waste<00:02:28.330> any

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
don't waste any

very<00:04:30.419> happy<00:04:31.419> with<00:04:32.260> how<00:04:32.620> this<00:04:32.800> turned<00:04:32.860> out<00:04:33.280> a

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
very happy with how this turned out a

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.080 
very happy with how this turned out a
little<00:04:35.560> tip<00:04:35.740> though<00:04:35.979> if<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:36.400> happen<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.850> put<00:04:37.060> a

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
little tip though if you happen to put a

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.210 
little tip though if you happen to put a
lot<00:04:37.510> it<00:04:38.080> would<00:04:38.260> might<00:04:38.560> soak<00:04:38.919> through<00:04:39.130> which

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
lot it would might soak through which

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.270 
lot it would might soak through which
the<00:04:39.370> back<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:40.180> once<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:40.740> finishes<00:04:41.740> drying

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
the back so once that finishes drying

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.430 
the back so once that finishes drying
just<00:04:42.970> flip<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.330> over<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.050> rest<00:04:44.229> can

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
just flip it over so that the rest can

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.830 
just flip it over so that the rest can
dry<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:44.979> I<00:04:45.310> always<00:04:45.460> worked<00:04:45.789> on<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.450> sheet<00:04:46.810> of

she had a seven point star for earring

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.510 
she had a seven point star for earring
but<00:05:07.360> as<00:05:07.660> i<00:05:07.690> watched<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.139> show<00:05:08.380> its<00:05:08.770> switch

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
but as i watched the show its switch

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.580 
but as i watched the show its switch
between<00:05:09.820> a<00:05:10.000> seven<00:05:10.419> point<00:05:10.599> and<00:05:10.870> an<00:05:11.020> eight<00:05:11.260> point

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
between a seven point and an eight point

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.770 
between a seven point and an eight point
i<00:05:11.830> believe<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:12.880> if<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.090> have<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.539> general

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
i believe that if you have the general

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.080 
i believe that if you have the general
you<00:05:14.289> know<00:05:14.410> shape<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:14.950> idea<00:05:15.310> of<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.760> glittery

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
you know shape and idea of the glittery

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.560 
you know shape and idea of the glittery
star<00:05:16.570> earring<00:05:17.940> then<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:19.180> don't<00:05:19.360> think<00:05:19.510> it

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
star earring then I don't think it

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.629 
star earring then I don't think it
really<00:05:19.599> matters<00:05:19.750> if<00:05:20.169> it's<00:05:20.320> seven<00:05:21.010> points<00:05:21.400> or

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
really matters if it's seven points or

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.900 
really matters if it's seven points or
eight<00:05:22.539> points<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.979> I<00:05:24.010> just<00:05:24.160> want<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:24.370> let<00:05:24.760> you
