00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920

out<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.220> spray<00:02:21.819> some<00:02:22.060> cleaner<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.959> pad<00:02:23.170> and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
out I spray some cleaner on the pad and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.710 
out I spray some cleaner on the pad and
then<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.799> just<00:02:24.129> rub<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:24.879> on<00:02:25.000> one<00:02:25.150> side<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.390> then

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
then I just rub it on one side and then

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.839 
then I just rub it on one side and then
scrub<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.769> other<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.430> dries<00:02:27.640> off

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
scrub it on the other so it dries off

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.580 
scrub it on the other so it dries off
and<00:02:28.090> as<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.360> can<00:02:28.510> see<00:02:28.540> all<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.019> paint<00:02:29.319> is<00:02:29.440> gone

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
and as you can see all the paint is gone

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.430 
and as you can see all the paint is gone
so<00:02:29.830> it's<00:02:29.980> really<00:02:30.129> not<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.370> hard<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.670> clean

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
so it's really not that hard to clean

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.330
