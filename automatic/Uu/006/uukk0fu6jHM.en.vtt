strategies<00:03:06.389> as<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:06.989> see<00:03:07.170> from<00:03:07.350> my<00:03:07.950> other

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
strategies as you can see from my other

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.849 
strategies as you can see from my other
videos<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.880> some<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.510> my<00:03:09.569> strategies<00:03:10.019> and

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
videos that some of my strategies and

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.949 
videos that some of my strategies and
they're<00:03:11.250> not<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.549> best<00:03:11.730> I'm<00:03:12.209> definitely

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
they're not the best I'm definitely

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.150 
they're not the best I'm definitely
looking<00:03:13.200> forward<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:15.709> refine<00:03:16.709> them<00:03:16.859> I'll

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
looking forward to refine them I'll

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.979 
looking forward to refine them I'll
probably<00:03:17.459> send<00:03:18.030> an<00:03:18.150> update<00:03:18.420> video<00:03:18.540> or<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.840> might

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
probably send an update video or I might

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.599 
probably send an update video or I might
reef<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:19.290> replace<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.739> video<00:03:20.010> if<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.280> find<00:03:20.519> a

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
reef and replace the video if I find a

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.089 
reef and replace the video if I find a
better<00:03:20.819> strategy<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.599> Easter<00:03:21.840> strategy<00:03:22.319> but

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
better strategy and Easter strategy but

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.280 
better strategy and Easter strategy but
till<00:03:23.459> then<00:03:23.609> those<00:03:23.970> are<00:03:24.000> those<00:03:24.900> are<00:03:24.959> pretty

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
till then those are those are pretty

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.160 
till then those are those are pretty
reliable<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.609> hope<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.269> see<00:03:27.540> guys<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:28.079> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
reliable and I hope to see guys in the
