no<00:00:20.820> more<00:00:21.289> when<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.320> got<00:00:22.710> home<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.910> whole

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
no more when I got home this whole

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.109 
no more when I got home this whole
bottom<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.279> way<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> road

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
bottom and all the way out to the road

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.800 
bottom and all the way out to the road
was<00:00:27.330> completely<00:00:27.869> covered<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.619> water<00:00:29.810> because

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
was completely covered in water because

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.750 
was completely covered in water because
the<00:00:31.410> wood<00:00:31.590> chips<00:00:31.859> were<00:00:32.160> blocking<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
the wood chips were blocking the

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.010 
the wood chips were blocking the
drainage<00:00:33.650> holes<00:00:34.650> and<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:36.030> totally<00:00:36.420> didn't<00:00:36.870> even

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
drainage holes and I totally didn't even

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.870 
drainage holes and I totally didn't even
think<00:00:37.260> about<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.620> thought<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.280> would<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.579> okay

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
think about I thought it would be okay

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.229 
think about I thought it would be okay
so<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.180> had<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> come<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:41.090> clear<00:00:42.090> it

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
so I had to come out here and clear it

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.720 
so I had to come out here and clear it
out<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.350> water<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.890> start<00:00:44.129> flowing<00:00:44.489> through

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
out so water can start flowing through

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.420 
out so water can start flowing through
again<00:00:45.140> water<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.710> side<00:00:47.040> was<00:00:47.280> completely

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
again water on that side was completely

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.869 
again water on that side was completely
covering<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.600> coming<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.320> over<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.890> road<00:00:50.070> so

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
covering out coming out over the road so

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.290 
covering out coming out over the road so
now<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.570> starting<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> drain<00:00:52.140> through<00:00:52.530> but

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
now it's starting to drain through but

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.610 
now it's starting to drain through but
this<00:00:54.300> side<00:00:54.570> down<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:56.329> cannot<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.309> the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
this side down here I cannot get to the

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.060 
this side down here I cannot get to the
drainage<00:01:01.620> hole<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> guess<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.920> this

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
drainage hole I guess so all of this

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.200 
drainage hole I guess so all of this
water<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:06.240> still<00:01:07.080> pouring<00:01:07.580> out<00:01:08.580> onto<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
water is still pouring out onto the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.859 
water is still pouring out onto the
street<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> whole<00:01:11.869> this

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
street and this is what the whole this

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.260 
street and this is what the whole this
whole<00:01:12.930> ditch<00:01:13.500> side<00:01:13.830> looked<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.340> about<00:01:15.150> an

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
whole ditch side looked like about an

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.469 
whole ditch side looked like about an
hour<00:01:15.450> ago<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.520> can't<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.299> one

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
hour ago and I just can't get that one

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
hour ago and I just can't get that one
clear<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.439> gonna<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.220> when

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
clear so I'm gonna have to do that when

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
clear so I'm gonna have to do that when
it<00:01:21.540> stops<00:01:21.869> raining<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> water<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.890> go

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it stops raining and the water just go

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
it stops raining and the water just go
down<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> little<00:01:23.640> bit<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> rest<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.170> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
down a little bit but the rest of this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
down a little bit but the rest of this
is<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:27.770> draining<00:01:28.770> pretty<00:01:29.009> okay<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> mean<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.119> saw

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
is now draining pretty okay I mean I saw

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.289 
is now draining pretty okay I mean I saw
a<00:01:30.659> lot<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.140> water<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.590> coming<00:01:31.830> through<00:01:32.299> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
a lot of water that's coming through and

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.140 
a lot of water that's coming through and
now<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.530> where<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.970> can't<00:01:36.390> plant<00:01:38.150> I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
now I know where I can and can't plant I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
now I know where I can and can't plant I
don't<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.810> should<00:01:39.869> plant<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.740> this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
don't think I should plant in this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.859 
don't think I should plant in this
little<00:01:41.520> ditch<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.630> because

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
little ditch here at all just because

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.899 
little ditch here at all just because
there's<00:01:43.049> gonna<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.320> much<00:01:43.829> water<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.520> I

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
there's gonna be so much water or I

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.609 
there's gonna be so much water or I
guess<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.780> planning<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> summer
