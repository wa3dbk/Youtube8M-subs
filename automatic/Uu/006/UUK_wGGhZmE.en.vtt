00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.230
 must own interim x16 dia in 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.500
 trial version of ascione triad so 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.330
 she is 3 days a record x which I 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.330
 reminder allows to customize

 facebook and google services so 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.229
 it's one of the most complete stuff 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.989
 which is very convenient 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.370
 however you have discreet x you are you 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.330
 you will visit the website 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.690
 so I would put the address in the video 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.119
 and you will put open an iphone 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.699
 that's it for this camp peary file you have to 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:07.299
 download before the video so then 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.820
 you have it here we say zip explorer 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.590
 archive is installed it was canceled 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.899

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:20.890
 cut to excuse me there you and m cut 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.740
 then you'll put ok you go 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.619
 go in the path that 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.079
 I'm doing well in the next var 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:34.950
 you will go to the folder 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:37.659
 road which is a media vuvuzela 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.640

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.200
 cydia locate you go in alas he 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.090
 is not there you create an auto folder 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.560
 install that I remember for yvon summer 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.780
