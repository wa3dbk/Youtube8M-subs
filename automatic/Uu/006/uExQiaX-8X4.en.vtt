00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.980
 valdívia considered a gift of nature there are about 35 thousand 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 native species in the world 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.390
 and more than 100 thousand hybrids or are genetically improved by the organ 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.530
 the Asians 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.619
 are the most commercialized in the world 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.810
 but the South Americans are the most appreciated 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.580
 only in Brazil there are about 3 thousand species I represent 10% of all the flora 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.850
 of the planet 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.670
 the habit of growing orchids 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.780
 is considered the largest block in the world 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.990
 of the square of the sweets taste sweet 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.850
 coin cards 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.280
 only here in the big field are 200 conservator of orchids 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.670
 and this time I will not say 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.040
 are natural in every state of the southern thicket we have to keep our heads 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.570
 Cold created my everything, little baby. 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.660
 in the opposite direction 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.270
 It should be recalled that 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.430
 fearing the screen but in its entirety presented 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.920
 most people believe that life is too expensive is too difficult 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.190
 it's too much work 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.439
 and that most of the time 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.610
 now let's solve 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.250
 But not quite 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.730
 she is very resistant 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.960
 making several prisoners only from then on they lord some 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.550
 Jorge and passionate about orchids 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.530
 a passion that comes from 1957 when he was interested in the beauty of plants but 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.800
 it was only eleven years later that it came to be known that those beautiful flowers were 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.400
 orchids and that each had a name 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.330
 belonged to a species and that it was a favorite hobby of many collectors 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.170
 the passion turned out to be Maria and today he has this space in his house with 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.470
 hundreds of species twice a day if one is dedicated to taking care of each one 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.540
 but when a plant dies the menus of sadness but it was not and 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.480
 this is not it 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.380
 It's something that happened to me happens to all the collectors of 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.300
 orchids 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.310
 here they so used to 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.039
 the ana punch or a tivo to review their accounts die is as well 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.380
 provide for them to die parnaíba but what has some problem 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.009
 Do not worry 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.870
 has until 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.870
 in an orchid hospital wants to meet you 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.479
 party is the incubator 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.769
 only that the plants are pollinated after they reach the seed 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.769
 then on her way out to the maternity ward 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.809
 I grow germinating 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:33.959
 after 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.939
 and I'm still here 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.449
 in the nursery for a period of up to 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:42.349
 4 years art but if she is sick even comes straight to the center 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.359
 surgery here the action operators and recovered 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:51.810
 I'm developing here then come to the recovery industry 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.750
 but if they are really very sick come straight to the cti after here 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:02:59.629
 the management 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.999
 logs ready to go home may be that there in your house you have a 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:09.639
 background like these with fred and some plants some wagons down to a small 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:10.879
 vegetable garden 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.069
 but you can have more than just green you can grow orchids 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:18.349
 you think it's hard 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.879
 It's very easy, it's just that it's a lot of affection and attention you do not have to have 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.859
 a small space 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.959
 the west if you want active in the big space is also to have a quantity 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.859
 orchids and the simple recommendations are the principles of cultivation 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.690
 she needs sun 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.969
 but I do not like that midday sun of strong sun 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.969
 It takes the morning or a show 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:45.979
 I like water 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.879
 say they think they did not like Augustine what they would not like 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.889
 stay wet you can not leave what de sanctis is each are 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.589
 look and let it dry and then look again this puts fertilizer is 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.929
 good always put the fertilizer itself is Kenya does not need 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.779
 Inventing fertilizers not certainties are quite common from fairly cheap 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:10.689
 if not now, this rapid growth and 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.249
 orchids and the rest is just affection and dedication
