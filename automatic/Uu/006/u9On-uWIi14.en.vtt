00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
character I'm not particularly sure if

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.390 
character I'm not particularly sure if
the<00:03:52.489> one-handed<00:03:53.419> strength<00:03:54.349> version<00:03:54.949> of<00:03:55.190> the

blade has and that spell factor or not
but<00:03:58.639> I<00:03:58.699> just<00:03:58.729> went<00:03:59.000> with<00:03:59.120> lens<00:03:59.359> and<00:03:59.629> lens<00:04:00.290> of

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
but I just went with lens and lens of

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.110 
but I just went with lens and lens of
the<00:04:00.530> mind<00:04:00.739> just<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.370> be<00:04:01.459> sure<00:04:01.489> that<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:01.909> spell

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
the mind just to be sure that the spell

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.899 
the mind just to be sure that the spell
effect<00:04:02.389> would<00:04:02.599> be<00:04:02.629> there<00:04:02.930> because<00:04:03.139> I<00:04:03.260> liked<00:04:03.560> it

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
effect would be there because I liked it

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.000 
effect would be there because I liked it
now<00:04:04.909> and<00:04:05.209> that's<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.169> weapon<00:04:06.319> and<00:04:06.620> shield<00:04:06.829> if

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
now and that's the weapon and shield if

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.500 
now and that's the weapon and shield if
you're<00:04:07.129> just<00:04:07.280> going<00:04:07.519> for<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.669> tanking<00:04:08.090> paladin

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
you're just going for a tanking paladin

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.780 
you're just going for a tanking paladin
of<00:04:08.599> course<00:04:09.109> you<00:04:09.229> might<00:04:09.379> be<00:04:09.500> a<00:04:09.530> DPS<00:04:09.979> er<00:04:10.190> in<00:04:10.340> which

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
of course you might be a DPS er in which

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.420 
of course you might be a DPS er in which
case<00:04:11.090> if<00:04:11.449> you<00:04:11.690> can<00:04:11.989> transmog<00:04:12.560> into<00:04:12.829> a<00:04:12.859> pool<00:04:13.129> arm

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
case if you can transmog into a pool arm

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.099 
case if you can transmog into a pool arm
you<00:04:13.909> want<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.209> go<00:04:14.329> for<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.569> four<00:04:14.720> Dragons

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
you want to go for the four Dragons

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.379 
you want to go for the four Dragons
blades<00:04:15.349> I<00:04:15.620> think<00:04:15.919> this<00:04:16.099> is<00:04:16.310> probably<00:04:16.880> one<00:04:17.329> of

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
blades I think this is probably one of

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.509 
blades I think this is probably one of
the<00:04:17.510> best<00:04:17.750> weapons<00:04:18.289> for<00:04:18.500> this<00:04:18.680> set<00:04:18.889> in<00:04:19.070> fact<00:04:19.430> I

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
the best weapons for this set in fact I

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.729 
the best weapons for this set in fact I
think<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.760> might<00:04:19.880> be<00:04:19.909> the<00:04:20.209> best<00:04:20.469> 200<00:04:21.469> weapon

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
think it might be the best 200 weapon

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.890 
think it might be the best 200 weapon
anyway<00:04:22.070> this<00:04:22.550> drops<00:04:22.849> from<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.120> new<00:04:23.240> Paracon

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
anyway this drops from a new Paracon

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.030 
anyway this drops from a new Paracon
trial<00:04:24.229> of<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.409> Crusader<00:04:24.770> 10<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.520> it's<00:04:25.700> really

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
trial of the Crusader 10 so it's really

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.910 
trial of the Crusader 10 so it's really
in<00:04:26.970> fact<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.480> lot<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:28.080> set<00:04:28.350> can<00:04:28.500> just<00:04:28.770> be

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
in fact a lot of this set can just be

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.670 
in fact a lot of this set can just be
gained<00:04:29.190> from<00:04:29.520> trial<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.480> Crusader<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.260> a

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
gained from trial of the Crusader and a

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.560 
gained from trial of the Crusader and a
little<00:04:31.950> bit<00:04:32.070> of<00:04:32.160> siege<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.310> Orgrimmar<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:33.060> think

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
little bit of siege of Orgrimmar I think

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.240 
little bit of siege of Orgrimmar I think
for<00:04:33.720> dragons<00:04:34.020> looks<00:04:34.230> great<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:34.830> once<00:04:35.130> again

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
for dragons looks great but once again

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.890 
for dragons looks great but once again
the<00:04:35.520> problem<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:36.090> since<00:04:36.270> it's<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.540> polearm

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
the problem is that since it's a polearm

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.320 
the problem is that since it's a polearm
you<00:04:37.350> can<00:04:37.530> only<00:04:37.650> transmog<00:04:38.160> it<00:04:38.310> between<00:04:39.030> like

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
you can only transmog it between like

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.000 
you can only transmog it between like
polearm<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:39.900> staff<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.410> obviously<00:04:40.740> since

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
polearm and staff and obviously since

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.350 
polearm and staff and obviously since
you're<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.160> paladin<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.640> don't<00:04:41.790> use<00:04:42.030> staffs

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
you're a paladin you don't use staffs

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.780 
you're a paladin you don't use staffs
and<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:43.260> would<00:04:43.410> be<00:04:43.500> nice<00:04:43.740> if<00:04:44.040> you<00:04:44.280> could<00:04:44.460> trance

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
and it would be nice if you could trance

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.260 
and it would be nice if you could trance
MOG<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.510> two<00:04:45.570> hundred<00:04:45.870> sword<00:04:46.380> into<00:04:46.710> a<00:04:47.180> into<00:04:48.180> a

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
MOG a two hundred sword into a into a

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.510 
MOG a two hundred sword into a into a
polearm<00:04:48.660> but<00:04:48.930> unfortunately<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.680> cannot<00:04:49.950> and

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
polearm but unfortunately you cannot and

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.520 
polearm but unfortunately you cannot and
that<00:04:50.880> brings<00:04:51.090> me<00:04:51.210> on<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:51.450> two-handed<00:04:52.170> swords

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
that brings me on to two-handed swords

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.530 
that brings me on to two-handed swords
this<00:04:53.010> is<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.220> little<00:04:53.520> bit<00:04:53.670> of<00:04:53.790> problematic<00:04:54.180> one

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
this is a little bit of problematic one

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.480 
this is a little bit of problematic one
the<00:04:55.200> only<00:04:55.500> thing<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:55.890> could<00:04:56.070> see<00:04:56.220> people

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
the only thing that I could see people

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.700 
the only thing that I could see people
recommending<00:04:57.180> was<00:04:57.390> one<00:04:57.930> called<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.320> storm

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
recommending was one called the storm

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.460 
recommending was one called the storm
rune<00:04:58.980> edge<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.760> I<00:05:00.690> think<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.080> storm<00:05:01.290> route

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
rune edge and I think the storm route

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.040 
rune edge and I think the storm route
edge<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:02.250> looks<00:05:02.490> pretty<00:05:02.880> cool<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.210> it's<00:05:03.870> not<00:05:03.930> a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
edge it looks pretty cool but it's not a

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.140 
edge it looks pretty cool but it's not a
hundred<00:05:04.320> percent<00:05:04.470> great<00:05:04.980> anyway<00:05:05.790> it<00:05:05.880> drops

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
hundred percent great anyway it drops

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.810 
hundred percent great anyway it drops
from<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.360> assembly<00:05:06.900> of<00:05:07.020> iron<00:05:07.290> on<00:05:07.710> 25<00:05:08.460> player

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
from the assembly of iron on 25 player

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.570 
from the assembly of iron on 25 player
old<00:05:09.120> where<00:05:09.390> you<00:05:09.990> can<00:05:10.200> solo<00:05:10.650> your<00:05:10.980> way<00:05:11.160> there

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
old where you can solo your way there

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.760 
old where you can solo your way there
though<00:05:12.000> soloing<00:05:12.510> flame<00:05:12.780> Leviathan<00:05:13.350> is<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.470> pain

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
though soloing flame Leviathan is a pain

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.830 
though soloing flame Leviathan is a pain
basically<00:05:14.310> you<00:05:14.850> just<00:05:14.880> need<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.420> set<00:05:15.660> up

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
basically you just need to set up

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.410 
basically you just need to set up
demolishers<00:05:16.560> on<00:05:16.770> opposite<00:05:17.700> sides<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.360> the

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
demolishers on opposite sides of the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.740 
demolishers on opposite sides of the
room<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:18.870> then<00:05:19.350> have<00:05:20.190> choppers<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.420> allow<00:05:21.690> you

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
room and then have choppers to allow you

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.420 
room and then have choppers to allow you
to<00:05:21.990> quickly<00:05:22.200> get<00:05:22.590> from<00:05:22.800> demolishor<00:05:23.280> to

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
to quickly get from demolishor to

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.950 
to quickly get from demolishor to
demolisher<00:05:23.940> and<00:05:24.150> then<00:05:24.450> you<00:05:24.540> basically<00:05:24.690> just

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
demolisher and then you basically just

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.650 
demolisher and then you basically just
kind<00:05:25.290> of<00:05:25.440> in<00:05:25.650> a<00:05:26.010> way<00:05:26.190> kite<00:05:26.670> flame<00:05:27.090> fire<00:05:27.390> then<00:05:27.570> it

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
kind of in a way kite flame fire then it

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.390 
kind of in a way kite flame fire then it
really<00:05:27.960> is<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.140> pain<00:05:28.440> in<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.590> ass<00:05:28.740> anyway

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
really is a pain in the ass anyway

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.040 
really is a pain in the ass anyway
that's<00:05:29.820> basically<00:05:30.030> it<00:05:30.420> for<00:05:30.510> this<00:05:30.600> transmog

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
that's basically it for this transmog

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.780 
that's basically it for this transmog
set<00:05:31.320> I<00:05:31.500> think<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.800> looks<00:05:31.950> fantastic<00:05:32.100> it<00:05:32.610> just

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
set I think it looks fantastic it just

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.180 
set I think it looks fantastic it just
screams<00:05:33.060> paladin<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:34.080> obviously<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.770> think

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
screams paladin and obviously I think

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.940 
screams paladin and obviously I think
it's<00:05:35.460> great<00:05:35.610> for<00:05:35.760> humans<00:05:36.180> and<00:05:36.950> characters

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
it's great for humans and characters

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.530 
it's great for humans and characters
like<00:05:38.130> that<00:05:38.370> maybe<00:05:38.580> I<00:05:38.700> think<00:05:38.910> actually<00:05:39.210> blood

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
like that maybe I think actually blood

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.240 
like that maybe I think actually blood
elves<00:05:39.690> would<00:05:39.810> probably<00:05:40.530> look<00:05:40.740> quite<00:05:41.040> well

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
elves would probably look quite well

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.770 
elves would probably look quite well
with<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.580> siege<00:05:41.730> of<00:05:41.760> Orgrimmar<00:05:42.240> gear<00:05:42.510> if

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
with the siege of Orgrimmar gear if

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.110 
with the siege of Orgrimmar gear if
you're<00:05:43.260> maybe<00:05:43.650> if<00:05:43.980> you're<00:05:44.190> a<00:05:44.220> drain<00:05:44.520> I<00:05:44.640> I<00:05:44.670> think

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
you're maybe if you're a drain I I think

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.600 
you're maybe if you're a drain I I think
a<00:05:45.330> more<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.870> drain<00:05:46.170> I<00:05:46.350> theme<00:05:46.860> set<00:05:47.220> might<00:05:47.460> look

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
a more a drain I theme set might look

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.830 
a more a drain I theme set might look
better<00:05:47.790> for<00:05:48.030> your<00:05:48.120> character<00:05:48.480> but<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.690> course

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
better for your character but of course

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.510 
better for your character but of course
it's<00:05:48.990> all<00:05:49.110> personal<00:05:49.530> preference<00:05:49.740> anyway<00:05:50.490> I

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
it's all personal preference anyway I

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.860 
it's all personal preference anyway I
