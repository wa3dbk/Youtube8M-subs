00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.000
 the fresh grave of his close friend 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.210
 leaves journalist dmitry skvortsova in 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.809
 deep sorrow lies oles 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.880
 elder 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.039
 after numerous nationalistic 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.410
 minded threats in his address about 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.029
 russian publicist was shot dead 16 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.289
 April 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.830
 Dmitri blames the right-wing radicals 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 in Ukraine he was for them the biggest 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.070
 the enemy 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.939
 but people like elderberry are in 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.239
 every city 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 publicists anti-fascist activists right 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.969
 the radicals have published on the net thousands of names 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 and addresses your supposed enemies in 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.559
 generally on this page openly threatened 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.510
 thirty two thousand people on 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.520
 throughout the month she was available at 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.989
 the internet 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.000
 government critic Dmitry Starlings 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.430
 his colleagues also received a threat there 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.579
 killing either fleeing abroad or 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.989
 death such were the statements all this 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.090
 the work of the right radicals who 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.070
 helped today's government 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.020
 pass power 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.700
 the ruling circles are blackmailing themselves 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.650
 they have to reckon with this people 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:20.430
 since they are an important force in 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:22.049
 there is no clear evidence of their guilt 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.210
 however nationalists really 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.460
 shows itself more aggressive they 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.299
 confidently protesting against attempts 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.470
 government 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.030
 disarm their troops on the front line on 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.140
 our next rally we will burn 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.140
 presidential administration 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.330
 after this demonstration the president 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.060
 Poroshenko called the head of the right sector 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.619
 to calm your environment 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.509
 surprise the threat of murder from 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.520
 alleged Ukrainian nationalists 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.960
 got even a pro-Western political scientist 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.630
 Vladimir Fesenko 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.549
 however, fesenko believes that threats and 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.940
 maybe behind some killings 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.940
 Russia 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.770
 I assume that Russia is behind this 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.200
 she uses every opportunity to 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.209
 destabilize the country with 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.650
 using an information campaign around 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.500
 Russian killings want to strengthen 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.569
 separatist wave in the east for 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.720
 Dmitry Skvortsova for killing his friend 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.160
 responsibly Ukrainian ruling circles in 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.500
 early April, Parliament announced 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.989
 historically unions of nationalists 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.600
 fighters for independence and dance and akiva 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.890
 can hardly help reconciliation and so 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.890
 already split society
