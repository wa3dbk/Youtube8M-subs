okay

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:02.710 
okay

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.019 
okay
all<00:00:03.250> right<00:00:03.400> this<00:00:04.000> is<00:00:04.500> collective<00:00:05.500> control

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
all right this is collective control

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.480 
all right this is collective control
trial<00:00:07.029> two<00:00:07.210> vehicle<00:00:07.960> one<00:00:08.170> I'm<00:00:09.070> going<00:00:09.220> to<00:00:09.309> try<00:00:09.460> a

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
trial two vehicle one I'm going to try a

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.030 
trial two vehicle one I'm going to try a
couple<00:00:09.640> things<00:00:09.970> going<00:00:10.059> to<00:00:10.269> try<00:00:11.040> maximum

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
couple things going to try maximum

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.310 
couple things going to try maximum
throttle<00:00:12.280> at<00:00:12.580> stable<00:00:12.910> hover<00:00:13.060> so<00:00:13.420> maintaining

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
throttle at stable hover so maintaining

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.010 
throttle at stable hover so maintaining
stable<00:00:14.770> hover<00:00:15.010> with<00:00:15.340> just<00:00:16.150> the<00:00:16.359> collective

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
stable hover with just the collective

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.670 
stable hover with just the collective
control<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:17.710> then<00:00:18.430> we're<00:00:18.609> going<00:00:18.789> to<00:00:19.000> try

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
control and then we're going to try

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.140 
control and then we're going to try
minimum<00:00:20.680> rotational<00:00:21.310> speed<00:00:21.580> with<00:00:21.760> stable

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
minimum rotational speed with stable

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.260 
minimum rotational speed with stable
hover<00:00:22.300> so<00:00:23.289> that'll<00:00:23.530> be<00:00:23.650> maximal<00:00:24.070> active<00:00:24.520> flat

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
hover so that'll be maximal active flat

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.410 
hover so that'll be maximal active flat
deflection<00:00:25.780> with<00:00:26.130> minimal<00:00:27.130> throttle<00:00:27.490> here<00:00:28.330> we

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
deflection with minimal throttle here we

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.349 
deflection with minimal throttle here we
go

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.779 

full<00:00:33.929> throttle

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.980 

yeah<00:00:38.359> five<00:00:39.230> control

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 
yeah five control

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.200 
yeah five control
we<00:00:41.590> go<00:00:41.770> up

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
we go up

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.819 
we go up

down

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.639 

okay<00:00:48.329> all<00:00:49.329> right<00:00:49.390> so<00:00:49.660> we've<00:00:49.809> got<00:00:49.840> maximum<00:00:50.290> flap

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
okay all right so we've got maximum flap

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.150 
okay all right so we've got maximum flap
I'm<00:00:50.860> going<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.070> review<00:00:51.190> this<00:00:51.340> reduce<00:00:51.820> throttle

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
I'm going to review this reduce throttle

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.119 
I'm going to review this reduce throttle
okay<00:00:54.160> so<00:00:54.220> we<00:00:54.399> get<00:00:54.550> lots<00:00:54.790> of<00:00:54.940> instability<00:00:55.540> there

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.790 

okay<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:00.190> it<00:01:00.399> starts<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.699> go<00:01:00.820> unstable<00:01:01.390> when<00:01:01.540> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
okay so it starts to go unstable when I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.259 
okay so it starts to go unstable when I
reduce<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.129> throttle<00:01:03.519> so<00:01:03.670> we<00:01:03.790> rotate<00:01:04.150> very

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
reduce the throttle so we rotate very

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.580 
reduce the throttle so we rotate very
slowly<00:01:05.790> stuff<00:01:06.790> according<00:01:06.970> okay<00:01:08.940> so<00:01:09.940> this<00:01:10.210> is

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
slowly stuff according okay so this is

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.530 
slowly stuff according okay so this is
flight<00:01:11.590> number<00:01:12.040> three<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.490> guess<00:01:12.790> with<00:01:13.000> vehicle

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
flight number three I guess with vehicle

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.560 
flight number three I guess with vehicle

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
go Matt I'm going to use the fine tuners

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.160 
go Matt I'm going to use the fine tuners

on the controller versus this to try and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.919 
on the controller versus this to try and
change<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.590> flap<00:01:26.770> angle<00:01:27.270> okay<00:01:28.270> using<00:01:28.539> trim

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
change the flap angle okay using trim

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:38.710 
change the flap angle okay using trim

trying<00:01:50.870> to<00:01:50.930> turn<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.229> down

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.610 

this<00:01:58.010> is<00:01:58.190> Susan<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.760> man<00:01:58.940> drops<00:01:59.270> names<00:01:59.630> down

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
this is Susan the man drops names down

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.380 
this is Susan the man drops names down
okay<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:01.580> trim<00:02:02.030> trim<00:02:02.690> had<00:02:02.930> inadequate<00:02:03.770> effect

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
okay so trim trim had inadequate effect

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.820 
okay so trim trim had inadequate effect
it<00:02:05.390> had<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.570> little<00:02:05.900> effect<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.440> definitely

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
it had a little effect it definitely

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.290 
it had a little effect it definitely
slowed<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.340> not<00:02:08.300> too<00:02:08.479> much<00:02:08.690> okay<00:02:10.150> see<00:02:11.150> right

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
slowed it not too much okay see right

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.560 
slowed it not too much okay see right
now<00:02:11.420> I'm<00:02:11.540> going<00:02:11.720> up<00:02:11.930> with<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.230> trim<00:02:13.060> okay<00:02:14.090> it

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
now I'm going up with the trim okay it

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.060 
now I'm going up with the trim okay it
stopped<00:02:14.960> our<00:02:15.140> descent<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.680> we're<00:02:15.890> going<00:02:16.040> to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
stopped our descent and we're going to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.380 
stopped our descent and we're going to
be<00:02:16.220> in<00:02:16.370> climbing<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.850> little<00:02:17.060> bit<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.120> all

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
be in climbing a little bit this is all

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.190 
be in climbing a little bit this is all
been<00:02:20.540> constant<00:02:21.050> battle<00:02:22.510> okay<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:23.930> this<00:02:24.050> is

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
been constant battle okay so this is

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.899 
been constant battle okay so this is
very<00:02:24.320> gradual<00:02:24.770> very<00:02:25.330> soft

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.970 

trying<00:02:33.909> to<00:02:34.180> obviously<00:02:34.750> thought<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.709> little

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
trying to obviously thought a little

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:49.830 
trying to obviously thought a little
further<00:02:36.940> down

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840
