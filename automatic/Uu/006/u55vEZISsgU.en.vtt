00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.350
 hello friends of nanotechnology paulo 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.390
 again this video I'm going to do because 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.520
 a lot of people ask me and it looks like a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.500
 Silly question but she is already the same 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.110
 time it's simple it's complicated 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.739
 explain why you watch me 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:40.590
 I'll connect the videogame to a video game 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:43.710
 I switched off red, I'm going 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.280
 light turned green 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.350
 pay attention here below 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.219
 in this luizinha go of the zone and many of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.410
 You already know what mec means already. 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:05.910
 You know what happened is the hd and the side 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.460
 edge of u2 will connect on the internet and 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:15.080
 stay green 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:18.570
 this is my control told him 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:27.509
 ready now you're seeing him 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:29.670
 is messing with the emotional pm here in 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.560
 cruise 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.520
 I'm fixing this girl here who 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.130
 will select the user for many of 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.220
 you if it can appear and useless but 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.590
 many people do not know why 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.420
 What I did in this simple video is a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.489
 video because the next I'll explain 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.130
 here it is an indicator of the 

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.330
 health the video game that if thank you 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.619
 problem at the time I select the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.929
 on the menu and stay there be direct and 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.179
 otto stirring one hand every time 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.770
 he will select a submarine and the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:06.090
 chopped and for but for example if you 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.280
 World side to side of the disc 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.020
 photos and you do not have any photos you change 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.880
 for video I do not have to have video 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.910
 the anticipated they are taking is 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.650
 just be direct means your 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.810
 hd at the time of reading me 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.390
 He does not know how he can not 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.430
 find out how it was recorded what is 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.650
 recorded there and knows that there is some data 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.410
 recorded as recorded has to pass through 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.450
 several times the reading head by 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.840
 top 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.709
 modify the value with which it reads it 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.840
 modifies the surface of the head with 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.360
 another chain and he can discover 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.150
 how was it recorded previously and 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.640
 Be careful because it has changed as it was recorded 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.980
 previously for this time was a changed 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.690
 because the hotter it is 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.420
 the hotter the head is 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.489
 begins to have to float further for 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.709
 cause of friction and there you have to 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.049
 to put more current in order to go 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.890
 to the magnetic field in order to 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.049
 that that piece of space 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.819
 hd disk and sensitizes 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.030
 so it has to be recalibrating 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.620
 every time this hd lights up because 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.810
 he is doing chores 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.849
 so if it's on and you 're 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.400
 doing nothing that the video game means 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.799
 Your videogame is with hd with life. 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.890
 very low, recalls that the one shown in the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:32.480
 Previous video to the health of the donor and as 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:35.889
 well I'll put on this game now 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.970
 person here for example she put 11 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:53.180
 a kit of services we have 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:55.819
 The king of fighters guide guy played only 70 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.880
 rooster games played for which he bought 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.489
 a video game and so he bought 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.459
 video game put the kit is happy and will 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.269
 be happy for another ten to fifteen years 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:14.690
 quietly this videogame will not go 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:16.880
 to be so soon another side to the other 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.930
 same time this problem is that without the 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.490
 video that I look at it will only 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.620
 see a little bit about the video 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.630
 health is exceptional 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.030
 this video to put on the pc and when 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.729
 analyze is 100% health 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.180
 so I'll put it here, look at this mine 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.419
 zac 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.310
 notice the light in the light 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.620
 the ranking is loading the boy from 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.660
 God for him changes from being the whole family 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.820
 back exchange-swap disc and play 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.650
 There are several discs, right? 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.199
 no hd watches if it stops because it 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.820
 search for random sectors of data from 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.520
 shadows one after another says about 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.520
 different places different routes 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:14.310
 the video that is the law and will stay 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:15.930
 You do not have to stay lit any longer. 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.509
 because it only does this is not just a menu 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.550
 just finished this animation animation already 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.810
 was copied by memory has already been 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.120
 processed and stays there 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:29.030
 while not changing and not leaving now 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:36.599
 I'm going to go here and hit the start button. 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:41.960
 the new rock by recording and making a 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:41.960
 second disc and now continue in the game 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.210
 this loading is just that he catches 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.400
 the data that is in HD 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.070
 blame the memory the processor handles 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.120
 city memory process them to you 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.100
 on-screen 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.220
 This is the game there to play lan. 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.820
 have some disk activity only now 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.250
 that has a sound I quit the game 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.250
 recording the disc leaves the game between teams 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.860
 finished tatÃ¡ is that rock 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:18.230
 It still came back better. 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.940
 this quick ladder between 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.120
 flashes the faster it is 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.680
 applied on average means that the 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.550
 health and looks great. 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.770
 size 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.440
 I will not stretch another video because 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.290
 do not need is that the idea that you are going 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.300
 have to always take care of the 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.970
 health just that this one is a reflection 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.130
 the whole health of the whole and 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.140
 you have the kit on it improves is because 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.640
 you can expect that if you bought a 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.890
 video game put on soon thereafter 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.230
 buy can lose idea 15 years 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.540
 peace of mind in your device 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.780
 hug I see you in the next video stay 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.780
 with God
