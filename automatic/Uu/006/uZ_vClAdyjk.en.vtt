okay<00:02:01.840> it's<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:03.259> scratch<00:02:03.679> proof<00:02:04.070> computer<00:02:04.759> from

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
okay it's a scratch proof computer from

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.719 
okay it's a scratch proof computer from
the<00:02:05.030> outside<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:05.750> from<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.049> inside<00:02:06.530> but<00:02:07.520> for

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
the outside and from the inside but for

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.930 
the outside and from the inside but for
the<00:02:07.850> screen<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.629> don't<00:02:08.929> know<00:02:09.019> if<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.349> is<00:02:09.910> but<00:02:10.910> I

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
the screen I don't know if it is but I

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:22.570 
the screen I don't know if it is but I
don't<00:02:11.209> guess<00:02:17.650> yeah<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:22.099> in<00:02:22.250> scratch

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
don't guess yeah so it's in scratch

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.619 
don't guess yeah so it's in scratch
proof<00:02:22.910> as<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.330> can<00:02:23.480> see<00:02:23.629> just<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.349> glittery<00:02:25.629> so

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
proof as you can see just so glittery so

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.309 
proof as you can see just so glittery so
still<00:02:26.959> finish<00:02:27.290> inside<00:02:28.480> your<00:02:29.480> do<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.750> just<00:02:29.989> sell

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
still finish inside your do is just sell

still finish inside your do is just sell
you<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.890> clean<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:34.329> also<00:02:35.329> this<00:02:35.540> are<00:02:35.780> scratch

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
you and clean the also this are scratch

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.059 
you and clean the also this are scratch
proof<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.640> masses<00:02:38.000> pretty<00:02:38.299> much<00:02:38.680> came<00:02:39.680> with

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
proof the masses pretty much came with

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.539 
proof the masses pretty much came with
the<00:02:41.349> cable<00:02:42.349> mouse<00:02:42.500> with<00:02:42.860> an<00:02:43.010> optical<00:02:43.459> mouse

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
the cable mouse with an optical mouse

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.759 
the cable mouse with an optical mouse
this<00:02:44.120> was<00:02:44.329> an<00:02:44.450> offer<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.140> shop<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.620> it
