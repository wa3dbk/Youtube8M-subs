00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.149 
round shot strength and this is
important<00:01:27.869> again<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.649> want<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> use<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.069> in

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
important again you want to use it in

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.919 
important again you want to use it in
combination<00:01:29.789> with<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.179> heavy<00:01:30.390> shot<00:01:30.719> and

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
combination with the heavy shot and

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.749 
combination with the heavy shot and
another<00:01:31.590> thing<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.100> hold<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
another thing if you hold it down you

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.609 
another thing if you hold it down you
can<00:01:32.999> actually<00:01:33.210> shoot<00:01:33.569> it<00:01:33.719> a<00:01:33.749> lot<00:01:33.990> quicker<00:01:34.200> I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
can actually shoot it a lot quicker I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.260 
can actually shoot it a lot quicker I
was<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.189> pressing<00:01:35.399> triangle<00:01:35.789> each<00:01:36.060> time

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
was just pressing triangle each time

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.580 
was just pressing triangle each time
before<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.840> hold<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.170> down<00:01:37.319> it<00:01:37.560> just

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
before but if you hold it down it just

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.620 
before but if you hold it down it just
zooms<00:01:37.889> into<00:01:38.249> the<00:01:38.429> next<00:01:38.670> target<00:01:38.819> instantly<00:01:39.450> so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
zooms into the next target instantly so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.270 
zooms into the next target instantly so
that's<00:01:39.780> awesome<00:01:39.990> definitely<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.189> get

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
that's awesome definitely going to get

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.950 
that's awesome definitely going to get
that<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.700> though<00:01:41.909> next<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:42.689> elite

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that one though next is the elite

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480 
that one though next is the elite
mortars<00:01:43.469> and<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.159> really

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
mortars and they are really really

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.219 
mortars and they are really really
awesome<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.179> a<00:01:45.240> lot<00:01:45.509> more<00:01:45.689> damage<00:01:45.899> with

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
awesome you get a lot more damage with

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.359 
awesome you get a lot more damage with
them<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> fact<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.069> you<00:01:47.189> get<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
them but it's the fact that you get a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.190 
them but it's the fact that you get a
much<00:01:47.549> bigger<00:01:47.759> blast<00:01:48.119> radius<00:01:48.389> as<00:01:48.719> well<00:01:48.929> that's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
much bigger blast radius as well that's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.840 
much bigger blast radius as well that's
the<00:01:49.319> most<00:01:49.439> important<00:01:49.889> thing<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.189> my<00:01:50.340> opinion<00:01:50.459> I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the most important thing in my opinion I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.399 
the most important thing in my opinion I
don't<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.299> there's<00:01:51.450> an<00:01:51.509> increase<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.869> range

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
don't think there's an increase in range

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.020 
don't think there's an increase in range
but<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.950> said<00:01:53.159> before<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.549> blast<00:01:53.789> radius

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
but like I said before the blast radius

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.459 
but like I said before the blast radius
is<00:01:54.389> bigger<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.929> it's<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.139> to<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.289> lot

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
is bigger so it's going to be a lot

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.139 
is bigger so it's going to be a lot
easier<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> hit<00:01:56.159> targets<00:01:56.670> even<00:01:56.819> if<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
easier to hit targets even if you

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.359 
easier to hit targets even if you
slightly<00:01:57.420> miss<00:01:57.780> next<00:01:58.499> is<00:01:58.619> elite<00:01:58.920> swivel

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
slightly miss next is elite swivel

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.889 
slightly miss next is elite swivel
strength<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.209> really<00:02:00.420> cool<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> be

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
strength and it is really cool to be

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.260 
strength and it is really cool to be
fair<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.189> easy<00:02:02.429> to<00:02:02.579> use<00:02:02.880> swivel

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
fair it's not that easy to use swivel

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.999 
fair it's not that easy to use swivel
guns<00:02:03.450> against<00:02:03.810> mana<00:02:04.139> Wars<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.679> stuff<00:02:04.829> like

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
guns against mana Wars and stuff like

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.169 
guns against mana Wars and stuff like
that<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.429> you're<00:02:05.520> taking<00:02:05.819> out<00:02:05.909> some<00:02:06.060> all

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
that but if you're taking out some all

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.370 
that but if you're taking out some all
the<00:02:06.270> ships<00:02:06.509> you're<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.779> to<00:02:06.840> dominate<00:02:06.990> them

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the ships you're going to dominate them

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.529 
the ships you're going to dominate them
pretty<00:02:07.649> quickly<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.340> managed<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.880> get<00:02:09.030> four<00:02:09.300> in

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
pretty quickly I managed to get four in

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.390 
pretty quickly I managed to get four in
one<00:02:09.720> hit<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.410> gun<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.950> definitely

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
one hit with this gun so definitely

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
really good to be fair you can see me

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.760 
really good to be fair you can see me
here<00:02:39.270> decimating<00:02:39.930> some<00:02:40.110> smaller<00:02:40.410> ships

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
here decimating some smaller ships

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.440 
here decimating some smaller ships
against<00:02:41.160> bigger<00:02:41.340> ships<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.850> realized<00:02:42.300> if

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
against bigger ships that I realized if

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.030 
against bigger ships that I realized if
you<00:02:42.570> lay<00:02:42.780> fire<00:02:43.080> barrels<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.710> then<00:02:43.830> use

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
you lay fire barrels and then use

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.440 
you lay fire barrels and then use
mortars<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.610> blow<00:02:44.760> them<00:02:44.970> up<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.420> really

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
mortars to blow them up that is really

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.250 
mortars to blow them up that is really
really<00:02:45.870> good

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
really good

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.930 
really good
and<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.680> me<00:02:46.830> using<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> fire<00:02:47.550> barrels

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
and this is me using the fire barrels

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.880 
and this is me using the fire barrels
