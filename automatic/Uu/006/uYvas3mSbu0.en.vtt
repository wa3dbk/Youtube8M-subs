use a notch Libra direct system and what

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.750 
use a notch Libra direct system and what
I<00:01:06.840> mean<00:01:06.990> by<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.280> smooth

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
I mean by that is that it's not smooth

I mean by that is that it's not smooth
going<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.290> little

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
going up it's you know it's little

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.429 
going up it's you know it's little
clicks<00:01:11.330> which<00:01:12.330> doesn't<00:01:12.659> impact<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.290> sort

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
clicks which doesn't impact it it sort

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.620 
clicks which doesn't impact it it sort
of<00:01:13.560> makes<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> easier<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> select<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.420> drag

the two-speed mechanism is right here
right<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:32.130> you're<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.400> high<00:01:32.549> gear<00:01:32.759> ratio<00:01:33.150> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
right now you're in high gear ratio you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.510 
right now you're in high gear ratio you
push<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> button<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:34.860> drops<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.460> to

low and then when you want to take it
out<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.159> push<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.030> button<00:01:39.180> right

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
out you just push that button right

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.050 
out you just push that button right
there<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.750> you're<00:01:39.930> back<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.290> high<00:01:40.350> gear<00:01:40.619> ratio

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
there and you're back in high gear ratio

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.370 
there and you're back in high gear ratio
like<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.090> said<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> really<00:01:42.479> nice<00:01:42.659> railway<00:01:43.079> just
