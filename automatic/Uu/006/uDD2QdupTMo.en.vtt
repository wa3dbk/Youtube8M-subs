00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.990
 space sports friends 5 we are in 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.719
 andrea male captain company 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.219
 of libertas astense we have witnessed 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.619
 there is a nice match between two beautiful ones 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.539
 teams poised until the last time 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 that the final that has in the last minutes 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.070
 risked a pole and a crossbar 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.949
 yes they are very good, they have spent a lot of time 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.230
 struggling on the physical plane at the end 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.330
 we have done a second time with 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.120
 few changes we have done more to turn the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.550
 most of them have brought their ball 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 rumble a lot we tried to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.180
 take the center to do even throws from 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 far because they defend very well 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 they do very well and then counterattack 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.870
 end were also lucky because the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.399
 two poles them in the last seconds too 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.620
 if in my opinion he had mistaken so many 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.570
 goal to close it first 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.699
 this therefore continues to be a field 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.199
 that for the first round was 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.809
 conquered only once the first 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.850
 day we only lost the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.289
 before the dachshunds why man 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.430
 still a little amalgamate our game 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.040
 with new grafts 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.220
 then after how many last year we have 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.690
 always made our fort because 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.640
 many teams are struggling to express themselves 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.630
 last quarry a little boy especially i 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.650
 many minutes we put them many 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.090
 difficulty 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.920
 I think we did well too 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.050
 today against an experienced team though 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.950
 they were so behind us for the first time 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.660
 has put us in trouble we are not 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.310
 never managed to go over two goals 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.000
 to try to manage the game in 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.650
 best way more ball possession to date 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.080
 an exciting first season in 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.070
 championship alone and final four where 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.860
 you want to arrive this year 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.580
 now yes we can no longer pull ourselves 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.230
 back 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.000
 we want to aim to win this 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.310
 championship with as I said before 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.870
 tax grafts depend on dialogues that 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.990
 they came from a higher category 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.370
 to give us a hand and we'll do our best 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.370
 to win this championship for 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.660
 also win the final four 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.080
 nice pierfrancesco coach of the do 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.990
 nike 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.850
 you have tried to flip to the end 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.320
 the result at least reach the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.840
 misfortune was also a draw 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.850
 with a pole and a crossbar as it was 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.130
 this game 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.560
 bad luck counts even if up to a 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.210
 at some point we took the two poles 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.800
 because we wanted to win the game 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.140
 we took 3 in the first half e 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.270
 are five we played with bring 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.250
 the movement to equalize I have 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.920
 however, sought after after winning 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.480
 the game because in my opinion today 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.860
 we could demonstrate it in part 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.890
 we have shown to be in the field 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.840
 at the stand if you have something 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.920
 to complain about your boys 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.720
 no absolutely I asked 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.850
 just my guys to come 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.590
 here at asti to play as we know 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.390
 get out of this field with your head held high 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.950
 because the thing that interests me is going out 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.420
 from a field with its head held high 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.510
 the boys made it they put us 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.190
 every conceivable effort possible 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.900
 it's not bad luck but we would have it anyway 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.250
 could definitely win this one 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.620
 match don't even win this 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.600
 game in a week you went out 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.580
 from the Italian cup and you have arrived at 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.180
 minus 7 from the leader what is 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.340
 happening 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.350
 absolutely nothing this is ours 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.870
 strength and in the cup we went out without 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.610
 lose because on penalties it 's gone 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.620
 bad 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.080
 in the league we lost two games 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.910
 against the dachshunds and the same one they are 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.200
 the two teams ahead of us are waiting 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.200
 the end to judge the final
