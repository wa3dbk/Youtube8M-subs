Bujji 20 it is a success of a budget and
so<00:00:24.159> there<00:00:24.429> are<00:00:24.609> several<00:00:25.089> differences<00:00:25.749> from

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
so there are several differences from

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.979 
so there are several differences from
the<00:00:26.259> widget<00:00:26.529> 10<00:00:26.739> but<00:00:27.339> the<00:00:28.329> big<00:00:28.509> difference<00:00:28.539> is

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
the widget 10 but the big difference is

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.290 
the widget 10 but the big difference is
it's<00:00:29.289> a<00:00:29.349> frame<00:00:29.619> later<00:00:29.890> for<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.310> recordings<00:00:30.849> so

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
it's a frame later for the recordings so

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
again it means of difference between two

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.010 
again it means of difference between two
frames<00:00:59.079> less<00:00:59.710> than<00:01:00.120> differences<00:01:01.120> between<00:01:01.390> two

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
frames less than differences between two

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.530 
frames less than differences between two
frames<00:01:02.260> in<00:01:02.440> 25<00:01:03.070> p<00:01:03.220> or<00:01:03.310> 50<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:03.610> so<00:01:04.180> you're<00:01:04.330> saying

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
frames in 25 p or 50 I so you're saying

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.120 
frames in 25 p or 50 I so you're saying
I<00:01:04.690> don't<00:01:04.750> have<00:01:05.019> to<00:01:05.110> worry<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:05.440> it's<00:01:05.860> almost

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
I don't have to worry that it's almost

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.620 
I don't have to worry that it's almost
the<00:01:06.550> same<00:01:06.700> bitch<00:01:06.970> wait<00:01:07.150> for<00:01:07.390> high-speed

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
the same bitch wait for high-speed

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.930 
the same bitch wait for high-speed
recording<00:01:08.290> because<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.280> difference<00:01:09.850> between

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
recording because the difference between

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.640 
recording because the difference between
the<00:01:10.210> frames<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.570> almost<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.960> same<00:01:10.990> almost<00:01:11.590> the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
the frames is almost the same almost the

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.530 
the frames is almost the same almost the
same<00:01:11.770> yes<00:01:12.040> correct<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.640> heard<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.270> camera

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
same yes correct I heard that the camera

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.200 
same yes correct I heard that the camera
has<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.780> same<00:01:14.020> sensor<00:01:14.470> as<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.710> new<00:01:15.490> Sony<00:01:15.850> and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
has the same sensor as the new Sony and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.230 
has the same sensor as the new Sony and
five<00:01:16.479> an<00:01:16.630> M<00:01:17.020> since<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.409> using<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.979> boogy<00:01:18.280> 20<00:01:18.640> so

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
five an M since I using the boogy 20 so

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.719 
five an M since I using the boogy 20 so
so<00:01:19.690> that<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:19.960> why<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.229> widget<00:01:20.680> 20<00:01:21.040> is<00:01:21.190> capable

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
so that is why the widget 20 is capable

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.130 
so that is why the widget 20 is capable
up<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.630> photo<00:01:23.170> still<00:01:23.830> Camilla<00:01:24.280> k<00:01:25.060> poverty<00:01:25.450> so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
up a photo still Camilla k poverty so

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.969 
up a photo still Camilla k poverty so
which<00:01:26.590> can<00:01:26.830> take<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.670> row<00:01:28.320> still<00:01:29.320> camera<00:01:29.620> image

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
which can take a row still camera image

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.450 
which can take a row still camera image
as<00:01:30.159> well<00:01:30.370> in<00:01:30.760> does<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.180> b20<00:01:32.020> have<00:01:32.200> clean<00:01:33.040> hdmi

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
as well in does the b20 have clean hdmi

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.149 
as well in does the b20 have clean hdmi
output<00:01:33.850> have<00:01:34.120> this<00:01:34.810> has<00:01:34.990> hdmi<00:01:35.470> output<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.040> it

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
output have this has hdmi output so it

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.990 
output have this has hdmi output so it
is<00:01:36.280> possible<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.729> record<00:01:37.060> external<00:01:37.540> recorder

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
is possible to record external recorder

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.840 
is possible to record external recorder
so<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.050> same<00:01:40.230> as<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> phase<00:01:40.680> 100<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:41.640> pretty

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so the same as a phase 100 it's a pretty

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.640 
so the same as a phase 100 it's a pretty
big<00:01:42.120> brother<00:01:42.420> mother<00:01:42.690> professional<00:01:43.350> budget

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
big brother mother professional budget

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.940 
big brother mother professional budget
yeah<00:01:44.400> do<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.510> it's<00:01:45.660> 4<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:46.080> 2<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.320> 4<00:01:46.740> for

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
yeah do you know if it's 4 to 2 or 4 for

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.700 
yeah do you know if it's 4 to 2 or 4 for
4<00:01:47.390> HDMI<00:01:48.390> itself<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.550> four<00:01:50.550> to<00:01:50.790> two<00:01:51.030> Cody<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:52.380> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
4 HDMI itself is four to two Cody so it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.460 
4 HDMI itself is four to two Cody so it
is<00:01:52.830> ok<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.570> record<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.690> as<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
is ok to record it as it is on the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
is ok to record it as it is on the
external<00:01:55.710> recorder<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.090> guess<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.420> still

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
