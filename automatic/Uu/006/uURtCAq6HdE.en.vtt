00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.320 
to play with this for a long long time I
loved<00:06:00.520> a<00:06:00.610> lot<00:06:00.790> about<00:06:01.000> it

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
loved a lot about it

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.360 
loved a lot about it
I<00:06:01.360> really<00:06:01.810> like<00:06:01.960> this<00:06:02.230> little<00:06:02.590> cockpit<00:06:03.100> here

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
I love how it moves how the jaws open

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.460 
I love how it moves how the jaws open
and<00:06:09.220> closed<00:06:09.520> how<00:06:10.270> it<00:06:10.420> goes<00:06:10.630> up<00:06:10.810> and<00:06:10.960> down<00:06:11.080> is

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
and closed how it goes up and down is

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.950 
and closed how it goes up and down is
you<00:06:11.650> know<00:06:11.770> it's<00:06:12.280> really<00:06:12.670> cool<00:06:13.030> a<00:06:13.090> lot<00:06:13.300> of<00:06:13.360> great

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
you know it's really cool a lot of great

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.860 
you know it's really cool a lot of great
functionality<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:15.520> tail<00:06:15.850> you<00:06:16.420> know<00:06:16.480> very

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
functionality the tail you know very

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.230 
functionality the tail you know very
articulated<00:06:17.650> a<00:06:17.740> lot<00:06:17.950> of<00:06:18.130> ways<00:06:18.700> that<00:06:18.730> you<00:06:19.000> can

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
articulated a lot of ways that you can

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.920 
articulated a lot of ways that you can
go<00:06:19.510> with<00:06:19.540> that<00:06:19.840> tail<00:06:20.140> the<00:06:21.070> one<00:06:21.340> thing<00:06:21.670> that<00:06:22.540> I

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
go with that tail the one thing that I

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.850 
go with that tail the one thing that I
wasn't<00:06:23.500> as<00:06:23.590> keen<00:06:23.860> on<00:06:24.070> it<00:06:24.460> is<00:06:25.450> the<00:06:25.630> treads<00:06:25.990> the

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
wasn't as keen on it is the treads the

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.070 
wasn't as keen on it is the treads the
only<00:06:27.520> way<00:06:27.730> that<00:06:28.090> I<00:06:28.150> could<00:06:28.330> get<00:06:28.600> the<00:06:28.690> treads<00:06:28.960> to

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
only way that I could get the treads to

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.830 
only way that I could get the treads to
actually<00:06:29.410> leave<00:06:30.040> tracks<00:06:30.490> was<00:06:31.180> to<00:06:31.420> be<00:06:31.510> in<00:06:31.600> very

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
actually leave tracks was to be in very

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.070 
actually leave tracks was to be in very
wet<00:06:32.050> sand<00:06:32.380> and<00:06:33.090> it<00:06:34.090> didn't<00:06:34.360> really<00:06:34.480> work<00:06:34.570> that

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
wet sand and it didn't really work that

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.370 
wet sand and it didn't really work that
that<00:06:35.500> watch<00:06:35.740> they're<00:06:35.980> very<00:06:36.280> tight<00:06:37.110> and<00:06:38.110> the

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
that watch they're very tight and the

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.450 
that watch they're very tight and the
tread<00:06:38.770> is<00:06:39.100> a<00:06:39.400> little<00:06:39.880> a<00:06:40.600> little<00:06:41.050> thin<00:06:41.380> I'd<00:06:42.310> like

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
tread is a little a little thin I'd like

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.580 
tread is a little a little thin I'd like
to<00:06:42.580> see<00:06:42.730> that<00:06:42.760> thicker<00:06:43.480> or<00:06:43.840> maybe<00:06:44.020> the<00:06:44.200> tracks

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
to see that thicker or maybe the tracks

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.740 
to see that thicker or maybe the tracks
thicker<00:06:44.980> that<00:06:45.970> way<00:06:46.120> it's<00:06:46.330> going<00:06:46.450> to<00:06:46.510> really

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
thicker that way it's going to really

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.740 
thicker that way it's going to really
grab<00:06:47.200> on<00:06:47.470> the<00:06:47.650> on<00:06:47.860> the<00:06:48.390> sand<00:06:49.390> or<00:06:49.840> on<00:06:50.110> the<00:06:50.320> rug<00:06:50.730> it

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
grab on the on the sand or on the rug it

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.030 
grab on the on the sand or on the rug it
it's<00:06:52.750> thin<00:06:52.990> enough<00:06:53.020> that<00:06:53.440> kind<00:06:53.920> of<00:06:53.950> the

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.040 
it's thin enough that kind of the

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.910 
it's thin enough that kind of the
plastic<00:06:54.670> the<00:06:54.910> bottom<00:06:55.390> here<00:06:55.720> hits<00:06:56.530> the<00:06:56.710> ground

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
plastic the bottom here hits the ground

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.820 
plastic the bottom here hits the ground
before<00:06:57.340> the<00:06:57.880> tread<00:06:58.240> so<00:06:58.990> I<00:06:59.020> do<00:06:59.320> have<00:06:59.620> a<00:06:59.650> little

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
before the tread so I do have a little

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.510 
before the tread so I do have a little
bit<00:06:59.920> of<00:07:00.070> trouble<00:07:00.370> of<00:07:00.430> pushing<00:07:00.910> it<00:07:01.150> along<00:07:01.330> and

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
bit of trouble of pushing it along and

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.460 
bit of trouble of pushing it along and
you<00:07:03.520> know<00:07:03.610> if<00:07:03.790> the<00:07:04.060> treads<00:07:04.330> will<00:07:04.540> move<00:07:04.840> but

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
you know if the treads will move but

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.380 
you know if the treads will move but
you've<00:07:05.740> really<00:07:05.980> got<00:07:06.250> to<00:07:06.370> be<00:07:06.610> on<00:07:06.790> a<00:07:06.820> solid

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.390 
you've really got to be on a solid

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.200 
you've really got to be on a solid
surface<00:07:08.250> probably<00:07:09.250> like<00:07:09.460> a<00:07:09.730> real

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
surface probably like a real

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.110 
surface probably like a real
thin<00:07:10.650> carpet<00:07:11.650> it<00:07:12.490> would<00:07:12.610> be<00:07:12.699> good<00:07:12.880> for<00:07:12.910> that

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
thin carpet it would be good for that

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.659 
thin carpet it would be good for that
but<00:07:13.720> on<00:07:13.900> sand<00:07:14.289> I<00:07:14.590> did<00:07:14.919> have<00:07:15.069> some<00:07:15.280> trouble<00:07:15.310> with

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
but on sand I did have some trouble with

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.460 
but on sand I did have some trouble with
it<00:07:15.910> I'd<00:07:16.600> like<00:07:16.780> to<00:07:16.870> see<00:07:16.990> this<00:07:17.080> maybe<00:07:17.289> a<00:07:17.380> little

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
it I'd like to see this maybe a little

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.390 
it I'd like to see this maybe a little
bit<00:07:17.770> looser

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
bit looser

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.640 
bit looser
maybe<00:07:18.669> the<00:07:18.970> rubber<00:07:19.810> a<00:07:19.930> little<00:07:20.319> bit<00:07:20.410> thicker

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
maybe the rubber a little bit thicker

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.260 
maybe the rubber a little bit thicker
but<00:07:21.569> overall<00:07:22.569> a<00:07:23.050> solid<00:07:23.199> solid<00:07:24.039> toy<00:07:24.340> a<00:07:24.699> lot<00:07:25.150> of

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
but overall a solid solid toy a lot of
