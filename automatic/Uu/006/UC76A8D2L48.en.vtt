 now you can put something 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:22.060
 report which is on the valve cats but we 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.550
 departing for the day will include about 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.509
 power tract here they are still Italian 8 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.830
 liters is not a consumption of 30 liters it is so 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.750
 50 days of this tank, you have turned off 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.100
 they will be without water here for 50 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:43.120
 liters capacity because not opened 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.360
 glasses filled wrote fill maybe 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.239
 look i overlap 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.409
 now I don't have water 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.659
 although such a thought was but it is not a valve 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.129
 let's say 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.019
 I blocked the water on the barrel 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:04.619
 the system opened under pressure she 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:09.220
 flushing without extra valve taps 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.600
 calmly start with you they are sealed 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.450
 break you crush I will 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.910
 I'll take it over the tap for the barrel 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:32.770
 turns off it turns out 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:35.080
 not directly peleg system all you 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.590
 at the same time under pressure you go there from 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.590
 on the floor because it is open here 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.720
 I understood perfectly 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:02:00.360
 open and need to be washed out 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.360
 extremely for each and quietly filled 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.610
 additional crane such archer but for 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.509
 reducing plug the well, then lower costs 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.170
 fender 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.099
 you are at each one that is, I look at us cell 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:24.129

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:30.760
 unscrews unscrew i can in the cage 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:33.519
 pulling them out doesn't work so how 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.829
 would be tame enough it doesnâ€™t need a key 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.319
 delay everyone is no longer on the system 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:48.670
 heating what else sly let's say miracles 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:51.489
 nipple what are they different 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.739
 somewhere a couple millimeters long then 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.519
 There is here I pay attention dates that 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.239
 the tube goes right inside the cell yes 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.049
 nothing is necessary 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.930
 doesn't touch up the only nuance I have 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.849
 were the tea surgeon made just in 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.709
 tube screwed nipple thread answer 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.870
 I just had to drill holes to be screwed 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.449
 case grabbed morron grabbed and 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.810
 povydavlivaet nickname gift I will do 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:35.290
 festool eat nastinka got 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:40.750
 would get sealed to freeze so 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:47.079
 everyone grew you wrong promises warm 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.840
 she 1 to 10 on the street inside does not freeze 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.690
 my water nipple works 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.319
 here they are these wild nipples how long 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.840
 3 problems probably don't work for 3 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.690
 any problem areas that no 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.269
 no only pay attention to that 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.650
 not two kinds they are they are different 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.829
 body length of a couple of millimeters and that 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.829
 in short 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.140
 and there is no choice they were alone then 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.110
 others there is nothing to choose or not 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.850
 further there is just when you take them 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.850
 mixed them it's not different 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.270
 you can not die when you mix things up there 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:41.140
 different in them that is in two different 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:45.900
 nipples and which which presses 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:48.760
 the second part is the same there 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.650
 well there is a millimeter or two there it is this 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.290
 microscopic but nerves how often 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.630
 my water is clogged soft 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.730

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.100
 that there salts almost from 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.680
 artesian pigeon water than 300 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.750
 meters the water is very clean and very soft 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.450
 what good is your charter not up to the filter 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.040
 no on nipple works until nipple i 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:26.800

 washed there is no visit less and 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.180
 here they accumulate something there 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.979

 there was almost no water around my 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.190
 sinful notable frost and because he himself 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:49.419
