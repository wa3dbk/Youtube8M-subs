I'm<00:00:15.750> gonna<00:00:15.870> talk<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.170> today<00:00:16.500> -<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.770> had<00:00:17.130> a

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
I'm gonna talk about today - I had a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.340 
I'm gonna talk about today - I had a
bone<00:00:17.460> chip<00:00:17.760> coming<00:00:18.210> through<00:00:18.390> now<00:00:19.050> those<00:00:19.320> of

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
bone chip coming through now those of

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.140 
bone chip coming through now those of
you<00:00:19.560> who<00:00:19.830> if<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.369> don't<00:00:20.550> know<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.789> is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
you who if you don't know what that is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.970 
you who if you don't know what that is
basically<00:00:21.840> when<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> tooth<00:00:22.949> pulled

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
basically when you have a tooth pulled

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.120 
basically when you have a tooth pulled
ill<00:00:23.910> alerts<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.570> or<00:00:24.810> all<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> them<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:26.039> know

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
ill alerts one or all of them you know

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.580 
ill alerts one or all of them you know
in<00:00:26.279> separation<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.970> dentures<00:00:27.590> basically

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
in separation for dentures basically

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
in separation for dentures basically
when<00:00:28.980> your<00:00:29.130> teeth<00:00:29.310> aren't<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:29.939> there<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
when your teeth aren't there there you

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.970 
when your teeth aren't there there you
know<00:00:30.900> they're<00:00:31.080> right<00:00:31.230> down<00:00:31.470> there<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.859> your

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
know they're right down there and your

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.610 
know they're right down there and your
gums<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.730> know<00:00:32.850> into<00:00:33.390> your<00:00:33.480> jaw<00:00:34.170> bone<00:00:34.200> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
gums and you know into your jaw bone and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.560 
gums and you know into your jaw bone and
basically<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.820> happen<00:00:36.000> when<00:00:36.360> your

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
basically what can happen when your

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.290 
basically what can happen when your
tooth<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.960> pulled<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.829> little<00:00:38.670> bits<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.059> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
tooth is pulled as a little bits of that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.209 
tooth is pulled as a little bits of that
bone<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:40.110> eventually<00:00:40.680> work<00:00:40.890> their<00:00:40.920> way

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
bone can eventually work their way

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
bone can eventually work their way
through<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.200> I'm<00:00:43.200> sure<00:00:43.410> there's<00:00:43.620> probably<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
through and I'm sure there's probably a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.010 
through and I'm sure there's probably a
better<00:00:43.950> explanation<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.360> than<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
better explanation for it than that and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990 
better explanation for it than that and
not<00:00:46.680> explaining<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.280> probably<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> best<00:00:47.820> way

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
not explaining it probably the best way

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.220 
not explaining it probably the best way
of<00:00:48.030> possibly<00:00:48.510> could<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:49.020> basically

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
of possibly could but that's basically

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
of possibly could but that's basically
what<00:00:49.710> happens<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.879> had<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.329> those<00:00:51.480> pop

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
what happens and I had one of those pop

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.049 
what happens and I had one of those pop
up<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.469> work<00:00:52.800> its<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.550> last<00:00:53.699> week

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
up and work its way out this last week

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.049 
up and work its way out this last week
and<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.660> did<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.530> some<00:00:55.739> before<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.550> but

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and I did have some before that one but

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
and I did have some before that one but
it<00:00:57.449> was<00:00:57.660> before<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> got<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.350> dentures<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
it was before I got the dentures and you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.439 
it was before I got the dentures and you
know<00:00:59.489> they<00:00:59.640> kind<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> help<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.300> weren't

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
know they kind of help but they weren't

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.689 
know they kind of help but they weren't
too<00:01:00.660> bad<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:02.100> most<00:01:02.370> recent

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
too bad but this one this most recent

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.460 
too bad but this one this most recent
one<00:01:02.730> hurt<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.270> lot<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.960> guessing<00:01:04.350> it's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
one hurt a lot and I'm guessing it's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109 
one hurt a lot and I'm guessing it's
because<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:05.100> denture<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.670> rubbing<00:01:05.970> up

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
because my denture was rubbing up

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.640 
because my denture was rubbing up
against<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> did<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.380> I

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
against it when I did have it in I

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.649 
against it when I did have it in I
didn't<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.270> there's<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
hurt so much and it did you know after a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.980 
hurt so much and it did you know after a
few<00:01:23.490> days<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.909> did<00:01:24.060> work<00:01:24.210> its<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
few days it did work its way out and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.910 
few days it did work its way out and
it's<00:01:25.200> gone<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.280> goes<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> lot<00:01:26.759> better<00:01:26.820> um

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920

rinsing with salt water can help not you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.289 
rinsing with salt water can help not you
know<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.400> help<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:41.700> bit<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.090> pain

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
but more importantly it keeps the area

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.100 
but more importantly it keeps the area
clean<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> should<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.750> doing<00:01:45.990> anyway
