00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
look at the skill I mean this is pretty

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.459 
look at the skill I mean this is pretty
amazing<00:01:55.819> and<00:01:56.270> for<00:01:56.840> some<00:01:56.990> reason<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.319> thought

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
amazing and for some reason I thought

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.409 
amazing and for some reason I thought
that<00:01:57.649> demon<00:01:57.950> Avengers<00:01:58.369> were<00:01:58.579> pretty<00:01:58.819> slow<00:01:59.119> but

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.419 
that demon Avengers were pretty slow but

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.899 
that demon Avengers were pretty slow but
I'm<00:01:59.719> training<00:01:59.959> pretty<00:02:00.319> fast<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:01.789> was

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.249 
I'm training pretty fast and I was
probably<00:02:02.060> thinking<00:02:02.299> of<00:02:02.539> another<00:02:02.719> character

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
probably thinking of another character

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.099 
probably thinking of another character
but<00:02:03.529> look<00:02:03.770> at<00:02:03.889> this<00:02:04.009> going<00:02:04.869> it's<00:02:05.869> one<00:02:05.959> of<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
but look at this going it's one of the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.929 
but look at this going it's one of the
