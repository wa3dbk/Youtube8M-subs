 hello everyone with you svetlana nasgorodnaya and 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.630
 now I want to show how you can 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.410
 I worked with styles yesterday 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.710
 videos with styles and more than 120 styles 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.590
 transitions but there are also some difficult 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.340
 style and there need to add pictures 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.590
 if you choose only style and there to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.160
 hiv and but let's say some pictures then 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.279
 you will have empty films in your slide 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:38.190
 Here, for example, pictures like here 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.790

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.790

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 double click on the parameters 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.820
 slide and see what's important to me 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.609
 I want to show that we understood if you 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.210
 look at the style and on the right goes here 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.010
 player is how many pictures you need 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.930
 add to this picture 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.570
 if you choose just the style and you 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.150
 just one photo then if there 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.600
 two three or four all the rest will be 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.960

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.790

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.040

 I show in principle with one style but 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.090
 when you choose here look we press 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.580

 attention to the left here is where the inscription 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.480
 an inscription appears 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.070
 when you push it you can it 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.560
 either adjust to can drag 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.900
 wherever you want her to be 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.970
 have you can either change it and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.610
 write what you need but if you donâ€™t 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.769
 need inscriptions need only style then you 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.830
 here it is with you blue lit 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.550
 selected and click on the inscriptions minus you 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:59.230
 delete the style remains it you delete 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:03.400
 and click ok and look through that is 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.040
 the style remained itself directly 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.170
 what is what I think now you 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.299
 will be much easier and easier to work with and 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.560
