drill stopper assembly you can then

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.030 
drill stopper assembly you can then
clean<00:00:52.690> each<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:53.140> these<00:00:53.260> parts<00:00:53.680> using

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
clean each of these parts using

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.829 
clean each of these parts using
handpiece<00:00:54.580> oil<00:00:54.879> lubricant<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.839> then

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
handpiece oil lubricant and then

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.910 
handpiece oil lubricant and then
reassemble<00:00:59.549> to<00:01:00.549> reassemble<00:01:01.229> it's<00:01:02.229> easiest<00:01:02.739> if

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
reassemble to reassemble it's easiest if

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.950 
reassemble to reassemble it's easiest if
you<00:01:03.070> do<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.280> in<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.460> correct<00:01:03.699> order<00:01:04.059> they've

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
you do it in the correct order they've

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.140 
you do it in the correct order they've
indicated<00:01:05.350> this<00:01:05.770> by<00:01:05.979> putting<00:01:06.190> a<00:01:06.400> one<00:01:06.670> as

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
indicated this by putting a one as

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.870 
indicated this by putting a one as
opposed<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:08.130> a-1<00:01:09.130> which<00:01:09.369> is<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> side

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
opposed to a to a-1 which is the side

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.330 
opposed to a to a-1 which is the side
that<00:01:09.909> would<00:01:10.150> go<00:01:10.299> in<00:01:10.450> first<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.890> one<00:01:12.070> goes

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
that would go in first so the one goes

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.200 
that would go in first so the one goes
into<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:13.090> head<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.320> handpiece<00:01:15.210> notice

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
into the head of the handpiece notice

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.510 
into the head of the handpiece notice
that<00:01:16.330> there<00:01:16.510> are<00:01:16.630> small<00:01:16.930> grooves<00:01:17.320> here<00:01:17.920> so<00:01:18.430> it

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
that there are small grooves here so it

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.240 
that there are small grooves here so it
only<00:01:18.670> fits<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.330> in<00:01:19.570> one<00:01:19.780> direction<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.500> has<00:01:21.039> to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
only fits in in one direction and has to

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.179 
only fits in in one direction and has to
fit<00:01:21.430> in<00:01:21.549> completely<00:01:22.680> once<00:01:23.680> that's<00:01:23.920> all<00:01:24.100> the

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
fit in completely once that's all the

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.020 
fit in completely once that's all the
way<00:01:24.280> in<00:01:24.509> insert<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.659> remaining<00:01:25.960> part<00:01:27.030> over

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
way in insert the remaining part over

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.209 
way in insert the remaining part over
the<00:01:28.149> edge<00:01:28.409> click<00:01:29.409> all<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.649> way<00:01:29.770> down<00:01:30.009> into

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
the edge click all the way down into

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.580 
the edge click all the way down into
place<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:30.820> slide<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.939> now<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.929> drill<00:01:35.170> stopper
