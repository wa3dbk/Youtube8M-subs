00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
into one because this game actually

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.429 
into one because this game actually
presents<00:01:44.850> me<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.479> whole<00:01:45.750> new<00:01:45.780> challenges

hour of playing it and I feel that I
have<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.729> relearn<00:01:57.240> how<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> become<00:01:58.079> better<00:01:58.259> at

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
weeks till I actually figure the game

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.520 
weeks till I actually figure the game
out

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
examples of what I can actually

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.900 
examples of what I can actually
construct<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.440> my<00:02:19.590> mind<00:02:19.800> because<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
construct in my mind because that's the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.790 
construct in my mind because that's the
way<00:02:20.940> my<00:02:21.209> mind<00:02:21.480> works<00:02:21.660> my<00:02:22.170> mind<00:02:22.440> basically

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
way my mind works my mind basically

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.740 
way my mind works my mind basically
breaks<00:02:23.280> stuff<00:02:23.459> down<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.569> haven't

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
broke this game down I just haven't had

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.240 
broke this game down I just haven't had
enough<00:02:29.580> time<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.970> basically<00:02:30.709> take<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.860> all<00:02:32.010> in

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
enough time to basically take it all in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.640 
enough time to basically take it all in
and<00:02:32.459> give<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:34.489> what<00:02:35.489> comes<00:02:35.760> out<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.440> bit

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
and give you what comes out it's a bit

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.559 
and give you what comes out it's a bit
it<00:02:38.280> might<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.760> might<00:02:38.790> seem<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.209> it's<00:02:39.480> not

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
the biggest one of those was being how

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.660 
the biggest one of those was being how
poorly<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.019> ps3<00:03:16.530> version<00:03:16.560> looks<00:03:17.069> compared<00:03:17.549> to

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
basically on my own endeavor and like I

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.080 
basically on my own endeavor and like I
love<00:03:58.380> how<00:03:58.650> they<00:03:58.859> basically<00:03:59.280> use<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.880> same

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
love how they basically use the same

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.000 
love how they basically use the same
perks<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.630> kill<00:04:00.780> loadouts<00:04:01.200> but<00:04:01.530> actually

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
perks and kill loadouts but actually

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.370 
perks and kill loadouts but actually
integrated<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.760> technology<00:04:03.660> like<00:04:04.350> this

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
integrated in the technology like this

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.259 
integrated in the technology like this
for<00:04:04.980> example<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.459> target<00:04:05.850> finder<00:04:06.060> is

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
for example this target finder is

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.210 
for example this target finder is
nothing<00:04:06.570> more<00:04:06.720> than<00:04:06.870> marksman<00:04:07.380> pro<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.160> I

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
nothing more than marksman pro and I

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.410 
nothing more than marksman pro and I
didn't<00:04:08.459> really<00:04:08.609> catch<00:04:08.790> on<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.209> when<00:04:09.359> I

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
didn't really catch on to that when I

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.660 
didn't really catch on to that when I
first<00:04:09.720> noticed<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.320> but<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.829> really<00:04:11.250> like<00:04:11.489> the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
first noticed it but I really like the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.009 
first noticed it but I really like the
idea<00:04:11.700> behind<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.540> like<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:14.180> it's<00:04:15.180> it's<00:04:15.930> a

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
idea behind it like it it's it's a

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.490 
idea behind it like it it's it's a
wonderful<00:04:16.049> sight<00:04:16.739> on<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.970> very<00:04:18.269> strong<00:04:18.660> gun<00:04:18.930> I'm
