00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
energem which the pterodactyl bonded

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.320 
energem which the pterodactyl bonded
with<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.940> gonna<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
with so we know that it's gonna be a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.510 
with so we know that it's gonna be a
pterodactyl<00:02:10.050> Ranger<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.099> also<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
pterodactyl Ranger this is also the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.780 
pterodactyl Ranger this is also the
first<00:02:11.760> time<00:02:11.970> we

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
first time we

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.300 
first time we
to<00:02:12.939> see<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.329> morphing<00:02:13.930> sequence<00:02:14.469> the<00:02:15.069> black

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
to see the morphing sequence the black

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.869 
to see the morphing sequence the black
spandex<00:02:15.730> morphing<00:02:16.450> sequence<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.200> full<00:02:18.129> view<00:02:18.579> I

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
spandex morphing sequence in full view I

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.780 
spandex morphing sequence in full view I
think<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.420> caught<00:02:19.719> more<00:02:20.049> attention<00:02:20.650> now<00:02:20.950> than

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
think it caught more attention now than

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.940 
think it caught more attention now than
when<00:02:22.390> they<00:02:22.569> split<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.959> five<00:02:23.170> rangers<00:02:23.680> into

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
when they split the five rangers into

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.920 
when they split the five rangers into
the<00:02:24.040> five<00:02:24.250> screens<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.120> then<00:02:25.299> you<00:02:25.540> don't

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the five screens and then you don't

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.740 
the five screens and then you don't
really<00:02:26.230> get<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.469> see<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.280> whole<00:02:27.489> picture

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
really get to see the whole picture

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.420

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
but since chase did it by himself that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.149 
but since chase did it by himself that
black<00:02:33.430> spandex<00:02:33.760> really<00:02:34.480> well<00:02:35.349> it's<00:02:35.950> really

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159
