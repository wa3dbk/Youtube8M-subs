down<00:05:29.169> or<00:05:29.649> you<00:05:29.829> can<00:05:30.039> go<00:05:30.159> up<00:05:30.360> so<00:05:31.360> that<00:05:31.479> you<00:05:31.569> can

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:31.689 
down or you can go up so that you can

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:36.670 
down or you can go up so that you can
play<00:05:31.899> along<00:05:32.169> with<00:05:32.379> it

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.690 

so<00:05:37.680> that's<00:05:37.860> pretty<00:05:38.070> much<00:05:38.190> it<00:05:38.520> in<00:05:38.610> a<00:05:38.670> nutshell

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
so that's pretty much it in a nutshell

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.700 
so that's pretty much it in a nutshell
you<00:05:39.360> can<00:05:39.540> turn<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.840> lights<00:05:40.050> on<00:05:40.230> and<00:05:40.380> off<00:05:40.500> by

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
you can turn the lights on and off by

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.990 
you can turn the lights on and off by
holding<00:05:40.800> these<00:05:41.040> two<00:05:41.100> buttons<00:05:41.610> down<00:05:41.760> at<00:05:41.910> the

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
holding these two buttons down at the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.100 
holding these two buttons down at the
same<00:05:42.180> time<00:05:42.480> and<00:05:42.980> kind<00:05:43.980> of<00:05:47.660> further<00:05:48.660> round<00:05:48.960> with

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
same time and kind of further round with

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.570 
same time and kind of further round with
it<00:05:49.230> on<00:05:49.350> your<00:05:49.500> own<00:05:49.650> but<00:05:50.520> since<00:05:51.210> I'm<00:05:51.360> no<00:05:51.510> drummer

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480 
hi-hat and the base is 2 and if you go

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.700 
hi-hat and the base is 2 and if you go
to<00:07:15.540> the<00:07:15.750> chart<00:07:16.020> more<00:07:17.450> it'll<00:07:18.450> tell<00:07:18.630> you<00:07:18.780> what
