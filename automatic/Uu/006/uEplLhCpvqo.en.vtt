00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.080
 sure these were not very good 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.720
 pets to have at home imagine 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.690
 that piece of plasta the size of a 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.930
 person but good the bunnies are very 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.350
 different the sacks of these dwarves are 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.360
 tiny little girls very hard and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.970
 round in fact we have left you here 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.860
 some so you can see and I'm going to 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.170
 say a bit how are the poops and how 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.600
 are the steps to show you that if 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.390
 they are hygienic pets and they are pets 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.690
 very good to have in a flat here 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.570
 I have them you can see they do not stain anything they are 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.000
 perhaps the hardest of all and 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.640
 they are also very round, very easy 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.080
 of removing are hygienic pets and they are 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.600
 pets that normally make their 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.450
 countries and their poop in a corner is 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.850
 you see a triangular instrument of 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.310
 plastic in which we fill in a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.500
 substrate to honey personally the one that most 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.140
 I like the one I consider the most hygienic 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.820
 is the newspaper of pressed newspaper 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.210
 also because it is biodegradable 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.490
 talk and it's the least harm to the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.260
 nature so to speak all of paper 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.030
 recycled newspaper 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.710
 recycling 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.150
 the steps will get used to 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.420
 make them there is a pee that is also 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.460
 very little abundant is a tiny country 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.040
 and very focused and the only thing 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.049
 we will need is to change the poop and 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.500
 pises for every two or three days 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.869
 avoid odors from the cluster and by 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.270
 last tell you that there are very few 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.130
 diseases that can transmit to us 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.899
 the people especially when we have 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.850
 animals that are dewormed and 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.920
 they vaccinate periodically 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.250
 We recommend two visits per year to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.250
 vet
