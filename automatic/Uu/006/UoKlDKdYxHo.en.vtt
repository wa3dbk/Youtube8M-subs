00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
fight for an app um so jailbreaking is

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.920 
fight for an app um so jailbreaking is
basically<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.009> unlocking<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.630> full

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
basically just unlocking the full

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 
basically just unlocking the full
potential<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:35.010> device<00:00:35.280> apple<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.030> know

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
potential of your device apple you know

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.889 
potential of your device apple you know

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
has all these dr drm restrictions and

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.440 
has all these dr drm restrictions and
stuff<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.440> put<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.710> their<00:00:40.890> devices<00:00:41.190> um<00:00:41.670> too

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
stuff they put in their devices um too

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.720 
stuff they put in their devices um too
and<00:00:43.170> they<00:00:43.320> kind<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.219> hold<00:00:44.550> you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and they kind of you know with hold you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.400 
and they kind of you know with hold you
from<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.390> making<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.870> yours<00:00:46.340> and

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
from really making it yours and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
from really making it yours and
jailbreaking<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:50.090> in<00:00:51.090> my<00:00:51.239> opinion

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
jailbreaking just really in my opinion

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.819 
jailbreaking just really in my opinion
it<00:00:52.020> brings<00:00:52.559> your<00:00:53.219> phone<00:00:53.550> back<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.930> you're

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it brings your phone back to you you're

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.350 
it brings your phone back to you you're
the<00:00:56.010> owner<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.760> phone<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.149> do

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the owner of your phone you can do

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
the owner of your phone you can do
whatever<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> um<00:00:58.710> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
whatever you want with it um so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.060 
whatever you want with it um so
jailbreaking<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.539> basically<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.500> hacking

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
jailbreaking is basically just hacking

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.380 
jailbreaking is basically just hacking
your<00:01:02.969> your<00:01:03.510> iPhone<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.729> customizing<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
your your iPhone and customizing it to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
your your iPhone and customizing it to
your<00:01:06.689> likings<00:01:07.290> um<00:01:09.229> that's<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.530> jailbreaking

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
your likings um that's what jailbreaking

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.990 
your likings um that's what jailbreaking
is<00:01:11.840> in<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> nutshell<00:01:13.080> um<00:01:15.740> that's<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.520> um

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
is in a nutshell um that's really it um

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.050 
is in a nutshell um that's really it um
and<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:19.619> safe<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> jailbreak<00:01:20.460> now<00:01:20.670> there<00:01:20.970> are
