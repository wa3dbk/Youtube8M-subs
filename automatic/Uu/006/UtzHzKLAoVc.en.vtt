my friends my mechanics everybody around
me<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.390> I'm<00:01:48.390> pretty<00:01:48.899> confident<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.619> can

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
me and I'm pretty confident that we can

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.960 
me and I'm pretty confident that we can
make<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.070> happen<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:50.790> they<00:01:50.939> just

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
make this happen and now they just

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.010 
make this happen and now they just
nobody<00:01:51.479> else<00:01:51.630> has<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.960> confidence<00:01:53.899> look<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
nobody else has that confidence look the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.850 
nobody else has that confidence look the
gold<00:01:55.259> one

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
gold one

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.900 
gold one
the<00:01:57.860> biggest<00:01:58.190> thing<00:01:58.310> would<00:01:58.370> be<00:01:58.580> mechanical

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
the biggest thing would be mechanical

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.060 
the biggest thing would be mechanical

million pieces will be pretty safe even

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.980 
million pieces will be pretty safe even
at<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:28.850> kind<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.120> speed<00:02:29.270> coming<00:02:29.660> down<00:02:29.750> from

that kind of air hitting the dirt you
know<00:02:32.990> be<00:02:33.500> strapped<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:34.070> I've<00:02:34.220> got<00:02:34.400> some<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.820> the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
know be strapped in I've got some of the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.460 
know be strapped in I've got some of the
best<00:02:35.060> safety<00:02:35.420> equipment<00:02:35.780> than<00:02:35.900> Motorsports

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
best safety equipment than Motorsports

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.710 
best safety equipment than Motorsports
is<00:02:36.709> pretty<00:02:37.640> much<00:02:37.790> all<00:02:37.970> monster<00:02:38.270> trucks<00:02:38.510> have

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
is pretty much all monster trucks have

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.750 
is pretty much all monster trucks have
nowadays<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.800> we're<00:02:39.950> pretty<00:02:40.130> safe<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.610> there

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
nowadays so we're pretty safe in there
