keyboards<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> downside<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:42.960> there's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200

keyboards the downside is that there's
no<00:01:43.290> backlighting<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> keep

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

the keyboard aimed at the screen because
