guitar

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.740 
guitar
so<00:00:47.150> I<00:00:48.400> guess<00:00:49.400> the<00:00:49.580> last<00:00:49.820> few<00:00:50.270> months<00:00:50.570> I've<00:00:50.720> been

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
so I guess the last few months I've been

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.230 
so I guess the last few months I've been
kind<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.260> keeping<00:00:52.100> an<00:00:52.250> eye<00:00:52.370> out<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:53.200> this<00:00:54.200> one

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
kind of keeping an eye out and this one

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.300 
kind of keeping an eye out and this one
is<00:00:56.240> about<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.780> same<00:00:56.930> as<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.230> crane<00:00:57.440> except<00:00:57.950> it

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
is about the same as the crane except it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.950 
is about the same as the crane except it
just<00:00:58.340> has<00:00:58.730> I<00:00:58.970> guess<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.300> regular<00:00:59.600> regular

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
just has I guess the regular regular

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.160 
just has I guess the regular regular
mahogany<00:01:00.590> body<00:01:00.740> and<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.670> pickups<00:01:02.150> where<00:01:03.020> the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
mahogany body and the pickups where the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.580 
mahogany body and the pickups where the
kareena<00:01:03.470> model<00:01:03.830> had<00:01:04.780> us<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.930> mate<00:01:06.170> Seymour

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
kareena model had us a mate Seymour

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.550 
kareena model had us a mate Seymour
Duncan<00:01:06.909> I<00:01:07.909> think<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.509> was<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.659> 59<00:01:09.140> in<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.380> neck

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
Duncan I think it was a 59 in the neck

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.160 
Duncan I think it was a 59 in the neck
and<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.799> JB<00:01:10.130> in<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.429> bridge<00:01:10.780> this<00:01:11.780> one<00:01:11.960> has

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
and a JB in the bridge this one has

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.109 
and a JB in the bridge this one has
Duncan<00:01:12.679> design<00:01:13.009> pickups<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.920> I<00:01:15.920> think<00:01:16.820> these

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
Duncan design pickups and I think these

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.069 
Duncan design pickups and I think these
are<00:01:17.179> based<00:01:17.780> or<00:01:18.710> trying<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.429> model<00:01:19.789> the<00:01:20.119> super

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
are based or trying to model the super

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.440 
are based or trying to model the super
distortion<00:01:21.999> Seymour<00:01:22.999> Duncan<00:01:23.149> pickups<00:01:23.329> so<00:01:25.450> if

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
distortion Seymour Duncan pickups so if

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.599 
distortion Seymour Duncan pickups so if
you<00:01:26.600> look<00:01:26.749> at<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.319> last<00:01:27.469> demo<00:01:27.890> Dan<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.340> the

the same thing I played for the Les Paul
demo<00:02:26.349> but<00:02:27.510> now<00:02:28.510> playing<00:02:29.079> it<00:02:29.230> on<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.500> Hamer

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
demo but now playing it on the Hamer

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.990 
demo but now playing it on the Hamer
standard<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.900> I'm<00:02:32.019> gonna<00:02:32.170> start<00:02:32.379> with<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
standard and I'm gonna start with the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:03:09.940 
standard and I'm gonna start with the
bridge<00:02:34.239> pickup

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.870

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
so you can hear a little bit thicker
