00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.430 
that's what we've tried to do is maybe
get<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.730> cross<00:01:34.000> upon<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.450> party<00:01:34.870> which<00:01:35.290> is<00:01:35.320> a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
slightly different timing from the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.740

back just to keep you cornered started
there<00:02:00.729> we<00:02:00.790> go

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
there we go

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.000 
there we go
with<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.840> drag<00:02:02.020> can<00:02:02.229> swap<00:02:02.470> he<00:02:02.590> goes<00:02:02.740> into<00:02:02.860> the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
with the drag can swap he goes into the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.260 
with the drag can swap he goes into the
super<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.640> really<00:02:04.360> good<00:02:05.580> ops<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.729> save<00:02:06.940> once<00:02:07.150> so

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
super a really good ops to save once so

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.359 
super a really good ops to save once so
he<00:02:07.420> has<00:02:07.540> meter<00:02:07.810> for<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> drive<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:09.010> the<00:02:09.070> super

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
he has meter for the drive and the super

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.260 
he has meter for the drive and the super
so<00:02:09.460> he<00:02:09.520> can<00:02:09.640> do<00:02:09.790> that<00:02:09.910> again<00:02:10.000> if<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
so he can do that again if the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.610 
so he can do that again if the
opportunity<00:02:10.300> arises<00:02:13.260> whether<00:02:14.260> or<00:02:14.410> not<00:02:14.500> he

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
opportunity arises whether or not he

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.600 
opportunity arises whether or not he
will<00:02:14.830> actually<00:02:15.220> use<00:02:15.370> it

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
will actually use it

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.090 
will actually use it
yeah<00:02:16.330> he<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:16.840> has<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:16.990> threat<00:02:17.320> loaded<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:17.800> Shin

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
yeah he just has a threat loaded so Shin

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.040 
yeah he just has a threat loaded so Shin
has<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.370> worry<00:02:18.550> about<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:19.030> there<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.690> go

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
was really smart because the rekha only

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.120 
was really smart because the rekha only
takes<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.600> one<00:02:49.810> hit<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.590> has<00:02:50.739> one<00:02:50.980> hit<00:02:51.100> of

best option but he's just trying to

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.590 
best option but he's just trying to
press<00:03:14.460> momentum<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.090> would<00:03:15.210> think<00:03:15.330> at<00:03:15.480> this

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
press momentum I would think at this

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.510 
press momentum I would think at this
point<00:03:15.810> then<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:16.860> he's<00:03:17.010> trying<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> keep
