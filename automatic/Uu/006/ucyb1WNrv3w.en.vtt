00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello today we are going to make a linen bread 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.330
 without bran without cornstarch without gluten and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.730
 you will see how easy and how rich and stay 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.219
 attentive because at the end of the video I add 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 also a recipe for frozen yogurt this 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.199
 bread is made with a spoonful of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.420
 linen flax or linseed is one 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.640
 of the new ingredients allowed in 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.830
 the dukan diet can take a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.170
 tablespoon from the cruise phase 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.849
 We grind the flax seeds with a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.070
 electric grinder for about 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.200
 seconds until you get a flour 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 although it seems incredible, this is the only 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.270
 flour that we need to make this 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 we put bread in a bowl or in a cup and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.190
 we add a teaspoon of yeast 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.350
 royal by the way I'm measuring with a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.809
 small spoon of the ones that are 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.660
 they use for coffee not for dessert 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.360
 agreement I add a teaspoon of bolero ' 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 Ginger flavor is juice powder without 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.449
 sugar and finally the egg white 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.760
 large these are about 40 or 50 grams of 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.129
 clear we are going to stir with the spoon 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.659
 to mix everything as we go 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.600
 removing we will give 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.579
 notice that the mixture thickens this 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.740
 It is very characteristic of flour 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.899
 flax when it comes in contact with a 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.439
 liquid as in this case the clear 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:22.289
 egg forms an elastic mass you see what 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.689
 fast that is only a few seconds and in the 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.240
 mix will be ready we look for the mass in 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.459
 a small mold I'm using a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.950
 silicone mold but it can be a 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.590
 glass or earthenware mold we have 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.479
 coupled with a droplet of oil to 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.179
 that the bread does not stick a couple of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.879
 dry taps against the table so that 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.399
 the dough is well distributed in the mold and 

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:47.189
 We cook in the microwave 1 minute and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.829
 medium to maximum power fix what has 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.530
 uploaded and how fluffy it is 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.899
 incredible that this does not take flour we go 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.729
 to let it cool a couple of minutes and 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.969
 now I show you in more detail 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.359
 fix this bread can be cut in 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.209
 slices is fluffy and fluffy like 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.970
 a bread mold you know what it means 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:12.150
 this we can make a sandwich 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.560
 a great option for breakfast for 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.959
 mid morning or to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.780
 snack and now we go with the yogurt 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.450
 ice cream as easy as putting a yogurt or 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.790
 a glass of fresh cheese beaten during 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.550
 one hour in the freezer add one 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.980
 small teaspoon of bolero that like 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.590
 I tell you it 's juice powder without sugar and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.750
 remove just enough for the powder 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.819
 mix and so we will have a yogurt 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.489
 ice cream as a flavor parts more 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.040
 intense and others with smoother flavor has
