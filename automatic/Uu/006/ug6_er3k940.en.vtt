00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.870
 welcome from Munich where we are now the 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.210
 dell xps have found eleven and us that 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.050
 finally can watch live and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.870
 the person 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.030
 because it is even from today until 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.560
 Yesterday already available on the market 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.449
 the model online shop you can this 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.279
 Gorgeous new notebook with one 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.369
 brand new design by dell here 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.900
 could order it again, as it were 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.839
 take unboxing video because we have 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.820
 here the official packaging for 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.190
 example as you can see where the xps 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.620
 Eleven was in and there is too 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.940
 still a fancy power supply one 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.560
 separate box then look like this 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.380
 we look and we always show that 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.090
 like a mobile device should be synonymous 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.440
 in the mobile payment received but and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.510
 again sometimes more power 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.550
 as a day or two on the way to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.810
 you see, here was something quite 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.660
 interesting things they did 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.890
 Power supply not only kept small and 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.840
 this part of the cable here for a long time 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.330
 with a led then in but also 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.470
 two more parts than us 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.730
 For example, just this one 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.220
 Partially wearing plugs 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.660
 then you 3 pin end then this must 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.679
 if I take this second cable 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.929
 but many may have 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:08.840
 still the need that this by cable 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:11.609
 for example at home 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.109
 or maybe not right in the wall 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.090
 so to speak, plug the power supply because they are 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.920
 not have so much space and exactly 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.109
 then there are accordingly here or 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.200
 this solution is ideal but come 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:24.179
 Let's go back to the notebook with his 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 11.6 inches I only have a full hd display 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.469
 variant offers but a cow hd 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.780
 So also a very high resolution is 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.579
 really nice and thin and light 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.700
 offer a little different 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.259
 goes rom but first yes I'll do it once 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.310
 and then take a look 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.689
 bit of them then we can see 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.530
 You can do this wonderfully with one 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.780
 hand open too 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.700
 from about 90 degrees then you have to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.439
 However, to hold times but then 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.880
 a little bit backwards anyway 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.139
 until then you can do this up here though 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.270
 even with a hand on doing that 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:53.700
 mind you, a pre-production model 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.049
 I can not turn it on now 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.819
 the system is not on it but right now 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.819
 of course it has a touchscreen here 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.420
 and on 8 and 1 installed and 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.780
 of course different 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.280
 Intel Core variants are also available 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.550
 with the ESWE generation course 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.929
 latest intel processor technology in it 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.270
 seen so we can at the top a 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.770
 webcam the game of course just easy 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.930
 and we also have two microphones here 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.940
 which are of course ideal for that 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.050
 to use all if now grab 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.209
 then we want one here 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.550
 beautiful keyboard a bit 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.200
 applied to the technology 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.580
 Microsoft also uses your service 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.290
 Tablets because we have none here 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.700
 active pressure point so you can here 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.500
 really push as hard as you want 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.780
 that it's just a touch keyboard 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.550
 so to speak, but they are a 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.500
 Vibrant feedback is not a form 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.940
 already from the smartphone who types the quali 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.260
 to do that when when a button 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.030
 pressed a vibrate gently and 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.060
 then you definitely feel that one 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.650
 here also actively writes why has that 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.769
 dell made quite simply the device is 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.000
 that's how dimming and still wanted to be 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.100
 Pack enough power here 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.910
 there was no room for one 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.209
 deeper keyboard but at least at 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.730
 the touchpad can be seen here on the left and 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.440
 bottom right still press the button for 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.250
 left and right mouse button of course 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.400
 we have as you can see 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.630
 a beautiful big trackpad buttons 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.799
 moderately, of course, you can also see 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.450
 that has inserted many here 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.120
 especially the function keys are too 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.519
 pleasant and i think so too 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.350
 again that these function keys the 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.980
 now he actively uses it like that 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.980
 f keys 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.930
 without reach are good then look 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.180
 we are here laterally the connection 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.790
 once usb 3.0 saw where we have a 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.780
 power hdmi headphones and a 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.340
 speaker 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.560
 besides, we have one here 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.879
 Volume control of course, too 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.349
 very nice is especially in the tablet mode 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.849
 the area will still show 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.799
 on the front we have the on and off 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.439
 switch off here a little button 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.489
 so to speak, have to engage multiple 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.810
 and on the other side we have here 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.760
 not only a speaker but 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.769
 also a sdk very nice 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.870
 I have the xps 13 for example 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.700
 misses a usb 3 connection also with 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.620
 external power output so if you 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.239
 wanted to charge your phone overnight 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.129
 and the notebook is a standby 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.319
 could do that wonderfully and one 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.989
 kernels are of course wrong and someone 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.870
 should want to buy the money in 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.639
 airman or anywhere else in the office, it is 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.840
 of course always very convenient now 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.549
 I'll do that to me from the outside 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.840
 looked at me before seen before 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.639
 I also said you see this here 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.590
 is already something was taken because 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.949
 Touring the world here already has the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.840
 dell xps 11 to show yourself everywhere 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.690
 I have beautiful carbon look with 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.639
 a rubberized surface to the 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.870
 fingerprint is repellent then 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.310
 mainly we can see is this 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.289
 nice and fast again and also from below 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.639
 the device looks it is the same 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.580
 but we actually know the optics 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:49.419
 already from the xps 13 devices and the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.229
 new generation, so to speak, there 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.650
 it will be longer here now 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.060
 used 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.320
 find under this metal surface 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.590
 we only really like him 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.370
 so label the design here now 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.260
 would have beautified and otherwise can 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.880
 you see that the rubber crew is direct 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.680
 under the hinges is and otherwise 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.479
 I also pretty longish 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.139
 that means they will not be solved 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.199
 case 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.490
 fall off too fast so now comes 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.500
 the interesting thing is of course how it looks 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.050
 That's when I complete this whole 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.580
 so it could only be 180 degrees 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.920
 of course tilt backwards but like 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.980
 at the lenovo 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.270
 Jurassic this kind of 290 you to 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.800
 could have shown that for the first time 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.630
 Just put it up in the plane 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.150
 you are then you can on wonderful movie 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:34.260
 look now we have none here 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.910
 gummierung on the edge is actually pure 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.280
 theoretically you should think so 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.520
 do not put it down but it works 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.110
 have to say also the tent motor 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.000
 and then you can do it all the same 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.740
 just lay flat on the table 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.570
 Of course we do not patience the keyboard 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.280
 or the turns then synonymous 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.170
 accordingly also as it could as 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.780
 so wonderful in the world 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.520
 Of course, they comply with this 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.950
 very fancy device and is for example 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.900
 that the yoga 11 take what I am here 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.070
 took extra 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.730
 then you see this is on everyone 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.080
 case dekker has its right one 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.970
 keyboard and at first impression 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.890
 It does not seem to be much thicker 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.590
 as you can see, however, that has 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.930
 dell xps 11 a slight wedge shape and 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.730
 that does not mean that's when I say that 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.350
 lenovo right here now too 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.510
 lie down then you see here is 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.030
 clearly different in thickness 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.430
 available 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.040
 and that is exactly what this or that works 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.680
 dell also easier 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.940
 though maybe it could say that 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.800
 But the keyboard is me 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.380
 think that was solved quite well 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.750
 here from dell that's easy too 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.340
 still feels very good and if we 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.990
 just do it again two make each other 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.260
 Of course , they are right in size 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.600
 finally over yet lenovo the 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:52.320
 very high on special has in her 11th 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.220
 s jura ideapad device but you can open up 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.590
 Seeing every case there are some 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.550
 Differences there and keyboard keys 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.680
 I'm a bit taller too 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.510
 even as with all logo and find that 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.700
 I also very nice the screen 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.470
 frame also really similar size 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.200
 But it is always hard to see 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.820
 to the device, of course, are not you 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.740
 if you eat the game that was the dell here 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.060
 xps 11
