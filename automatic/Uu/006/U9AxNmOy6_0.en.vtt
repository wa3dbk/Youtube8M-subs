00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
all right guys I just want to give a

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.960 
all right guys I just want to give a
video<00:00:04.470> update<00:00:04.680> now<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.279> I've<00:00:05.400> switched<00:00:05.700> over

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
video update now that I've switched over

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.500 
video update now that I've switched over
to<00:00:06.089> Linux<00:00:06.529> it's<00:00:07.529> been<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> couple<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.130> days<00:00:08.510> with

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
to Linux it's been a couple of days with

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.790 
to Linux it's been a couple of days with
so<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.719> just<00:00:09.870> see<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.019> setup<00:00:10.320> hardware-wise

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
so you just see the setup hardware-wise

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.209 
so you just see the setup hardware-wise
is<00:00:11.190> still<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.550> exact<00:00:11.940> same<00:00:12.740> I'm<00:00:13.740> running

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
is still the exact same I'm running

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.750 
is still the exact same I'm running
headless<00:00:15.080> nothing<00:00:16.080> will<00:00:16.230> show<00:00:16.410> up<00:00:16.590> there<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.730> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
headless nothing will show up there so I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.210 
headless nothing will show up there so I
don't<00:00:17.970> use<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.150> GUI<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:19.560> everything<00:00:20.039> through

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
don't use it GUI I do everything through

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
don't use it GUI I do everything through
SSH<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.949> as<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.189> see<00:00:23.250> I've<00:00:23.460> got<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> fan

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
SSH and as you can see I've got a fan

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.060 
SSH and as you can see I've got a fan
over<00:00:24.570> here

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
over here

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.620 
over here

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
thing I wanted to show you guys was the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.459 
thing I wanted to show you guys was the
numbers<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.930> temperatures<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.469> getting<00:00:47.360> I

numbers and temperatures I'm getting I

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.119 
numbers and temperatures I'm getting I
used<00:00:49.469> ATI<00:00:49.920> config<00:00:51.110> 80<00:00:52.110> I'm<00:00:52.440> sorry<00:00:53.000> 80<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.180> flash

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
being down clocked as important it helps

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.359 
being down clocked as important it helps
keep<00:01:07.170> your<00:01:07.320> cards<00:01:07.650> cool<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.960> 875<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.560> safe

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
keep your cards cool and 875 is a safe

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550 
keep your cards cool and 875 is a safe
stable<00:01:11.790> core<00:01:12.600> clock<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.200> could<00:01:13.350> probably

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
stable core clock but you could probably

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.530 
stable core clock but you could probably
go<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> 900<00:01:14.400> I'm<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.060> next

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
go to 900 I'm going to do that next

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.710 
go to 900 I'm going to do that next
I<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:16.229> haven't<00:01:16.439> yet<00:01:17.540> current<00:01:18.540> temperatures

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
I just haven't yet current temperatures

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.969 
I just haven't yet current temperatures
as<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.350> yeah<00:01:22.680> 76<00:01:23.430> 69<00:01:24.150> 69<00:01:24.869> 48<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
as you can see yeah 76 69 69 48 this is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.800 
as you can see yeah 76 69 69 48 this is
under<00:01:26.189> full<00:01:26.369> load<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.880> they've<00:01:27.509> been<00:01:27.630> under

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
under full load and they've been under

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.090 
under full load and they've been under
full<00:01:28.049> load<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> little<00:01:28.619> while<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.770> top

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
full load for a little while that top

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.649 
full load for a little while that top
card<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.520> extra<00:01:29.850> hot<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.150> not<00:01:30.299> totally<00:01:30.479> sure

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
card is extra hot I'm not totally sure

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.740 
card is extra hot I'm not totally sure
why<00:01:31.759> but<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.880> want<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> bottom<00:01:33.600> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
why but I want to get to the bottom of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.660 
why but I want to get to the bottom of
that<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:33.990> some<00:01:34.140> point<00:01:35.930> also<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:38.340> show<00:01:38.610> you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that at some point also I can show you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
that at some point also I can show you
I'll<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.540> I'll<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:39.930> pick<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
I'll just I'll just pick one of the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.590 
I'll just I'll just pick one of the
cards<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.369> they<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.570> same

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
cards because they all do the same

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.310 
cards because they all do the same
magnet<00:01:43.110> hashes<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> show<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:48.320> bring

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
magnet hashes just to show you I bring

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.600 
magnet hashes just to show you I bring
it<00:01:49.470> about<00:01:49.710> 3:45<00:01:50.990> at<00:01:51.990> 875<00:01:53.420> core<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.689> 300<00:01:55.259> gram

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
it about 3:45 at 875 core and 300 gram

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.730 
it about 3:45 at 875 core and 300 gram
so<00:01:56.610> that's<00:01:56.759> pretty<00:01:56.909> good<00:01:57.180> I'm<00:01:58.140> pretty<00:01:58.439> pleased

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
so that's pretty good I'm pretty pleased

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.690 
so that's pretty good I'm pretty pleased
with<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.280> far<00:01:59.549> using<00:02:00.149> Diablo<00:02:00.869> minor<00:02:01.700> I've

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.910 
do SDK 2.4 and SDK 2.1 is better for the
58<00:02:28.030> 50s<00:02:28.540> that's<00:02:28.720> why<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.870> chose<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.680> just

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
58 50s that's why I chose that so I just

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.410 
58 50s that's why I chose that so I just
at<00:02:30.099> that<00:02:30.250> part<00:02:30.489> of<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.610> instructions<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.239> just

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
at that part of the instructions I just

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.970 
at that part of the instructions I just
flop<00:02:31.810> swap<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.470> out<00:02:32.530> for<00:02:33.599> SDK<00:02:34.599> 2.1<00:02:35.140> but

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
flop swap that out for SDK 2.1 but

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.710 
flop swap that out for SDK 2.1 but
