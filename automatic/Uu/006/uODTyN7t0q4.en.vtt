00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
this next step really makes the look I'm

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.399 
this next step really makes the look I'm
using<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.340> reflective<00:01:57.090> lime<00:01:57.450> green<00:01:57.930> eyeshadow

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409

using a reflective lime green eyeshadow
and<00:01:58.770> patting<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> over<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> ball<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> eye

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and patting it over the ball of the eye

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.200 
and patting it over the ball of the eye
so<00:02:01.409> right<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.040> middle<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> mobile<00:02:03.000> lid

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so right in the middle of the mobile lid

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.840 
so right in the middle of the mobile lid
this<00:02:04.140> will<00:02:04.320> act<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.740> our<00:02:05.070> central<00:02:05.549> lid

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
this will act as our central lid

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.850 
this will act as our central lid
highlight<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.869> gives<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.229> look<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.560> lot<00:02:07.740> of

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
highlight and it gives the look a lot of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.330 
highlight and it gives the look a lot of
light<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.459> dimension

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
light and dimension

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
light and dimension
so<00:02:11.340> hold<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.820> thought<00:02:12.150> let's<00:02:12.840> take<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> look

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
so hold that thought let's take a look

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.070 
so hold that thought let's take a look
at<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.890> color<00:02:14.280> wheel<00:02:14.600> recall<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.750> we<00:02:15.870> have

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
at a color wheel recall that we have

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.320 
at a color wheel recall that we have
greens<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.890> lid<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.430> purples<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.210> the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
greens on the lid and purples in the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.020 
greens on the lid and purples in the
crease<00:02:18.600> they<00:02:19.500> are<00:02:19.560> almost<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.370> opposite<00:02:20.820> sides

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
crease they are almost on opposite sides

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.150 
crease they are almost on opposite sides
of<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.330> color<00:02:21.720> wheel<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.440> blending<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> two

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
of the color wheel so blending the two

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.000 
of the color wheel so blending the two
might<00:02:23.670> prove<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.090> bit<00:02:24.270> challenging<00:02:25.010> between

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
might prove a bit challenging between

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.470 
might prove a bit challenging between
green<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.700> purple<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.250> blue<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:30.270> we're

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
green and purple we have blue so we're

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.300 
green and purple we have blue so we're
taking<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.930> blue<00:02:31.170> shadow<00:02:31.500> through<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.040> crease

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
taking a blue shadow through the crease

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.120 
taking a blue shadow through the crease
to<00:02:32.580> ease<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.300> transition<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.140> suddenly<00:02:34.800> our

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
to ease that transition and suddenly our

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.750 
to ease that transition and suddenly our
job<00:02:35.490> becomes<00:02:35.880> much<00:02:36.270> easier<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.950> using<00:02:38.490> a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
job becomes much easier I'm using a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.670 
job becomes much easier I'm using a
small<00:02:39.120> brush<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.750> etch<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.230> blue<00:02:40.410> shade

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
small brush to etch the blue shade

another perfectionist step I decided to

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.400
