of<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.939> funky<00:01:44.149> trick<00:01:44.479> I<00:01:44.570> think<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.990> original

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
of a funky trick I think on the original

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.870 
of a funky trick I think on the original
one<00:01:45.500> he<00:01:45.590> doesn't<00:01:45.799> have<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.159> B<00:01:46.340> note<00:01:46.549> but<00:01:46.729> it's

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
one he doesn't have the B note but it's

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.230 
one he doesn't have the B note but it's
two<00:01:47.119> guitars<00:01:47.540> I<00:01:47.780> think<00:01:48.380> doing<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.789> kind

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
two guitars I think doing that the kind

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.520 
two guitars I think doing that the kind
of<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.390> bend<00:01:50.630> down<00:01:50.840> because<00:01:51.049> doesn't<00:01:51.350> just

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
of the bend down because doesn't just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.620 
of the bend down because doesn't just
sound<00:01:51.649> like<00:01:51.890> one<00:01:52.100> note<00:01:52.369> there<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.210> me<00:01:53.360> so

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
sound like one note there to me so

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.999 
sound like one note there to me so
that's<00:01:54.079> how<00:01:54.259> I<00:01:54.289> do<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.710> little<00:01:54.860> trick

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
that's how I do that little trick

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.460 
that's how I do that little trick
anyways<00:01:55.490> lots<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:55.880> fun

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
well you're doing the chord version you

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.150 
well you're doing the chord version you
can<00:03:31.660> do<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> power<00:03:32.079> chord<00:03:32.349> either<00:03:32.500> with<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.889> 1st

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
can do a power chord either with the 1st

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.069 
can do a power chord either with the 1st
and<00:03:33.400> 3rd<00:03:33.459> or<00:03:33.849> 1st<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.359> 4th<00:03:34.569> doesn't<00:03:34.930> really

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
and 3rd or 1st and 4th doesn't really

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.589 
and 3rd or 1st and 4th doesn't really
matter<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.590> use<00:03:36.430> 1st<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.910> 4th<00:03:37.090> for<00:03:37.269> this<00:03:37.389> when

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
matter I use 1st and 4th for this when

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.000 
matter I use 1st and 4th for this when
there's<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:38.049> -<00:03:38.200> note<00:03:38.380> power<00:03:38.590> chord<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:38.920> be

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
there's just a - note power chord to be

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.860 
there's just a - note power chord to be
almost<00:03:39.130> at<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.549> time<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.970> I've<00:03:40.359> tucked<00:03:40.660> these

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
almost at the time and I've tucked these

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.720 
almost at the time and I've tucked these
fingers<00:03:41.260> away<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.530> give<00:03:42.069> you<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.190> good<00:03:42.459> clear

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
fingers away to give you a good clear

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.979 
fingers away to give you a good clear
view<00:03:42.910> normally<00:03:43.209> I'd<00:03:43.299> kind<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.599> play<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.840> more

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
view normally I'd kind of play it more

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:54.670 
view normally I'd kind of play it more
like<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.410> but<00:03:44.590> um

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:05.480 

Oh

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.490 

when<00:04:06.490> it<00:04:06.580> goes<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.760> single<00:04:07.360> light<00:04:07.600> single<00:04:08.290> note

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
when it goes to single light single note

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.530 
when it goes to single light single note
stuff<00:04:08.830> when<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.130> vocals<00:04:09.520> start<00:04:09.760> he's<00:04:10.240> playing

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
stuff when the vocals start he's playing

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.930 
stuff when the vocals start he's playing
a<00:04:10.660> single<00:04:10.870> notes<00:04:11.140> he<00:04:11.260> goes<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.500> suppose<00:04:11.980> game

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.979 

doesn't<00:04:18.940> really<00:04:19.090> sound<00:04:19.359> right<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.780> think

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
doesn't really sound right so I think

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.980 
doesn't really sound right so I think
it's<00:04:20.080> more<00:04:20.230> likely<00:04:20.500> he's<00:04:20.709> going<00:04:20.859> here<00:04:21.160> be<00:04:24.990> in

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
it's more likely he's going here be in

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.630 
it's more likely he's going here be in
the<00:04:26.140> next<00:04:26.290> part<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.620> me<00:04:26.860> sounds<00:04:27.190> like<00:04:27.250> flick

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
the next part to me sounds like flick

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.340 
the next part to me sounds like flick

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.710 

and

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
and

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:29.410 
and
Wow

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.090 

of<00:05:32.600> course<00:05:32.930> there<00:05:33.140> are<00:05:33.170> a<00:05:33.290> lot<00:05:33.500> more<00:05:33.530> rifts<00:05:33.950> in

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
of course there are a lot more rifts in

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.770 
of course there are a lot more rifts in
this<00:05:34.250> tune<00:05:34.520> I<00:05:34.640> think<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:35.030> would<00:05:35.120> be<00:05:35.240> great<00:05:35.570> for

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
this tune I think it would be great for

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.420 
this tune I think it would be great for
your<00:05:35.870> development<00:05:36.470> as<00:05:36.620> a<00:05:36.650> guitar<00:05:37.040> player<00:05:37.220> to

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
have a go at work in them at yourself I

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.750
