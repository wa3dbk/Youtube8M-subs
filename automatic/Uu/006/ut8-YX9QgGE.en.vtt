 We are very good, we are all here 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.170
 in minecraft this time to see another type 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.960
 of bots a pretty big bot that is the 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.520
 tornado boat good what it does 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.290
 basically is to generate any kind of 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.029
 tornado in minecraft at different level 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.190
 already different size that is to say it is a 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.570
 authentic fucking madness then let's 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.610
 go see it one by one today I hope that 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.410
 you like it worth remember remember like if 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.520
 you really like this type of bots and 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.050
 You can also download it in the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.489
 description so you do not have any 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.380
 problem and you can try it yourself 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.540
 well said this we will go testing what 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.910
 there are five types of tornado that I have 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.140
 in hand the tornado is worth one is the cadiz 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.519
 seen in the trailer that is the first 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.500
 that I'm going to release right now then 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.629
 I'm going to release a couple of vaquitas vaquitas 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.010
 so you can see how they fly ie the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.500
 tornado what it does is catch any 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.179
 type of mods of mods that say sorry and 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.250
 any type of block and move it towards 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.930
 up is going to release it and at the end of 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.420
 video I'll release two of these great vouchers 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.409
 set yourself qatar 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 one 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.810
 and the panties 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.860
 oh my god please piece of bots jb 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.890
 like my mother 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.140
 what madness for all those blocks 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.180
 When the tornado falls, it will be 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.280
 soil that is to say they are distributed by all 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.350
 sides you can see that it is a 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.330
 was really crazy how awful 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.820
 leaving on the ground a land worth going 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:42.350
 leaving broken here over here 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.940
 my mother epic epic good this would be 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.350
 the biggest tornado there is 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.360
 minecraft I at least have not seen 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.160
 none more than this is worth and good now 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.570
 let's do 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.340
 let's keep trying it worked for me 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.500
 please forgive me but it is that I get excited 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.960
 Well now we will go to see how it goes 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.550
 and I will continue to put another type of 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.470
 tornado vale we have another tornado that is 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.710
 the work but what it does is generate 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.450
 a tornado worth of fire that would happen 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.400
 because if we are in a snowy biome or 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.800
 be snowed not of grass that is biome 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.540
 of forest because it would burn the whole forest 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.000
 it's obviously worth the most 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.010
 little one is worth noting that releasing 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.320
 how many and are smaller but 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.180
 they are also an authentic madness worth 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.070
 I'm going to release them around here was a soldier 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.800
 I think that 10 11 12 34 fictitious 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.530
 look at what chulada macho are blocks like 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.140
 of fire that they are giving are rotating 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.709
 which one is good we're going to release another type 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.769
 of tornado that is this one is called word 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.050
 as good software if you have understood 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.049
 that what he does here is not seen but what 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.460
 what it does is move the land, it's worth no 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.590
 you see here why 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.280
 elevated that became more curious to 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.280
 record it here that put the times set one 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.170
 it became more and more curious to 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.960
 record it here but what it does already 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.670
 I say is to move the earth it turns around 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.610
 and put it back in here, yes 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.610
 will leave but I will not leave why not 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.670
 I do not know if you have noticed that there is 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.250
 bursts this is the air that generates the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.140
 tornado is worth it with loose the tornado what 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.970
 What it does is generate as it looks at the leaves 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.680
 that fly around here so well then the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.420
 to perez but good, well, this one does not 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.430
 let's be able to see why it does not let me 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.250
 I'm in a snowy biome and it will not let me 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.500
 It's worth the trip and it's worth it and let it go 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.240
 here what it does is to do as a 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.490
 cave and go loosing all the blocks 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.410
 where it comes out of the fucking eggs 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.570
 it is no better to say that they admire 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.020
 put several so you see it cha cha 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.420
 cha cha 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.730
 all those blocks are worth it is placed 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.920
 say you do not lose any if there's 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.990
 Diamond cave not place it here 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.040
 it has more or that is to say now the one that has 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.860
 bundled here 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.180
 Look, you see how caves he has 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.590
 letting go and I tell you how you have 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.210
 seen as it is releasing everything it catches 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.880
 in his step of releasing several so that 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.640
 you see the madness 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.580
 creative beasts I'm surfing 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.310
 suffering the good land and finally 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.590
 we have another tornado but this one I do not know 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.750
 what class is 12 I do not know if it will be for 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.060
 the version of the ford that is called test 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.000
 item or equal is not a tornado and I'm 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.770
 thrown away but good what happens that I do not 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.230
 I can continue, it does not, it does not leave me and 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.880
 is sounding has more wanted than you see 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.530
 this look this now works here it's worth 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.450
 as dipper what it does is give it the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.330
 return is worth the blocks and returns it to 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.370
 place has no more even the water that 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.260
 they are blocks of water also what is 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.290
 crazy look look at my friend loves me 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.300
 it even doubles it is worth fixing 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.170
 then we have other little things also from 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.670
 bots 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.770
 one thing that we have here is the sensor 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.810
 of tornado to really see 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.450
 where is a tornado if it is close if 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.850
 he gives us the alarm if he does not give it to us 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.190
 etcetera is valid and finally we have the 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.920
 tornado sirens that what we do is 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.390
 hit a giant mermaid okay I want that 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.030
 the listening will go up the sound 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.720
 it is super ethical that you are going to be deaf 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.720
 bastards look 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.210
 it sounds 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.210
 the good ones 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:10.110
 the fac file fai total because it does not sound 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.270
 I want to go, it sounds like ringing 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.260
 well, it's going to leave me total fire what 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.260
 does is do 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.460
 as it has no more and I have done 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.830
 as if it were the larva since 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.660
 you want better you can try everything 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.729
 this then you are good the boat 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.169
 is for version 1.64 for the one that 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.940
 I want to know and now what I'm going to do 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.100
 it's madness is to say I'm going to drop a 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.169

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.880
