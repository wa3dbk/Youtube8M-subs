this<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.930> our<00:00:07.049> creative<00:00:07.529> expressions

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
this is our creative expressions

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.419 
this is our creative expressions
learning<00:00:08.580> area<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.559> space<00:00:11.160> for

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
learning area and it is a space for

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.430 
learning area and it is a space for
students<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:11.940> represent<00:00:12.300> their<00:00:12.780> thinking<00:00:13.170> in

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
students to represent their thinking in

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.279 
students to represent their thinking in
lots<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.009> different<00:00:14.070> ways<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:15.420> feel<00:00:15.690> that

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
lots of different ways and I feel that

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.230 
lots of different ways and I feel that
we've<00:00:16.650> been<00:00:16.680> able<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
we've been able to do that with the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.120 
we've been able to do that with the
materials<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.140> we've<00:00:19.289> provided<00:00:19.560> them<00:00:20.100> with

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
materials that we've provided them with

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.029 
materials that we've provided them with
a<00:00:21.090> lot<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.779> these<00:00:21.869> materials<00:00:22.109> were<00:00:22.500> actually

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
a lot of these materials were actually

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.890 
a lot of these materials were actually
collected<00:00:23.699> by<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> students<00:00:24.539> during<00:00:24.689> our

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
collected by the students during our

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500 
collected by the students during our
beautiful<00:00:25.350> stuff<00:00:25.590> project<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:27.060> had<00:00:27.269> an

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
beautiful stuff project and we had an

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.009 
beautiful stuff project and we had an
entire<00:00:28.189> math<00:00:29.189> problem<00:00:29.880> around<00:00:30.539> whether<00:00:30.869> or

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
entire math problem around whether or

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.690 
entire math problem around whether or
not<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.500> could<00:00:31.650> create<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> rainbow<00:00:32.369> of

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
not we could create a rainbow of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.479 
not we could create a rainbow of
material<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:34.380> would<00:00:34.829> say<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.219> about<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
material and I would say it was about a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760 
material and I would say it was about a
month<00:00:35.730> where<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.780> materials<00:00:37.260> were

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
month where all of these materials were

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
month where all of these materials were
mixed<00:00:38.579> together<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> table<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
mixed together on a table and the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.410 
mixed together on a table and the
students<00:00:40.410> had<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.739> organize<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.360> of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
students had to organize and a lot of

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
students had to organize and a lot of
the<00:00:42.480> terminology<00:00:42.690> came<00:00:43.320> out<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.739> sorting

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the terminology came out about sorting

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.270 
the terminology came out about sorting
in<00:00:44.700> order<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.420> create<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.350> rainbow<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
in order to create this rainbow that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.569 
in order to create this rainbow that
they<00:00:47.460> had<00:00:47.640> envisioned<00:00:48.770> we<00:00:49.770> also<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.309> other

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
they had envisioned we also have other

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.180 
they had envisioned we also have other
materials<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.510> these<00:00:52.079> salad<00:00:52.620> containers

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
materials in these salad containers

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
materials in these salad containers
which<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.610> free<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.180> recycle<00:00:54.539> them<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
which are free if you recycle them and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.639 
which are free if you recycle them and
it<00:00:55.949> gives<00:00:56.129> us<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.489> chance<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.410> have

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
it gives us a chance to see what we have

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.180 
it gives us a chance to see what we have
and<00:00:59.010> use<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.149> within<00:01:00.329> our<00:01:00.660> creative<00:01:01.109> area<00:01:01.500> we

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and use it within our creative area we

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.810 
and use it within our creative area we
also<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.960> self-portraits<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.700> Julie<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
also have self-portraits and Julie you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
also have self-portraits and Julie you
can<00:01:06.000> describe<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> self-portraits<00:01:07.619> are

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
can describe what the self-portraits are

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.060 
can describe what the self-portraits are
for<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> children<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> beginning<00:01:10.950> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
for so the children in the beginning of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.550 
for so the children in the beginning of
the<00:01:11.280> year<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> children<00:01:13.110> came<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the year was just as a children came to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.280 
the year was just as a children came to
school<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.520> got<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.270> kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.720> join<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
school we got them to kind of join and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.690 
school we got them to kind of join and
gave<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> lesson<00:01:16.680> about<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.490> learning

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
gave a lesson about just really learning

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.420 
gave a lesson about just really learning
looking<00:01:18.420> at<00:01:18.540> themselves<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.860> mirror<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
looking at themselves in the mirror and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.940 
looking at themselves in the mirror and
what<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> features<00:01:21.180> are<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.290> there<00:01:22.500> so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
what the features are and just there so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.039 
what the features are and just there so
that<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.580> got<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> closer<00:01:24.119> look<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.600> guess

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that they got a closer look I guess

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
that they got a closer look I guess
about<00:01:25.259> who<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.820> got

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
about who they are and then we got

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
about who they are and then we got
mirrors<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.110> got<00:01:28.259> each<00:01:28.470> child<00:01:28.860> to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
mirrors and then we got each child to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
mirrors and then we got each child to
draw<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.850> picture<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.630> herself<00:01:30.900> coach<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
draw a picture of herself coach of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.289 
draw a picture of herself coach of
themselves<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.579> wasn't<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.150> wasn't

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
themselves but it wasn't it wasn't

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.969 
themselves but it wasn't it wasn't
something<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.049> done<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> ones<00:01:34.619> we

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
something with just done the ones we

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.310 
something with just done the ones we
just<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> drew<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> initial<00:01:36.960> picture

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
just we got the drew the initial picture

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.289 
just we got the drew the initial picture
that<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.560> kept<00:01:37.770> revisiting<00:01:38.369> incident<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.090> they

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that we kept revisiting incident as they

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.730 
that we kept revisiting incident as they
kept<00:01:39.479> looking<00:01:39.840> at<00:01:39.930> themselves<00:01:40.350> more<00:01:40.560> they

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
kept looking at themselves more they

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.679 
kept looking at themselves more they
added<00:01:41.009> more<00:01:41.159> details<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> pictures<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
added more details to the pictures and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.899 
added more details to the pictures and
so<00:01:43.680> that's<00:01:43.860> why<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> children<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so that's why the children have a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.240 
so that's why the children have a
portrait<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.720> themselves<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.860> family

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
portrait of themselves and for family

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.010 
portrait of themselves and for family
involvement<00:01:47.700> during<00:01:48.090> our<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> think<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.899> our

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
involvement during our I think is our

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.760 
involvement during our I think is our
open<00:01:49.320> house<00:01:49.500> barbecue<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.310> had<00:01:50.340> parents

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
open house barbecue we had parents

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.620 
open house barbecue we had parents
engage<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.980> this<00:01:53.130> process<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.180> had<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
engage with this process we had the

engage with this process we had the
invitation<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.409> learning<00:01:55.830> set<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.310> with

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580

tried to work on their portraits with
their<00:02:02.490> parents<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.150> independently<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
their parents but independently and

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.859 
their parents but independently and
these<00:02:04.650> materials<00:02:05.340> initially<00:02:06.300> when<00:02:06.479> Joe<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
these materials initially when Joe and I

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.359 
these materials initially when Joe and I
started<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.380> were<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> cupboards<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
started they were in the cupboards and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.850 
started they were in the cupboards and
so<00:02:08.820> they're<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.060> packed<00:02:09.420> away<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.020> sometimes

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
so they're all packed away and sometimes

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.020 
so they're all packed away and sometimes
you<00:02:11.070> want<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.730> where<00:02:11.880> this

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you want to know do you know where this

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.960 
you want to know do you know where this
is<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.110> I'd<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:13.910> I'm<00:02:14.910> not

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
is or that is and I'd be like I'm not

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.550 
is or that is and I'd be like I'm not
sure<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.570> we're<00:02:15.660> searching<00:02:16.050> all<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.350> time

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
sure and we're searching all the time

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.580 
sure and we're searching all the time
and<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.490> decided<00:02:17.970> why<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.360> I'm<00:02:19.020> instead<00:02:19.470> of

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
and so we decided why is I'm instead of

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.740 
and so we decided why is I'm instead of
putting<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.340> away<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.820> we<00:02:20.940> can't<00:02:21.180> really<00:02:21.390> see

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
putting it away that we can't really see

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.260 
putting it away that we can't really see
or<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.290> don't<00:02:22.350> know<00:02:22.530> what's<00:02:22.770> what<00:02:23.280> what

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
or know we don't know what's what what

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.479 
or know we don't know what's what what
we<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:25.110> decide<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.590> pull<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.890> all<00:02:26.010> out<00:02:26.040> and

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
we have we decide to pull it all out and

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.960 
we have we decide to pull it all out and
in<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.000> way<00:02:27.150> -<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.600> children<00:02:27.870> are<00:02:28.020> able<00:02:28.110> to
