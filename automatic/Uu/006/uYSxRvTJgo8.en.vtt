00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:15.540
 nadine is to blame 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:31.279
 shoulder belt stop and shoulders 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:31.279
 to have a neck 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.350
 especially the neck has to be in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.489
 bench press nice warm be a high 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.489
 and down both ended post 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.010
 to the side 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.790
 that can be up to a certain degree 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.100
 expand 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.710
 20 400 per side is pretty much 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.380
 pretty strong word 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:42.800
 they are now doing 15 repetitions each 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:44.240
 page through ten look the arms that 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.119
 you stretched your arms west or and 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.810
 back to the front 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.890
 Spain is doing eight to ten times now 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.670
 if it works well too 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.670
 grab a little bit 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.690
 especially if you pay attention 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.340
 that you if you back 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.560
 Do not walk your shoulders forward 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.780
 come load and looking after you a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.160
 in front but that it stays up 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.850
 and the poor I stay behind 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.819
 turned 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:24.230
 the chest muscles with tasks 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.879
 let's start with one side reason 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.459
 but to go is the poor environment 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:34.310
 stretched what am I looking up with 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.360
 So is his estate for taking the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.360
 whole here with a country 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.610
 you can occasionally use as a 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.230
 huge play and accurately and I 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:57.859
 sometimes just done so long 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:03:00.549
 santos be diagonally so poor 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.549
 leave entangled 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.810
 now is to take it all the way back 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.810
 the hand just to reach in 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:18.350
 the same story resist shoulder to 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:24.640
 and is pulling forward here namely 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:27.410
 beautiful as coo and nice again 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.150
 and the whole 18 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.150
 the under work 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:57.049
 have the toes up by doing so 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.269
 we have the advantage of being a light one 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.400
 pull up the weight first that is the 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.190
 shoulder muscles must work the 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.480
 whole shoulder belt work and 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.090
 but relate the weight to the rear 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.250
 down that means we work complete 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.040
 Toppits with the lower fibers with 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.549
 the upper one and so have the complete one 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.310
 shoulder part also not only activates 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.900
 stretched like a movement in front of it 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.900
 but also activated 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.630
 the punishment 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.400
 That was the first time so come to the man 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.400
 the choice to put put
