00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.260
 hello friends as a state welcome to 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.610
 a new video of awaiting the full on 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.530
 this occasion is same game train that 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.150
 it's called stand of in its excellent 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.529
 twitter for our device we are going to 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.480
 start in the options section 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.250
 we have the option to change our 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.260
 nick and the sensitivity of the game if 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.720
 we go in play we have in the part 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.490
 left our level and the part of 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.379
 down the weapons that will be assigned to us 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.000
 depends on the level we have here 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.040
 we can observe the weapons and the level 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.199
 required now on the right side 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.879
 we found playing with our friends 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.860
 have the same application in their 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.150
 cellular and they look for the game since this one 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.580
 you need internet connection to be able to 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.680
 try it we will choose in this case a 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.180
 match match which means two 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.269
 equipment and the first one that reaches the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.339
 number of deaths will win we start and I 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.409
 I'm going to choose my weapon in this case and 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.850
 let's start this game is a 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.920
 excellent shooter has a quality 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.140
 acceptable graphics is not the best but it is 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.000
 very good in this case we end up 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.730
 killing fingers 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.500
 now we start again and kill him 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.770
 in the head we keep moving forward in the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.770
 fire 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.580
 is to tell them that the game requires a 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.700
 2.3 minimum version of hunger so 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.700
 everyone will meet that requirement and only 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 requires 150 mb of space between 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.860
 devices so it's a great option 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.780
 to games like modern combat that occupy 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.520
 too much space and they do not run very 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.090
 well in this case that game does not demand 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.030
 much 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.530
 even if I have a day of ram 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.149
 11.2 or one day exercised should be 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.729
 enough for them to run this 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.590
 game they killed me again let's go 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.590
 start again to see if losses 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.979
 and they killed me again as they see 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.869
 been starting to play this game like this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.580
 that I'm still not very good but it has 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.840
 liked it a lot and that's why I've 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.840
 brought against 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.480
 and it ended up killing my partner 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.090
 let's see that in the top 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.709
 and we managed to defeat him with a shot in the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.060
 head we will continue moving forward and here 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.090
 it seems another enemy so let's go 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.100
 liquidate it and we managed to defeat it like this 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.990
 that we keep moving forward we will see in the 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.970
 top that we found 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.090
 and here is another enemy so let's go 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.970
 see if we can reach it and throw it there 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.620
 some pull in the game has been for 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.270
 blame my cell phone that can not 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.680
 hold record and play at the same time 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.620
 since the game requires connection to 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.370
 internet my partner and we were going 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.370
 to go playing 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.299
 let's see we do not find anyone and 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.439
 here is we find an enemy like that 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.439
 that we're going to go around the turn 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.240
 we see the symbols of the bullets in the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.940
 wall that collide and here is our 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.650
 friend if we are going to liquidate it 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.180
 we both kill each other so we're going to 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.430
 move forward again we find that united 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.330
 that we must defeat in this case what 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.980
 liquidated with a shot of the head 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.980
 so we are moving forward in the game 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.940
 and until another enemy 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.550
 and I have almost no life left so 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.620
 I killed myself I had almost nothing and that's it 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.569
 until another 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.120
 and we got to take care of him with a shot in 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.120
 the head and here another enemy appears 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.730
 and we also got to defeat him 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.460
 as they progress in the game 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.080
 first they will raise the level obviously and 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.410
 they read will block new weapons that 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.990
 you can use 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.990
 let's go for them how to defeat them 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.980
 we eliminate two at a time as 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.709
 keep moving forward 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.430
 we found tied in several part 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.430
 left and others 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.590
 and they killed me in the rear I saw it 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.590
 but he can not react 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.449
 we are moving forward as you see in the part 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.069
 superior says that only two are missing 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.380
 minutes to end this game 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:27.919
 and the first one that reaches 50 gets 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.590
 greater death of the opposing team will win 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.960
 in this case we go 39 Tuesday and 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.259
 the opposite electric goes 40 we go 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.259
 winning 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.660
 and here I am going to liquidate this companion 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:46.280
 we are tied so we have to 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.280
 hurry to win this game 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.420
 and here we were where he was standing 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.430
 and they did not move, you have to take advantage of 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.230
 opportunities 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.710
 and here are others that we are going to have 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.710
 clean it 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.069
 and we end up killing him with a has a 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.069
 head 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.449
 here is another son a kill 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.449
 let's go 45-44 winning 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.840
 46 47 will not request the one who is here 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.000
 and we come to kill these two we will win 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.280
 the game we managed to liquidate one and 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.500
 against the second we go and we end 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.360
 killing but my partner kills the last 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.009
 and so we win good guys 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.630
