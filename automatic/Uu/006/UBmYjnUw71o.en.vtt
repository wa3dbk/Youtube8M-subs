00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
probably wondering what it's all dirty

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060 
probably wondering what it's all dirty
and<00:01:44.579> stuff<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.329> there's<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> reason<00:01:46.110> why<00:01:46.259> it's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and stuff and there's a reason why it's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.730 
and stuff and there's a reason why it's
all<00:01:47.280> dirty<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.880> stuff<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:49.439> don't

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
all dirty and stuff because you don't

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.050 
all dirty and stuff because you don't
want<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> serve<00:01:50.369> them<00:01:50.610> during<00:01:50.850> breeding

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
want it to serve them during breeding

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.120 
want it to serve them during breeding
season<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.899> reason<00:01:52.200> why<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:53.070> because

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
season and the reason why is because

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.399 
season and the reason why is because
they<00:01:53.970> need<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> lot<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.509> privacy<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
they need a lot of privacy they like a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.340 
they need a lot of privacy they like a
lot<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> privacy<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.200> less

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
lot of privacy so I have much less

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.580 
lot of privacy so I have much less
taking<00:01:58.649> over<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> year<00:01:59.240> they<00:02:00.409> haven't<00:02:01.409> they

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
taking over a year they haven't they

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.230 
taking over a year they haven't they
give<00:02:01.770> me<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> couple<00:02:02.100> clutches<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.520> eggs<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.850> far

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
give me a couple clutches of eggs so far

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.530 
give me a couple clutches of eggs so far
this<00:02:03.420> year<00:02:03.770> but<00:02:04.770> I'm<00:02:05.009> assuming<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.640> should<00:02:06.390> get

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
this year but I'm assuming I should get

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.210 
this year but I'm assuming I should get
a<00:02:06.570> couple<00:02:06.719> more<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.200> soon<00:02:07.530> because<00:02:07.920> it's

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
a couple more here soon because it's

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.219 
a couple more here soon because it's
like<00:02:08.369> peak<00:02:08.580> season

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
like peak season

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.580 
like peak season
almond<00:02:10.229> bottom<00:02:10.590> here

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
almond bottom here

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
almond bottom here
is<00:02:13.110> my<00:02:14.110> another<00:02:14.319> loop<00:02:14.680> tank<00:02:15.099> these<00:02:15.310> are<00:02:15.489> just

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
is my another loop tank these are just

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.670 
is my another loop tank these are just
three<00:02:15.970> loops<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.660> think<00:02:16.900> there's<00:02:17.050> two<00:02:17.260> females

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
three loops I think there's two females

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.339 
three loops I think there's two females
or<00:02:17.830> one<00:02:18.010> male<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.400> there<00:02:18.989> they're<00:02:19.989> still<00:02:20.110> too

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
or one male in there they're still too

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.979 
or one male in there they're still too
young<00:02:20.379> for<00:02:20.860> breeding<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.450> haven't<00:02:22.690> decided

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
young for breeding so I haven't decided

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.720 
young for breeding so I haven't decided
what<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.260> want<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.500> with<00:02:23.620> them<00:02:23.739> yet<00:02:24.010> um<00:02:24.310> I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
what I want to do with them yet um I

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.640 
what I want to do with them yet um I
show<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.750> first<00:02:25.959> video<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.349> think

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
show that in the first video I think

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.890 
show that in the first video I think
when<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.430> started<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:27.940> want<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.209> do<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:28.510> um

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
when I started to want to do this um

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.199 
when I started to want to do this um
guys<00:02:29.890> can't<00:02:30.190> see<00:02:30.340> them<00:02:30.459> they're<00:02:30.910> all<00:02:31.030> hiding

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
look at that plant when I first got that

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.460 
look at that plant when I first got that
plant<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.950> was<00:02:54.160> pretty<00:02:54.760> small<00:02:55.230> it's<00:02:56.230> grown

crazy<00:02:57.099> drip<00:02:57.670> would<00:02:57.879> think<00:02:58.690> underneath<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
crazy drip would think underneath the

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.280 
crazy drip would think underneath the
coconut<00:02:59.440> hunt<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.769> should<00:03:00.010> be<00:03:00.900> yep<00:03:01.900> there's

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
coconut hunt this should be yep there's

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.229 
coconut hunt this should be yep there's
one<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.769> have<00:03:03.370> two<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.640> here<00:03:03.849> I<00:03:03.879> think<00:03:04.120> they're

too young the sex though these are

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.330 
too young the sex though these are
probably<00:03:06.280> like<00:03:06.430> six<00:03:06.730> months<00:03:06.879> old<00:03:07.090> maybe<00:03:08.340> don't

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
probably like six months old maybe don't

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.470 
probably like six months old maybe don't
know<00:03:09.400> where<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.579> other<00:03:09.700> one<00:03:09.849> is<00:03:09.879> he<00:03:10.209> likes<00:03:10.390> to

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
know where the other one is he likes to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.539 
know where the other one is he likes to
hide<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.690> lot<00:03:10.900> there's<00:03:11.739> another<00:03:11.890> father's<00:03:12.340> plan

you guys can see the pathos is going

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.069 
you guys can see the pathos is going
right<00:03:15.160> into<00:03:15.430> gravel<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.090> made<00:03:16.269> I<00:03:16.510> put<00:03:16.870> in<00:03:16.959> there

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
right into gravel I made I put in there

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.750 
right into gravel I made I put in there
it's<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:17.739> it's<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.010> little<00:03:18.100> swimming<00:03:18.459> pool

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.059 
it's like it's a little swimming pool
type<00:03:18.970> thing<00:03:19.269> now<00:03:20.200> they<00:03:20.319> liked<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.739> wanted

to<00:03:21.160> also<00:03:21.250> say<00:03:21.489> this<00:03:21.549> too<00:03:21.819> they<00:03:22.120> also<00:03:22.269> like<00:03:22.630> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
to also say this too they also like a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.470 
to also say this too they also like a
place<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.680> get<00:03:23.950> water<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:25.000> some<00:03:25.150> student

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
place to get water to some student

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.809 
place to get water to some student
because<00:03:25.720> they<00:03:26.280> observe<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> water<00:03:27.609> through

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
because they observe the water through

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:28.729 
because they observe the water through
their<00:03:27.940> cloaca

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
their cloaca
