and this one's big enough I can drive it

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.639 
and this one's big enough I can drive it
most<00:01:13.759> of<00:01:13.880> them<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.030> have<00:01:14.149> to<00:01:14.210> back<00:01:14.450> up<00:01:14.479> into

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.179 

see<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:22.509> flag<00:01:22.840> on<00:01:23.109> the<00:01:23.259> tree<00:01:23.590> I<00:01:23.890> don't

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
see a little flag on the tree I don't

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.760 
see a little flag on the tree I don't
you<00:01:24.340> see<00:01:24.579> that<00:01:24.729> or<00:01:24.820> not<00:01:24.850> right<00:01:25.149> there<00:01:25.770> that's

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
you see that or not right there that's

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.969 
you see that or not right there that's
just<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.460> I<00:01:27.490> can<00:01:27.609> remember<00:01:27.939> where<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.420> is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
just so I can remember where it is

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.440 
just so I can remember where it is
because<00:01:30.240> once<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.479> feed<00:01:31.780> them<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.049> few<00:01:32.229> times

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
because once you feed them a few times

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.480 
because once you feed them a few times
the<00:01:34.450> first<00:01:34.630> time<00:01:34.840> anyway<00:01:35.259> they<00:01:35.439> eat<00:01:36.009> so<00:01:36.310> much

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
the first time anyway they eat so much

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.569 
the first time anyway they eat so much
that<00:01:37.049> you'll<00:01:38.049> never<00:01:38.170> find<00:01:38.530> it<00:01:38.709> again<00:01:38.799> other

much<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.400> next<00:02:51.640> time<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:51.940> come<00:02:52.090> along<00:02:52.269> with<00:02:52.450> bait

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
much so next time I come along with bait

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.880 
much so next time I come along with bait
does<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.319> be<00:02:53.410> snares<00:02:53.709> hung<00:02:53.950> now<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.319> bush<00:02:56.500> I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
does it be snares hung now in the bush I

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.309 
does it be snares hung now in the bush I
know<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:58.450> from<00:02:58.510> experience<00:02:58.720> where<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
know just from experience where the

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.319 
know just from experience where the
trails<00:02:59.560> are<00:02:59.739> going<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.980> be<00:03:00.099> but<00:03:00.849> they<00:03:01.150> aren't

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
trails are going to be but they aren't

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.020 
trails are going to be but they aren't
really<00:03:01.510> making<00:03:02.079> very<00:03:02.290> good<00:03:02.380> trails<00:03:02.799> yet<00:03:03.099> so

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
really making very good trails yet so

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.229 
really making very good trails yet so
that's<00:03:04.780> why<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.019> have<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.410> pre<00:03:05.620> bait<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.239> once

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
that's why you have to pre bait and once

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.789 
that's why you have to pre bait and once

where the heck I put this one you're
running<00:04:12.250> around<00:04:12.450> well<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.510> was<00:04:13.750> planning

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
running around well I was planning

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.379 
running around well I was planning
around<00:04:14.319> a<00:04:14.500> lot<00:04:14.680> more<00:04:14.920> but<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:15.970> year<00:04:16.180> looks

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
around a lot more but this year looks

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.240 
around a lot more but this year looks
like<00:04:16.510> they'll<00:04:16.630> be<00:04:16.660> run<00:04:16.900> out<00:04:16.930> about<00:04:17.199> 27<00:04:17.949> 28

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
like they'll be run out about 27 28

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.870 
like they'll be run out about 27 28
Bates<00:04:18.579> only<00:04:19.000> so<00:04:19.979> so<00:04:20.979> until<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.519> do<00:04:21.699> it<00:04:21.789> a<00:04:21.850> few

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
Bates only so so until you do it a few

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.760 
Bates only so so until you do it a few
times<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.510> takes<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.810> little<00:04:22.930> bit<00:04:23.139> to<00:04:23.320> remember

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
times it takes a little bit to remember

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.980 
times it takes a little bit to remember
once<00:04:24.760> you've<00:04:24.970> been<00:04:25.419> there<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.660> couple<00:04:25.720> times

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
once you've been there a couple times

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.490 
once you've been there a couple times
and<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:26.620> easier<00:04:27.360> just<00:04:28.360> go<00:04:28.600> all<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.169> tracks

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
and it's easier just go all the tracks

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.200 
and it's easier just go all the tracks
in<00:04:29.770> here<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.250> know<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.580> doesn't<00:04:30.729> show<00:04:31.030> up

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
in here I know it doesn't show up

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.060 
in here I know it doesn't show up

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
because of the dirty windshield in the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.670 
because of the dirty windshield in the
sunshine<00:04:33.610> in<00:04:33.820> but<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.990> just<00:04:35.229> around<00:04:35.530> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
sunshine in but it's just around the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:50.219 
sunshine in but it's just around the
corner<00:04:36.070> here<00:04:38.070> pink<00:04:39.479> shirts<00:04:40.479> right<00:04:40.750> here
