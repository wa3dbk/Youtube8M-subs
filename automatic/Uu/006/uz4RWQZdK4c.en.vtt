00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
batteries after we've removed the cables

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.359 
batteries after we've removed the cables
we're<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.720> pull<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.890> check

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
we're going to pull them up and check

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.520 
we're going to pull them up and check
them<00:01:08.640> carefully<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.080> there's<00:01:10.290> any

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
them carefully to see if there's any

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.760 
them carefully to see if there's any
fraying<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.310> any<00:01:11.820> wires<00:01:12.150> exposed<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.200> if

fraying or any wires exposed and if
there<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.460> could<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.640> take<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> piece<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
there is you could just take a piece of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.840 
there is you could just take a piece of
electrical<00:01:15.810> tape<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.590> wrap<00:01:16.650> them<00:01:17.100> up<00:01:17.280> you're

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
electrical tape and wrap them up you're

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.240 
electrical tape and wrap them up you're
also<00:01:18.060> checking<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.320> clamps<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.770> make<00:01:20.009> sure

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
also checking the clamps to make sure

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
also checking the clamps to make sure
they're<00:01:20.490> free<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.880> corrosion<00:01:21.330> our<00:01:21.990> battery

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
they're free of corrosion our battery

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440 
they're free of corrosion our battery
cables<00:01:22.920> look<00:01:23.040> pretty<00:01:23.310> good<00:01:23.490> right<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
cables look pretty good right here the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.410 
cables look pretty good right here the
next<00:01:24.659> step<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.200> we're<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.640> actually

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
next step is we're going to actually

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.620 
next step is we're going to actually
locate<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.470> cable<00:01:28.979> clamp<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.790> holds<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
locate the cable clamp that holds the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.469 
locate the cable clamp that holds the
battery<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.170> place<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.829> remove<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.329> that

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
battery in place and remove it so that

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.600 
battery in place and remove it so that
we<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.720> lift<00:01:33.930> our<00:01:34.079> battery<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.610> every

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we can lift our battery out every

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.700 
we can lift our battery out every
battery<00:01:35.939> has<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.479> different<00:01:36.960> assembly

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
battery has a different assembly

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
battery has a different assembly
sometimes<00:01:38.130> they're<00:01:38.369> clamps<00:01:38.909> sometimes

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
sometimes they're clamps sometimes

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.870 
sometimes they're clamps sometimes
they're<00:01:39.509> held<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.869> by<00:01:40.079> bolts<00:01:40.530> now<00:01:41.490> we're<00:01:41.759> going

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
they're held on by bolts now we're going

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.450 
they're held on by bolts now we're going
to<00:01:41.939> lift<00:01:42.180> our<00:01:42.360> battery<00:01:42.780> out<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.159> set<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.189> on

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
to lift our battery out and set it on

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
to lift our battery out and set it on
the<00:01:44.549> ground<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.780> next<00:01:46.079> step<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.439> we're<00:01:46.560> going

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the ground the next step is we're going

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.929 
the ground the next step is we're going
to<00:01:46.710> take<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.189> good<00:01:47.520> look<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
to take a really good look at the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.929 
to take a really good look at the
battery<00:01:48.420> tray<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.200> check<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.220> corrosion<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
battery tray and check for corrosion and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.210 
battery tray and check for corrosion and
clean<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.869> before<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.680> put<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.950> our<00:01:53.100> new

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
clean it before we put in our new

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.920 
clean it before we put in our new
battery<00:01:53.610> sometimes<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.240> even<00:01:54.450> need<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.720> pour

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
battery sometimes you even need to pour

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.690
