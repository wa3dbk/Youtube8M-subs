00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
Camry BMW versus Mercedes so I thought

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.730

why not get into that racket
so<00:00:11.160> today<00:00:11.370> I've<00:00:11.490> decided<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.059> do<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> highly

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
so today I've decided to do a highly

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.480 
so today I've decided to do a highly
informative<00:00:13.200> comparison<00:00:13.830> test<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.280> pits

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
informative comparison test that pits

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.160 
informative comparison test that pits
this<00:00:14.759> Hummer<00:00:15.320> against<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.970> original<00:00:17.970> Mini

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.540 

now<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.230> might<00:00:22.590> think<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.920> an<00:00:23.130> unfair

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
now you might think this is an unfair

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.880 
now you might think this is an unfair
comparison<00:00:23.939> because<00:00:24.480> these<00:00:24.630> two<00:00:24.840> cars<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.350> so

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
comparison because these two cars are so

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.170 
comparison because these two cars are so
different<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.910> where<00:00:27.060> you're

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
different but that is where you're

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.700 
different but that is where you're
mistaken<00:00:27.300> these<00:00:28.050> cars<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> lot<00:00:28.680> more

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
mistaken these cars have a lot more

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.140 
mistaken these cars have a lot more
similarities<00:00:29.250> than<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.699> think

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
same power-to-weight ratio they both

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.340

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.140 
and then you have these little turn
signals<00:02:02.770> which<00:02:02.950> don't<00:02:03.220> really<00:02:03.430> say<00:02:03.610> I'm<00:02:03.880> going

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
signals which don't really say I'm going

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.450 
signals which don't really say I'm going
to<00:02:04.210> turn<00:02:04.450> as<00:02:04.750> much<00:02:04.870> as<00:02:05.020> they<00:02:05.140> say<00:02:05.380> can<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.400> please

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
to turn as much as they say can I please

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.410 
to turn as much as they say can I please
turn<00:02:07.300> now<00:02:08.369> inside<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.610> have<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.970> pedals

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
turn now inside you have the pedals

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:19.050 
turn now inside you have the pedals
which<00:02:10.630> are<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:11.140> little<00:02:11.560> small<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.880> then<00:02:18.880> there

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
which are a little small and then there

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.700 
which are a little small and then there
are<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.330> air<00:02:19.480> vents<00:02:19.870> they're<00:02:20.200> only<00:02:20.470> two

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
are the air vents they're only two

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.530 
are the air vents they're only two
presumably<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.610> only<00:02:21.730> needs<00:02:22.030> two<00:02:22.270> for<00:02:22.480> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
presumably it only needs two for the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.690 
presumably it only needs two for the
entire<00:02:22.780> cabin<00:02:23.260> but<00:02:23.830> they're<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.220> small<00:02:24.490> that<00:02:24.640> I

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
entire cabin but they're so small that I

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.240 
entire cabin but they're so small that I
can<00:02:24.940> completely<00:02:25.480> stop<00:02:25.660> airflow<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.860> just

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
can completely stop airflow with just

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.770 
can completely stop airflow with just
two<00:02:27.520> fingers<00:02:30.120> but<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.210> already<00:02:31.450> knew<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
two fingers but you already knew the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.810 
two fingers but you already knew the
original<00:02:32.200> mini<00:02:32.350> with<00:02:32.500> small<00:02:32.770> afterall<00:02:33.490> I'm

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
original mini with small afterall I'm

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.460 
original mini with small afterall I'm
currently<00:02:34.090> standing<00:02:34.450> next<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.230> you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
currently standing next to it and you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.460 
currently standing next to it and you
can't<00:02:35.680> even<00:02:35.800> see<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:37.690> how<00:02:37.840> small<00:02:38.140> is

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
can't even see it but just how small is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.690 
can't even see it but just how small is
it<00:02:39.270> it's<00:02:40.270> only<00:02:40.420> 120<00:02:41.350> inches<00:02:41.620> long<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.190> that

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
it it's only 120 inches long and that

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.280 
it it's only 120 inches long and that
means<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.030> will<00:02:43.090> fit<00:02:43.300> entirely<00:02:43.690> within<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
means it will fit entirely within the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.780 
means it will fit entirely within the

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:08.980

this<00:07:15.400> thick<00:07:15.820> I'm<00:07:16.660> guessing<00:07:17.620> there's<00:07:17.800> not<00:07:18.070> a

whole lot of crash protection in there
