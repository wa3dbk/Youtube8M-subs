this<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:28.380> bit<00:00:28.590> dumb<00:00:28.800> you'll<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.250> as<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
this a little bit dumb you'll see as I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
this a little bit dumb you'll see as I
said<00:00:30.000> before<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.390> got<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> 15<00:00:30.720> inch<00:00:31.019> screen<00:00:31.140> it

said before it's got a 15 inch screen it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.660 
said before it's got a 15 inch screen it
has<00:00:31.610> 1366<00:00:32.610> by<00:00:32.700> 768<00:00:33.120> resolution<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:35.130> finish<00:00:35.430> on

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
has 1366 by 768 resolution the finish on

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.400 
has 1366 by 768 resolution the finish on
this<00:00:35.820> case<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> brushed<00:00:37.050> metal<00:00:37.140> finish

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
this case is a brushed metal finish

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.470 
this case is a brushed metal finish
you'll<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.790> kind<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.030> picks<00:00:39.270> up

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you'll see that it kind of picks up

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
you'll see that it kind of picks up
fingerprints<00:00:40.350> down<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:41.910> fair<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
fingerprints down here and to be fair I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.690 
fingerprints down here and to be fair I
did<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.660> greasy<00:00:43.379> fingers<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> time<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
did have greasy fingers at the time and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.430 
did have greasy fingers at the time and
which<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> why<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.719> kind<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> showing<00:00:46.230> up

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
which is why it's kind of showing up

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.060 
which is why it's kind of showing up
more<00:00:46.649> than<00:00:46.800> you'd<00:00:46.950> expect<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:48.410> this<00:00:49.410> laptop

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
more than you'd expect there this laptop

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.189 
more than you'd expect there this laptop
does<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> backlight<00:00:51.570> keyboard<00:00:51.809> you'll

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
does have a backlight keyboard you'll

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.560 
does have a backlight keyboard you'll
see<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.890> f5<00:00:53.399> key<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.789> illuminated

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
see here that the f5 key is illuminated

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.299 
see here that the f5 key is illuminated
and<00:00:54.750> that's<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> push<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and that's because if you push it it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.979 
and that's because if you push it it

in the light here so I'm going to go
turn<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.530> light<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.180> how

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
turn off the light so you can see how

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.100

the<00:01:03.680> backlighting<00:01:04.680> notes<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> keyboard

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
the backlighting notes on the keyboard

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.210 
the backlighting notes on the keyboard
there<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.200> go

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
there we go

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.359 
there we go
and<00:01:08.720> again<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> push<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.770> five<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and again I can push it as a five to

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.250 
and again I can push it as a five to
toggle<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.760> off<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.450> once<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.689> toggle<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> off

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
toggle it off and once you toggle it off

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.370 
toggle it off and once you toggle it off
the<00:01:13.799> key<00:01:14.280> stays<00:01:14.549> illuminated<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> can

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the key stays illuminated so you can

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
the key stays illuminated so you can
easily<00:01:16.470> find<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> dark<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.430> turn<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> back

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
easily find in the dark to turn it back

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
easily find in the dark to turn it back
on<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.439> pretty<00:01:19.710> cool<00:01:19.890> feature<00:01:20.159> I

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
on so that's a pretty cool feature I

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.149 
on so that's a pretty cool feature I
think<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.810> uh<00:01:21.960> that's<00:01:22.350> right<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.950> lights

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
think so just uh that's right the lights

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.440 
think so just uh that's right the lights
again<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.330> boy<00:01:26.090> okay<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
again here so we can see boy okay if the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.929 
again here so we can see boy okay if the
touchpad<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.369> integrated<00:01:29.369> click<00:01:29.549> pad<00:01:29.759> so

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
touchpad is a integrated click pad so

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.179 
touchpad is a integrated click pad so
the<00:01:30.090> buttons<00:01:30.360> actually<00:01:30.650> part<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the buttons actually part of the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.039 
the buttons actually part of the
touchpad<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> lower<00:01:33.299> left<00:01:33.600> side

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
touchpad there in the lower left side

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.710 
touchpad there in the lower left side
and<00:01:34.290> right<00:01:34.560> side<00:01:34.939> let's<00:01:35.939> take<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> little<00:01:36.450> tour

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
and right side let's take a little tour

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.630 
and right side let's take a little tour
the<00:01:36.869> ports<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> left<00:01:38.040> side<00:01:38.460> you

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the ports here so on the left side you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.990 
the ports here so on the left side you
get<00:01:39.110> at<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> back<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.490> an<00:01:41.610> Ethernet

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
get at the back here this is an Ethernet

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.740 
get at the back here this is an Ethernet
port<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:42.930> an<00:01:43.290> HDMI<00:01:43.860> port<00:01:43.890> two<00:01:44.880> USB<00:01:44.909> 3.0

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
port you get an HDMI port two USB 3.0

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.100 
port you get an HDMI port two USB 3.0
ports<00:01:46.079> an<00:01:46.290> SD<00:01:46.740> card<00:01:46.770> slot<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.630> by<00:01:48.630> rotating

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
ports an SD card slot there by rotating

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.160 
ports an SD card slot there by rotating
around<00:01:49.759> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> bright<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.720> will<00:01:51.840> see
