00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
really dirty environment and I needed a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.209 
really dirty environment and I needed a
good<00:00:31.730> way<00:00:31.940> to<00:00:32.000> wash<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.719> rope<00:00:32.899> before<00:00:33.649> I<00:00:33.890> had

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
good way to wash the rope before I had

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.100 
good way to wash the rope before I had
washed<00:00:34.489> my<00:00:34.789> rope<00:00:35.180> in<00:00:35.420> a<00:00:35.629> front-loading

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
washed my rope in a front-loading

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.020 
washed my rope in a front-loading
washing-machine<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:37.310> I<00:00:37.340> don't<00:00:37.550> have<00:00:37.640> access

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
washing-machine but I don't have access

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.729 
washing-machine but I don't have access
to<00:00:38.150> that<00:00:38.270> anymore<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:39.440> didn't<00:00:39.650> really

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
to that anymore and it didn't really

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.950 
to that anymore and it didn't really
feel<00:00:39.920> like<00:00:39.980> going<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.310> a<00:00:40.430> longer<00:00:40.790> met<00:00:40.970> so<00:00:41.630> I

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
feel like going to a longer met so I

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.229 
feel like going to a longer met so I
thought<00:00:42.230> online<00:00:42.410> this<00:00:42.920> bill<00:00:43.280> rope<00:00:43.670> brush<00:00:44.000> it's

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
thought online this bill rope brush it's

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.790 
thought online this bill rope brush it's
made<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:44.450> ideal<00:00:44.780> which<00:00:45.020> I<00:00:45.110> believe<00:00:45.560> it's<00:00:45.739> the

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
made of ideal which I believe it's the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.620 
made of ideal which I believe it's the
same<00:00:45.829> company<00:00:46.489> as<00:00:46.520> Black<00:00:46.820> Diamond<00:00:47.090> they<00:00:47.420> make

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
same company as Black Diamond they make

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.049 
same company as Black Diamond they make
bill<00:00:48.020> makes<00:00:48.350> Black<00:00:48.770> Diamond<00:00:49.010> two<00:00:49.250> ropes<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.000> I

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
bill makes Black Diamond two ropes so I

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.569 
bill makes Black Diamond two ropes so I
guess<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:50.420> a<00:00:50.480> sub<00:00:50.690> company<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.100> what<00:00:52.250> this<00:00:52.370> is

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
guess it's a sub company so what this is

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.160 
guess it's a sub company so what this is
it's<00:00:52.820> kind<00:00:53.059> of<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:54.130> steel<00:00:55.130> spring<00:00:55.780> okay<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.079> on

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
it's kind of a steel spring okay and on

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.130 
it's kind of a steel spring okay and on
the<00:00:57.260> inside<00:00:57.829> it<00:00:58.130> has<00:00:58.340> bristles<00:00:58.840> so<00:00:59.840> hopefully

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
the inside it has bristles so hopefully

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.569 
the inside it has bristles so hopefully
you<00:01:00.200> can<00:01:00.260> see<00:01:00.469> this<00:01:00.559> on<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.739> video<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.370> the

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
you can see this on the video that the

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.880 
you can see this on the video that the
inside<00:01:01.969> of<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:02.270> has<00:01:02.540> just<00:01:02.840> full<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.530> all

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
inside of this has just full of all

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.340 
inside of this has just full of all
these<00:01:04.070> bristles<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.149> it's<00:01:05.299> a<00:01:05.360> tight<00:01:05.630> fit<00:01:05.659> for

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
these bristles so it's a tight fit for

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.190 
these bristles so it's a tight fit for
any<00:01:06.590> sized<00:01:06.920> rope<00:01:07.310> if<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:08.420> didn't<00:01:08.840> come<00:01:08.959> in<00:01:09.079> any

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.990 
so what I did is just through the whole
thing<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> big<00:01:45.780> bucket<00:01:46.759> filled<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.280 
thing in a big bucket filled it with the
hose<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.899> ran<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> through<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:52.049> water

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.499 
hose and just ran it through the water
underneath<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.979> water<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.520> did<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.330> about

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
underneath the water I did that about

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.050 
underneath the water I did that about
three<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.320> four<00:01:55.500> water<00:01:55.770> exchanges<00:01:56.369> finally

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
three or four water exchanges finally

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.330 
three or four water exchanges finally
the<00:01:57.180> water<00:01:57.360> wasn't<00:01:57.750> as<00:01:58.020> dirty<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.189> can

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the water wasn't as dirty and I can

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.429 
the water wasn't as dirty and I can
actually<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> rope<00:02:00.180> inside<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.840> inside

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
