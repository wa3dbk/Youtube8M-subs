00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.810
 although this stopped jerking 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.940
 Zorc is the garden Nasri Schrade so there is nothing growing at the moment 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.900

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.720
 High Resolution 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.420

 Dietz wanted to continue 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.790
 it works 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.790
 Hello 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.850
 it is advisable that the cheap or 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 about a short moment was short 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.030

 Ada is building on it 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.829
 now we have to deal with dancing 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.149
 fertilized and o 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.149
 Also that takes a while Kokenge mail or one 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:23.359
 but that is not finished this my throne percent you can already see me 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.929
 have neatly shaped and so 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.369
 So I have shaped and light 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.749
 you like the video here 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.749
 No quite so lecture that has shaped me so everything 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.579
 and here are my ovens and Copenhagen's are stone axes object 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.359
 I need for right now 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.219

 fifth time small elevator 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.349
 and yes now so it's clear so nearly done it will be more likely 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.289
 so 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.779
 these doors 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.739
 Of course, also drop off groups 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.739
 Do we do we do you don't but somehow it is 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:08.159
 Farooq was often an expression in the past, but that was not all 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.899
 van Gaal 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.379
 it is already day 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.559
 Let's take advantage of the opportunity Boeing for complaints and bonuses 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.159
 I used to see two things I'm on 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.309
 and yes I have such a tournament here 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.299

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:40.279
 out 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:41.380
 why why why 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.589
 see that way 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.029
 will turn out plants 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.659
 and I so far was above each percent less than a percent 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:53.759
 Leahy touched too many pieces of train station 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.109
 here goes down to 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.109
 it goes off here 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.829
 that is very odd 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.829
 the world has Fraps on God's hand 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.299

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.639
 I do not know when Skoff and if active 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.999
 Managing Director is preloaded for the time being so um 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.999
 Braunsfeld the real burden 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.529
 that hit 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.860

 embarrassing already blatant mother change here so still grass 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.129
 So the match new that so Hiesl on Pop Teint 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.909
 and at these facilities 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.629
 under it would 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.569
 the lights and percent that should be on a siding 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.469
 and yes percent 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.240
 bamboo 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.970
 I can not blame the packshot for sure that's awesome 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.029
 Sky 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:26.229
 and I believe it 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.629
 is now stops with loading and it remains nothing like up 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:34.789
 I think that's really nice 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.750
 I hope that you can also in the winter 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.610
 Finally 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.610
 Hasbro click to z rock straw machines 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.249
 and I have with ethics that Neuss on the Trausnitz I still have one 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:46.300
 Loser, too, not made and 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.300
 Here you also want to rest water 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.199
 and yes that one is out but everything 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.669
 but construction site 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.500
 and he is the rest of the way 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.960
 double-double this mountain in theory clock 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.719
 Doodle means and this area here 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.879
 or these stones here 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.979
 was a mountain so I've completely dismantled the work 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.090
 and that made it pretty much needed a break as it had dismantled and 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:14.809
 IG Bau is advisor from behind 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:16.490
 Rohleder 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.999
 and now we are not getting over 4 4 billion here 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:22.669
 that's the way it is made of clay or what that means 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.360
 I have the highest on here 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.360
 I'm glad that he fell down in silence 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.770
 what no one laughs 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.029
 Tapie in Beijing 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:37.339
 Prüm what else do I have to his ideas 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:42.009
 Blumer had seen everything 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:46.389
 he encourages he knows what the other one would have kicked him sounds like this and that 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.499
 there is the decision 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.169
 if I do the left one down there shop through adultery the son does not care 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:53.940
 So and texture from Dr 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.809
 where he is then 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:59.669
 256 percent of Demons percent textures could incorporate this 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:02.860
 Thought club 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.110

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.449
 looks pretty cool 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.990
 Thöne that I still make up for everything break down and the off I say goodbye 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.819
 Dufry is now too much and too much 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.740
