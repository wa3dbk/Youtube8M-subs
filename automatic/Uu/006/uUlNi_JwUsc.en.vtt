house and I don't buy a lot of the Lego
architecture<00:00:30.599> sets<00:00:31.410> because<00:00:31.560> they're

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
architecture sets because they're

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.920 
architecture sets because they're
usually<00:00:32.719> price<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.430> very<00:00:35.430> good<00:00:35.690> but<00:00:36.690> this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
usually price is not very good but this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.590

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
building I guess you got to be isolated

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
building I guess you got to be isolated
cuz<00:01:44.340> oh<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.700> got<00:01:44.850> curtains<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.659> can

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
cuz oh they got curtains that you can

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.639 
cuz oh they got curtains that you can
draw<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.860> privacy<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
draw for privacy that's what it is a

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.810 
draw for privacy that's what it is a
bitch<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.950> hard<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.340> keep<00:01:52.520> warm<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
bitch it's hard to keep warm in the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.780 
bitch it's hard to keep warm in the
wintertime<00:01:54.060> being<00:01:54.720> raised<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.790> but

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
wintertime being raised like that but

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.300 
wintertime being raised like that but
there's<00:01:56.969> some<00:01:57.119> special<00:01:58.310> architecture

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
there's some special architecture

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
there's some special architecture
techniques<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.000> were<00:02:00.119> used<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.659> this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
techniques that were used in this

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.920 
techniques that were used in this
building<00:02:01.460> they're<00:02:02.460> fairly<00:02:02.729> unique<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.810> give

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
building they're fairly unique to give

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.109 
building they're fairly unique to give
it<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> finish<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.979> has<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.729> go<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:06.000> all

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
it the finish it has so they go into all

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.580 
it the finish it has so they go into all
those<00:02:06.270> details<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.229> mean<00:02:07.439> there's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
those details in here I mean there's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.949 
those details in here I mean there's
just<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.799> ton<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.069> details

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
just a ton of details

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.420 
just a ton of details
and<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.939> definitely<00:02:11.950> Lego<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.040> doing<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> good

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
and this definitely Lego is doing a good

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.520 
and this definitely Lego is doing a good
job<00:02:13.489> of<00:02:13.939> teaching<00:02:14.299> architecture<00:02:14.750> in

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
job of teaching architecture in

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.550 
job of teaching architecture in
architecture<00:02:16.219> history<00:02:16.670> through<00:02:16.969> these<00:02:17.180> sets

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
architecture history through these sets

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.770 
architecture history through these sets
but<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.769> one<00:02:19.010> had<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.579> get<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.969> because<00:02:20.540> it's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
but this one had to get it because it's

cool house this I like the tile
structure<00:03:09.859> even<00:03:10.099> though<00:03:10.159> you're<00:03:10.310> getting<00:03:10.370> a

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
structure even though you're getting a

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.339 
structure even though you're getting a
lot<00:03:10.669> of<00:03:10.790> white<00:03:10.909> tiles<00:03:11.329> now<00:03:11.750> despite<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.290> I

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
lot of white tiles now despite that I

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.710 
lot of white tiles now despite that I
think<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.859> part<00:03:13.129> out<00:03:13.250> value<00:03:13.489> is<00:03:13.729> over<00:03:13.879> $90<00:03:14.599> on

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
think the part out value is over $90 on

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.869 
think the part out value is over $90 on
the<00:03:14.870> set<00:03:15.109> so<00:03:15.319> even<00:03:15.769> at<00:03:15.859> full<00:03:16.010> price<00:03:16.310> it's<00:03:16.639> still

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
the set so even at full price it's still

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.599 
the set so even at full price it's still
a<00:03:17.209> decent<00:03:17.510> deal<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.290> mean<00:03:18.949> not<00:03:19.069> something<00:03:19.459> you

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
a decent deal I mean not something you

a decent deal I mean not something you
want<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.599> buy<00:03:20.750> at<00:03:20.930> full<00:03:20.959> price<00:03:21.379> but<00:03:21.909> I<00:03:22.909> don't

something<00:04:07.900> easy<00:04:08.900> build<00:04:09.350> even<00:04:09.560> though<00:04:09.740> it's

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
something easy build even though it's

546 pieces it didn't take any time to
build<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.860> cuz<00:04:12.980> you're<00:04:13.100> just<00:04:13.280> basically

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
build it cuz you're just basically

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.020 
build it cuz you're just basically
popping<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.540> bunch<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.920> 1<00:04:15.920> by<00:04:16.070> 1<00:04:16.100> tiles<00:04:16.520> on<00:04:16.790> there

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
you just have a little raised here if

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.070 
you just have a little raised here if
they<00:04:20.239> raise<00:04:20.420> it<00:04:20.450> up

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
they raise it up

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.520

watching<00:04:55.820> this<00:04:55.910> review<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.780> guess<00:04:57.470> show<00:04:58.100> you<00:04:58.160> it

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
watching this review I guess show you it

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.150 
watching this review I guess show you it
mini<00:04:59.000> figure<00:04:59.300> scale<00:04:59.710> kind<00:05:00.710> of<00:05:00.770> scare<00:05:01.040> you

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
mini figure scale kind of scare you

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.560 
mini figure scale kind of scare you
there<00:05:02.710> see<00:05:03.740> not<00:05:04.190> minifigure<00:05:04.880> scale<00:05:05.150> at<00:05:05.390> all

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
there see not minifigure scale at all

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.600 
there see not minifigure scale at all
but<00:05:06.110> anyway<00:05:06.320> that<00:05:06.530> is<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.920> Farnsworth<00:05:07.370> house
