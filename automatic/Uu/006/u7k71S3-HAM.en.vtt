00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:05.259
 Malemá is verified that we are here once again to the past and I trust yes borders 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.039
 our focus and does slightly different 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.849
 once a ppp class that students how is it that is said altidore english 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.039
 we are in the period of concentration when agreeing to leave 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.189
 This is the big problem. 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.169
 we have all eight in English 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.689
 another meaning 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.869
 is a sum of today but the fact that certain words 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.970
 who do not use 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.339
 the english musician 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.140
 with that same idea 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.030
 for example the word 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.999
 on the contrary 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:38.370
 you think with the pen drive is what the use of the computer 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.230
 yea 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.520
 only that at the moment united states in england is not the most common word 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.550
 When we refer to telebrás 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.679
 the three most common words countries 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:48.580
 they would 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.030
 in the finals 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.269
 effect. 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.850
 in fact they have to be broader would not be Socrates goes forward 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.370
 said 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.310
 hehehe the fbi several 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.290
 these three words here are more common 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.109
 How do we have to say English? 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.610
 central 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.610
 there is another word that is important would be great 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.990
 you are at home all eight techniques such a little payment of 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.070
 pension 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.470
 actually the author of the english foot goal 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.680
 it's a dead man 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.740
 what is it 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.979
 very simple though 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.480
 the things that I wanted 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.340
 4 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.370
 while he gave the counterattack and gave pass to announce 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.190
 ie is a table where the calendar year something 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.310
 to the whole organ exists in the country 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.740
 in fact it matters little is that if on the one hand outside outdoors 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.189
 is the main headquarters 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.420
 so why do we use the word in Portuguese? 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.840
 that motivates me 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 because in ancient times the name was chaotic 8 thousand dead 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.930
 What do they mean by that, people? 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.030
 was a foot behind 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.350
 that was free 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.010
 the big problem in the past because in the first the wrong word 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.110
 which happens and we get the additive to the whole year of the interpretation 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.020
 wrong 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.149
 and this one only ended up getting worse over time nowadays we have 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.310
 before the agreement 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.679
 even if you think the bus door 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.009
 following this sachet of idea 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.780
 but in Portuguese bento for having used by the prosecutor percent by rumors 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.769
 but this too people 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.690
 there is no english 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.999
 ah, athlete of the year 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.330
 2 I can not call a dead bandit 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.950
 here was that I was attended to 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.629
 footwear mistake all year round 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.170
 the third word - let's focus 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.479
 it was said mourinho 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.370
 the big problem is that you do not think a little bit is what I look for in a 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:34.589
 gala party 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.969
 and neither be same thing 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.839
 We borrowed the word Sidon. 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.890
 this is the english word 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.959
 even the fifth in Portuguese 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.439
 another big mistake, what happened was that we had 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.059
 milk but English but the reason 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.770
 Simon 23 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.000
 the petism 23 formerly people put some people here and transvestism 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.819
 23 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.469
 by the proposal would be to burn 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.590
 and prosthesis that ended up underneath the bonnet, but nowadays it does not 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:04.889
 if you vote more this 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:05.979
 this allowed 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:10.709
 I notice the right term I presume who it would be possible English 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:15.150
 and lastly we other word that is a very common mistake is tense 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.409
 we have to be more efficient 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.259
 but no tennis is an English sport 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.059
 with the desperation caused by the two times 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.840
 other speaks trainers 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.149
 or if it is possible this can be achieved 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.089
 they also have a tendency 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:32.279
 on ctbc it's more physical 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.029
 finally my dear ones the main idea of ​​fia 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:39.369
 be careful not always that word that we use English 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.399
 reminds us that in this sense as the years in Portuguese 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.599
 author we use here in our language worthy of them 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.359
 only you get different 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.629
 teacher from the context that they will never make a mistake 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.180
 It's true that little is wanted.
