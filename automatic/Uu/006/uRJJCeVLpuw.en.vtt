00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
forward gears now as soon as I heard

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.509 
forward gears now as soon as I heard
that<00:00:56.719> I<00:00:56.929> thought<00:00:57.319> you<00:00:57.559> know<00:00:57.679> I<00:00:58.069> don't<00:00:58.159> need<00:00:58.460> a

that I thought you know I don't need a

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.149 
that I thought you know I don't need a
17<00:00:59.089> bladed<00:00:59.569> razor<00:00:59.719> that<00:01:00.170> connects<00:01:00.889> to<00:01:01.039> the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
17 bladed razor that connects to the

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.129 
17 bladed razor that connects to the
Internet<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:01.760> makes<00:01:01.969> my<00:01:02.179> morning<00:01:02.389> espresso

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:03.139 
Internet and makes my morning espresso

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.069 
Internet and makes my morning espresso
but<00:01:03.949> I<00:01:04.190> get<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:04.760> that's<00:01:05.030> why<00:01:05.329> Chrysler<00:01:05.840> can

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
but I get it that's why Chrysler can

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.069 
but I get it that's why Chrysler can
claim<00:01:06.700> nineteen<00:01:07.700> City<00:01:08.060> thirty-one<00:01:08.689> highway

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
claim nineteen City thirty-one highway

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.700 
claim nineteen City thirty-one highway
so<00:01:09.890> that's<00:01:10.070> connected<00:01:10.579> to<00:01:11.020> sport<00:01:12.020> mode<00:01:12.079> in<00:01:12.590> the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
so that's connected to sport mode in the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.010 
so that's connected to sport mode in the
transmission<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:13.610> get<00:01:14.030> these<00:01:14.180> garden<00:01:14.719> tool

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
transmission you get these garden tool

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.109 
transmission you get these garden tool

originated<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.840> look<00:03:08.140> but<00:03:08.980> it's<00:03:09.130> become<00:03:09.430> a

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
Chrysler went big with it and I think

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.130 
Chrysler went big with it and I think
it's<00:03:13.990> successful<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:15.690> because<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:16.900> car<00:03:17.110> is

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
it's successful and because this car is

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.830 
it's successful and because this car is
