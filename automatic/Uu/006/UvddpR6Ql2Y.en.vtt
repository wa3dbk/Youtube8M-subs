00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.360
 we are here with this guitar 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.959
 telecaster 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.680
 and what we're going to do is put this 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.570
 switch that will work as 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.539
 normally it is said in English 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.670
 kitts switch that means something like that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.300
 how to kill the signal or 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:32.520
 the translation would be like cutting the signal 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.520
 of the guitar that goes into the amplifier 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.440
 it's not that difficult it 's a pretty thing 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.570
 simple 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.550
 these buttons are available in the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.610
 electronics houses are not too 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.970
 expensive cost me 8 pesos each 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.100
 and what you have to do is locate it in 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.100
 somewhere in the case of the telecaster 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.870
 I liked that position 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.600
 I did not have another one left 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.600
 then there will be the switch 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.180
 what is a push button that when 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.270
 press short the signal rather than cut it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.440
 as the voids that have to be welded 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.440
 the wires of this switch 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.810
 in these two cables that come from the jack 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.730
 basically what it does is make a 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.600
 short between the positive and 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.080
 negative of sac 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.010
 well there we can see how 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.530
 it was soldier and switch 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.230
 for not taking out the iac what I did was 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.000
 follow the cables that come the jack and 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.450
 only there is attention 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.530
 well let's put it together 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 I hope it works 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.560
 well there it is 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.450
 well let's try the very good time 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.570
 well I tell you that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.130
 the bar name 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.920
 so much more noise when 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.860
 I pressed the button 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.140
 clear what happens what 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.540
 does as a kind of download not 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.489
 when 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.010
 we do not short-circuit units 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.709
 would cut some of the cables 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.590
 positive negative but good the 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.379
 solution is putting a capacitor in 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.109
 the end of the positive cable that comes 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.109
 of the iac there works 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.730
 i 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:13.510
 well the ideal would be 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.860
 yes the same but get a push button 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.980
 what 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.980
 even if it is activated when we say 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.740
 do not activate when we press it because 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.140
 that way if or if we have to do 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.050
 a short that is positive and 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.980
 negative since we have to get a 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.599
 push button that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.599
 when it is not pressed 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.260
 let's see continuity and when 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.510
 we press make the cut 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.090
 if I get 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.090
 is the push button we will do it with ejected 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.950
 good after renegar a while a while 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.950
 so long that it 's night 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.300
 I went to buy first buy these 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.300
 push buttons that 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.159
 connect when you press or 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.159
 when you press 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.290
 makes the bridge let's say it connects 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.720
 with the high 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.260
 it disconnects 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.260
 Y 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.940
 are these other push buttons that when 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.970
 it's like this 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.750
 is connected and when you press it 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.290
 disconnect is called I do not remember the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.410
 Presence closed push buttons 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.350
 open or something like that an agreement then 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.500
 The first ones that I bought were 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.070
 pushbuttons that when you press is cut in 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.070
 cut 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.830
 sorry the first ones I bought were 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.840
 these what 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.920
 makes the bridge when you press when 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.190
 pulsas is activated 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.330
 and good 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.060
 then I said good 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.210
 I'm going to try these with you when you press 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.439
 It is cut because I made a noise 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.320
 of mass when he pushed so some 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:25.940
 discharge 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:29.300
 and seeing some forums some said 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.620
 that did make that noise and that 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.390
 they tried to change the button for this one 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.750
 and only cut the positive or in 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.730
 negative but good it turns out that if short 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.100
 the positive or negative one makes a 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.249
 buzz that is impressive no no it 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.839
 hold 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:51.050
 then I decided to leave the button 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:54.120
 first that man who is 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:58.320
 that when you step on it connects 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.320
 and well I left it connected as I am going to 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.510
 show a beginning 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.790
 a tip on the positive of it and another 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.860
 point on the negative which causes a 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:12.650
 sort of short that overrides the 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:16.060
 guitar output then but 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.600
 good at first I had put 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:24.050
 a capacitor so that it attenuates that 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.240
 pop that produced but 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.180
 let a little bit pass the signal no no 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.930
 I cut it all off then good 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.039
 He decides to leave just like that 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.550
 so if we see how it was left 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.550
 basic 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.879
 and it sounds like this 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:53.810
 well now if it stays that way we'll see you in the 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.810
 next
