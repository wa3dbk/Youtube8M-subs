00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
number of those physics issues the big

number of those physics issues the big
deal<00:00:26.550> with<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.180> player<00:00:27.390> impact<00:00:27.779> engine<00:00:28.140> is

deal with the player impact engine is

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.839 
deal with the player impact engine is
obviously<00:00:28.590> where<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.340> have<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> near

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
obviously where you have a near

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.880 
obviously where you have a near
limitless<00:00:30.269> variety<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.050> outcomes<00:00:31.619> from

limitless variety of outcomes from

limitless variety of outcomes from
collisions<00:00:32.250> sometimes<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.300> near<00:00:33.570> limitless

collisions sometimes that near limitless

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.560 
collisions sometimes that near limitless
includes<00:00:35.040> some<00:00:35.340> somewhat<00:00:35.790> humorous<00:00:36.360> moments

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
includes some somewhat humorous moments

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.310 
includes some somewhat humorous moments
I<00:00:37.020> think<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.489> overriding<00:00:39.210> sentiment<00:00:40.140> from

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
I think the overriding sentiment from

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.810 
I think the overriding sentiment from
the<00:00:40.530> community<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.190> fans<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> game

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the community and fans of the game

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.700 
the community and fans of the game
though<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.329> been<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:43.050> those<00:00:43.320> rare<00:00:43.680> occasions

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
though have been on those rare occasions

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
though have been on those rare occasions
where<00:00:44.640> those<00:00:44.850> things<00:00:45.149> happen<00:00:45.360> they<00:00:45.690> were

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
where those things happen they were

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.569 
where those things happen they were
quite<00:00:46.079> forgiving<00:00:46.649> because<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> vast

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
quite forgiving because for the vast

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
quite forgiving because for the vast
majority<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> game<00:00:48.539> obviously<00:00:49.170> improved

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
majority of the game obviously improved

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.439 
majority of the game obviously improved
the<00:00:50.039> fluidity<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.879> flow<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.420> game

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the fluidity and flow of the game

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.060 
the fluidity and flow of the game
significantly<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> think<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.010> were

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
significantly so I think they were

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.100 
significantly so I think they were
pretty<00:00:53.280> cool<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:54.420> those<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.960> are

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
pretty cool for those of you that are

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
pretty cool for those of you that are
interested<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
interested in what we get from the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
interested in what we get from the
player<00:00:56.969> impact<00:00:57.360> engine<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.870> year<00:00:58.079> though<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
player impact engine this year though a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.160 
player impact engine this year though a
really<00:00:59.340> neat<00:00:59.670> push<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.300> pull<00:01:00.510> mechanic<00:01:00.989> when

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
really neat push and pull mechanic when

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
really neat push and pull mechanic when
you're<00:01:01.320> alongside<00:01:01.649> behind<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.609> slightly<00:01:03.239> in

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you're alongside behind or slightly in

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.060 
you're alongside behind or slightly in
front<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.750> another<00:01:03.899> player<00:01:04.199> pressing<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
front of another player pressing that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.890 
front of another player pressing that
tackle<00:01:05.460> button<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> real<00:01:06.630> sense

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
tackle button now you get a real sense

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
tackle button now you get a real sense
of<00:01:07.170> being<00:01:07.439> involved<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.040> physical<00:01:08.220> contact

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
of being involved in physical contact

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.120 
of being involved in physical contact
and<00:01:09.450> obviously<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.409> skill<00:01:10.680> games<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and obviously the the skill games that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310 
and obviously the the skill games that
we've<00:01:11.280> introduced<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.909> year<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.450> very

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
we've introduced this year are very

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.070 
we've introduced this year are very
reliant<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> player<00:01:14.250> impact<00:01:14.580> engine

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.300 

so<00:01:19.080> we've<00:01:19.260> tried<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> lot<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.950> work<00:01:20.130> this

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
so we've tried to do a lot of work this

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.340 
so we've tried to do a lot of work this
year<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.670> keeping<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> flow<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.750> game<00:01:21.780> are

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
year on keeping the flow of the game are

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.550 
year on keeping the flow of the game are
more<00:01:22.770> consistent<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:23.520> fluid<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:25.140> think

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
more consistent and fluid so I think

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.950 
more consistent and fluid so I think
last<00:01:26.280> year<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:26.820> maybe<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> year<00:01:27.450> before<00:01:27.570> now

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
last year or maybe the year before now

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.350 
last year or maybe the year before now
we<00:01:28.110> introduce<00:01:28.290> these<00:01:28.890> quick<00:01:29.250> free<00:01:30.090> kicks

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
we introduce these quick free kicks

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.840 
we introduce these quick free kicks
under<00:01:30.720> certain<00:01:30.900> circumstances<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.610> players

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
under certain circumstances the players

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.609 
under certain circumstances the players
would<00:01:33.000> pick<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.420> ball<00:01:33.570> place<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.229> go

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
would pick up the ball place it and go

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.730 
would pick up the ball place it and go
to<00:01:35.150> take<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.300> pretty<00:01:36.509> kick<00:01:36.659> from<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:37.020> this

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
to take the pretty kick from there this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.649 
to take the pretty kick from there this
year<00:01:38.009> similarly<00:01:38.759> we've<00:01:38.970> introduced<00:01:39.450> more

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
year similarly we've introduced more

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.990 
year similarly we've introduced more
moments<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.800> on<00:01:41.040> throw<00:01:41.340> ins<00:01:41.550> now<00:01:41.820> if

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
moments like that so on throw ins now if

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.510 
moments like that so on throw ins now if
the<00:01:42.119> players<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.690> in<00:01:42.899> roughly<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> correct

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the players are in roughly the correct

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
the players are in roughly the correct
area<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.300> will<00:01:45.750> allow<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.050> player<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.350> run

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
area for it will allow the player to run

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
area for it will allow the player to run
over<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.190> pick<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.580> ball<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.759> throw<00:01:48.330> it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
over and pick up the ball and throw it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.660 
over and pick up the ball and throw it
in<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> try<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.470> keep<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.220> fluidity

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
in just to try and keep the the fluidity

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.340 
in just to try and keep the the fluidity
of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.910> game<00:01:51.119> net<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> we've<00:01:54.600> done<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> lot<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.320 
of the game net so we've done a lot of
working<00:01:55.679> on<00:01:55.770> goalkeepers<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.550> year<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.940> know

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
working on goalkeepers this year I know

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.660 
working on goalkeepers this year I know
that<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.780> actually<00:01:57.960> were<00:01:58.410> giving<00:01:59.399> us<00:01:59.490> some

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that you actually were giving us some

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.029 
that you actually were giving us some
feedback<00:01:59.850> with<00:02:00.210> early<00:02:00.630> preview<00:02:01.080> coat<00:02:01.350> around

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
feedback with early preview coat around

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.800 
feedback with early preview coat around
one<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.550> bugs<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.910> found<00:02:03.149> thankfully

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
one of the bugs you found thankfully

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.020 
one of the bugs you found thankfully
we'd<00:02:04.649> already<00:02:04.830> found<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.429> we<00:02:05.580> were<00:02:05.700> trying<00:02:05.940> to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
we'd already found it we were trying to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.850 
we'd already found it we were trying to
track<00:02:06.270> back<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.660> time<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.619> this

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
track back in time going what is this

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.350 
track back in time going what is this
bug<00:02:08.100> trying<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:08.610> figure<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.209> we'd

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
bug trying to figure it out but we'd

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.999 
bug trying to figure it out but we'd
fixed<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.840> probably<00:02:10.380> three<00:02:10.560> or<00:02:10.590> four<00:02:10.709> weeks

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
fixed it probably three or four weeks

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.460 
fixed it probably three or four weeks
ago<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.510> bill<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.050> guys<00:02:13.230> have

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
ago but the the bill that you guys have

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
ago but the the bill that you guys have
got<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.769> obviously<00:02:14.100> quite<00:02:14.519> old<00:02:14.790> compared<00:02:15.269> to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
got is obviously quite old compared to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.120 
got is obviously quite old compared to
this<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.200> we're<00:02:16.410> pretty<00:02:16.590> confident<00:02:17.040> that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
this one so we're pretty confident that

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.170 
this one so we're pretty confident that
the<00:02:17.280> goalkeepers<00:02:17.760> are<00:02:17.790> going<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.060> behave

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
the goalkeepers are going to behave

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.210 
the goalkeepers are going to behave
themselves<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.900> year<00:02:18.959> you're<00:02:19.890> playing<00:02:20.100> with

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
themselves this year you're playing with

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.030 
themselves this year you're playing with
Barcelona<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.420> you're<00:02:21.570> down<00:02:21.780> one<00:02:22.079> nil<00:02:22.320> with

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
Barcelona so you're down one nil with

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.160 
Barcelona so you're down one nil with
Kinect<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.180> react<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.720> precision

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
Kinect you can react with the precision

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.380 
Kinect you can react with the precision
of<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.500> season<00:02:25.860> manager<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.090> work<00:02:27.209> that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
of a season manager the the work that

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.300 
of a season manager the the work that
we've<00:02:27.480> done<00:02:27.510> with<00:02:27.900> our<00:02:27.959> hardware<00:02:28.769> partners<00:02:29.070> on

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
we've done with our hardware partners on

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.030 
we've done with our hardware partners on
connect<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:31.200> Sony<00:02:31.440> move<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.920> been

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
connect and on the Sony move have been

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.530 
connect and on the Sony move have been
very<00:02:32.280> much<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.640> partnership<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.209> Microsoft

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
very much in partnership with Microsoft

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.900 
very much in partnership with Microsoft
and<00:02:34.019> Sony<00:02:34.200> what<00:02:35.100> we<00:02:35.190> wanted<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.549> do<00:02:35.760> was

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
and Sony what we wanted to do was

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.550 
and Sony what we wanted to do was
actually<00:02:36.239> incorporate<00:02:36.870> them<00:02:37.049> into<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.380> game

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
actually incorporate them into the game

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.140 
actually incorporate them into the game
in<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.739> meaningful<00:02:38.340> way<00:02:38.489> rather<00:02:38.730> than<00:02:38.880> just

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
in the meaningful way rather than just

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.210 
in the meaningful way rather than just
come<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.510> with<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> kind<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.200> gimmicky<00:02:40.650> solution

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
come up with a kind of gimmicky solution

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.430 
come up with a kind of gimmicky solution
so<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:41.610> Kinect<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.570> very<00:02:42.900> much<00:02:43.079> integrated

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
so with Kinect it's very much integrated

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.050 
so with Kinect it's very much integrated
in<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.950> game<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.459> way<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.850> voice

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
in the game in the way that voice

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.140 
in the game in the way that voice
commands<00:02:45.480> now<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.959> change<00:02:46.200> tactics<00:02:46.769> and

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
commands now can change tactics and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.910 
commands now can change tactics and
substitutions<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.360> for<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.049> move<00:02:49.290> it's<00:02:49.650> very

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
substitutions and for the move it's very

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.380 
substitutions and for the move it's very
much<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.160> very<00:02:50.459> intuitive<00:02:51.120> very

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
much a very intuitive very

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.090 
much a very intuitive very
straightforward<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.140> easy<00:02:52.290> way<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> control

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
straightforward and easy way to control

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.890 
straightforward and easy way to control
the<00:02:53.160> play<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.670> pitch<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.450> rather<00:02:54.690> than

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
the play on the pitch so rather than

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.360 
the play on the pitch so rather than
just<00:02:55.110> trying<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.410> put<00:02:55.560> something<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.130> for<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
just trying to put something in for the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.740 
just trying to put something in for the
sake<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.880> we<00:02:57.000> really<00:02:57.269> wanted<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.570> make<00:02:57.690> sure

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
sake of it we really wanted to make sure

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.449 
sake of it we really wanted to make sure
that<00:02:57.930> they<00:02:58.230> added<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.829> going<00:02:59.010> rather<00:02:59.250> than

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
that they added to the going rather than

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.930 
that they added to the going rather than
were<00:02:59.610> just<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.910> distraction

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
were just a distraction

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.570 
were just a distraction
