00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.240
 dear friends of us still on the stand 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.299
 by sony ifa 2012 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.510
 and let 's talk about digital imaging that how 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.590
 said cocks rai during the conference 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.010
 print is one of the pillars on which they are 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.570
 intends to concentrate on setting the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.119
 future strategy 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.619
 we know how important it is 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.809
 within the sony strategy the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.590
 nex system has been very successful 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.300
 sony's mirrorless system 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.420
 we have here a new copy of the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.969
 series nex 3 which is the nex 5 r 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.329
 so the name suggests a 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.460
 improvement an evolution of the nex 5 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.020
 we are with franc calabretto of sony that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 explains the features of this 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.809
 product nex 5 r was chosen not a 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.830
 case as a product we say 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.320
 representative of the range of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 mirrorless is the mid-range product 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.940
 and the one who received a response 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.000
 I would say more 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.210
 valid and more positive within 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.310
 this range of products is on this 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.990
 new product then on r were 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.750
 incorporate some of the features 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.140
 both in terms of software and in 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.890
 hardware terms borrowed for 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.690
 so to say from the older sisters 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.290
 the most visible or the one immediately 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.020
 visible and this dayal so this 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.240
 control that derives directly from the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.370
 probably trine someone's system 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.890
 of you will remember that it was 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.080
 implemented on a former 7 where they were 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.420
 present where two of are present 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.390
 these dayal is a function key that 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.310
 allows with a very simple movement 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.280
 then using only the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.400
 thumb quickly access 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.110
 many functions that are necessary or that 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.290
 I want to reach the moment when 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.780
 I want to take creative photography on 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.910
 this machine for views of the dimensions 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.700
 a single die was added to that 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.370
 still allows using a key 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.620
 to quickly access those that 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.090
 are the primary settings 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.370
 settings that can be 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.670
 customized so I can choose 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.540
 what are the most settings 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.550
 But there are some important ones for me 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.910
 important news also on commissioning 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.530
 correct fire other very new 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.090
 important are certainly related to 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.850
 that focusing system to it 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.420
 uses a system called fasta 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.310
 hybrid af therefore combines technology 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.760
 dismissed the fire in contrast to that 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.220
 basic research to cover all 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.980
 gaps it has with each other and 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.120
 therefore it substantially speeds up that 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.430
 which focusing system then 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.030
 more precise focusing without 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.230
 excursion in the wrong direction 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.450
 and therefore faster 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.299
 how many megapixels this machine offers 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.430
 aps c sensor always always psc sensor 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.680
 and a 16.1 megapixel 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.849
 other structural innovations on the product 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.569
 they are for example a rear LCD that is 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.329
 now rotates 180 degrees to facilitate 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.970
 what is the shelf shooting then 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.920
 self recovery this makes it naturally 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.340
 more versatile, certainly more versatile 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.950
 the product and then move on to one 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.879
 truly innovative feature for 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.000
 regarding this range 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.959
 of the introduction of the wifi then of the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.599
 Wifi connection 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.120
 then the wifi machine on board that 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.659
 I guess we can use for 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.099
 connect to a computer directly 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.620
 to connect to a tablet smartphone 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.189
 tell us what possibilities wifi offers us 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.489
 board this is a machine that has some 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:03.760
 Extensible functionality is the first 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.799
 machine that uses apps 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.190
 which can be downloaded via 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.030
 wifi or via direct connection 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.360
 all 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:18.000
 to the pc ap that are part of the play park 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.769
 memories will be a play memories camera 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.120
 in which I will be able to add some 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.919
 functionality inside the machine 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.830
 specific dedicated features 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.540
 then of course with photography 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.880
 of the most interesting we see in 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.639
 little by little in a demo will be the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.760
 possibility to connect and tell tar and 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.910
 the machine through a mobile product 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.440
 and then there are specific features 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.230
 dedicated to photography such as ad 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.230
 example a greater number of effects a 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.740
 most evolved bracketing a photograph 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:56.830
 interspersed or maybe a touch up 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.190
 a little bit more advanced than the image 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.040
 these will be free 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.290
 or they will be paid there will be 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.710
 of the free apps there will be apps 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.910
 for a fee one of the most appealing and 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.130
 interesting that the one I have just 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.930
 mentioned connection 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.810
 fortunately it will be free and it's one 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.250
 of the first that we go right to 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.540
 prove let's see how 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:25.000
 it works then we move into 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.790
 this other position for example then 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.920
 which we can see as the link 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.400
 can be performed either using 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.980
 a phone authorizing a tablet i 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.680
 products among other things must not be 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.350
 necessarily of the android and products 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.290
 therefore necessarily sony but products 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.570
 apps are also available on itunes 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.080
 store 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.309
 the 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.559
 system not only allows me to 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:54.289
 download the photos directly that I have 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.969
 done on camera 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.849
 inside the device for then 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:01.830
 share them manage it but process them 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:05.389
 also allows you to take the picture 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:11.309
 directly from the device and therefore is a 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:14.179
 self shopping available to the button 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:17.639
 shooting when I like the shot 

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:19.999
 shot taken the photo the car snaps 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.259
 and after that I imagine the photo is 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:24.089
 definitely its camera memory 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.819
 and then then also accessible 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:29.669
 through the smartphone itself we say 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.709
 that via the smartphone the possibility 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.349
 to copy it into the memory 

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:36.080
 of the smartphone and possibly 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:39.149
 subsequently or directly 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.449
 forward it or share it let's say how 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:44.789
 they even say this 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.860
 machine is one of the apps that will be 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.899
 You can download it 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.050
 share it directly through the 

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:54.449
 wifi regulation for example on facebook 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.819
 ah I understood then the camera yes 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.829
 also connects directly to the network 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.990
 without the support of a smartphone of a 

00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:03.430
 tablet well 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.460
 thank you very much very interesting 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.110
 especially for those who want to use the 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.570
 camera for the self-timer than this 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.350
 point time to have the display 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.990
 reversible can control the 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.830
 first shots on the smartphone 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.830
 thank you so much
