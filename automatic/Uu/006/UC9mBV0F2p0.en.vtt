00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
just listening to some you know some

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.389 
just listening to some you know some

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.470 
kind of 80s 70s synthesizer sound so I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
played the clarinet but it was so dry

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.230 
played the clarinet but it was so dry
compared<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> all<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> synthesizer<00:01:05.339> stuff

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
compared to all the synthesizer stuff

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.350 
compared to all the synthesizer stuff
that<00:01:06.509> so<00:01:07.440> yeah<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> me<00:01:08.550> there<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:08.729> no<00:01:08.880> magic<00:01:09.060> in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that so yeah to me there was no magic in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.680 
that so yeah to me there was no magic in
that<00:01:09.540> music<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.800> was<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
that music and it was and then I I

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.749 
that music and it was and then I I
really<00:01:13.259> really<00:01:13.560> hated<00:01:13.830> wearing<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.430> uniform

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
really really hated wearing a uniform

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.359 
really really hated wearing a uniform
and<00:01:15.300> I<00:01:15.660> I<00:01:15.690> guess<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.560> me<00:01:16.680> thinking<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.160> lot

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and I I guess that got me thinking a lot

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.300 
and I I guess that got me thinking a lot
about<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.479> ideology<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:20.039> is<00:01:20.160> this

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
about you know ideology and what is this

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.510 
about you know ideology and what is this
music<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.690> music<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.440> kind<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.830> big

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
music for this music is for kind of big

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.320 
music for this music is for kind of big
gatherings<00:01:24.060> national<00:01:24.630> nationalism<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:26.330> you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
gatherings national nationalism and you

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.680 
gatherings national nationalism and you
know<00:01:27.450> military<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:28.380> appearance<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:30.450> about

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
know military like appearance it's about

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.650 
know military like appearance it's about
the<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.920> big<00:01:32.100> square<00:01:32.459> of<00:01:32.759> people<00:01:33.209> that<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
the the big square of people that is the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.449 
the the big square of people that is the
marching<00:01:34.050> band<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.819> and<00:01:36.050> I<00:01:37.190> never<00:01:38.190> liked

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
marching band just and I never liked

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:41.600 
marching band just and I never liked
that<00:01:39.140> when<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> started<00:01:40.560> writing<00:01:40.770> music<00:01:41.069> was

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that when I started writing music was

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.719 
that when I started writing music was
when<00:01:41.849> I<00:01:41.880> kind<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.240> found<00:01:42.599> the<00:01:42.780> voice<00:01:43.369> with<00:01:44.369> my

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
when I kind of found the voice with my

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.449 
when I kind of found the voice with my
writing<00:01:45.229> before<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.440> I<00:01:46.740> didn't<00:01:47.250> really

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
writing before that I didn't really

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.330 
writing before that I didn't really
write<00:01:47.610> music<00:01:48.420> seriously<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.050> needed<00:01:49.560> words<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
write music seriously I needed words and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.260 
write music seriously I needed words and
so<00:01:50.849> I<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.619> my<00:01:52.619> interest<00:01:53.009> may<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.399> broad<00:01:53.819> but

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
so I think my interest may be broad but

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.029 
so I think my interest may be broad but
my<00:01:54.450> they're<00:01:54.869> also<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.289> narrow<00:01:55.649> because

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
my they're also very narrow because

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.109 
my they're also very narrow because
they're<00:01:56.220> at<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.459> intersection<00:01:57.090> between

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
they're at the intersection between

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:25.290 
they're at the intersection between
writing<00:01:57.599> and<00:01:57.810> music

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.600 

I<00:02:25.530> wouldn't<00:02:26.530> really<00:02:26.620> call<00:02:26.920> myself<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.430> writer

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
I wouldn't really call myself a writer

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.820 
I wouldn't really call myself a writer
I'm<00:02:28.030> more<00:02:28.300> like<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> failed<00:02:28.840> writer<00:02:29.290> because

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
I'm more like a failed writer because

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.950 
I'm more like a failed writer because
I'm<00:02:29.980> too<00:02:30.550> interested<00:02:31.060> in<00:02:31.120> music<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.600> let<00:02:31.720> go<00:02:31.930> of

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
I'm too interested in music to let go of

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
I'm too interested in music to let go of
it<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.340> think<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:34.120> lot<00:02:34.570> of<00:02:34.600> my<00:02:34.840> my<00:02:35.230> writing

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
it so I think a lot of my my writing

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.610 
it so I think a lot of my my writing
would<00:02:36.160> for<00:02:36.460> many<00:02:36.780> people<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.900> very<00:02:38.170> interested

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
would for many people it very interested

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.740 
would for many people it very interested
in<00:02:38.740> literature<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.730> poetry<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.360> would<00:02:40.510> lack

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
in literature and poetry it would lack

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.650 
in literature and poetry it would lack
something<00:02:41.200> I'm<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.280> interested<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.000> in

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
something I'm just so interested in in

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.380 
something I'm just so interested in in
the<00:02:44.260> kind<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.560> directness<00:02:45.460> that<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.030> get<00:02:46.180> from

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
the kind of directness that you get from

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.890 
the kind of directness that you get from
using<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.200> voice<00:02:48.120> expressing<00:02:49.120> words<00:02:49.270> the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
using the the voice expressing words the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.920 
using the the voice expressing words the
way<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.170> changes<00:02:50.200> something<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.160> wrote

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
way it changes something that you wrote

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.060 
way it changes something that you wrote
the<00:02:52.930> way<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.140> challenges<00:02:53.710> something<00:02:53.980> you

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
the way it challenges something you

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.230 
the way it challenges something you
thought<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.400> worked<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:56.940> I'm<00:02:57.940> also<00:02:58.150> very

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
thought it worked and I'm also very

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.140 
thought it worked and I'm also very
