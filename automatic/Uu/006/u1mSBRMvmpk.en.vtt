00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.910
 and the international business center of 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.619
 russia in modern brand new moscow 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.529
 symbolizes the dream of an economy that 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:20.060
 He wants to intervene worldwide but 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.060
 that for now it is not true 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.850
 until recently the stockbrokers 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.760
 They had a lot of work but the euphoria 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.410
 faded 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.410
 the atmosphere is tense 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.550
 with mask 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.870
 you have to get rid of it as soon as possible 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.520
 the actions of the banking sector and the 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.950
 energy due to the sanctions that 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.960
 will affect these sectors not only short 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.960
 but also in the long term 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.590
 Sanctions close to russia 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.960
 doors of the main markets of 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.870
 capitals the european union and the states 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.300
 united here banks were stocked 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.670
 Russians with credits but it is no longer possible 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.670
 now they only have left towards and switzerland 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.970
 the question now is how will they impact 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.400
 the sanctions on people currently 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.310
 banks are more reluctant to grant 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.190
 credits and if granted they do it to 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.560
 very high interests this situation 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.610
 affects everyone but especially the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.040
 Business 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.440
 Valeri Mironov worked a long time in 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.869
 the Russian central bank he knows very well 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.840
 the need for capital of the firms 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.810
 Mironov says that the Russian economy 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.760
 have enough reservations 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.370
 the Russian economy can survive so 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.750
 least one year autonomously without 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.060
 a large company is declared in 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.150
 bankruptcy but growth and 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.920
 productive innovation will slow down and 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.470
 the more time passes without investments 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.540
 and only debts are paid either with 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.180
 own reserves or those with which the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.700
 state that they reach 450 billion 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.400
 of dollars, as long as we live without 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.929
 investments there will be no modernization and so 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.929
 Competitive ability is lost 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.330
 in germany there was also a debate 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.310
 about the latest sanctions in particular 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.540
 on those that affect the sector 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.540
 Russian energy 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.849
 in the long term the sanctions will have 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.849
 negative consequences for the economy 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.920
 Russian special equipment high 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.110
 technology that the Russians need to 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.299
 extracting oil and gas come from 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.980
 West for the moment the Russians 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.260
 they have equipment to maintain the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.720
 exploitation but in two or three years 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.640
 when they have to exploit deposits 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.260
 difficult to access or renew the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.269
 old machinery at that time 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.220
 will depend on the equipment coming 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.959
 of the West if the sanctions are 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.349
 maintain they will not have the possibility of 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.150
 extract oil or gas with france yes 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.940
 You can sell these warships to 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.220
 Russia during the negotiation Paris 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.709
 managed to impose arguing that if you 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.099
 broke this signed contract a long time ago 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.109
 many jobs would be jeopardized but 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.030
 from now on export arms 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.160
 and war equipment is prohibited with 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.810
 consequences for other sectors in the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.569
 European Union 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.120
 and Russia not only goods of use are sent 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.739
 exclusively military frequently 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.020
 we found products that have use 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.200
 military but that are also used in 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.060
 other sectors is the meaning of liu 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.230
 the just 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.450
 you can give him an application 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.940
 purely military to some products 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.739
 for example weapons but there are goods 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.450
 like gears or machines or 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.680
 tools that can be used with 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.120
 military or non-military purposes 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.360
 for example the products of the firm 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.400
 pills in baden-württemberg the company 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.460
 caters to machine manufacturers in 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.130
 everyone also in russia 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.190
 feels produces stop systems 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.850
 emergency for production lines 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.590
 automated 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.750
 the manager demands from her clients 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.540
 certificates to rule out that their 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.920
 products are used in the industry 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.490
 armamentística now estimates that the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.110
 penalties will bring you losses for 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.600
 we are important to maintain the 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.420
 contact with our partners in russia the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.670
 return to peace will be decisive and that 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.700
 actors resume the dialogue that 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.980
 restore mutual trust we support 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.530
 the sanctions because now the most 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.190
 important are not the contracts but 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:38.270
 return peace to the region 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.790
 nixon of time jets which is an index of 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.190
 that a committee 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.960
 among the stockbrokers in the 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.330
 international business center 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.270
 Moscow reigns uncertainty 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.120
 how the sanctions will impact on 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.140
 putin when he falls into recession 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.140
 Russian economy
