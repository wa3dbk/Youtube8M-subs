00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
face up once you the corners lined up

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.620 
face up once you the corners lined up
I'm<00:02:38.100> going<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.280> start<00:02:38.459> with<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.640> long<00:02:38.970> side<00:02:39.390> of

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
I'm going to start with a long side of

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.740 
I'm going to start with a long side of
your<00:02:39.780> base<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.850> when<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> take<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> short<00:02:42.570> side

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
your base and when to take a short side

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.470 
your base and when to take a short side
okay<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.010> insert<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.640> corner<00:02:45.060> bracket

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
okay and it's insert the corner bracket

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690 
okay and it's insert the corner bracket
into<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.560> groove<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> back<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.490> frame

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
into the groove in the back of the frame

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.060 
into the groove in the back of the frame
the<00:02:48.390> longer<00:02:48.750> side<00:02:48.930> will<00:02:49.080> be<00:02:49.170> your<00:02:49.290> base<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.980> you

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
the longer side will be your base so you

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.980 
the longer side will be your base so you
start<00:02:50.430> by<00:02:50.760> putting<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> two<00:02:51.330> shorter<00:02:51.959> sides

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
start by putting the two shorter sides

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.070 
start by putting the two shorter sides
onto<00:02:52.709> one<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.070> longer<00:02:53.459> sides<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.959> they

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
onto one of the longer sides and they

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.940 
onto one of the longer sides and they
line<00:02:55.320> up<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:56.300> Wow<00:02:57.300> okay<00:02:58.020> now<00:02:58.830> what
