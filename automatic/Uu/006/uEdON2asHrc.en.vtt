I'm<00:01:30.570> assuming<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.530> more<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I'm assuming it's going to be more and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
I'm assuming it's going to be more and
that<00:01:32.460> eats<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.820> hard<00:01:33.000> drive<00:01:33.240> space<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.689> think

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that eats up hard drive space I think

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
that eats up hard drive space I think
the<00:01:34.049> consoles<00:01:34.530> from<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> get-go<00:01:35.009> both<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
say all should have had at least a

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.109 
say all should have had at least a
terabyte<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.409> storage<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.909> was

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
terabyte of storage so this this was

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.789 
terabyte of storage so this this was
