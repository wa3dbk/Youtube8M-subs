the<00:01:44.660> strain<00:01:44.960> slows<00:01:45.620> down<00:01:45.800> little<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:47.060> only

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
the strain slows down little but only

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.450 
the strain slows down little but only
marginally

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
marginally

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.490 

and<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.060> wheel<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.390> already<00:01:50.630> almost<00:01:50.990> off<00:01:51.350> the

that it's a flexible bit of kit and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:25.730 
that it's a flexible bit of kit and
we're<00:02:08.970> now<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> lower<00:02:09.570> it<00:02:24.440> its<00:02:25.440> maximum

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
we're now going to lower it its maximum
