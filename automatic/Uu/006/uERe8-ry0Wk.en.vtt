00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 speaks guys here galiano matthew mj 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.820
 I am part of the fifth unit of the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.059
 clan mosquito nets and would like to show 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.089
 for you there the new defense and tp sorelle 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.869
 running on a 7 cd that really 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.380
 helped a lot very very very severe 7 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.390
 because he made a defense against 67 himself 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.840
 it was getting very difficult if it were 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.590
 dragon attack the dragons in case and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.410
 ended up destroying even giving 100% 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.000
 67 if it was well - planned and or not 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.450
 makes a well-planned face attack 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.829
 really get the 3 stars or 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.059
 really is now 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.940
 making it difficult 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.770
 I do not say it 's impossible but the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.719
 dispersion has helped a lot and I 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.800
 show you a defense there and that I 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.140
 I did it against the case the guy was the same 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.379
 number that attacked me squid so we 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.710
 is balanced it comes with the attack 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.019
 he comes with 10 dragons and also comes with 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.970
 a level 3 dragon in the castel is 10 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.090
 level 2 dragons on level 3 dragon 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.340
 castle fury level 4 tyler is 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.700
 bringing healing also four then he 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.490
 is giving a food service 7 attack in 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.220
 down the level the four could not 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.220
 be at level 5 or 4 to 1 thousand 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.390
 He tries to start with the king. 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.610
 barbarian trying to wipe dragons 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.220
 They tried to enter here by coming to defense. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.840
 but the dragons here seem to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.020
 His intention was not that they end up 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.619
 diverging slightly and entered the angle of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.479
 action of my disperser you can see 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.610
 that one of his dragons ends up coming 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.930
 here in my defense but not long ago 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.420
 effect because it is being attacked 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.659
 by the thesis of two aerial defenses 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.159
 their dragons end up being 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.560
 beaten here by my scatterer 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 I understand, it's not much use and there are two 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.180
 dragons here will destroy a go key 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.399
 get behind here from my speech but 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.520
 will not advance the air defenses with 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.369
 It's no use detonating the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.190
 dragon himself is level 5 air defense 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.730
 then I did not know one attack disrupts 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.040
 there is little here he has been using 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.379
 healing in the dragon that I find a mistake in 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.150
 my opinion really cures does not work 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:25.760
 both the dragon because the dragon already has 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:28.099
 a lot of life is then that fury I 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.110
 I think it's much more effective you can open 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.750
 hand of a cure to take a fury is 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.180
 better because a leaf you attack more 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.250
 faster faster attacking faster 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.769
 the stronger you move up the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.379
 defenses faster and ends up destroying 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.860
 defenses consequently taking less 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.860
 damage 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.370
 then maybe he would take a sheet and 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.470
 maybe help a little more 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.170
 I do not think it would be very different 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.420
 for this attack he made and you 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.780
 you can see here that really 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.060
 dispersed it ends up driving away all 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.620
 dragons not letting him touch the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.079
 my aerial defenses 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.760
 the air defenses were almost intact 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.209
 sun he lost some more life 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.190
 there 's still has a thesis he points 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.739
 succeeded in destroying another pottery thesis 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.290
 but the man a village center that stayed 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.299
 well impact as you can see late 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.590
 made a mess here to destroy a little 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:28.190
 round I managed to take 69 69% of my 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:32.510
 village is a star but against an attack 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.650
 of this level 10 dragons and 11 dragons 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.720
 I think it was a good defense and I'm going 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.269
 show you here also how 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.280
 okay worked my attack here with him 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.849
 His defense in my opinion was wrong. 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.220
 that's what it is, then you're 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.030
 Look here, how was that? 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.180
 attack 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.880
 his alarm clock is here 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.970
 is an oil will be person point to the 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.919
 other side he can get here already gives 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.889
 help us both 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.290
 protect his two air defenses 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.480
 I entered with the dragons here understands that 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.419
 was to wait for the defense to start 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.699
 attack and when it begins to attack in 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.959
 a key dragon enters here with it 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.760
 also asked him to concentrate the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.639
 Dragons in the middle will come with a balloon 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.130
 who understood the balloon is going to come in like this 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.840
 that the balloon arrives I will give a fury 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.640
 that the dragons will attack faster 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.030
 with students will arrive faster will 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.740
 destroy faster than it leaves 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.290
 weight the balloon is rushing to another 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.880
 defense and sent another defense 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.120
 aerial space 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:41.160
 so yesterday here two leaves left 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.440
 understood to administer that the result 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.180
 on the balloons have not seen leave will arrive 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.350
 something should arrive in the tower of 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.020
 I was not reminded and it was that 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.800
 attack are seeing of it has not done 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.760
 nothing nothing nothing because it was badly situated 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.900
 on site 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.640
 How could you come on my blog? 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.730
 very high you concentrating disperser 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.490
 enunciated betrayal of the village and taking a 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:13.290
 lightning protection and air defense is a 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.870
 great antunes had 7 is a great year 97 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.690
 I still gave a damn maybe there I 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.520
 I do not know, maybe I would take one of the 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.250
 archers to destroy these huts in the 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.750
 beginning would be better understood or at the time 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.030
 that I looked at the time like this 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.340
 and it really is about a time until it is 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.110
 legal must be left around 30 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.330
 the 2nd did not notice as the dragon and 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.520
 Leandro was a thousand mistake in my opinion 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.979
 not having repaired and his huts in the 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.789
 singing understood why dragon attack is 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.140
 dangerous because of that if you boot 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.180
 ending up in the corner 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.280
 we can the dragon started slowly 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.520
 it might not have been 100% alone 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.800
 because you forgot the cabins in the 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.090
 beginning understood and really is not 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.160
 interesting you get in with the dragons 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.910
 the cabin because you're able though to 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.490
 tactic is to win that was it 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.380
 This was an attack left over from two leaves. 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.930
 You saw that I took three children. 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.000
 for war I only used one and had not 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.210
 need the layout of it for me was 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.260
 something easy to attack 11 we had many 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.720
 problems 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.229
 his attack with me was not as effective 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.100
 so could not better be a war 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.220
 finished 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.470
 and I can suffer attacks and saw the dragon 3 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.289
 I do not know how it's going to be 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.970
 but let's wait and have a cv 9 I do not know 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.659
 if he already gave both his attacks and 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.060
 I never believe the attack desires 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.580
 but 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.419
 That's it. It was about two 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.070
 milk examples as one defines a 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.960
 well positioned air disperser and a 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.540
 defender was poorly positioned makes the 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.669
 difference in case 67 does not 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.280
 difference no further even attack 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:57.880
 dragon with the destruction of everything coming out 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.460
 there is no way to make a good defense 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.120
 with poorly positioned air defenses 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.570
 point bring the dragon will always win 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.250
 There is no way, that's it, folks. 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.440
 war is not over yet we 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.510
 to manage is to know how to do the second 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.790
 attack so we can not take 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:21.040
 the hurley home and this is only airton 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:25.540
 for you to have an idea and how it is 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:28.510
 that it was this attack there with a and the defense 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.060
 with a disperser it was worth a great one 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.760
 strong hug to everyone who watched 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.520
 the video hopefully helped in the strategy 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.580
 of positioning and dispersed I also 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.740
 I'm new people plan on nothing 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:45.340
 I ended up going to a tip from a 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:48.400
 Friend thousand idol I go the clan leader 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:51.120
 and a good tip for positioning 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:55.750
 person and eventually it really was 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.520
 sensational crucial there great 

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.419
 positioning of the person as 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.620
 dragons 

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:01.620
 so this is it folks
