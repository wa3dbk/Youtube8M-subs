00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.119
 gas in may 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.519
 it seems we are late 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.369
 Bolshakova survey the first floor hall 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.369
 Kotenko Let's keep in touch for the second 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.030
 loyalty you have to stay with 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 childhood I will go that both 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.940
 I have invested a lot and the program of this spider 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 there doctors waited for him to get all the districts 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.679

 September 3 like this 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.050
 welcome my world 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.050
 we are not busy now 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.510
 you don't help 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.100
 i feel art 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.400
 apparently step beeline free 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.640
 I have an idea 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.640
 it's always bad i'm grateful 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.089
 prim 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.609
 i played finished 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.709
 you can not let him fry 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.349
 the trip room that wants to do new 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.549
 by cars 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.089
 assembly line is not worth it 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.439
 when you go 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.539
 don't count me 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.389
 I'm so afraid of the button accordion after that 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.239
 happened i needed was 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.799
 if it does not appear 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.059
 Be carefull 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.870
 either if we see that 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.870
 are you afraid of something 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.809
 rub 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.669
 everything is good 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.269
 not quite 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.349
 and how are you 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.299
 somewhat differently represented verification 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.099
 were assembly line 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.130
 I want to support the act 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.880
 but then you both decided a little 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.719
 ride 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.489
 so i will take as a memento 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.489
 bit by consuelo 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.999
 ikea so we don't respect space 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.909
 to dispel 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.879
 saw what i did so did something 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.189
 yes you would not get on the drum bar even standing 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.349
 Headlights 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.349
 f 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.169
 in this standing position 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.439
 Caution 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:11.519
 and about 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.109
 what about 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.189
 first 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.699
 him 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.699
 However, from March to May, I certainly did not appear 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.979
 she m 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.800
 Tass today I have to retire 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.560
 so I will never be surprised 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.270

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.270

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 data 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.409
 but he 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.409
 informs 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.939
 chapter 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.740
 65 6 times more than once 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.729
 Kostusev m as for my 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.779
 behaviors bring me 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.430
 very afraid of them 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.939
 and who was not afraid 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:26.979
 I was afraid 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.689
 even before I learned about this touch 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.180
 root 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.180

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.189
 don't worry he was going to anyway 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.960
 change assembly line 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.680
 probably want some 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.089
 relax 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:49.129
 in may black 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:50.659
 pathetic
