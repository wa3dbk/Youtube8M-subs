00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.159
 Web navegation 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.159

 Ã¡lex that is very good if you do not know him 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.880
 let's load the other game a little bit 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.020
 plus 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.570
 a little bit more spectacular than 1st 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.319
 It's free for all tablets that 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.629
 have as cpu nvidia tegra 3 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.989
 is a three young man to install does very 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.989
 well done 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.430
 let's continue let's see now how 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.150
 playing a video resource 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.489
 let's use enter mx player i am 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.380
 optimized for video decoding 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.650
 for hardware so for a 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.480
 excellent performance we will put by 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.830
 example this brings this trailer that is 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:34.860
 is recorded at 1080p so 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.810
 so the nexus should reduce the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.280
 size to display on your screen like this 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.280
 he has to have even more work 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.979
 that is a mkv 1080p like diogenes 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.349
 do not 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.060
 as you see the revolution is excellent without 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.270
 no type of jump or loss of 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.080
 frame 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:26.190
 let's put video now also this 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.750
 it's a mp4 to 720 of course if the 720 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.750
 he has no problem with them 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.530
 good thing more this is the 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.490
 let's say the desktop for the widgets and 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.490
 It only works 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.889
 nothing happened 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.490
 but good 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.490
 the programs 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.160
 and well, I hope that I have 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:07.530
