 a traditional bridge in the area was the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.689

 summit despite the political backroom 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.530
 tranquility and camaraderie between 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.580

 made present with shouts and slogans a 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.610
 climate of tension that the chancellery 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.569
 Chilean prevented the absence of alfredo 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.920
 Brown 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.349

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.180
 necessary to do in Bolivia in 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.220

 install the theme regionally I 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.480
 I think we have to be 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.079
 quiet because the arguments of chile 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.150
