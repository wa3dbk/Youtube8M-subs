00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.640
 Once the piece is located, it is necessary to 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.530
 determine the best way to approach 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.530
 up to the optimal shooting distance 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.019
 it is indispensable to go observing 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.910
 continuously the movements of the roe deer 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.789
 we will be directing the approach 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.740
 final depending on your travels 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.960
 always aiming to place us in 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.680
 a place where it is possible to make a 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.680
 good shot 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.470
 the success of the final entry will depend 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.720
 of experience and good 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.730
 hunter then to meet a 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.410
 such a short distance of an animal so 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.239
 Shy and with senses so 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.700
 developed the slightest noise 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.520
 will cause the flight of the dam by giving 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.520
 lost all the work done 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
 previously 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.190
 analyzing the situation and seeing that there is 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.989
 to go through a lot too much 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.270
 discovered paco decides with great 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.070
 criterion keep moving forward only to 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.670
 minimize the chances of being 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.670
 detected 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.020
 the short absorbed in his work has not been 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.790
 given the presence of paco 'that 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.190
 meter to meter is reducing the distance 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.530
 of shooting until you reach a precipice that 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.300
 it makes it impossible for you to keep moving forward and 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.540
 that will force you to make a shot 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.370
 more than 300 meters act solely from a 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.370
 experienced hunter as is he 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.909
 no no 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.660
 I was quite far away from those who 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.750
 we have a possibility the idea was 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.140
 very in favor of the others that we have 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.720
 could reach a bidder that being 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.530
 a very long shot 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.970
 the air was not so long 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.860
 if about 300 meters I think it has not 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.140
 he left nearby branches to the air he was 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.910
 very in favor 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.319
 very good a good one is normal the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.569
 shot all things for the heart 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.410
 are normal are more normal than 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:51.030
 it has about 150 180 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.030
 the period I have and pretty 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.140
 the residents are not bad either 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:09.350
 up, up, down, have many 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.350
 photos already 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.440
 the haul has been really exciting 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.450
 so the occasion will not be missed 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.450
 to make some good memories photos
