notice these are two different types of

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.510 
notice these are two different types of
buffer<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> long<00:00:17.460> thin<00:00:18.330> buffer<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
buffer this is a long thin buffer and

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.920 
buffer this is a long thin buffer and
this<00:00:20.520> one<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> square

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
this one is a square

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.279 
this one is a square
the<00:00:22.560> typical<00:00:23.039> buffers<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.730> would<00:00:23.910> see

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
the typical buffers that you would see

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.900 
the typical buffers that you would see
when<00:00:25.289> you're<00:00:25.439> doing<00:00:25.769> nails<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.369> you're<00:00:26.670> using

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
when you're doing nails and you're using

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.259 
when you're doing nails and you're using
a<00:00:27.150> buffer<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:28.140> big<00:00:28.529> buffer<00:00:29.160> sometimes<00:00:30.000> can

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
a buffer this big buffer sometimes can

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.080 
a buffer this big buffer sometimes can
be<00:00:30.420> cumbersome<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.669> don't<00:00:32.850> want<00:00:33.000> to

be cumbersome so and you don't want to
waste<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:33.510> buffer<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.440> through

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
waste your buffer because you go through

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.780

in beauty school that I'm gonna share
with<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:41.059> starting<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:43.050> you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
with you starting with this one if you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.490 
with you starting with this one if you
cut<00:00:43.680> them<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.219> smaller<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.989> cut<00:00:46.230> them<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
cut them at smaller you can cut them a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.619 
cut them at smaller you can cut them a
little<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.860> smaller<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.270> cut<00:00:48.480> them

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
little bit smaller and you can cut them

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.220 
little bit smaller and you can cut them
different<00:00:49.079> sizes<00:00:49.670> because<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.149> still<00:00:51.840> works

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
different sizes because it still works

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670 
different sizes because it still works
the<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:52.559> I'll<00:00:53.250> show<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.469> it<00:00:55.469> does

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the same I'll show you right now it does

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520 
the same I'll show you right now it does
the<00:00:55.829> same<00:00:56.070> trick<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.879> use<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> buffer<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.109> an<00:00:58.289> X

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the same trick I use the buffer in an X

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.369 
the same trick I use the buffer in an X
motion<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.030> way<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.300> way<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.109> way

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
motion going this way that way this way

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.950 
motion going this way that way this way
that<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.670> works<00:01:02.879> perfectly<00:01:03.329> fine<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
that way and it works perfectly fine and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.830 
that way and it works perfectly fine and
using<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.619> bigger<00:01:04.799> size<00:01:05.159> does<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> same<00:01:06.479> thing

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
using a bigger size does the same thing

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.039 
using a bigger size does the same thing
this<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.710> you'll<00:01:08.369> save<00:01:08.729> money<00:01:09.090> because<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this way you'll save money because you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.870 
this way you'll save money because you
cut<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.560> smaller<00:01:10.979> cut<00:01:11.460> them<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> size

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
cut them smaller cut them to the size

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.300 
cut them smaller cut them to the size
that<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.710> easier<00:01:14.070> for

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
that you want and it's just easier for

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.310 
that you want and it's just easier for
you<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.689> regular<00:01:16.049> size

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you to use so with these regular size

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280 
you to use so with these regular size
buffers<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> nice<00:01:18.869> sharp

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
buffers if you if you take a nice sharp

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.289 
buffers if you if you take a nice sharp
knife<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.130> slice<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.729> down<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
knife you can slice them down to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.300 
knife you can slice them down to
different<00:01:21.509> sizes<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
different sizes now if you're of a
