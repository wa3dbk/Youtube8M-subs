have a little bit of a sheen to it unit
I<00:02:36.150> mean<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.600> wouldn't<00:02:36.960> call<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> gloss

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
I mean I wouldn't call it like a gloss

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.310 
I mean I wouldn't call it like a gloss
or<00:02:38.130> anything<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.960> little

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.660 
or anything like that but it is a little
bit<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:41.900> shiny<00:02:42.900> than<00:02:43.380> like<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.980> regular<00:02:44.430> old

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
bit more shiny than like a regular old

bit more shiny than like a regular old
chapstick<00:02:45.300> chapstick<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.740> makes<00:02:46.950> sense<00:02:47.300> but

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
of tea smell so it's just a really nice

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.260 
of tea smell so it's just a really nice
combination<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:27.590> really<00:03:28.590> enjoy<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.640> just

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
combination I really enjoy it and I just

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.550 
combination I really enjoy it and I just
wanted<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.510> upload<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> video<00:03:31.140> about<00:03:31.410> it

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
wanted to upload a video about it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.320 
wanted to upload a video about it
because<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.040> scent<00:03:32.370> has<00:03:32.610> been<00:03:32.820> really<00:03:33.180> nice

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
because the scent has been really nice

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.479 
because the scent has been really nice
and<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.720> think<00:03:33.750> it's<00:03:34.050> kind<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.410> nice<00:03:34.650> fall

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
and I think it's kind of a nice fall

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.229 
and I think it's kind of a nice fall
scent<00:03:36.060> kind<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.540> thing<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.670> sun's<00:03:38.940> just

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
scent kind of thing and the sun's just

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.620 
scent kind of thing and the sun's just
really<00:03:39.630> great<00:03:39.900> but<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.320> doesn't<00:03:40.680> have<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.920> taste

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
really great but it doesn't have a taste

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.760 
really great but it doesn't have a taste
at<00:03:42.630> least<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:42.959> don't<00:03:43.020> think<00:03:43.170> they're<00:03:43.440> supposed

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
at least I don't think they're supposed

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.830 
at least I don't think they're supposed
to<00:03:43.950> be<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.160> specific<00:03:44.520> taste<00:03:45.030> or<00:03:45.300> anything<00:03:45.660> when

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
to be a specific taste or anything when

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.729 
to be a specific taste or anything when
you<00:03:45.930> lick<00:03:46.140> your<00:03:46.170> lips

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
you lick your lips

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.479 
you lick your lips
it<00:03:47.370> does<00:03:47.640> smell<00:03:48.000> good<00:03:48.060> though<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:50.070> smell

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
it does smell good though so the smell

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.030 
it does smell good though so the smell
kind<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.270> maybe<00:03:51.570> makes<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.230> think<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.830> has

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
kind of maybe makes it think that it has

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.770 
kind of maybe makes it think that it has
a<00:03:53.070> little<00:03:53.280> bit<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.580> taste<00:03:53.820> but<00:03:54.120> not<00:03:54.150> really<00:03:54.540> it

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
a little bit of taste but not really it

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.240 
a little bit of taste but not really it
