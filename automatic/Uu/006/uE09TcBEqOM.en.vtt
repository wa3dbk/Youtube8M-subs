00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.509
 Dustin: How are the aquarium people? Fishtanktv.com Dustin 's Fish Tanks giving it to you from 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.530
 Steve's house. Are you going to talk about Steve's aquarium. Enthusiastic to show us his tank. Agitated 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.900
 to re-create videos because I felt completely dead like 4 days. Both daughters 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.609
 sick mama sick clean up puke. Ill miss myself from a few days of work. Terrible 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.929
 , terrible, terrible. Wash your hands. If you have children, their hands 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:28.749
 wash before you feed them. It is filthy. Anyway you can talk about some 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.630
 tanks. Must say what's up Steve dude. 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.809
 Steve: Man I hope you left that funk at home. 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.460
 Dustin: I got the funk, I'll take the funk to your home baby. The 55, goodbye 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.739
 to take the 55. Oh man, people are going to be so angry. It's a sad day guy 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.239
 . He called me the other day, had this sad tone in his voice as a guy, I have a plan 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.850
 . I thought he was going to move to Zimbabwe or something. I didn't know where 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.809
 you go with that conversation. He was like "I have a plan:" I was like oh no, something big 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.580
 . Then he was like "I'm knocking down the 55" which is just as painful for me to 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.750
 to hear . He tells me to enlarge I will zoom in brother. So here it is 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.490
 the man . Saying goodbye to 55. How long have you had this thing on humans. 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 Steve: Years ... Years Dustin: I got it when you moved? 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.000
 Steve: Yes, it's been about 3 years. Dustin: About 3 years. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.830
 Steve: Maybe 2 years Dustin: Let's just go ahead and do it 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.170
 it does. You have your crypts, they are just exile there, those Crypts there. And then I have 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 you Ludblu Cortinalis, that's just great. And then the Anubius all in the mix. 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.880
 Steve: Java Fern Dustin: Java Fern. Vendelov. Then you have 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.540
 the Rotella that I always like. Anubius: the same deal. A couple 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.160
 beautiful rainbows. Give me your theory a lot. I know you read some articles 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.580
 about it, it's just a change thing. Tell us why you tear this tank to 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.230
 downstairs, what's your theory about taking tanks down, and we're talking about what's going on 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.090
 going on next. Steve: Well frankly my theory about it 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.830
 tearing this tank down is because i really want to play in the discus tank and it is 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.680
 not big enough . I'm going to upgrade, go with the 72 bowfront. You know it's okay too 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.350
 to switch every now and then. You've been going for a few years, it's time for one 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.330
 change. When I started this tank it was all about the big piece of wood 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.110
 so covered with Anubius now that you can hardly see it is there. But you know that 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.150
 it was time for a change. Turn it on, keep it interesting. Receive something 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.480
 otherwise release there in my house and have more fun figuring out how to plant it. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.900
 Dustin: People hate when I cut you off, so I'm just not going to talk. 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.420
 Steve: That's all I have for. Dustin: That's all you have? Alright 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.819
 . Yes dude so the driftwood I have to talk about it, because I had it right in my pond, 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.040
 you can't even see it now. I didn't know you could do it. It just really pops 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.069
 , it really works. It was in a 55 and it is just a really big piece. When this 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.240
 is jerked, I don't know if you are going to use it again, but I would like to 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.490
 show that piece at a certain point. We will get a video of it. That is one 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.080
 Bryan Campbell special. Yes man the rainbows have been good for you. He has this one 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.100
 beautiful fool here. Oh man she is beautiful, just beautiful fish. You've got to love it 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.580
 . We are probably, we were wanting to put this tank in the green house. Oh by the way 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.859
 people are like peace in the work of Steve Ludwigia. Messed up orders, they got angry 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.390
 . They were like you said you were not going to touch dude. Someone had some Ludwigia 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.080
 . It will grow back, it will be nice to you all. So yes, tear up 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.129
 To go downstairs to the 72 bowfront we decided. A lot of good things going on in this tank man 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.700
 . Lots of fish there. Steve: Thing about tanks, tanks never the same 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.180
 stay and all tanks just grown so over that you are tired of hacking things, sometimes 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.180
 It is better to just start being fresh. Amano wrote an article about that and sometimes 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.349
 You only get tired of trimming Dustin: Tired of trimming 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.780
 Steve: Just have to start from scratch, clear the palette. 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.569
 Dustin: Erasing the canvas here. This is the last video. Moment of silence before 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.950
 the 55. That's it people. Quick update a lot of people have done a lot of it 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.840
 I signed up for the newsletter at Aquatic Jungles. I go through all my old ones 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.709
 video, introducing comments, and looping them there so you definitely want to check 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.199
 that out, a lot of good advice. Going through old videos, old times out 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.620
 to pull . As well as some things you told me. It is really good 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.879
 stuff there: go to the aquatic jungle, download the top 10 tank tips to your left 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.529
 . People are giving me some good feedback on that, so I totally want it 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.179
 plug that. And again wash your hands people this flu is poultry. So that's what's up 

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:37.979
 ! Steve is bringing the discus down and we are excited. Later on .
