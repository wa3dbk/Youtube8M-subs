00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
of a dude there that is me let's do this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.119 
of a dude there that is me let's do this
is<00:00:42.210> whole<00:00:43.170> wheat<00:00:43.200> better<00:00:43.590> than<00:00:43.770> white<00:00:43.920> bread

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
is whole wheat better than white bread

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.069 
is whole wheat better than white bread
here's<00:00:44.670> thing<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.510> whole<00:00:45.539> grains<00:00:45.930> you

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
here's thing the whole grains you

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
here's thing the whole grains you
consumed<00:00:46.440> today<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:46.890> vastly<00:00:47.430> different<00:00:47.879> than

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
consumed today are vastly different than

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
grandparents consumed whole grains they

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.750 
grandparents consumed whole grains they
were<00:00:51.870> healthy<00:00:52.230> they<00:00:52.530> contained<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.340> fibers

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
were healthy they contained the fibers

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.939 
were healthy they contained the fibers
content<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:55.199> our<00:00:55.320> body<00:00:55.500> knew<00:00:55.739> they

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
content that our body knew they

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580 
content that our body knew they
contained<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.610> lot<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.210> my<00:00:57.239> corner<00:00:57.600> chance<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
contained a lot on my corner chance the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.650 
contained a lot on my corner chance the
fact<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.280> whole<00:00:59.430> grains<00:00:59.670> today<00:01:00.000> aren't

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
fact is the whole grains today aren't

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.299 
fact is the whole grains today aren't
that<00:01:00.809> much<00:01:00.989> different<00:01:01.050> from<00:01:01.440> sugar<00:01:01.739> they

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that much different from sugar they

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
that much different from sugar they
actually<00:01:02.699> had<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> same<00:01:03.210> same<00:01:03.899> chemical

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
actually had the same same chemical

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
actually had the same same chemical
makeup<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.309> sugar<00:01:05.549> yes<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:06.270> right<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.510> know

makeup and sugar yes that's right I know

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.270 
makeup and sugar yes that's right I know

and bash me and tell them tell me I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.000 
and bash me and tell them tell me I
don't<00:01:09.630> know<00:01:09.689> what<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.869> talking<00:01:10.170> about<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.530> want

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you to look into the science behind

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
you to look into the science behind
whole<00:01:12.840> grains<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.159> only<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.520> don't

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670

mean stuff you see on talk shows I mean
the<00:01:16.020> actual<00:01:16.140> signs<00:01:16.590> I'll<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.939> donut<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the actual signs I'll see that a donut a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.929 
the actual signs I'll see that a donut a
bagel<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.110> bread<00:01:19.320> whole<00:01:20.070> wheat<00:01:20.100> bread<00:01:20.340> it's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
bagel or bread whole wheat bread it's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
bagel or bread whole wheat bread it's
all<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> same<00:01:21.270> thing<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.020> base<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
all the same thing the base is all the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.770 
all the same thing the base is all the
same<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> collide<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.460> derived<00:01:23.790> peptides<00:01:24.330> but

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
same to collide and derived peptides but

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330 
same to collide and derived peptides but
I<00:01:24.810> body<00:01:25.020> can't<00:01:25.380> use<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.590> actually<00:01:26.070> passed

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I body can't use that actually passed

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.490 
I body can't use that actually passed
through<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> gut<00:01:26.909> completely<00:01:27.780> undigested<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
week 10 days that's bad stuff so you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.209 
week 10 days that's bad stuff so you
take<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.200> these<00:01:58.290> 10<00:01:58.500> day<00:01:58.680> bread<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.070> put

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
protein more fiber it's got to be

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.760 
protein more fiber it's got to be
healthier<00:02:03.180> that's<00:02:03.869> actually<00:02:04.110> incorrect
