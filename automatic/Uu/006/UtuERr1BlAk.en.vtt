00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
first CCM be honest I never tried before

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.640 
first CCM be honest I never tried before
but<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:17.340> honest<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.940> really<00:00:17.970> liked<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.900> really

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
but be honest I really liked it really

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.340 
but be honest I really liked it really
liked<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.100> very<00:00:20.279> good<00:00:20.970> support<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.930> ankle

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
liked it very good support for the ankle

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.640 
liked it very good support for the ankle
and<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.640> feel<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.180> nice<00:00:24.359> leanings<00:00:25.050> with

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and I can feel the nice leanings with

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.189 
and I can feel the nice leanings with
the<00:00:25.769> fast<00:00:26.099> acceleration<00:00:26.760> more<00:00:27.300> more<00:00:27.960> like

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the fast acceleration more more like

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.830 
the fast acceleration more more like
fast<00:00:28.590> crossovers<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> corners<00:00:30.119> which

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
fast crossovers in the corners which

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.900 
fast crossovers in the corners which
means<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.320> very<00:00:31.619> important<00:00:32.160> how<00:00:32.369> your<00:00:32.579> edge

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
means it's very important how your edge

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.380 
means it's very important how your edge
holds<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:35.130> do<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> kind
