there's no special technique to swinging

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.529 
there's no special technique to swinging
the<00:00:28.410> sledgehammer<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:30.090> don't<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the sledgehammer and you don't have to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.110 
the sledgehammer and you don't have to
use<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.810> tire<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.740> I'm<00:00:31.949> doing<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
use a tire like I'm doing now but the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.389 
use a tire like I'm doing now but the
reason<00:00:33.390> why<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> use<00:00:33.780> retire<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.309> get

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
reason why I use retire and so I can get

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.160 
reason why I use retire and so I can get
a<00:00:35.430> better<00:00:35.640> workout<00:00:35.850> because<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.870> hit<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
a better workout because when I hit the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
a better workout because when I hit the
tire<00:00:37.380> they<00:00:37.890> slash<00:00:38.219> imma<00:00:38.460> bounces<00:00:38.790> right<00:00:38.820> back

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
tire they slash imma bounces right back

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
tire they slash imma bounces right back
up<00:00:39.300> quickly<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.170> gives<00:00:40.410> me<00:00:40.590> very<00:00:40.800> little

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
up quickly and it gives me very little

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.650 
up quickly and it gives me very little
time<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> rest<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:42.059> keeps<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:42.329> muscles

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
time to rest which keeps my muscles

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.360 
time to rest which keeps my muscles
working<00:00:42.899> longer<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.379> making<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:43.980> burn<00:00:44.190> more

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
working longer and making me burn more

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.299 
working longer and making me burn more
fat<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.820> build<00:00:45.360> more<00:00:45.480> muscle<00:00:45.539> faster<00:00:49.309> but

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
fat and build more muscle faster but

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.310 
fat and build more muscle faster but
even<00:00:50.610> if<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.000> don't<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> tire<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.199> can

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
even if you don't have a tire you can

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.350 
even if you don't have a tire you can
hit<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> ground<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:54.180> hit<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
hit the ground like this and you hit a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.540 
hit the ground like this and you hit a
tree<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.230> hit<00:00:55.289> anything<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:56.460> because

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
tree you can hit anything just because

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.459 
tree you can hit anything just because
you<00:00:56.760> don't<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> tire<00:00:57.360> does<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.140> mean<00:00:58.320> you
