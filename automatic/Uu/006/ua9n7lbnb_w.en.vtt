00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
the ice cream is now forming what looks

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.920 
the ice cream is now forming what looks
like<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.890> hand<00:01:57.160> or<00:01:57.340> fingers<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.060> it's<00:01:58.420> twisting

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930

like a hand or fingers and it's twisting
that's<00:01:59.350> showing<00:01:59.770> us<00:01:59.860> that<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.040> consistency

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
that's showing us that the consistency

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.800 
that's showing us that the consistency
is<00:02:00.670> just<00:02:00.700> about<00:02:01.000> right<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.330> ice<00:02:01.420> courses
