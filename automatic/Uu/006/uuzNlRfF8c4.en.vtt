for all your around so like I said for

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.479 
for all your around so like I said for
all<00:04:11.810> year<00:04:11.989> round<00:04:12.019> it's<00:04:12.440> important<00:04:12.859> to<00:04:12.920> use<00:04:13.070> SPF

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
all year round it's important to use SPF

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.550 
all year round it's important to use SPF
