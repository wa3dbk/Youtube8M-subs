okay today we are going to be doing the
flip<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.160> not<00:00:08.370> many<00:00:08.580> people<00:00:08.760> know<00:00:09.120> it's

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
flip that not many people know it's

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.450 
flip that not many people know it's
called<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.200> dolphin<00:00:10.620> flip<00:00:10.860> but<00:00:11.070> you'll<00:00:11.250> need

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
called the dolphin flip but you'll need

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.340 
called the dolphin flip but you'll need
to<00:00:11.519> know<00:00:11.880> how<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.570> kickflip<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.440> this

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
to know how to kickflip in this

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.140 
to know how to kickflip in this
yeah<00:00:16.350> just<00:00:16.500> kickflip<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.039> you'll<00:00:17.880> probably

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
yeah just kickflip and you'll probably

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.880 
yeah just kickflip and you'll probably
need<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.930> know<00:00:18.960> how<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.289> flip<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.680> board

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
need to know how to flip the board

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.009 
need to know how to flip the board
forward<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.789> um<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
forward like that so to do um to do a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.859 
forward like that so to do um to do a
dolphin<00:00:25.350> flip<00:00:26.240> you<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
dolphin flip you have to have the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.580 
dolphin flip you have to have the
regular<00:00:28.289> position<00:00:30.650> just<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:34.260> then

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
regular position just like that and then

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.690 
regular position just like that and then
so<00:00:37.590> you're<00:00:38.010> gonna<00:00:38.100> start<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.489> regular

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
so you're gonna start with regular

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.910 
so you're gonna start with regular
position<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.480> always<00:00:39.750> pull<00:00:40.050> back<00:00:40.290> before<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.800> do

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
position I always pull back before I do

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.740 
position I always pull back before I do
tricks<00:00:41.309> cuz<00:00:41.730> then<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.030> gives<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.420> enough

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
tricks cuz then it gives you enough

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.560 
tricks cuz then it gives you enough
height<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:43.860> what<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> want<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
height to do what you want to do so you

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.560 
height to do what you want to do so you
do<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.620> pull<00:00:46.950> back<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.270> comes

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
do that you pull back so that it comes

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.459 
do that you pull back so that it comes
up<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.930> your<00:00:49.079> fingers<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:52.230> you're

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
up on your fingers and so then you're

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.319 
up on your fingers and so then you're
gonna<00:00:52.620> bring<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.550> finger<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.059> you're<00:00:54.149> gonna

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
gonna bring this finger and you're gonna

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
gonna bring this finger and you're gonna
pull<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> forward<00:00:55.230> while<00:00:55.590> sliding<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
pull it forward while sliding off the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
pull it forward while sliding off the
edge<00:00:56.840> right<00:00:58.219> this<00:00:59.219> edge<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.230> at<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
edge right this edge right here at the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.880 
edge right this edge right here at the
same<00:01:01.590> time<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.100> that'll<00:01:02.309> cause<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
same time and that'll cause it to go a

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.670 
same time and that'll cause it to go a
flip<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.610> forward<00:01:06.500> that'll<00:01:07.500> look<00:01:07.590> like

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
flip and go forward that'll look like

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
flip and go forward that'll look like
this<00:01:11.150> sort<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:14.090> some<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
this sort of like that some of the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.749 
this sort of like that some of the
mistakes<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:16.140> see<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:17.070> people<00:01:17.280> who

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
mistakes I see there are people who

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.719 
mistakes I see there are people who
don't<00:01:18.509> actually<00:01:18.720> fly<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.560> they<00:01:20.310> don't

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
don't actually fly it up they don't

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
don't actually fly it up they don't
flick<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.659> they<00:01:22.560> flick<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
flick it up like that they flick it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.810 
flick it up like that they flick it
sideways<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.780> not<00:01:25.070> really<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.250> dolphin

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
sideways and that's not really a dolphin

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.460 
sideways and that's not really a dolphin
flip<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.210> that's<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:28.110> okay

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
flip because that's just a very okay

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
flip because that's just a very okay
varial<00:01:29.220> kickflip<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:29.909> nightmare<00:01:30.420> flip

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
varial kickflip or nightmare flip

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.210 
varial kickflip or nightmare flip
depending<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.200> how<00:01:31.350> many<00:01:31.409> kickflip<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.070> do

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
depending on how many kickflip see do

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.940 
depending on how many kickflip see do
some<00:01:33.210> other<00:01:33.570> people<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.290> try<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
some other people they try to do that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.590 
some other people they try to do that
and<00:01:35.659> they<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.689> end<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.170> doing<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.590> 360<00:01:38.220> flip

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
and they just end up doing a 360 flip

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.940 
and they just end up doing a 360 flip
and<00:01:40.700> yeah<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> other<00:01:43.619> things

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and yeah and some of the other things

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.889 
and yeah and some of the other things
when<00:01:44.189> people<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
when people do it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.590 
when people do it
you<00:01:46.290> got<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> half<00:01:48.180> flips

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you got to have one and a half flips

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.690 
you got to have one and a half flips
because<00:01:48.960> you're<00:01:49.290> spinning<00:01:49.560> from<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
because you're spinning from this to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.359 
because you're spinning from this to
this<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.439> do<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.619> flip<00:01:53.100> that's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
this so if you just do one flip that's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.520 
this so if you just do one flip that's
just<00:01:53.640> pretty<00:01:53.850> much<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> hard<00:01:54.390> flip<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
just pretty much a hard flip just a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.520 
just pretty much a hard flip just a
reversed<00:01:55.890> hard<00:01:56.159> flip<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> put<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
reversed hard flip so if you put one and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.580 
reversed hard flip so if you put one and
a<00:01:58.560> half<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:59.130> you'll<00:01:59.280> go<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.590> then

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
a half then you'll go like that and then

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.359 
a half then you'll go like that and then
land<00:02:01.829> down<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.640> that'll<00:02:03.329> look<00:02:03.509> cooler

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
land down on it and that'll look cooler

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.930 
land down on it and that'll look cooler
so<00:02:05.369> once<00:02:05.700> again<00:02:05.930> the
