00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180 

this<00:00:00.840> next<00:00:01.170> mission<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.589> probably<00:00:02.010> the

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
this next mission is probably the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.999 
this next mission is probably the
hardest<00:00:02.700> one<00:00:02.730> so<00:00:03.120> far<00:00:03.360> I<00:00:03.840> still<00:00:04.440> find<00:00:04.650> it<00:00:04.799> quite

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
hardest one so far I still find it quite

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.380 
hardest one so far I still find it quite
easy<00:00:05.069> but<00:00:05.640> that's<00:00:05.970> because<00:00:06.180> I've<00:00:06.359> been

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
easy but that's because I've been

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.020 
easy but that's because I've been
playing<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.899> campaign<00:00:07.109> mode<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:07.890> ages<00:00:08.280> for

playing the campaign mode for ages for
new<00:00:09.240> players<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:09.929> mission<00:00:10.320> actually<00:00:10.500> is

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
new players this mission actually is

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.880

exactly<00:00:20.660> it's<00:00:21.660> funny<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.230> flak<00:00:22.740> is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
exactly it's funny because flak is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.260 
exactly it's funny because flak is
stupid

/ I think it was penny and days of ruins

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:08.640 
/ I think it was penny and days of ruins
dollars<00:01:01.350> anyway<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:07.600> this<00:01:07.960> vision<00:01:08.290> is<00:01:08.440> one<00:01:08.590> of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
dollars anyway now this vision is one of

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.649 
dollars anyway now this vision is one of
the<00:01:08.710> ones<00:01:08.860> that<00:01:08.979> seems<00:01:09.370> very<00:01:09.520> daunting<00:01:10.330> at

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
the ones that seems very daunting at

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.289 
the ones that seems very daunting at
first<00:01:10.690> but<00:01:11.350> it's<00:01:11.799> not<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.430> bad<00:01:12.729> but<00:01:13.150> you've

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
first but it's not that bad but you've

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.810 
first but it's not that bad but you've
got<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.510> lot<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.229> take<00:01:14.710> in<00:01:14.770> really<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:17.080> basically

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
got a lot to take in really so basically

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.580 
got a lot to take in really so basically
yeah<00:01:18.820> there's<00:01:19.090> no<00:01:19.270> point<00:01:19.690> in<00:01:20.020> going<00:01:20.290> for<00:01:20.560> a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
yeah there's no point in going for a

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.140 
yeah there's no point in going for a
route<00:01:20.860> in<00:01:21.010> this<00:01:21.130> vision<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.430> have<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.940> capture

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
route in this vision you have to capture

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.190 
route in this vision you have to capture
the<00:01:22.330> headquarters<00:01:22.810> here<00:01:23.049> and<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.750> really<00:01:26.080> I

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
the headquarters here and so really I

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.320 
the headquarters here and so really I
consider<00:01:26.860> in<00:01:27.040> a<00:01:27.130> way<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:27.549> mission<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.299> be

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
consider in a way this mission to be

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.200 
consider in a way this mission to be
sort<00:01:28.750> of<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:29.020> summary<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:30.160> general<00:01:30.610> tactics

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
sort of a summary of the general tactics

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.210 
sort of a summary of the general tactics
you<00:01:31.480> want<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.780> be<00:01:31.840> using<00:01:32.140> your<00:01:32.230> Sammy<00:01:34.980> she<00:01:35.980> has

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
you want to be using your Sammy she has

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.690 
you want to be using your Sammy she has
good<00:01:36.640> movement<00:01:36.880> range<00:01:37.300> on<00:01:37.570> transports<00:01:38.350> and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
good capturing ability so basically it's

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.760

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.130 

yes<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.210> first<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> need<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.810> save<00:02:04.020> this

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.230 
yes I first you need to save this
transport<00:02:04.649> copter<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.909> don't<00:02:06.090> need

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
transport copter because you don't need

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.809 
transport copter because you don't need
transports<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.439> mission

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.369 

right<00:02:12.819> now<00:02:13.120> here<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.800> cruiser<00:02:16.200> right<00:02:17.200> now

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
right now here is a cruiser right now

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.350 
right now here is a cruiser right now
cruisers<00:02:17.860> are<00:02:17.950> extremely<00:02:18.580> specialized<00:02:19.120> they

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
cruisers are extremely specialized they

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.119 
cruisers are extremely specialized they
are<00:02:19.420> very<00:02:19.690> good<00:02:19.959> against<00:02:20.290> air<00:02:20.470> units<00:02:20.950> and

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
are very good against air units and

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.490 
are very good against air units and
submarines<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.030> because<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.080> they<00:02:23.470> are

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
submarines and because of that they are

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.259 
submarines and because of that they are
very<00:02:23.920> good<00:02:24.129> escorts<00:02:24.670> for<00:02:24.760> battleships

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
very good escorts for battleships

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.699 
very good escorts for battleships
because<00:02:25.629> of<00:02:25.720> course<00:02:25.959> battleships<00:02:26.560> are

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
because of course battleships are

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.280 
because of course battleships are
incredibly<00:02:27.220> weak<00:02:27.430> against<00:02:27.700> selves<00:02:28.290> other

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
incredibly weak against selves other

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.380 
incredibly weak against selves other
than<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.560> they<00:02:29.950> really<00:02:30.310> can't<00:02:30.610> do<00:02:30.819> much<00:02:31.000> I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
than that they really can't do much I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.360 
than that they really can't do much I
think<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.959> prefer<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.890> days<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.610> ruin<00:02:33.940> when<00:02:35.370> they

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
think I prefer in days of ruin when they

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.280 
think I prefer in days of ruin when they
made<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:36.910> cruisers<00:02:37.510> can<00:02:37.690> attack<00:02:38.019> all

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
made it so that cruisers can attack all

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.699 
made it so that cruisers can attack all
naval<00:02:38.680> units<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.910> not<00:02:40.660> as<00:02:40.810> powerfully<00:02:41.410> their

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
naval units but not as powerfully their

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.830 
naval units but not as powerfully their
best<00:02:41.980> against<00:02:42.250> subs<00:02:42.519> obviously<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:45.599> here<00:02:46.599> is

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
best against subs obviously and here is

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.880 
best against subs obviously and here is
a<00:02:46.870> submarine<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.650> our<00:02:47.769> own<00:02:49.590> yeah<00:02:50.590> basically

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
a submarine of our own yeah basically

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.190 
a submarine of our own yeah basically
subs<00:02:51.549> are<00:02:52.260> well<00:02:53.260> then<00:02:54.069> mainly<00:02:55.079> really<00:02:56.079> good

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
subs are well then mainly really good

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.809 
subs are well then mainly really good
against<00:02:56.470> battleships<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.190> aircraft

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
against battleships and aircraft

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.490 
against battleships and aircraft
carriers<00:02:58.180> but<00:02:58.690> they<00:02:58.840> don't<00:02:58.989> exist<00:02:59.200> in<00:02:59.380> this

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
carriers but they don't exist in this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.289 
carriers but they don't exist in this
game<00:02:59.709> so<00:03:00.040> there's<00:03:00.640> no<00:03:00.849> point<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.150> talking

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
game so there's no point in talking

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.660 
game so there's no point in talking
about<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:03.329> yes<00:03:04.360> subs<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.170> unique

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
about that yes subs have this unique

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.009 
about that yes subs have this unique
feature<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.970> they<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.269> dive<00:03:07.569> underwater

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
feature that they can dive underwater

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.830 
feature that they can dive underwater
and<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:09.340> basically<00:03:09.549> hides<00:03:10.209> them<00:03:10.480> from<00:03:10.510> all

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
and it basically hides them from all

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.690 
and it basically hides them from all
enemy<00:03:11.200> units<00:03:11.590> except<00:03:11.920> those<00:03:12.069> directly<00:03:12.459> next

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
enemy units except those directly next

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.509 
enemy units except those directly next
to<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.060> role<00:03:13.980> unfortunately<00:03:14.980> as<00:03:15.160> Neil

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
to the role unfortunately as Neil

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.129 
to the role unfortunately as Neil
explained<00:03:16.019> diving<00:03:17.019> subs<00:03:17.319> use<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:18.690> lot<00:03:19.690> of<00:03:19.720> fuels

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
explained diving subs use a lot of fuels

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.460 
explained diving subs use a lot of fuels
so<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.799> generally<00:03:21.730> only<00:03:22.420> worth<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.230> dive

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
so it's generally only worth it to dive

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.770 
so it's generally only worth it to dive
when<00:03:23.859> you<00:03:24.040> really<00:03:24.639> really<00:03:24.790> don't<00:03:25.480> want<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.690> be

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
when you really really don't want to be

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.110 
when you really really don't want to be
spotted<00:03:29.040> are<00:03:30.040> now<00:03:30.459> speaking<00:03:30.819> of<00:03:30.940> this

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
spotted are now speaking of this

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.830 
spotted are now speaking of this
battleship<00:03:31.600> while<00:03:31.989> Sammy's<00:03:32.650> direct<00:03:33.400> combat

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
battleship while Sammy's direct combat

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.479 
battleship while Sammy's direct combat
ground<00:03:34.840> units<00:03:36.180> are<00:03:37.180> weaker<00:03:38.170> than<00:03:38.290> normal<00:03:38.489> that

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
ground units are weaker than normal that

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.520 
ground units are weaker than normal that
doesn't<00:03:39.819> apply<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.120> our<00:03:40.389> indirect<00:03:40.900> units<00:03:41.260> or

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
doesn't apply to our indirect units or

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.520 
doesn't apply to our indirect units or
indirect<00:03:41.980> units<00:03:42.310> are<00:03:42.400> still<00:03:42.609> average<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:43.870> you

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
indirect units are still average so you

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.660 
indirect units are still average so you
want<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.769> make<00:03:44.889> good<00:03:45.069> use<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:45.310> them<00:03:45.549> when

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
want to make good use of them when

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.430 
want to make good use of them when
you're<00:03:45.819> playing<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.150> semi

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
you're playing a semi

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.960 
you're playing a semi
and<00:03:48.790> Landers<00:03:49.790> are<00:03:50.030> basically<00:03:51.970> transport

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
and Landers are basically transport

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.970 
and Landers are basically transport
ships<00:03:53.240> like<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.780> pcs<00:03:54.200> except<00:03:54.470> they<00:03:54.590> work<00:03:54.800> on

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
ships like a pcs except they work on

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.820 
ships like a pcs except they work on
seas<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.790> they<00:03:56.480> do<00:03:56.540> carry<00:03:56.960> two<00:03:57.320> units<00:03:57.680> at<00:03:57.800> once

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
seas and they do carry two units at once

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.660 
seas and they do carry two units at once
and<00:03:58.340> they<00:03:58.460> can<00:03:58.610> carry<00:03:58.880> anything<00:03:59.740> so<00:04:00.740> emissions

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
and they can carry anything so emissions

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.790 
and they can carry anything so emissions
with<00:04:01.790> sea<00:04:02.090> they're<00:04:02.450> extremely<00:04:03.170> useful<00:04:03.680> the

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
with sea they're extremely useful the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.170 
with sea they're extremely useful the
only<00:04:03.980> problem<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.400> they're<00:04:04.580> a<00:04:04.610> bit<00:04:04.850> expensive

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
only problem is they're a bit expensive

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.600 
only problem is they're a bit expensive
but<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:08.060> know<00:04:08.090> in<00:04:08.390> maps<00:04:08.690> that<00:04:09.280> have<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> lot<00:04:10.520> of

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
but you know in maps that have a lot of

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.250 
but you know in maps that have a lot of
sea<00:04:10.820> you<00:04:11.030> will<00:04:11.060> need<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.540> use<00:04:11.750> them<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:12.020> lot

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
sea you will need to use them a lot

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.810 
sea you will need to use them a lot
because<00:04:12.800> they're<00:04:13.070> your<00:04:13.190> only<00:04:13.490> way<00:04:13.670> of

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
because they're your only way of

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.020 
because they're your only way of
transporting<00:04:14.420> things<00:04:14.630> like<00:04:15.610> medium<00:04:16.610> tanks

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
transporting things like medium tanks

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.620 
transporting things like medium tanks
across<00:04:17.660> seas<00:04:18.519> now<00:04:19.519> it's<00:04:19.790> important<00:04:20.390> here<00:04:20.600> that

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
across seas now it's important here that

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.260 
across seas now it's important here that
you<00:04:20.810> don't<00:04:21.290> move<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:22.220> transport<00:04:22.880> until

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
you don't move the transport until

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.760 
you don't move the transport until
you've<00:04:23.480> shot<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.960> Rockets<00:04:24.380> with<00:04:24.530> your

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
you've shot the Rockets with your

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.480 
you've shot the Rockets with your
battleship<00:04:25.450> because<00:04:26.450> Rockets<00:04:27.290> are<00:04:27.500> very<00:04:28.130> very

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
battleship because Rockets are very very

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.870 
battleship because Rockets are very very
dangerous<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:29.060> naval<00:04:29.540> units<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.850> want<00:04:31.850> to

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
dangerous to naval units and want to

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.990 
dangerous to naval units and want to
load<00:04:32.030> up<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.300> APC<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.550> head<00:04:34.550> out<00:04:34.700> for<00:04:34.850> that

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
load up this APC and head out for that

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.230 
load up this APC and head out for that
face<00:04:35.240> even<00:04:35.870> though<00:04:36.820> we're<00:04:37.820> not<00:04:37.940> really<00:04:38.090> gonna

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
face even though we're not really gonna

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.820 
face even though we're not really gonna
actually<00:04:38.330> get<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:38.990> until<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.410> end<00:04:39.590> of<00:04:39.710> this

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
actually get it until the end of this

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.780 
actually get it until the end of this
mission

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.270 

well<00:04:46.420> it's<00:04:46.960> not<00:04:47.140> technically<00:04:47.770> true<00:04:47.920> that

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
well it's not technically true that

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.260 
well it's not technically true that
Rockets<00:04:48.610> are<00:04:48.730> just<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.940> more<00:04:49.090> powerful

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
Rockets are just a more powerful

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.370 
Rockets are just a more powerful
artillery<00:04:50.370> Rockets<00:04:51.370> are<00:04:51.660> very<00:04:52.660> powerful<00:04:52.930> and

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
artillery Rockets are very powerful and

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.740 
artillery Rockets are very powerful and
effective<00:04:53.890> against<00:04:54.670> almost<00:04:55.060> all<00:04:55.300> types<00:04:55.540> of

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
effective against almost all types of

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.600 
effective against almost all types of
units<00:04:56.080> they're<00:04:56.470> even<00:04:56.740> really<00:04:57.010> good<00:04:57.160> on<00:04:57.250> naval

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
units they're even really good on naval

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.550 
units they're even really good on naval
units<00:04:57.940> so<00:04:58.150> they're<00:04:58.390> a<00:04:58.420> good<00:04:58.630> defense<00:04:59.110> against

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
units so they're a good defense against

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.620 
units so they're a good defense against
SI<00:05:00.070> units<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:02.670> here<00:05:03.670> Lash<00:05:03.940> explains<00:05:04.420> that

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
SI units and here Lash explains that

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.940 
SI units and here Lash explains that
basically<00:05:04.930> this<00:05:05.140> mission<00:05:05.440> is<00:05:05.530> on<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.650> time

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
basically this mission is on a time

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.660 
basically this mission is on a time
limit<00:05:06.300> but<00:05:07.300> yeah<00:05:08.290> you<00:05:08.350> would<00:05:08.770> capture<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.280> HQ

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
limit but yeah you would capture the HQ

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.750 
limit but yeah you would capture the HQ
by<00:05:09.790> day<00:05:09.850> seven<00:05:10.300> anyway<00:05:10.600> so<00:05:11.490> Sammy's<00:05:12.490> good<00:05:12.670> at

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
by day seven anyway so Sammy's good at

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.130 
by day seven anyway so Sammy's good at
finishing<00:05:13.060> missions<00:05:13.360> quickly<00:05:13.690> so<00:05:13.840> it<00:05:13.930> doesn't

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
finishing missions quickly so it doesn't

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.170 
finishing missions quickly so it doesn't
really<00:05:14.200> matter<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.560> much<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:17.040> course<00:05:18.180> new

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
really matter that much of course new

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.030 
really matter that much of course new
players<00:05:19.510> have<00:05:19.840> a<00:05:19.870> tendency<00:05:20.290> to<00:05:20.320> panic<00:05:20.800> here

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
players have a tendency to panic here

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.650 
players have a tendency to panic here
once<00:05:21.550> they<00:05:21.700> find<00:05:21.970> out<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.300> these<00:05:22.450> missions

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
once they find out that these missions

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.440 
once they find out that these missions
times<00:05:23.200> but<00:05:23.980> it's<00:05:24.400> not<00:05:24.730> that<00:05:24.880> much<00:05:25.060> of<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.270> big

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
times but it's not that much of a big

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.080 
times but it's not that much of a big
deal<00:05:25.480> I<00:05:28.260> know<00:05:29.260> I<00:05:29.410> panicked<00:05:29.950> well<00:05:30.100> I<00:05:30.130> found<00:05:30.970> out

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
deal I know I panicked well I found out

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.430 
deal I know I panicked well I found out
about<00:05:31.180> that<00:05:31.510> when<00:05:31.660> I<00:05:31.690> first<00:05:31.990> played<00:05:32.200> this<00:05:32.260> game

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
about that when I first played this game

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.790 
about that when I first played this game
and<00:05:33.570> as<00:05:34.570> Nell<00:05:34.810> said<00:05:34.990> at<00:05:35.110> the<00:05:35.170> beginning<00:05:35.290> it's

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
and as Nell said at the beginning it's

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.960 
and as Nell said at the beginning it's
hard<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:37.980> keep<00:05:38.980> that<00:05:39.190> base<00:05:39.400> away<00:05:39.700> from<00:05:39.880> the

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
hard to keep that base away from the

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.460 
hard to keep that base away from the
enemy<00:05:40.270> but<00:05:41.230> you<00:05:41.440> can<00:05:42.210> rush<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:43.480> and<00:05:43.840> hope<00:05:44.320> that

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
enemy but you can rush it and hope that

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.780 
enemy but you can rush it and hope that
doesn't<00:05:44.710> come<00:05:44.740> much<00:05:45.130> of<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.310> problem<00:05:46.740> and

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
doesn't come much of the problem and

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.570 
doesn't come much of the problem and
what<00:05:48.790> I<00:05:48.820> was<00:05:48.970> saying<00:05:49.180> about<00:05:49.240> rocket<00:05:49.840> units<00:05:50.580> is

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
what I was saying about rocket units is

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.760 
what I was saying about rocket units is
even<00:05:52.360> though<00:05:52.570> they<00:05:52.780> are<00:05:52.960> drove<00:05:53.230> how<00:05:53.440> they<00:05:53.710> do

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
even though they are drove how they do

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.430 
even though they are drove how they do
have<00:05:54.010> one<00:05:54.280> serious<00:05:54.700> weakness<00:05:55.330> their<00:05:55.900> movement

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
have one serious weakness their movement

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.400 
have one serious weakness their movement
tie<00:05:56.650> these<00:05:56.860> tires<00:05:57.340> rather<00:05:57.940> than<00:05:58.180> trends<00:05:58.750> that

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
tie these tires rather than trends that

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.950 
tie these tires rather than trends that
means<00:05:59.650> that<00:05:59.830> they're<00:06:00.010> pretty<00:06:00.790> much<00:06:00.970> massively

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
means that they're pretty much massively

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.780 
means that they're pretty much massively
slowed<00:06:02.470> down<00:06:02.770> on<00:06:03.040> any<00:06:03.340> terrain

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
slowed down on any terrain

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.420 
slowed down on any terrain
other<00:06:04.030> than<00:06:04.210> roads<00:06:04.770> so<00:06:05.770> that's<00:06:06.070> something<00:06:06.280> you

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
other than roads so that's something you

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.460 
other than roads so that's something you
really<00:06:06.730> need<00:06:06.760> to<00:06:06.940> watch<00:06:07.090> out<00:06:07.330> for<00:06:07.570> in<00:06:07.840> map<00:06:08.230> with

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
really need to watch out for in map with

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.060 
really need to watch out for in map with
lots<00:06:08.710> of<00:06:08.830> forests<00:06:09.400> or<00:06:10.170> even<00:06:11.170> just<00:06:11.350> planes

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.720 

they're<00:06:15.640> very<00:06:15.910> very<00:06:16.150> hard<00:06:16.480> to<00:06:16.630> move<00:06:16.750> around<00:06:17.730> so

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
they're very very hard to move around so

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.780 
they're very very hard to move around so
artillery<00:06:19.360> have<00:06:19.570> more<00:06:19.780> mobility<00:06:20.430> now<00:06:21.430> yet

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
artillery have more mobility now yet

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.490 
artillery have more mobility now yet
look<00:06:21.880> at<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:22.060> sub<00:06:23.250> and<00:06:24.930> I<00:06:25.930> think<00:06:26.200> it's<00:06:26.290> worth

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
look at that sub and I think it's worth

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.800 
look at that sub and I think it's worth
it<00:06:26.680> just<00:06:26.710> to<00:06:26.890> finish<00:06:27.100> off<00:06:27.340> that<00:06:27.630> rocket<00:06:28.630> so<00:06:28.750> I

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
it just to finish off that rocket so I

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.180 
it just to finish off that rocket so I
can<00:06:28.960> just<00:06:29.110> remove<00:06:29.320> my<00:06:29.500> battleship<00:06:29.920> into<00:06:30.160> a

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
can just remove my battleship into a

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.450 
can just remove my battleship into a
better<00:06:30.670> position<00:06:30.820> that<00:06:31.780> Cruiser

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
better position that Cruiser

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.540 
better position that Cruiser
since<00:06:33.460> this<00:06:33.720> starters<00:06:34.720> out<00:06:35.080> of<00:06:35.710> the<00:06:35.770> way<00:06:35.950> near

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
our headquarters that cruise is not

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.020 
our headquarters that cruise is not

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
going to pose a threat to us so we can

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.550 
going to pose a threat to us so we can
