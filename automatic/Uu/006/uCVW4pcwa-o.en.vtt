 It is Romoto of Hello camera resale consultant 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.880
 This time is it 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:25.310
 I have purchased real stores, so I would like to announce the results 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:28.849
 It is said that it is a real store , it is a familiar store for everyone 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.430
 I think there is a shop that works book 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:36.610
 I made a junk corner there for this time 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.090
 It is a book off near my home though 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:45.050
 You're going there regularly . 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:48.800
 I got a regular article in the price of junk 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.450
 Well here it is, but yes of Canon 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.440
 70210 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:01:00.990
 Though my father is 3.54.5 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:05.850
 Here is a regular product with Yahoo! Auction to sell a 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.780
 Put sell a little higher if sweet in it I sell for about Â¥ 671,000 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.220
 Though it is a lens 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:18.400
 This lens was put for 2000 yen 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.120
 Sometimes though I was put in that status product I'm going to always book off 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.250
 is not it 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:30.550
 Camera for checking the operation Well Nikon camera and Canon camera 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.030
 I took two, and it is from the other end of the lens actually put in the junk corner 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.240
 Ne 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.100
 Operation check doing 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.870
 But then that's why it's bagged 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.880
 The present condition delivery and the poster were stuck 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.760
 Of course saying to the clerk, I'm out of hard work and let me check the operation a little 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.970
 It is was a hope in the fact that say please 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.420
 Well it worked fine 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.290
 The auto focus also moved completely 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.440
 There is also a focus on it, and if the photo was taken beautifully 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:07.470
 And it is the lens line was quite beautiful 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:10.530
 Well state in which the dust I had entered Chapter later but went with cloudy Toka fungus was no 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.960
 It was quite clear 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.700
 a 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:21.340
 And if there is only one problem, it is this plastic part 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.240
 The Fu that wonder if there has been some difficulty a place called they've This contains some scratches 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 think 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.220
 It is relatively relatively overall but this is a good item class. 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.950
 It is not a product like 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.020
 usually 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:42.140
 It is appearance of level that there is no problem at all even if we put as genuine 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:44.390
 So if it is acceptable to accept this wound normally, I think it will sell relatively high 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.730
 I think so 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:53.690
 Well speaking of the junk corner, basically it's even if the lens cost is already overcast in the cloudy sky 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:59.000
 It is something that is quite cloudy, and there are many such things 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:03.140
 Is quite the Tteyuu But yeah or Oh Aa' it is if things went the other way 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.380

 If you look for something like a lens or something like this 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.370
 I Well, even this because you have fallen treasure like a rats 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.790
 Advertised in the usual way 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:32.049
 If it sells with 6000 or 7000 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:38.859
 It is a product that can make a profit for about 4 years, so this is something like 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:39.879
 One of the suppliers also because going to find I am carrying a foot to the Well diligently towards the shops
