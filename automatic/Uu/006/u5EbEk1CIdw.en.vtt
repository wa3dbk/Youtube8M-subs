00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.479

 a small onion 70 grams of butter and a small piece of cinnamon + 4 5 nails 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.130
 we are preparing the preparation of pilaf rice 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.740
 the first thing to do is certainly to rinse in cold water and 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.050
 basmati rice after which you will make it drain 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.820
 to make it dry 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.600
 in this pot I put the butter and I melted it now I add the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.420
 onion 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.990
 and let it dry over low heat 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.990
 to what extent it does not become transparent 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.950
 there is 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.229
 after about 15 minutes the onion will have become perfectly transparent 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.020
 then add the cinnamon 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.700
 the cloves 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.120
 finally rice 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 dick 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.620
 we mix we are well poinx korn so that it is time. from the glass 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.240
 after that 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.950
 we could add 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.690
 the broth all over 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
 until covering it 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:25.739
 now all we have to do is cover with an airtight lid 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:32.389
 and let the rice cook for at least 18 20 minutes per face this point should not 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:34.779
 never to be touched ever mixed 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:40.129
 we should just check maybe after 15 16 minutes if there is still no 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.419
 liquid 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:45.079
 for the rest let's cook this cooking calmly 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.629
 come as well as prepare it on the fire of the stove even in the oven 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.559
 in the same identical way, then close the container asking for mercy. 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:59.879
 chosen and put it in the oven ahahah 170 degrees for about 18 20 minutes depending on the 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.879
 face you have. chosen 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.769
 after about 18 minutes our pilaf and cooked rice is a basic recipe 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.569
 de riso pilaf because there are many variations that they use for 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.210
 example of themselves and how saffron curcuma 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.310

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.029

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.719
 to the amount of rice 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:41.219
 engineer you have to take the rice put it in a graduated container a 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.220
 than to see what its volume is 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.259
 the water will be double the volume of rice + one fifth 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.259
 having said that for rice the pilot we really know 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.329
