00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
she turns around to walk here you can

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.479 
she turns around to walk here you can
see<00:02:25.930> how<00:02:26.080> she<00:02:26.140> has<00:02:26.410> more<00:02:26.650> rotation<00:02:27.280> through

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
hip and she's shifting a lot better here

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.520 
hip and she's shifting a lot better here
so<00:02:52.540> we're<00:02:52.660> going<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:52.900> Josie<00:02:53.319> keep

walking and we'll come back here and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.770 
walking and we'll come back here and
show<00:02:55.569> you<00:02:55.630> her<00:02:55.900> test<00:02:56.230> I<00:03:00.510> will<00:03:01.510> do<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.750> same

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
show you her test I will do the same

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.960 
show you her test I will do the same
three<00:03:02.260> tests<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.709> did<00:03:03.010> before<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.489> see<00:03:03.819> how

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
three tests so we did before and see how

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.160 
three tests so we did before and see how
this<00:03:04.150> will<00:03:04.360> get<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.690> higher<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.810> will<00:03:07.989> lay<00:03:08.140> down

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
this will get up higher it will lay down

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.509 
this will get up higher it will lay down
here<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:08.799> her<00:03:08.980> back<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:14.769> left<00:03:15.100> hip<00:03:15.340> will

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
here on her back and this left hip will

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.020 
here on her back and this left hip will
come<00:03:15.730> up<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:16.090> lot<00:03:16.480> higher<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:18.459> she'll<00:03:18.670> be<00:03:18.820> more

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
come up a lot higher so she'll be more

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.560 
come up a lot higher so she'll be more
balanced<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:21.190> Josie<00:03:21.609> layover<00:03:21.940> for<00:03:22.180> me<00:03:22.299> on<00:03:22.390> to

at the foundation you look at the 21-30
you<00:04:00.310> can<00:04:00.580> see<00:04:00.850> how<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.150> foundation<00:04:01.989> comes<00:04:02.230> up

you can see how the foundation comes up

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.370 
you can see how the foundation comes up
and<00:04:02.709> is<00:04:02.830> more<00:04:03.130> narrow<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.970> support<00:04:04.540> her<00:04:05.110> left
