that<00:00:12.809> I'm<00:00:12.990> going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> run<00:00:13.349> through<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.299> also

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
that I'm going to run through and also

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.290 
that I'm going to run through and also
just<00:00:15.480> basic<00:00:15.960> fabric<00:00:16.170> tests<00:00:16.619> I've<00:00:16.859> got<00:00:17.300> four

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
just basic fabric tests I've got four

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880 
just basic fabric tests I've got four
layers<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.750> denim<00:00:18.930> they<00:00:19.500> were<00:00:19.560> already

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
layers of denim they were already

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.519 
layers of denim they were already
stitched<00:00:20.100> once<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:20.550> photo<00:00:20.789> used<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> edge

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
stitched once for photo used in the edge

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.950 
stitched once for photo used in the edge
and<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:23.010> layers<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.760> heavier<00:00:24.420> denim<00:00:24.779> but

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
and for layers it's a heavier denim but

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.750 
and for layers it's a heavier denim but
it's<00:00:25.080> about<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.650> max<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.189> fit<00:00:26.400> under<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
it's about the max you can fit under the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000 
it's about the max you can fit under the
foot<00:00:27.260> you<00:00:28.260> might<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.529> able<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> with

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
foot you might be able to get it with

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.060 
foot you might be able to get it with
five<00:00:29.340> layers<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.170> now<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.650> while<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
five layers and now just a while the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.959 
five layers and now just a while the
machine<00:00:32.369> runs<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:37.350> foot<00:00:37.620> pedal<00:00:37.920> has<00:00:38.070> slow<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
machine runs the foot pedal has slow and

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.150 
machine runs the foot pedal has slow and
fast<00:00:39.210> speed<00:00:40.020> selects<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.920> I'm<00:00:40.980> running

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
fast speed selects on it and I'm running

00:00:41.160 --> 00:01:01.360 
fast speed selects on it and I'm running
in<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> fast<00:00:42.690> mode

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.590 

and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.640> got<00:01:02.790> an<00:01:02.910> equal<00:01:03.120> stitch<00:01:03.360> on

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and then it's got an equal stitch on

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
and then it's got an equal stitch on
both<00:01:03.810> sides<00:01:04.730> next<00:01:05.730> I'm<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:07.520> run<00:01:08.520> through

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
both sides next I'm going to run through

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:45.990 
both sides next I'm going to run through
these<00:01:08.880> patterns<00:01:12.110> first<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:15.660> zigzag

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.880 

there's<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.060> variation<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:52.299> like<00:01:53.299> sickle<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
there's a variation of like sickle the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.529 
there's a variation of like sickle the
Chi<00:01:55.159> variation<00:01:55.670> Devon<00:01:56.000> I'll<00:01:56.090> do<00:01:56.210> them<00:01:56.390> one

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
Chi variation Devon I'll do them one

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:43.789 
Chi variation Devon I'll do them one
after<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.840> other

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:03:15.100 

next<00:02:44.799> is<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:46.920> sine-wave

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:44.540 

and<00:03:16.110> there's<00:03:16.500> blind<00:03:16.830> stitch

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.620 

now<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.610> multi<00:03:46.060> stitch<00:03:48.209> which<00:03:49.209> is<00:03:49.240> sort<00:03:49.569> of

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
now the multi stitch which is sort of

00:03:49.630 --> 00:04:15.530 
now the multi stitch which is sort of
like<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.840> zig<00:03:50.140> zag<00:03:50.170> but<00:04:07.500> now<00:04:08.500> do<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.950> next<00:04:09.250> three

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:05:23.890 

these<00:04:16.540> are<00:04:16.720> some<00:04:18.660> just<00:04:19.660> design<00:04:20.109> patterns

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:06:11.190 

you

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.610 

yeah<00:06:12.200> one<00:06:12.440> final<00:06:12.680> patter<00:06:13.070> I<00:06:14.500> thought<00:06:15.500> I'll

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
yeah one final patter I thought I'll

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.620 
yeah one final patter I thought I'll
show<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:15.830> picture<00:06:16.070> of<00:06:16.250> these<00:06:16.430> close<00:06:17.090> up<00:06:17.330> in<00:06:17.480> the

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
show a picture of these close up in the

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:33.860 
show a picture of these close up in the
air

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.170 

there<00:06:34.870> you<00:06:34.960> have<00:06:35.140> it
