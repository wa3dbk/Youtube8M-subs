 I'll do it right now 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.750
 never seen the video i think so 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.980
 will the stand be normal dvd how to 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.980
 it actually already knows from the wii 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.170
 directly on how to naturally the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.239
 Free coming terno very clear 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.129
 comdirect open up all the benefits yet 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.969
 times written 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.420
 of course always very cool 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.190
 of course you have the disc 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.930
 These super mario brothers you honest 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.579
 said of all states title is that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.700
 really the best thing to do here 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.870
 I can find personally and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.449
 I am really great 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.890
 very curious 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.420
 nevertheless that was that is that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.800
 description what we have there at the moment 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.030
 I have to own my first time shortly 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.989
 let's see what the small map fact 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.119
 that you could even get info 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.520
 you accept it because you have it so small 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.290
 world map is that that's cool 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.170
 antenna is really always something 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.479
 New is simply that is really great 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 Everything is described only when you control 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.290
 I think it's even that 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.490
 description would you be like card.de 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.680
 not spent because she might 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 not worth describing that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.820
 maybe a new kind of description 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.619
 to make small card holders 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.680
 at least in colors really great 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.299
 that really transforms the hammer 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 Gamepad control the wii control 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.600
 really very short time are six 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.600
 million 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.670
 but of course the safety instructions 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.930
 this nature is very important by 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.700
 the game could have exploded yes 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.570
 very clear 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.100
 So everything was written here 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:59.150
 Nobody reads blablabla anyway 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:01.190
 Okay, we have everything together again 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.690

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.640

 will be the absolute best 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.050
 that would have kuhn extremely extreme 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.730
 so be funny in any case 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.320

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.340
