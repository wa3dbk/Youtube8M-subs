00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.150 
know you're going to get that wanted
level<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.980> can

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
level so you know that you can

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.279 
level so you know that you can
immediately<00:00:53.430> avoid<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:54.420> using<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.899> mask

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
immediately avoid it by using this mask

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.350

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
work is you robbed a store with a mask

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
on and then you take it off now that's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.609 
on and then you take it off now that's
the<00:02:02.969> way<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.930> supposed<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.439> work

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the way it actually is supposed to work

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
determined that this is totally a glitch

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.449 
determined that this is totally a glitch
like<00:03:12.840> Rockstar<00:03:13.319> needs<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.709> fix<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.189> that's

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
like Rockstar needs to fix this that's

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.459 
like Rockstar needs to fix this that's
not<00:03:14.549> how<00:03:14.879> it<00:03:15.060> should<00:03:15.269> be<00:03:15.419> working<00:03:15.689> however

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
not how it should be working however

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.289 
not how it should be working however
there's<00:03:16.739> still<00:03:16.859> a<00:03:17.010> temporary<00:03:17.489> workaround<00:03:18.090> if

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
there's still a temporary workaround if

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.879 
there's still a temporary workaround if
you<00:03:18.449> find<00:03:18.690> yourself<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:19.229> this<00:03:19.349> kind<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.680> glitch

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
you find yourself in this kind of glitch

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.979 
you find yourself in this kind of glitch
all<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.579> need<00:03:20.729> to<00:03:20.849> do<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.239> go<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.750> mask

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
all you need to do is go to the mask

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.740 
all you need to do is go to the mask
store<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.769> then<00:03:22.949> pick<00:03:23.549> no<00:03:23.909> masks<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.389> guess<00:03:24.599> you

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
store and then pick no masks I guess you

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.539 
store and then pick no masks I guess you
could<00:03:24.930> go<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.139> your<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.769> know<00:03:25.799> apartment<00:03:26.459> or

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
could go to your you know apartment or

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.069 
could go to your you know apartment or
whatever<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:27.000> take<00:03:27.150> off<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.449> mask<00:03:27.659> as<00:03:27.870> well

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
whatever and take off the mask as well

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.960 
whatever and take off the mask as well
but<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.859> can't<00:03:29.129> just<00:03:29.340> take<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.519> off<00:03:29.699> from<00:03:29.879> your

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
but you can't just take it off from your

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.699 
but you can't just take it off from your
inventory<00:03:30.239> system<00:03:30.840> if<00:03:31.019> your<00:03:31.229> game<00:03:31.349> is<00:03:31.379> working

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
inventory system if your game is working

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.679 
inventory system if your game is working
properly<00:03:31.859> obviously<00:03:32.579> it'll<00:03:32.790> let<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:33.449> if

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
properly obviously it'll let you but if

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.619

evidence<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:59.009> the<00:03:59.129> other<00:03:59.280> way<00:03:59.549> working<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.269> I

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
evidence of the other way working so I

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.849 
evidence of the other way working so I
just<00:04:00.449> want<00:04:00.629> to<00:04:00.689> show<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.870> guys<00:04:00.930> another<00:04:01.409> way

just want to show you guys another way

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.219 
just want to show you guys another way
for<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> work<00:04:02.579> but<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.269> traditional<00:04:03.989> way<00:04:04.199> I

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
for it to work but the traditional way I

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.890 
for it to work but the traditional way I
would<00:04:04.739> say<00:04:04.979> robbing<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.609> store<00:04:05.669> is<00:04:06.180> robbing<00:04:06.810> it

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
would say robbing a store is robbing it

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.749 
would say robbing a store is robbing it
with<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.109> mask<00:04:07.409> and<00:04:07.680> then<00:04:07.739> taking<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.220> mask<00:04:08.489> off

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:08.759 
with a mask and then taking the mask off

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.640 
with a mask and then taking the mask off
but<00:04:09.540> again<00:04:09.629> I<00:04:09.930> showed<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.229> guys<00:04:10.259> another<00:04:10.560> way
