question<00:01:28.140> right<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.530> don't<00:01:29.220> play<00:01:29.430> an<00:01:29.549> MMO

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
question right now I don't play an MMO

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.569 
question right now I don't play an MMO
Jane<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.150> used<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.509> go<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.720> MLG<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.350> back<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
Jane I used to go in MLG on back in the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.819 
Jane I used to go in MLG on back in the
halo<00:01:32.880> days<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.329> now<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.380> fell<00:01:34.590> off<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
halo days but now I it fell off the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.770 
halo days but now I it fell off the
circuit<00:01:35.040> basically<00:01:35.310> once<00:01:35.729> halo<00:01:36.210> reach<00:01:36.479> came

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
circuit basically once halo reach came

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.469 
circuit basically once halo reach came
out<00:01:37.159> but<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.549> halo<00:01:38.670> 4<00:01:38.909> never<00:01:39.090> got<00:01:39.270> picked

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
out but and then halo 4 never got picked

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.020 
out but and then halo 4 never got picked
up<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:39.900> anyways<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.799> with<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> rest<00:01:41.729> the

super combos from other people the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.280 
super combos from other people the
biggest<00:01:48.210> thing<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.600> want<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.229> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
became so good at FPS mostly call of

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.260 
became so good at FPS mostly call of
duty<00:01:51.720> ok<00:01:52.549> I'm<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> answer<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
duty ok I'm just going to answer all the

duty ok I'm just going to answer all the
questions<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.750> go<00:01:54.869> along<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.170> uh<00:01:55.219> the<00:01:56.219> way

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
questions as you go along so uh the way

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.920 
questions as you go along so uh the way
you<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.090> at<00:01:57.149> call<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.600> duty<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you get really good at call of duty is

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.420 
you get really good at call of duty is
honestly<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.560> by<00:01:58.770> playing<00:01:59.040> call<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.310> duty

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
honestly not by playing call of duty

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.300 
honestly not by playing call of duty
call<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.909> duty<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> very<00:02:00.869> good

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
call of duty is not a very good

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.230 
call of duty is not a very good
competitive<00:02:02.310> game<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.880> sense<00:02:03.090> where

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
competitive game in the sense where

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.940 
competitive game in the sense where
you're<00:02:03.360> illuminating<00:02:03.630> how<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> shoot<00:02:04.350> call<00:02:04.829> of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you're illuminating how to shoot call of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.889 
you're illuminating how to shoot call of
duty<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.250> more<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:05.820> all<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.719> all

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
duty is more about all all it's all

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
duty is more about all all it's all
about<00:02:07.110> positioning<00:02:07.350> spawns<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.399> rotations

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
about positioning spawns and rotations

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.999 
about positioning spawns and rotations
it<00:02:09.119> has<00:02:09.270> nothing<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.500> gunfights

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
it has nothing to do with gunfights

it has nothing to do with gunfights
gunfights<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.520> call<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.819> duty<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.660> generally

gunfights and call of duty you generally

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
gunfights and call of duty you generally
don't<00:02:13.349> want<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.620> take

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
don't want to take

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
they can only see you in like one but as

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.130 
they can only see you in like one but as
far<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:23.790> getting<00:02:23.910> good<00:02:24.150> at<00:02:24.210> kaldi<00:02:24.570> i<00:02:24.600> recommend

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
far as getting good at kaldi i recommend

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.830 
far as getting good at kaldi i recommend
probably<00:02:25.680> playing<00:02:25.920> halo<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.550> learn<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:27.030> little

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
probably playing halo to learn a little

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.690 
probably playing halo to learn a little
bit<00:02:27.960> about<00:02:28.320> like<00:02:28.560> spawns<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.370> was<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> much

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
bit about like spawns it was a much

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.280 
bit about like spawns it was a much
better<00:02:29.970> game<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.330> learn<00:02:30.480> about<00:02:30.630> spawns<00:02:31.110> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
better game to learn about spawns and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.960 
better game to learn about spawns and
stuff<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:31.710> I'd<00:02:32.400> say<00:02:32.640> if<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.760> play

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
stuff but I'd say if you play

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.580 
stuff but I'd say if you play
counter-strike<00:02:33.300> that's<00:02:33.990> also<00:02:34.260> another<00:02:34.350> good

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
counter-strike that's also another good

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.350 
counter-strike that's also another good
game<00:02:34.770> kind<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.370> learned<00:02:35.520> but<00:02:35.730> kind<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.090> truck<00:02:36.240> I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
game kind of learned but kind of truck I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.480 
game kind of learned but kind of truck I
know<00:02:36.530> spawns<00:02:37.530> there's<00:02:38.010> only<00:02:38.160> really<00:02:38.340> one

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
know spawns there's only really one

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.040 
know spawns there's only really one
spawn<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.270> game<00:02:39.420> there's<00:02:39.600> no<00:02:39.630> response

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
spawn in that game there's no response

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.480 
spawn in that game there's no response
in<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.470> guess<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:40.980> could<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.400> could

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
in that I guess you could you could

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.040 
in that I guess you could you could
tackle<00:02:41.700> elearn<00:02:41.970> ecology<00:02:42.390> from<00:02:42.630> playing<00:02:42.870> call

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
tackle elearn ecology from playing call

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.750 
tackle elearn ecology from playing call
of<00:02:43.080> duty<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.650> if<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.830> go<00:02:43.980> from<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.400> Halo<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
of duty but if you go from like Halo and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.130 
of duty but if you go from like Halo and
you're<00:02:44.940> really<00:02:45.120> good<00:02:45.209> at<00:02:45.240> halo<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.780> call<00:02:46.050> of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
you're really good at halo to call of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.320 
you're really good at halo to call of
duty<00:02:46.320> it'll<00:02:46.740> transition<00:02:47.250> much<00:02:47.430> better<00:02:47.670> but
