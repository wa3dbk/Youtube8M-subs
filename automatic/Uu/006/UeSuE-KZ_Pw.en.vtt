00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
specification it may be a little bit

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.130

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
shouldn't be too hard to make it through

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.490 
shouldn't be too hard to make it through
anyways

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.470 

now<00:01:18.130> that<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:18.430> have<00:01:18.460> killed<00:01:18.730> all<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.240> trash

now that you have killed all the trash
mobs<00:01:19.780> it's<00:01:20.200> time<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.560> go<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.860> first<00:01:21.190> boss

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550
