all<00:02:29.120> right<00:02:29.450> we've<00:02:29.659> got<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:30.080> phone<00:02:30.290> booted<00:02:30.680> up

all right we've got the phone booted up
now<00:02:31.159> and<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:32.000> let's<00:02:32.209> just<00:02:32.450> dive<00:02:32.750> right<00:02:33.019> into

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
now and so let's just dive right into

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.740 
now and so let's just dive right into
the<00:02:33.530> software<00:02:34.060> you'll<00:02:35.060> notice<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.480> we<00:02:35.599> are

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
the software you'll notice that we are

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.490 
the software you'll notice that we are
running<00:02:35.870> cents

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
running cents

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.559 
running cents
this<00:02:37.159> is<00:02:37.340> Sense<00:02:37.610> 3.0<00:02:38.269> not<00:02:38.540> cents<00:02:38.870> 3.5<00:02:40.569> and

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
this is Sense 3.0 not cents 3.5 and

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.949 
this is Sense 3.0 not cents 3.5 and
let's<00:02:42.019> see<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:43.129> runs<00:02:43.489> pretty<00:02:43.760> well<00:02:43.879> if<00:02:44.450> it

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
let's see it runs pretty well if it

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.539 
let's see it runs pretty well if it
would<00:02:45.110> stop<00:02:45.470> lagging<00:02:45.739> terrible<00:02:46.579> example<00:02:48.549> ya

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
would stop lagging terrible example ya

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.970 
would stop lagging terrible example ya
see<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:50.030> carousel<00:02:50.450> runs<00:02:50.690> pretty<00:02:50.870> well<00:02:50.989> which

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
see the carousel runs pretty well which

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.970 
see the carousel runs pretty well which
is<00:02:52.129> really<00:02:52.340> not<00:02:52.879> terrible<00:02:53.360> for<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:54.310> single<00:02:55.310> core

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
is really not terrible for a single core

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.390 
is really not terrible for a single core

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.979 
mistaken we're running Android 2.3.4
let's<00:03:07.280> double<00:03:07.670> check<00:03:07.909> that<00:03:07.940> yep<00:03:08.420> two<00:03:08.780> point

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
let's double check that yep two point

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.819 
let's double check that yep two point
three<00:03:09.049> point<00:03:09.230> four<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.709> since<00:03:10.010> 3.0<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.709> is

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
three point four and since 3.0 and it is

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.490 
three point four and since 3.0 and it is
basically<00:03:13.370> just<00:03:13.489> like<00:03:14.389> you<00:03:14.870> would<00:03:14.989> expect<00:03:15.079> if

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
basically just like you would expect if

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.879 
basically just like you would expect if
you've<00:03:15.680> used<00:03:15.889> any<00:03:16.220> other<00:03:16.310> sense<00:03:16.819> 3.0<00:03:17.299> devices
