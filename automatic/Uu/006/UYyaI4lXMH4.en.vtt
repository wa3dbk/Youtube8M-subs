00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:15.740
 hi guys it's me 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:21.980
 I hardly know if we say successful 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:27.260
 to see myself recognized, I emerge from the darkness 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:32.759
 like a creature of the night I'm here 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.260
 practically above all to explain you 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.750
 a little bit my situation here now 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 for example you won't see me at all 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.850
 but normal because night from the center of the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.010
 my very little country now I should 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.700
 pass in an area that enjoys the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 public lighting and look at how 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.859
 resurface from darkness and nothing 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.730
 I practically take a chance 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.799
 in this moment to speak to you 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.540
 then as you knew there was a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.299
 period in which I was totally 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.380
 absent every day at all hours 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.479
 of night and morning due 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 practically a course I had 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.659
 at the university he spoke and now then 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.060
 instead there was a very bad time 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.430
 because our school spa quarter 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.350
 beta mestre where practically after a 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.720
 month of explanations of January a 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.360
 February we started with 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.310
 the question to the cue is finally 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.700
 arrived for me this week a 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.020
 moment enough free in short where 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.520
 I have basically nothing left from it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.009
 do now 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 in the newsroom are the nuts I am a 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.100
 a little more enlightened, however, is also the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.060
 unkempt shoe shackles makes them for itself 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.679
 hideous 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.439
 but now it is surreal we say that it is 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.740
 having many problems instead 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.560
 questions etc. for which unfortunately one 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.479
 once I once fail to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.689
 get this pretty normal thing 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.369
 because too much the scholastic period e 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.700
 this you know 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.510
 in short, absolutely not going to 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.400
 school together our commitments 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 our days cannot coincide 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.190
 so maybe one day they are 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.410
 Free I pledged him which is always 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.980
 very difficult to put ourselves 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.590
 agree 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.170
 anyway, I hope, as soon as possible, that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.810
 we will be able to record again and I will 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.209
 I will still have some videos already 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.569
 kobe ​​legends videos and some 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.160
 unboxing some pretty reviews 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.160
 until in short I hope they can 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.319
 interest and soon continue 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.510
 again we will also see the point with i 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.709
 microsoft video searched channel 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.569
 unfortunately he is suffering a bit of 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.090
 inactivity is quite normal in the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.780
 school term and I 'm sorry because 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.389
 I'm staying a little bit back though 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.329
 in short, I will try as much as possible to 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:05.100
 return to the pace and pace of before and 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.260
 I will also make videos of the videos 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.080
 reviews on gods under the books of 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.090
 things maybe movies 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.640
 as I said in short, in this new one 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.370
 culture brand heading should be called 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.370
 theoretically that I'm designing and anyway 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.450
 nothing I was just going to the bookstore 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.850
 now the mondadori bookstore nearby 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.550
 where he is looking for a philosophy text 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.450
 that we are reading for school but that 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.270
 also quite interesting to say from 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.610
 to study and to read independently a 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.120
 text of viana ranking we say 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.190
 however twentieth century philosophy 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.990
 postwar we can say treats of the 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.880
 really interesting questions could 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.040
 maybe even be the subject of mine 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.560
 next video after finished work by 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:02.640
 I read it and it is linked very well 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.140
 has arguments like mass control 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.110
 and wandering propaganda of the regimes 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.660
 ideology and terror and so on 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.640
 many interesting things and 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.359
 I was also looking for books 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.500
 that they deal with a financial stock exchange 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.919
 right now it would be mine what 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.560
 I am more interested in it is now almost decided 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.870
 totally safe 99.9 percent 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.840
 at the university I'm going to study 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.510
 economics and finance finance what I do 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.300
 the finance guard finance in the sense 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.680
 purse to mediate finance 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.660
 in short, I mean financial markets 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.130
 this and so I was looking for books but me 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.620
 I've been there another time it seems to me 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.030
 to have found nothing 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.550
 anyway , well, maybe make a video more 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.290
 in-depth also on orientation 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.479
 university can also be used to 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:02.700
 some my age explain to you a little 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:05.670
 my world view about it 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.990
 in general the world of work and things 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.390
 so 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.890
 for the moment nothing I wanted 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.540
 thank you short video advice 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.590
 just to let you know that I'm alive 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:20.820
 usually to share a little what 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:25.410
 what I am doing am walking in the middle of one 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.690
 stream of people looks crazy and ok 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.900
 nothing for now then thanks for the 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.010
 vision I am going to direct towards the 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.710
 library 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.710
 I hope to have luck bye all
