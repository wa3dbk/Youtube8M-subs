this<00:01:02.030> video<00:01:02.120> run<00:01:02.660> too<00:01:02.840> long<00:01:03.079> who<00:01:03.680> did<00:01:03.829> that

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
this video run too long who did that

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.649 
this video run too long who did that
first<00:01:04.129> one<00:01:04.369> I<00:01:04.579> think<00:01:05.030> I<00:01:05.089> was<00:01:05.180> going<00:01:05.329> to<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:05.479> one

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
first one I think I was going to do one

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.899 
first one I think I was going to do one
side<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:05.930> think<00:01:06.229> what's<00:01:06.560> going<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.770> do<00:01:06.829> this<00:01:07.009> my

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
side I think what's going to do this my

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.380 
side I think what's going to do this my
side<00:01:08.240> all<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.659> way<00:01:08.979> all<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.040> way<00:01:10.219> down<00:01:10.460> so<00:01:13.390> to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
side all the way all the way down so to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.660 
side all the way all the way down so to
the<00:01:14.510> next<00:01:14.810> part<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.860> i'm<00:01:18.979> thinking<00:01:19.340> probably

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
the next part and i'm thinking probably

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.219 
the next part and i'm thinking probably
should<00:01:20.000> put<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.180> little<00:01:20.390> heat<00:01:20.630> protectant<00:01:21.170> on

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
should put a little heat protectant on

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.280 
should put a little heat protectant on
there<00:01:21.620> a<00:01:21.979> little<00:01:22.299> too<00:01:23.299> late<00:01:23.510> I'm<00:01:23.870> pulling<00:01:24.229> it

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
there a little too late I'm pulling it

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.590 
there a little too late I'm pulling it

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:12.250 

another<00:03:02.250> one<00:03:08.810> time

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:21.720 

there<00:03:13.129> we<00:03:13.250> go<00:03:13.430> pull<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.879> tight<00:03:15.640> there<00:03:16.640> we<00:03:16.849> go

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.710 

and<00:03:22.730> then<00:03:23.000> we're<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.299> to<00:03:23.420> do<00:03:24.409> the<00:03:24.530> same<00:03:24.739> here

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720
