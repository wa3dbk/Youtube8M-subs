00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.660
 Welcome to the Tower of Babel 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.270
 a minecraft plugin on the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.460
 original tower to babel oriented 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.600
 I had the idea and then have the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.010
 three called and they have immediately 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.010
 Well, let's make it clear 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.260
 and here we are three weeks later and 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.180
 have a first version of this pvp mods 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.640
 finished and I explain you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.670
 now like all this 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.379
 works as we have in many 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.879
 minecraft plugins first the lobby where 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.879
 we look at a team with a right click 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.500
 can assign and then a class 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.809
 namely looking for images mercenary or 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.040
 saboteur let's take a look at the pictures 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.710
 actually the most important unit 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.360
 is in this game because he is building and we are 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.190
 have here on the internet ever 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.589
 iron armor and a shovel as 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.049
 only weapon and work tool and there 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.640
 the sun is dazzling on this 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.740
 beautiful island here we see 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.490
 our camp the camp in blue 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.960
 this case 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.610
 there is also the camp of the red that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.430
 They look identical and we have here 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.140
 already the first sand places we also 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.940
 that's the only thing that can break down 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.580
 we can break down and go back 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.690
 can build can build with 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.390
 our shovel are natural 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.890
 much faster than by hand 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.100
 so far, you should get the scoop 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.990
 all others can choose none 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.460
 dismantle or place sandplaces 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.610
 but that really can only be the pictures 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.840
 and we can make out of this country 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.640
 then we can build the tower as well 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.340
 Animals attack for the food 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.200
 but in general we have to get out 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.970
 We look into the island 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.650
 go in there and as much sand as possible 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.120
 reduce because the opposing team makes 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.980
 of course, and here, for example 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.860
 In the middle of the island is really 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.300
 relatively much sand and we can there 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.370
 nice loot 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.760
 but that will of course be the Chinese 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.740
 team sometimes we may total 20 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.230
 Collect more of these sand blocks 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 is not there, there's limit and that applies 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.590
 also for all classes so you can 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.500
 always only 20 with which I can 21 here 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.500
 that's ok, but in the game that's it 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.420
 then limited to 20 right you see 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.380
 By the way, a small indication where you the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.940
 height of the opponent's gate and 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.670
 see your own thomas and 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.200
 also how many units the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.240
 respective class currently on the way 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.800
 are in your team now it works 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.780
 to build up in the spiral 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.010
 to reach this platform this 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.330
 you already have fire platforms 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.920
 won half the game 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.200
 because the pictures have to be really good 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.950
 coordinate and they need of course 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.390
 something escort and that makes the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.450
 ceneri also has a bit different 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.150
 Items include a leather armor and an iron 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.140
 sword and a bow with 20 fall 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.200
 that is actually quite good 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.110
 outfitted around enemy units 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.150
 attack or own camp too 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.060
 defend her you see left and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.840
 There are two towers on the right 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.760
 also can go well as a mercenary and 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.130
 when you're up here you have the good 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.710
 Overview of the camp and can with 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.900
 your bow on the bridge to the people 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.000
 example attack or people the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.950
 maybe under water in try in 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.360
 your position to come to your sand 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.900
 of course it is true 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.880
 prevent 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.830
 of course you can as well as 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.400
 mercenary in the opposing camp 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.460
 once penetrate the island 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.560
 and then it's nice on the cap 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.350
 give the challenger the evil one 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.240
 Of course you can not do that 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.520
 team goal out of sight we lose 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.680
 have to build a tower of 40 blocks in 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.120
 the height goes and that spiral 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.220
 with that we need a floor plan of 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.380
 607 maybe even seven times 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.180
 seven for safety around this between 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.640
 then reach the platform 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.290
 Build a 20- story tall tower 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.920
 can be around a flying island too 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.690
 to reach 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.370
 on which one then four such 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.680
 Pressure plates can be seen here 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.270
 if then on all four platforms one 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.950
 player is a small button 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.410
 released the fifth player 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.230
 can press and therefore the match for 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.570
 his team decides to look us 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.250
 again the saboteur to the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.990
 nothing good is up and running 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.970
 you can already see on his items he has 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.520
 namely dinner with and can the on 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.620
 place an opposing goal if so 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.900
 nobody defends and ignite that and 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.900
 then yes then the following happens 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.660
 that bothers but considerably 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.789
 planning and construction of a 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.080
 spiral thomas the released 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.759
 Of course, sand can also be collected 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.919
 so far is the saboteur 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:40.530
 really a nasty unit that that 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.530
 disturbing enemy team sensitively 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.080
 insofar it applies the own architecture 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.150
 to advance and the construction of the 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.259
 opposing gates as well as possible 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:05:01.240
 prevent 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:05:03.659
 in the tower to babel which class the more 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.659
 game
