your way a warning year with lots of
friends<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.789> after<00:00:24.690> I<00:00:25.140> was<00:00:25.350> five<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.920> moved<00:00:26.190> to

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
friends and after I was five I moved to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.020 
friends and after I was five I moved to
Paris

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
Paris

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.840 
Paris
I<00:00:27.060> moved<00:00:27.510> at<00:00:27.600> the<00:00:27.630> age<00:00:27.900> where<00:00:28.350> I<00:00:28.710> became<00:00:29.640> more

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
I moved at the age where I became more

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.269 
I moved at the age where I became more
classic<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.260> would<00:00:31.440> have<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:32.009> could<00:00:32.160> have

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
classic but it would have it could have

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.520 
classic but it would have it could have
been<00:00:32.489> random<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.239> know<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.570> came<00:00:33.840> earlier

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
been random if you know it came earlier

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.660 
been random if you know it came earlier
so<00:00:34.859> I<00:00:34.890> would<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.609> that<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.390> feeling<00:00:36.870> of

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
so I would not have that that feeling of

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.149 
so I would not have that that feeling of
judgment<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:39.239> Paris<00:00:40.079> because<00:00:40.319> here<00:00:40.620> there's

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
judgment in Paris because here there's

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.090 
judgment in Paris because here there's
none<00:00:41.399> my<00:00:41.670> parents<00:00:42.210> always<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:43.170> been<00:00:43.440> really

the<00:01:54.270> spectrum<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.959> was<00:01:55.200> working<00:01:55.920> there

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the spectrum that was working there

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.219 
the spectrum that was working there
every<00:01:56.520> day<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:57.179> 12<00:01:57.420> years<00:01:57.599> but<00:01:57.780> after<00:01:58.020> 10

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
every day for 12 years but after 10

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.330 
every day for 12 years but after 10
years<00:01:58.379> I<00:01:58.679> cannot<00:01:59.369> feel<00:01:59.789> I<00:02:00.799> wanted<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.009> breathe

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
years I cannot feel I wanted to breathe

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.059 
years I cannot feel I wanted to breathe
and<00:02:02.610> especially<00:02:03.299> also<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.659> wanted<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.649> what

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
and especially also I wanted to see what

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.089 
and especially also I wanted to see what
my<00:02:05.219> venue<00:02:05.789> is<00:02:06.179> outside<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> family<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
my venue is outside of the family I

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.789 
my venue is outside of the family I
think<00:02:08.519> it's<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:08.940> important<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.799> for

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
think it's really important for for

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.890 
think it's really important for for
yourself<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.519> know<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:11.879> it's<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.540> if

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
yourself to know if it's just because if

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.100 
yourself to know if it's just because if
