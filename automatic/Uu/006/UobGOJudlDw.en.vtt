00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
obviously with the holes in the middle

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.340 
obviously with the holes in the middle
they<00:01:36.299> did<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:38.240> help<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.930> any<00:01:40.079> way

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.030 

but<00:01:43.350> most<00:01:43.890> importantly<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:45.329> behind<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.229> my

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
but most importantly in behind here my

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.429 
but most importantly in behind here my
floor<00:01:48.590> new<00:01:49.880> no<00:01:50.880> issues<00:01:51.299> even<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.869> wood<00:01:52.079> here

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
floor new no issues even the wood here

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.219 
floor new no issues even the wood here
in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> front<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.540> actually<00:01:54.869> just

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
in the front is this is actually just

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.889 
in the front is this is actually just
discolored<00:01:55.920> from<00:01:56.130> rust<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.420> not

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
discolored from rust but it is not

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.370 
discolored from rust but it is not
rotten<00:01:58.860> at<00:01:59.009> all<00:01:59.219> even<00:02:00.149> though<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.509> looks<00:02:00.780> bad<00:02:01.049> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
rotten at all even though it looks bad I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.889 
rotten at all even though it looks bad I
actually<00:02:01.740> cut<00:02:02.399> into<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> knife<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.780> it

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
actually cut into it with a knife and it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.779 
actually cut into it with a knife and it
is<00:02:04.140> hard<00:02:04.729> there<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.880> no<00:02:06.090> issues<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:06.960> all

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
is hard there are no issues here at all

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.900 
is hard there are no issues here at all
so<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.090> merely<00:02:09.360> discoloration<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.979> could<00:02:11.610> cut

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
so it's merely discoloration I could cut

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.760 
so it's merely discoloration I could cut
this<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.360> somehow<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.319> replay

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
this out somehow and replay

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.110 
this out somehow and replay
but<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.160> don't<00:02:14.970> think<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.230> necessary

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
but I don't think it is it is necessary

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.050 
but I don't think it is it is necessary
so<00:02:18.470> I'm<00:02:19.470> gonna<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.460> gonna<00:02:20.640> leave<00:02:20.910> it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
so I'm gonna I think I'm gonna leave it

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.970 
so I'm gonna I think I'm gonna leave it
I'm<00:02:21.240> gonna<00:02:21.360> put<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.930> new<00:02:22.110> piece<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.530> metal<00:02:22.800> in

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
I'm gonna put the new piece of metal in

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.250 
I'm gonna put the new piece of metal in
and<00:02:23.280> then<00:02:23.570> it's<00:02:24.570> gonna<00:02:24.690> be<00:02:24.780> aluminum

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
and then it's gonna be aluminum

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.610 
and then it's gonna be aluminum
obviously<00:02:25.800> um<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> there<00:02:27.960> will<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.110> no<00:02:28.410> more

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
obviously um so there will be no more

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.260 
obviously um so there will be no more
rust<00:02:28.890> issues<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.400> gonna<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.880> straighten

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
rust issues I'm gonna have to straighten

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.090 
rust issues I'm gonna have to straighten
out<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.600> insulation<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> little<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.680> can

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
out the insulation here a little bit can

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
out the insulation here a little bit can
I<00:02:32.130> pull<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.330> when<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.570> pull<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.230> metal<00:02:34.530> out<00:02:35.120> so

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
I pull it when I pull the metal out so

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.300 
I pull it when I pull the metal out so
we'll<00:02:36.900> get<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.230> straightened<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.860> maybe

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
we'll get that straightened out maybe

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.710 
we'll get that straightened out maybe
even<00:02:38.640> maybe<00:02:39.060> even<00:02:39.180> replace<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.960> piece<00:02:44.720> and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
even maybe even replace this piece and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.880 
even maybe even replace this piece and
then<00:02:45.870> we'll<00:02:46.110> go<00:02:46.560> from<00:02:46.800> there<00:02:47.210> actually

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
then we'll go from there actually

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.100 
then we'll go from there actually
cutting<00:02:51.620> cutting<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.890> metal<00:02:53.420> on<00:02:54.420> top<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.960> the

cutting cutting the metal on top of the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.110 
cutting cutting the metal on top of the
frame<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.790> little<00:02:56.850> bit

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
frame is just it's a little bit

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.470 
frame is just it's a little bit
difficult<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.990> be<00:02:58.050> done<00:02:58.410> though<00:02:59.330> what<00:03:00.330> you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
difficult it can be done though what you

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.030 
difficult it can be done though what you
need<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.840> do<00:03:01.020> is<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.510> see<00:03:03.890> there<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.010> a

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
need to do is you can see there is a

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.010 
need to do is you can see there is a
piece<00:03:05.460> of<00:03:05.640> wood<00:03:05.880> right<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.600> sits<00:03:06.870> right

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
piece of wood right here that sits right

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.310 
piece of wood right here that sits right
on<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.800> frame<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:09.360> metal<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:10.170> metal

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
on the frame and the metal the metal

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.840 
on the frame and the metal the metal
runs<00:03:10.740> between<00:03:11.370> there<00:03:12.020> back<00:03:13.020> off<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> little<00:03:13.410> bit

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
runs between there back off a little bit

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.050 
runs between there back off a little bit
the<00:03:14.850> metal<00:03:15.210> runs<00:03:15.420> between<00:03:15.810> here<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.700> get

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
the metal runs between here and to get

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.150 
the metal runs between here and to get
in<00:03:18.360> there<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.810> cut<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> little<00:03:19.770> bit<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.040> an

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
in there to cut it is a little bit of an

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.920 
in there to cut it is a little bit of an
issue<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:22.290> way<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.470> did<00:03:22.770> it<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.430> drove<00:03:24.270> wooden

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
issue the way I did it is I drove wooden

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.070 
issue the way I did it is I drove wooden
wedges<00:03:25.230> in<00:03:25.590> between<00:03:26.330> right<00:03:27.330> in<00:03:27.480> between<00:03:27.630> here

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
wedges in between right in between here

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.460 
wedges in between right in between here
to<00:03:28.200> separate<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.280> then<00:03:29.780> using<00:03:30.780> both<00:03:31.200> a

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
to separate this and then using both a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.540 
to separate this and then using both a
right<00:03:31.800> hand<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:32.700> left<00:03:32.910> hand<00:03:33.120> tin<00:03:33.780> snip<00:03:34.170> I

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
right hand and the left hand tin snip I

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.610 
right hand and the left hand tin snip I
could<00:03:35.550> get<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.150> far<00:03:36.450> enough<00:03:36.720> to

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
could get in there far enough to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.210 
could get in there far enough to
actually<00:03:37.800> cut<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:40.040> again

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
actually cut it again

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.740 
actually cut it again
you<00:03:41.490> know<00:03:41.610> it's<00:03:41.970> just<00:03:42.180> one<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.420> those

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
you know it's just one of those

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.300 
you know it's just one of those
techniques<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:43.709> kinda<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:46.310> figure

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
techniques that you kinda have to figure

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.640 
techniques that you kinda have to figure
out<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.850> as<00:03:48.300> you<00:03:48.480> go<00:03:48.630> along<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:49.320> worked

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
out this you as you go along it worked

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.270 
out this you as you go along it worked
really<00:03:49.950> well

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
really well

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.280 
really well
oh<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:51.540> by<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.290> way<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.390> see<00:03:54.600> these<00:03:54.930> this

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
oh and by the way you can see these this

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.850 
oh and by the way you can see these this
there's<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.250> bracket<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.020> bracket<00:03:58.590> that

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
there's a bracket this is a bracket that

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.180 
there's a bracket this is a bracket that
holds<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.990> body<00:04:04.170> off<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.500> trailer<00:04:05.010> on<00:04:05.160> the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
holds the body off the trailer on the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.490 
holds the body off the trailer on the
frame<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:06.060> there's<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.480> bolt<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:07.230> through

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
frame and there's a bolt going through

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.190 
frame and there's a bolt going through
here<00:04:07.800> now<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:11.190> bolt<00:04:11.580> hole<00:04:11.880> was<00:04:12.239> drilled<00:04:12.510> after

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
here now the bolt hole was drilled after

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.180 
here now the bolt hole was drilled after
the<00:04:13.350> metal<00:04:13.709> was<00:04:13.890> installed<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:15.830> this<00:04:16.830> bolt

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
the metal was installed so it this bolt

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.650 
the metal was installed so it this bolt
would<00:04:17.459> have<00:04:17.900> formed<00:04:18.900> an<00:04:19.080> obstacle<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.660> pulling

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
would have formed an obstacle to pulling

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.020 
would have formed an obstacle to pulling
out<00:04:21.860> the<00:04:22.860> metal<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:24.030> what<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.240> did<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:25.220> cheated

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
out the metal so what I did I cheated

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.200 
out the metal so what I did I cheated
and<00:04:27.840> actually<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:29.750> pushed<00:04:30.750> this<00:04:30.960> bolt<00:04:31.350> up<00:04:32.210> and

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
and actually I pushed this bolt up and

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.770 
and actually I pushed this bolt up and
in<00:04:33.540> behind<00:04:33.930> here<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.790> had<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:35.970> cut<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.210> hole<00:04:36.540> in

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
in behind here I had to cut a hole in

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.830 
in behind here I had to cut a hole in
the<00:04:36.900> wall<00:04:37.080> again<00:04:37.580> but<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:39.510> just<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
the wall again but so it's just the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.800 
the wall again but so it's just the
paneling<00:04:40.320> they<00:04:40.800> cut<00:04:41.130> out<00:04:41.570> carefully<00:04:42.570> neatly

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
paneling they cut out carefully neatly

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.920 
paneling they cut out carefully neatly
so<00:04:43.170> I<00:04:43.200> can<00:04:43.410> put<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.740> back<00:04:43.920> in<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.930> nobody's

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
so I can put it back in and nobody's

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.220 
so I can put it back in and nobody's
ever<00:04:46.080> gonna<00:04:46.320> see<00:04:46.800> that<00:04:47.660> because<00:04:48.660> this<00:04:49.050> is

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
ever gonna see that because this is

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.740 
ever gonna see that because this is
right<00:04:49.590> behind<00:04:50.070> my<00:04:50.340> shower<00:04:50.610> tub<00:04:51.320> so<00:04:52.400> well<00:04:53.750> it

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
right behind my shower tub so well it

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.230 
right behind my shower tub so well it
gave<00:04:54.960> me<00:04:55.170> the<00:04:55.290> opportunity<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:55.920> inspect<00:04:56.670> the

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
gave me the opportunity to inspect the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:08.920 
gave me the opportunity to inspect the
flooring<00:04:57.750> behind<00:04:58.170> here<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:07.700> really

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
flooring behind here and and really

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.290 
flooring behind here and and really
other<00:05:09.930> than<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.260> few<00:05:10.740> mouse<00:05:10.919> droppings<00:05:11.300> there

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
other than a few mouse droppings there

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.140 
other than a few mouse droppings there
was<00:05:12.510> no<00:05:12.720> issue<00:05:13.070> no<00:05:14.070> apparent<00:05:14.610> issue<00:05:14.790> in<00:05:15.030> the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
was no issue no apparent issue in the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.170 
was no issue no apparent issue in the
wall<00:05:15.360> or<00:05:15.720> nothing<00:05:16.290> so<00:05:16.530> this<00:05:16.740> is<00:05:16.890> all<00:05:17.180> perfectly
