00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
those bright eyes she could also see a

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.739 
those bright eyes she could also see a
little<00:00:33.260> sparkle<00:00:33.769> in<00:00:33.890> there<00:00:34.129> that<00:00:34.510> maybe<00:00:35.510> there

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:35.749 
little sparkle in there that maybe there

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:37.329
