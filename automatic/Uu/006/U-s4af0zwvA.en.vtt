00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
you've been around for like five or six
years<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.020> was<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.380> first<00:01:31.530> NC

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
years but that was your first NC

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100 
years but that was your first NC
double-a<00:01:32.430> tournament<00:01:32.460> game<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.150> well<00:01:33.299> how<00:01:33.930> was

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
double-a tournament game as well how was

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
double-a tournament game as well how was
that<00:01:34.290> coming<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.549> was

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that coming out and you know what was

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.940 
that coming out and you know what was
your<00:01:35.850> feeling<00:01:36.110> coming<00:01:37.110> into<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> game<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
your feeling coming into the game and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
your feeling coming into the game and
then<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.340> guess<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> last<00:01:38.850> part<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
then I guess the last part of that

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.749 
then I guess the last part of that
multi-part<00:01:40.320> question<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.829> did<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.430> notice

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
multi-part question is did you notice

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.210 
multi-part question is did you notice
the<00:01:42.210> lack<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.479> fans<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.560> first<00:01:43.829> started

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the lack of fans when they first started

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.760 
the lack of fans when they first started

against Memphis which came down I think

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.570 
against Memphis which came down I think
they<00:02:33.379> tied<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.620> up<00:02:33.799> in<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.980> second<00:02:34.280> half<00:02:34.310> at

shot on their great basketball team

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.030 
shot on their great basketball team
there's<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.540> reason<00:02:47.660> why<00:02:47.810> they're<00:02:47.989> here<00:02:48.170> they

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
there's a reason why they're here they

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.500 
there's a reason why they're here they
went<00:02:49.190> on<00:02:49.220> execute<00:02:49.700> their<00:02:49.849> game<00:02:50.060> plan<00:02:50.090> against

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
went on execute their game plan against

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.130 
went on execute their game plan against
New<00:02:51.410> Mexico<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.579> at<00:02:53.299> times<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.870> wasn't<00:02:54.079> even

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
New Mexico and at times it wasn't even

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.380 
New Mexico and at times it wasn't even
close<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.680> think<00:02:55.340> Mexico<00:02:55.819> tried<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.090> make<00:02:56.239> their

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
close I think Mexico tried to make their

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.089 
close I think Mexico tried to make their
run<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:56.959> Harvard<00:02:57.620> kept<00:02:57.739> making<00:02:57.980> runs

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
run and and Harvard kept making runs

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.890 
run and and Harvard kept making runs
themselves<00:02:58.579> so<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.269> have<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.450> prepare<00:02:59.840> for

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
themselves so we have to prepare for

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.839 
themselves so we have to prepare for
them<00:03:00.110> just<00:03:00.260> like<00:03:00.380> any<00:03:00.590> other<00:03:00.680> team<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.190> think

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
them just like any other team I think

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.460 
them just like any other team I think
their<00:03:01.970> program<00:03:02.329> on<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.480> rise<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.019> they're

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
their program on the rise and they're

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.809 
their program on the rise and they're
making<00:03:03.739> steps<00:03:03.890> in<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.099> right<00:03:04.190> direction<00:03:04.250> and

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
making steps in the right direction and

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.100 
making steps in the right direction and
you<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.180> note<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:05.360> two<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.870> best

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
you have to note that two of the best

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.050 
you have to note that two of the best
players<00:03:06.380> is<00:03:06.590> not<00:03:06.739> playing<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.099> year<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:07.970> you

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
players is not playing this year so you

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.090 
players is not playing this year so you
have<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.239> think<00:03:08.269> just<00:03:08.959> if<00:03:09.470> those<00:03:09.709> two<00:03:09.889> players

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
have to think just if those two players

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.199 
have to think just if those two players
were<00:03:10.280> here<00:03:10.489> they'd<00:03:10.639> probably<00:03:10.850> be<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.030> higher

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
were here they'd probably be a higher

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.270 
were here they'd probably be a higher
see<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.630> be<00:03:11.720> playing<00:03:11.959> somewhere<00:03:12.260> else<00:03:12.440> but<00:03:12.650> we

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
see to be playing somewhere else but we

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.199 
see to be playing somewhere else but we
still<00:03:13.400> have<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:13.549> take<00:03:13.730> them<00:03:13.910> just<00:03:13.940> like

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
still have to take them just like

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.120 
still have to take them just like
anybody<00:03:14.480> else<00:03:14.810> I'm<00:03:15.230> take<00:03:15.440> them<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.799> series

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
anybody else I'm take them just a series

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.860 
anybody else I'm take them just a series

that people really underestimate and

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:29.920 
that people really underestimate and
it's<00:04:28.850> too<00:04:28.940> late<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.150> really<00:04:29.450> try<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.600> fight

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
it's too late to really try to fight

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.750 
it's too late to really try to fight
back<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.350> really<00:04:30.500> put<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.740> forth<00:04:30.979> effort<00:04:31.130> you

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
back and really put the forth effort you

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.280 
back and really put the forth effort you
have<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:31.970> start<00:04:32.180> that<00:04:32.330> from<00:04:32.510> start<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.050> finish

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290
