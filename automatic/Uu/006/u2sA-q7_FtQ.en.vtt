compression hose to fit my vacuum hose
on<00:01:27.380> my<00:01:27.740> vacuum<00:01:27.950> gauge<00:01:28.369> which<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.270> quite<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.869> bit

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
on my vacuum gauge which is quite a bit

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.950 
on my vacuum gauge which is quite a bit
smaller<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:30.710> I've<00:01:31.460> got<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.719> I've<00:01:32.810> got

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
smaller so I've got this and I've got

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.429 
smaller so I've got this and I've got
this<00:01:33.880> going<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:34.939> basically<00:01:35.360> insert<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:36.170> end

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
this going to basically insert this end

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.499 
this going to basically insert this end
it's<00:01:37.399> got<00:01:37.549> kind<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.820> pointy<00:01:38.119> end<00:01:38.149> I'm<00:01:38.420> going

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
it's got kind of a pointy end I'm going

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.679 
it's got kind of a pointy end I'm going
to<00:01:38.600> insert<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:38.990> part<00:01:39.289> into<00:01:40.070> here

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
to insert this part into here

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.700 
to insert this part into here
then<00:01:41.689> I'm<00:01:41.750> going<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:41.930> take<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:42.170> other<00:01:42.409> end

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
then I'm going to take this other end

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.260 
then I'm going to take this other end
this<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.100> like<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.310> piece<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.670> fuel<00:01:44.000> on<00:01:44.149> or

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
this is like a piece of fuel on or

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.940 
this is like a piece of fuel on or
whatever<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.689> I<00:01:44.869> can't<00:01:45.289> tell<00:01:45.439> exactly<00:01:45.469> what

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
whatever and I can't tell exactly what

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.789 
whatever and I can't tell exactly what
size<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.369> stuff<00:01:46.579> is<00:01:46.789> but<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:48.020> want<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.590> find

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
size of stuff is but you want to find

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.810 
size of stuff is but you want to find
something<00:01:49.100> that's<00:01:49.159> going<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.430> fit<00:01:49.609> over<00:01:49.789> your

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
something that's going to fit over your

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.780 
something that's going to fit over your
compression<00:01:50.359> hose

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.730 

all<00:01:57.300> right<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.690> we<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:57.960> see<00:01:58.410> I've<00:01:58.560> got

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
all right there we go see I've got

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.860 
all right there we go see I've got
basically<00:01:59.400> all<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:01.520> hooked<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:03.750> my

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
basically all this is hooked up to my

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.080 
basically all this is hooked up to my
vacuum<00:02:04.260> gauge<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:05.280> my<00:02:05.400> vacuum<00:02:05.580> gauge<00:02:05.910> in

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
vacuum gauge so my vacuum gauge in

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.150 
vacuum gauge so my vacuum gauge in
essence<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.570> hooked<00:02:06.870> up<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.080> my<00:02:07.830> compression

the seal the better off you are

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.270 
the seal the better off you are
okay<00:02:25.170> now<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.440> we're<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.650> sealed<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:26.100> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
okay now that we're all sealed up and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.650 
okay now that we're all sealed up and
you<00:02:26.340> can<00:02:26.460> actually<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.000> crankshaft<00:02:27.300> down

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
you can actually see the crankshaft down

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.590 
you can actually see the crankshaft down
here<00:02:27.960> I'm<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.440> take<00:02:28.590> my<00:02:28.770> ratchet<00:02:29.600> and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
here I'm going to take my ratchet and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.550 
here I'm going to take my ratchet and
I'm<00:02:30.660> going<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.810> rotate<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.230> crankshaft

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
I'm going to rotate the crankshaft

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.350 
I'm going to rotate the crankshaft
actually<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.460> direction<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.910> crankshaft

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
actually in the direction of crankshaft

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.870 
actually in the direction of crankshaft
rotation<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.900> rotated<00:02:34.350> clockwise<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.220> I'm

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
rotation I rotated clockwise and I'm

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.910 
rotation I rotated clockwise and I'm
basically<00:02:36.240> going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.510> look<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.440> see<00:02:37.590> if<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.800> have

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
basically going to look to see if I have

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.400 
basically going to look to see if I have
pressure<00:02:38.190> v<00:02:38.610> pressure<00:02:38.970> as<00:02:39.270> I'm<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:40.170> I'm

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
pressure v pressure as I'm is I'm

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.900 
pressure v pressure as I'm is I'm
cranking<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.890> over<00:02:41.160> I'm<00:02:41.340> coming<00:02:41.370> up<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:41.880> a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
cranking it over I'm coming up on a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.110 
cranking it over I'm coming up on a
compression<00:02:42.420> stroke<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.830> have<00:02:44.280> vacuum<00:02:44.850> then

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
compression stroke if I have vacuum then

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.800 
compression stroke if I have vacuum then
I'm<00:02:45.270> going<00:02:45.600> down<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.350> intake<00:02:46.890> stroke<00:02:47.810> what

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
I'm going down on the intake stroke what

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.300 
I'm going down on the intake stroke what
I<00:02:48.840> want<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.320> top<00:02:49.650> dead<00:02:49.830> center<00:02:50.100> on<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
I want is top dead center on the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.710 
I want is top dead center on the
compression<00:02:50.760> stroke<00:02:50.970> that's<00:02:51.180> why<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.510> got<00:02:51.630> to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
compression stroke that's why we got to

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.470 
compression stroke that's why we got to
have<00:02:51.810> vacuum<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.380> pressure<00:02:53.060> okay<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.240> am

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
have vacuum and pressure okay so I am

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.530 
have vacuum and pressure okay so I am
coming<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:54.990> on<00:02:55.110> compression<00:02:55.650> stroke<00:02:55.860> here<00:02:56.540> but

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
coming up on compression stroke here but

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.880 
coming up on compression stroke here but
as<00:02:57.630> soon<00:02:57.810> as<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:57.959> see<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.260> start<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.590> go<00:02:58.709> into

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
as soon as I see it start to go into

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.970 
as soon as I see it start to go into
vacuum<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.959> know<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.290> passed<00:03:01.680> top

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
vacuum I know that I just passed top

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.280 
vacuum I know that I just passed top
dead<00:03:02.160> center<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.640> just<00:03:02.910> passed<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.330> there<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:04.230> I

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
dead center I just passed it there so I

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.160 
dead center I just passed it there so I
come<00:03:04.560> back<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.950> other<00:03:05.070> direction

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
come back in the other direction

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.839 
come back in the other direction
until<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.200> find<00:03:07.530> zero

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.539 

there<00:03:12.849> we<00:03:12.909> go<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:14.590> right<00:03:14.799> there<00:03:14.830> is<00:03:15.069> top

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
there we go and that right there is top

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.699 
there we go and that right there is top
dead<00:03:15.790> center<00:03:16.090> compression<00:03:16.659> stroke<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.620> you

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
dead center compression stroke and you

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.319 
dead center compression stroke and you
want<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:17.980> basically<00:03:18.129> work<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.790> back<00:03:18.939> and<00:03:19.120> forth

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
want to basically work it back and forth

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.149 
want to basically work it back and forth
until<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.750> can<00:03:19.900> get<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:20.079> nailed<00:03:20.409> down<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.860> zero

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
until you can get it nailed down on zero

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.190 
until you can get it nailed down on zero
but<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> quick<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.540> easy<00:03:22.599> way<00:03:22.900> not

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
but that is a quick and easy way not

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.539 
but that is a quick and easy way not
using<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.620> screwdriver<00:03:23.829> method<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.519> I

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
using the screwdriver method that I

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.940 
using the screwdriver method that I
showed<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:24.939> last<00:03:25.120> time<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:26.140> find<00:03:26.409> top<00:03:26.739> dead

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
showed you last time to find top dead

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.160 
showed you last time to find top dead
center<00:03:27.280> on<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> cylinder<00:03:27.819> so<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.629> addition<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.140> a

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
center on a cylinder so in addition to a

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.259 
center on a cylinder so in addition to a
vacuum<00:03:29.470> gauge<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.310> might<00:03:30.489> be<00:03:30.640> able<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.970> this

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
vacuum gauge you might be able to this

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.530 
vacuum gauge you might be able to this
vacuum<00:03:32.019> pump<00:03:32.319> is<00:03:32.530> what<00:03:32.799> I<00:03:32.829> have<00:03:33.099> here

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
vacuum pump is what I have here

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.089 
vacuum pump is what I have here
sometimes<00:03:34.540> these<00:03:34.750> show<00:03:35.079> pressure<00:03:35.409> as<00:03:35.709> well<00:03:36.040> as
