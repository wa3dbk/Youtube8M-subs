 his Santa Claus operation that lasts since 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.500
 1995 earned him this morning the personality 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.600
 of the week the press / radio-canada he 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 is called wholesale standards it will us 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.900
 tell his story that you can 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.280
 read under the pen of cheated in the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.119
 tomorrow's press hello sir big 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.730
 hello sir lemieux 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.970
 first what is the Santa Claus operation 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.470
 Operation Santa Claus is a 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 love operation a story that lasts 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.140
 since 14 years as the saying and 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.399
 it's a love story between 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.890
 children first of all children who 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.469
 come from families of families who 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.769
 are less lucky less wealthy 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.379
 prison like that and kids too who 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.390
 are downright abandoned as soon as they 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.519
 agree to describe to Santa Claus as 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.429
 at all Christmas all bastard children 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.499
 usually do father operations 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.909
 Christmas has given itself the mission of making 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.100
 so that children who are at 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.809
 risk them 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.489
 a very likely risk of poppy 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.600
 much to Christmas but to do in 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.980
 so that they receive a gift that 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.290
 call us a significant gift 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.520
 so a gift that looks like that 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.040
 probably for this ticket when you 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.409
 were small I 'm going to your foot handed it 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.450
 on one level then fantasy what 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.430
 thou lé good there I Arabian 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.630
 questions because to answer all 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.440
 children we must have choices 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.780
 difficult to do 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.950
 you choose how I why you 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.080
 immediately say that on the web you 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.330
 find on our pages the hyperlink 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.369
 which leads to the Santa Claus operation to 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.050
 know and understand more but 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.840
 with the little time we have 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.630
 it's the choices to be made that must be 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.030
 horrible to listen to the dunes are to 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.000
 come so far is a lover 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.540
 mister lemieux know people are 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.210
 of great generosity and we have 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.040
 managed to lead so far since 14 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.670
 years to fill all the letters we have 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.110
 received this year we do not exceed the 2000 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.760
 including the recovery of 2500 the child and one 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.670
 is a little bit more misery on the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.220
 last few miles to find Santa Claus 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.670
 but we remain hopeful my wife and 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.869
 2.2 I find because we 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.730
 still nothing come so far 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.110
 because the secret is that in the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.270
 background you are not the real Santa Claus 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.590
 you are the real coordinator of 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.150
 unemployed tells you very well 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.790
 actually because you understand 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.740
 that the maj that the press and radio-canada 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.710
 we return to Santa Claus operation 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.600
 it's very touching it's very moving 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.730
 at the same time I receive them very 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.580
 humbly because if there is behind that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.560
 this operation there several people 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.290
 who collaborate with us and who are doing 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.269
 so that it can work 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.829
 including the folks he agrees 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.780
 play the role of Santa Claus the 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.939
 stakeholders also who collects the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.319
 children's letters is still a 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.819
 quite significant extra work for 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.010
 they are asked to go to 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.620
 families to support children the 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.200
 parents did not have a grant 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.680
 you are not a duly chartered organization 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.290
 constituted organized with 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.280
 funding not even that it started 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.109
 with a gift it started with a 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.310
 idea in any case of a child who 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.730
 have lit 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.260
 Therese and me on it but no 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.790
 actually we do not receive 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.930
 grant subsidy for the evening 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.520
 it's sir everyone is you 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.340
 who take a letter that says bombay 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.230
 I see m 35 to 45 in place and I'm going 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.180
 buy a gift that has finally 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.739
 the demand then this kind of subsidies 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.500
 we have to say that we 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.810
 have been very closely supported 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.700
 a few years the township to start to 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.599
 organize alone to do it on a 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.849
 larger scale 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.360
 the foundation city ​​to our lady of grace 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.220
 did not give us each year a 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.360
 amount of money to allow us to 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.880
 respond to so-called requests 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.620
 special in things that in a 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.410
 particular life situation for a 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.360
 child for a family that would exceed 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.220
 largely the amount of money that a 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.840
 particular can devote to his and so 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.940
 we answer some requests a little 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.640
 exceptional in this way you have to 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.650
 live Christmas exceptional because you 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.540
 make it live 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.030
 listen 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.890
 the period before christmas the period of 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.689
 advent finally because for us 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.859
 it starts in late November or early 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.209
 December really kids 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.280
 began in sculptures they to 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.799
 that time then from early December 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.100
 until the 24th at the end of the day 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.900
 we are there in full almost day and 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.300
 night my spouse and I are there people 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.979
 who were working with us and yes 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.080
 actually there is a lot of emotion 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.570
 that we live in the temple and letters 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.220
 children that people who we 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.380
 call and we call for their 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.240
 offer children's letters from people 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.849
 who tell us how important it is 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.610
 for them this idea begins there 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.289
 joined it allows them to relive gilded 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.380
 paris even something compared to 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.180
 their childhood christmas and this is the proof 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.740
 the demonstration that ideas all 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.810
 simple and good ideas can 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.430
 go far
