you of course you can all do it you need

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.190 
you of course you can all do it you need
to<00:01:57.850> do<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:59.070> in<00:02:00.070> terms<00:02:00.430> of<00:02:00.850> what<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.750> should<00:02:01.960> do

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
to do it in terms of what you should do

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.520 
to do it in terms of what you should do
it<00:02:02.610> rivet<00:02:03.610> eat<00:02:03.789> I<00:02:04.000> think<00:02:04.330> we've<00:02:04.509> six<00:02:04.869> people<00:02:05.409> it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
it rivet eat I think we've six people it

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.410 
it rivet eat I think we've six people it
would<00:02:05.649> be<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.799> very<00:02:06.220> difficult<00:02:06.640> task<00:02:07.210> to

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
would be a very difficult task to

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.710 
would be a very difficult task to
actually<00:02:07.930> pull<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.200> off<00:02:08.410> but<00:02:09.360> multi<00:02:10.360> where<00:02:10.509> to

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
actually pull it off but multi where to

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.860 
actually pull it off but multi where to
go<00:02:10.929> if<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.380> do<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:13.060> reason<00:02:13.510> for<00:02:13.540> doing

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
go if you can do it the reason for doing

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.670 
go if you can do it the reason for doing
it<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.200> might<00:02:14.380> say<00:02:15.120> saving<00:02:16.120> ammo<00:02:16.680> obviously

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
it you might say saving ammo obviously

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.040 
it you might say saving ammo obviously
in<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.890> first<00:02:18.130> part<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.700> use<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.330> lot<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.660> ammo

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
in the first part you use a lot of ammo

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.440 
in the first part you use a lot of ammo
defending<00:02:20.620> some<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.950> these<00:02:21.040> rings<00:02:21.519> so<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.030> can

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
defending some of these rings so you can

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.930 
defending some of these rings so you can
save<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> lot<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.959> ammo<00:02:23.290> doing<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.940> especially

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
save a lot of ammo doing it especially

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.800 
save a lot of ammo doing it especially
heavy<00:02:26.220> other<00:02:27.220> reasons<00:02:27.790> for<00:02:28.060> doing<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.540> are

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
heavy other reasons for doing it are

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.630 
heavy other reasons for doing it are
just<00:02:30.269> they're<00:02:31.269> nice<00:02:31.720> easy<00:02:32.200> doing<00:02:33.130> I'm<00:02:33.310> hard

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
just they're nice easy doing I'm hard

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.059 
just they're nice easy doing I'm hard
you<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.239> nice<00:02:34.480> easy<00:02:34.810> starts<00:02:35.530> oh<00:02:35.739> yeah

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
you can have a nice easy starts oh yeah

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.640 
you can have a nice easy starts oh yeah
other<00:02:36.970> reasons<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.510> do<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.930> can't<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:38.440> of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
other reasons to do it I can't think of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.710 
other reasons to do it I can't think of
any<00:02:40.920> see<00:02:41.920> ya<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:45.330> record<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.569> now

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
any see ya and the a record of the now

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.979 
any see ya and the a record of the now
along<00:02:47.049> with<00:02:47.080> them<00:02:47.410> waiting<00:02:47.650> now<00:02:48.069> but<00:02:48.989> we're

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
along with them waiting now but we're

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.170 
along with them waiting now but we're
getting<00:02:50.349> close<00:02:50.650> perhaps<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.640> little<00:02:52.000> look

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
getting close perhaps to a little look

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.120 
getting close perhaps to a little look
at<00:02:52.269> my<00:02:52.420> weapons<00:02:52.870> or<00:02:53.140> something<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.650> little<00:02:53.860> talk

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
at my weapons or something a little talk

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.780 
at my weapons or something a little talk
about<00:02:54.160> my<00:02:54.610> weapons<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:55.390> mine<00:02:55.690> will<00:02:56.790> manage

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
about my weapons then mine will manage

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.770 
about my weapons then mine will manage
we'll<00:02:58.750> manage<00:02:59.850> God<00:03:00.850> be<00:03:01.000> much<00:03:01.180> long<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.660> I

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
we'll manage God be much long and I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.550 
we'll manage God be much long and I
anyway<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:03.209> think<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.390> can<00:03:04.630> actually<00:03:05.109> hear<00:03:05.380> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
anyway I think you can actually hear the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.099 
anyway I think you can actually hear the
noise<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.829> via<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:07.329> know<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.870> raid

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
noise of via you know like the raid

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.370 
noise of via you know like the raid
noises<00:03:08.920> not<00:03:09.489> affect<00:03:09.910> noises<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.900> things<00:03:10.930> like

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
noises not affect noises and things like

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.420 
noises not affect noises and things like
that<00:03:11.820> was<00:03:12.820> fired<00:03:13.180> building<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:15.100> can<00:03:15.280> actually

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
that was fired building you can actually

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.130 
that was fired building you can actually
hear<00:03:15.940> as<00:03:16.150> well<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.790> I'm<00:03:19.000> getting<00:03:19.269> close<00:03:19.630> for

slide from a bike out straight away it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.900 
slide from a bike out straight away it
got<00:03:45.489> there<00:03:45.700> really<00:03:46.060> quick<00:03:46.799> but<00:03:47.799> I<00:03:48.250> left<00:03:48.700> a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
got there really quick but I left a

got there really quick but I left a
little<00:03:49.060> bit<00:03:49.269> early<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.079> tire<00:03:50.319> and<00:03:50.560> pulley

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
little bit early and the tire and pulley

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.819 
little bit early and the tire and pulley
belt<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.519> about<00:03:51.910> three<00:03:52.660> or<00:03:52.690> four<00:03:52.810> seconds<00:03:53.590> from

belt is about three or four seconds from
being<00:03:54.040> built<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:55.170> then<00:03:56.170> they<00:03:56.500> actually

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
being built and then they actually

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.410 
being built and then they actually
showed<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.310> one<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.609> conf

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
we have done that glitch and it does

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.409 
we have done that glitch and it does
work<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.710> this<00:05:05.950> is<00:05:06.130> after<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.610> faction<00:05:07.180> well

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
work and this is after the faction well

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
does work eventually energy state and

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.040 
does work eventually energy state and
there<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.240> go<00:05:16.300> got<00:05:16.720> to<00:05:16.930> ascendant<00:05:17.530> shards

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
there you go got to ascendant shards

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.600 
there you go got to ascendant shards
