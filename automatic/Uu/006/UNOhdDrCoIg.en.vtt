 I like the morning of saxophone today 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:15.380
 I want to do a way to clean the tanging today 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:22.660
 Do you have any trouble with everyone's tanging ? 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:30.010
 Please try 6 how to check if the tanging is clean or dirty first 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:32.130
 I do not make a sound because of the strength of the tanging that always blows, but I try to put in only breath 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.130
 Please give me 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:01:00.820
 I did hear a little How do er a 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:09.670
 Please try to make the sound of the tanging as small as possible at this time 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:11.630
 If this turn ring note is large , the sound from the actual trip ring will probably be dirty 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.730
 You may also 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:21.670

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.000
 Reed's 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.840
 If you touch the middle of the reed 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.750
 This is what happens when you are in the middle of the lead 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.540
 You can hear this kind of sound a 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:07.820
