as you see it's not falling so it makes

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.450 
as you see it's not falling so it makes
its<00:01:12.659> job<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.409> make<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.920> higher<00:01:17.430> or

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
its job you can also make it higher or

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.730 
its job you can also make it higher or
lower

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
lower

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.270 
lower
by<00:01:19.740> using<00:01:20.479> this<00:01:21.479> thing<00:01:21.780> up<00:01:22.049> here<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:23.040> really

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
by using this thing up here it's really

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
by using this thing up here it's really
hard<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.610> do<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.090> hand<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:24.890> it's

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
hard to do it with one hand because it's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.899 
hard to do it with one hand because it's
really<00:01:29.180> it's<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.549> hard<00:01:32.820> job

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
really it's just one that was a hard job

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.069 
really it's just one that was a hard job
but<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> look<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> works<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.740> higher<00:01:35.009> now

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
but it look but it works it's higher now

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.120 
but it look but it works it's higher now
you<00:01:37.079> need<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.680> two<00:01:37.890> hands

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you need to do it with two hands

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.210 
you need to do it with two hands
obviously<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.820> I'm<00:01:38.939> holding<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.680> camera<00:01:40.680> with

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
obviously but I'm holding a camera with

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.920 
obviously but I'm holding a camera with
one<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.700> mine<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.700> place<00:01:44.939> tablet<00:01:45.750> or

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
even plate here instead of laptop it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:57.069 
even plate here instead of laptop it
gets<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.630> holders<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:51.259> here<00:01:55.399> here<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079

gets for holders like here here here and
here<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.969> also<00:02:03.119> use<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.689> thing<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.369> let

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
here you can also use this thing to let

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.649 
here you can also use this thing to let
your<00:02:05.840> holders<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:07.469> out

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:15.759 

mmm<00:02:11.950> models<00:02:13.569> well<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.720> would<00:02:14.930> place<00:02:15.200> plate<00:02:15.530> up

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
mmm models well I would place plate up

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.350 
mmm models well I would place plate up
there<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:16.099> it's<00:02:16.280> really<00:02:16.340> hard<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.909> do<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.180> with

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
there but it's really hard to do it with

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.390 
there but it's really hard to do it with
one<00:02:17.569> hand<00:02:17.599> so<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.530> won't<00:02:18.769> do<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.069> but<00:02:19.250> believe

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
one hand so I won't do that but believe

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.610 
one hand so I won't do that but believe
me<00:02:19.519> you<00:02:19.700> can<00:02:19.879> do<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:20.959> also<00:02:21.049> make<00:02:21.260> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
me you can do this you can also make it

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.009 
me you can do this you can also make it
bigger<00:02:21.890> or<00:02:22.640> smaller<00:02:22.909> by<00:02:23.840> using<00:02:24.079> those<00:02:24.409> screws

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
bigger or smaller by using those screws

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.470 
bigger or smaller by using those screws
so<00:02:27.019> all<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:28.040> sizes<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.430> tablets<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:29.090> laptops

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
so all the sizes of tablets and laptops

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.089 
so all the sizes of tablets and laptops
should<00:02:29.599> fit<00:02:29.989> here<00:02:31.180> I'm<00:02:32.180> putting<00:02:32.540> links<00:02:33.200> under

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
should fit here I'm putting links under

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.369 
should fit here I'm putting links under
