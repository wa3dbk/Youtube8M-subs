00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.250
 dear followers of the itinerary I have 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.510
 a confession that make them a commission 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.090
 very strong we will not walk if I never 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.010
 they taught and now I'm missing the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.010
 best moment of this transport that 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.029
 it could change 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.019
 I teach you to walk always 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.890
 when I tell people that I do not know 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.870
 ride a bike first can not believe it 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.600
 and then they release a woe but if it's 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 Of course it's very easy easy 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 when you already know or when you are 8 years old and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.000
 you are of a slight 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.239
 the girls of I teach you to ride a bike 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.339
 he knows it and they do not walk with prejudices or 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.390
 you make faces bad if you never in your 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.390
 you have pedaled 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.350
 organized to share with others 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.930
 boxes your bicycle knowledge weigh 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.600
 as to give classes and rates already known 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.440
 and so and we launched the project in 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.050
 foundress 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.230
 a great success so much in discussion was 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.440
 they approached other girls to give classes was 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.530
 a huge boom 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.900
 the first step that I do step 1 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.760
 is for you to learn to have balance 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.470
 during the visit, the important thing about the bike is 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.150
 you have to move so you have 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 balance because you can not upload the 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.280
 two feet 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.130
 and stay static and you have to see the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.560
 hotel front the first step is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.930
 get familiar with the bike and try 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.300
 move in balance with the tips of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.370
 your feet on the floor 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.800
 after a while of practicing comes the 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.870
 the hardest part is learning to 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.870
 pedal and balance 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.430
 do not 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.290
 i 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.259
 this can take several hours and even 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.440
 days but do not lose patience 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.290
 because after much trial and error and 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.330
 must be your adult fears you achieve 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.280
 start moving 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.740
 like something clicks on your head and 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.260
 there is no turning back soon 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.300
 you ride on a bike the people who approach 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.790
 you with the help you bring in the 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.920
 there's a lot of girls 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.200
 they want to run races goodbye girls that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.720
 want to do triathlon and know how to swim and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.819
 run watch them ride a bike or there are girls 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.890
 most want to be transported 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.950
 vya all who will walk and if I also 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.950
 I want 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.820
 they give you confidence that with them I 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.820
 they gave 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.210
 there are people from the first day and others in 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.590
 the third class took like three weeks 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.750
 already moving more by bike the work 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.430
 As you can see the girls were taught to 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.700
 riding a bike are the most patient 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.700
 world 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.490
