we<00:01:48.329> got<00:01:48.479> lucky<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> mean<00:01:49.860> he<00:01:50.130> is

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
we got lucky on that one I mean he is

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190 
we got lucky on that one I mean he is
not<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.880> best<00:01:51.090> 3-point<00:01:51.720> shooter<00:01:52.049> out

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
not really the best 3-point shooter out

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
not really the best 3-point shooter out
there<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:53.009> he's<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.520> improve<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.299> this

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
there but he's going to improve as this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.200 
there but he's going to improve as this
series<00:01:54.780> goes<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.920> most<00:01:56.159> importantly<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
series goes on but most importantly I

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.389 
series goes on but most importantly I
want<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.719> build<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.200> team<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.890> defense

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
want to build this team up on defense

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.789 
want to build this team up on defense
first<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.570> defense<00:02:01.320> leading<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
first and then defense leading to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.569 
first and then defense leading to
offense

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
offense

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.700 
offense
so<00:02:03.000> Patrick<00:02:03.299> Beverley<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.990> definitely<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
so Patrick Beverley is definitely the
