00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
down by a minimum now so this is kind of

00:01:21.430 --> 00:02:21.180 
down by a minimum now so this is kind of
the<00:01:21.550> lowest<00:01:21.760> gain<00:01:22.180> sort<00:01:22.540> of<00:01:22.600> stuff<00:01:22.780> with<00:01:22.960> us

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:53.290 

you

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.020 

now<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.290> has<00:02:54.470> got<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.830> I've<00:02:55.040> got<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.400> gain

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
now this has got the I've got the gain

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.600 
now this has got the I've got the gain
and<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.330> volume<00:02:56.690> both<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> 2

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
and the volume both that like a 2

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.510 
and the volume both that like a 2
o'clock<00:02:58.850> position<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.950> let's<00:03:00.950> search<00:03:01.460> for

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
o'clock position so let's search for

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:17.410 
o'clock position so let's search for
those<00:03:01.760> hands<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:15.760> valuable<00:03:16.760> lesson<00:03:17.030> there

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
those hands of a valuable lesson there

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.950 
those hands of a valuable lesson there
and<00:03:17.650> that's<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.830> poor<00:03:19.580> webcam<00:03:20.000> placement<00:03:20.510> can

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
and that's the poor webcam placement can

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:41.309 
and that's the poor webcam placement can
be<00:03:21.290> hazardous<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:22.430> let's<00:03:23.120> try<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.540> again

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.840 

Oh

No

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.580 

I<00:04:03.000> guess<00:04:04.000> finally<00:04:04.330> I<00:04:04.600> should<00:04:04.720> do<00:04:05.110> some<00:04:05.319> stuff

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
I guess finally I should do some stuff

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.820 
I guess finally I should do some stuff
with<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.720> both<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:07.990> grid<00:04:08.319> and<00:04:08.500> pick<00:04:08.680> up

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
with the both and grid and pick up

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.470 
with the both and grid and pick up
singers<00:04:09.130> haven't<00:04:09.520> done<00:04:09.640> any<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:09.970> yet<00:04:10.090> so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
singers haven't done any of that yet so

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:31.950 
singers haven't done any of that yet so
here<00:04:10.720> we<00:04:10.780> go

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:05:04.580 

now<00:04:32.960> it's<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.260> neck

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.940 

twily

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
twily

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.240 
twily
okay<00:05:06.910> so<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.630> hope<00:05:07.930> that<00:05:07.960> sounded<00:05:08.770> like<00:05:08.920> alright

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250

and yeah I think it's like a little

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.500 
and yeah I think it's like a little
right<00:05:11.680> overdrive<00:05:12.130> pedal<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:12.640> it<00:05:13.030> doesn't

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
glue because the circuit designer things

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.760 
glue because the circuit designer things
you're<00:05:18.460> going<00:05:18.580> Nick<00:05:18.820> it<00:05:18.940> from<00:05:19.290> like<00:05:20.290> a<00:05:20.320> retard

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770
