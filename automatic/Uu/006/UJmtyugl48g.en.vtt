 7:49 your guest this morning jean michel 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.299
 aphatie is alexandre de juniac 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.680
 the CEO of air france hello alexandre de 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.570
 juniac hello jean michel lived the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.950
 cgt d'air france who refuses the plan of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.120
 restructuring that you want to put 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.280
 implemented in your company 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.560
 call to strike from tomorrow 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.730
 so what meaning according to your information 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.380
 traffic forecasts 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 we now have the information 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.390
 very precise about the consequences of this 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.769
 movement that affects 1% of employees I 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.609
 therefore very little for the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.650
 leaders of thirteen soldiers to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.160
 employees call to strike or go 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.679
 strike 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.320
 1% of our employees have filed a 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.890
 individual declaration for tomorrow 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.180
 like what it would be 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.649
 and join a strike 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.850
 launched 1% out of seventy thousand 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.149
 employees of the air france group 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.460
 to the south the little movement followed by 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.550
 movements that is little followed and which 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.649
 will result in no cancellation of flights 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.910
 delays and for which we have when 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.920
 even mobilized because it's a big 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.989
 holiday departure 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.790
 6500 people plus sites 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.360
 information then I recommend to our 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.159
 listeners at 2.2 to inquire 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.530
 green internet numbers on the site 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.450
 air france by sms on twitter on 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.580
 facebook on af know that a 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.020
 service by dealing so that's for and and 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.670
 to do it a little bit in advance 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.940
 with that I think he should avoid 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.830
 the most penalizing troubles 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.750
 to lift the planes will take off but 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.780
 that we speak they will take off 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.399
 uncertain no will be late so I 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.509
 do not expect too much attention for 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.830
 all the people who will visit 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.720
 at airports starting tomorrow 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.340
 let's talk about the plan if you want it 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.899
 Now lexandre Junior terms 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.570
 you want applied to air france 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.679
 provides for the abolition of 5000 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.560
 workstations ie near 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:42.100
 10% or so of scrub 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.060
 it's 10% of the company air france so 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.390
 it's still very important 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.500
 yes it's usually not about 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.329
 replace people who are leaving to the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.860
 retirement I also need departures 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.659
 volunteers just under 3000 departures 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.340
 volunteers in these times of unemployment 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.140
 important of rising unemployment 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.520
 you really think there will be three 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.259
 a thousand people who will come to see you 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.920
 to tell me I agree to leave 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.090
 the company two parties so why 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.079
 have we set up a plan to 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.060
 voluntary departures this because the 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.920
 company in a situation that is very 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.910
 difficult where we are for the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.010
 fourth year in loss 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.760
 we have a debt that has tripled and 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.709
 we have a financing capacity 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.000
 for a society that needs a lot 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.560
 to invest in buying planes it's 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.799
 very expensive 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.500
 invest in infrastructure 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.989
 airport is also a very cost 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.340
 important that we are not 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.600
 more in situation to develop ourselves 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.370
 so we have to rectify the situation 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.320
 of the company for that we have 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.510
 set up a plan called 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.269
 transforms and whose in which the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.100
 social component is extremely important 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.140
 and it's based on two things 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.020
 we started a very negotiation 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.490
 union monitoring and coordination 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.260
 which led to the signing of 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.440
 with two categories of staff the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.000
 ground staff and drivers agree 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.740
 which were the subject of a referendum and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.330
 who got very broad support these 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.400
 very important problems could not 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.380
 sign unfortunately it's all gone 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.360
 close with hostesses and stewards 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.370
 that's the first thing and in this 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.660
 plan what we said to 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.380
 unions is that we 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.940
 would do everything to preserve employment and 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.920
 do not resort to constrained measures 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.510
 and to avoid forced departures for 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.440
 avoid forced departures and there we 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.220
 came back after bringing back 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.530
 on the job 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.770
 many times the industrial hypotheses 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.420
 which allows to straighten the company 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.980
 without resorting to dismissals of which 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.480
 if people agree to leave 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.070
 voluntarily the company salute so 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.490
 we implemented a counter as the 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.320
 next month 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.210
 we open a window from the row 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.830
 is already open but it is formally 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.150
 in place and the first starts 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.590
 should start from mid 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.230
 November and there must be little 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.730
 nearly 3000 people a little less 2167 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.720
 departure for the ground staff who 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.890
 say yes I agree 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.870
 browse and in the current period 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.510
 you think it's listening for 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.010
 moment there are several thousand of 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.240
 people who have shown interest 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.430
 knowing that she can do three things 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.510
 either 7 are retirements 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.100
 anticipated 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.350
 either they are departures for project 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.580
 personal or professional project and that 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.570
 works very well because people have 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.290
 finally a lot of projects 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.640
 humanitarian 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.660
 thanks to the sound of great people the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.200
 Air France personnel are very much 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.690
 of a lot of originality of dedication 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.790
 and more are these are local time 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.260
 what is project for 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.780
 a company like ours as the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.280
 ours extremely well adapted without 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.760
 this business plan on is in danger 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.770
 a very great danger is even that same 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.440
 beyond that we have to succeed 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.480
 plan transforms 2005 to hand over 15 and 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.460
 on the rails 2015 forgiveness for putting off 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.230
 the company on the rails and for 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.330
 find the average grow if we 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.770
 do not do that I would be very very worried 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.180
 on the under the financial situation the 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.220
 company the goal is to save 2 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.200
 billion euros to reduce costs 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.710
 operating exactly 20% 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.150
 it is therefore 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.490
 a slimming cure of very 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.690
 severe yes and who was this nature 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.040
 it's a slimming cure because 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.210
 that our cost structure is too 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.670
 high we are more expensive our 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.260
 competitors while we have the most 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.850
 great network with our friends from klm the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.780
 largest global network at its 125 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.040
 destinations in the world of which we 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.640
 knows europe and the world 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.260
 air france klm and we have a fleet 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.610
 is very good very very good staff 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.750
 and so there is no reason we 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.340
 not that we are not the numbers one 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.650
 global and therefore having 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.170
 regressed it's really a it's 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.850
 really a place that we do not 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.290
 not deserve so you need to increase 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.510
 we have to make those efforts 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.950
 and this gentleman the thing I would like 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.240
 insist that organizations 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.950
 unions that have signed agreements 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.960
 with us are committed to doing these 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.400
 efforts and so it's really a choice 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.750
 of responsibility that I find very 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.310
 remarkable this plan had you designed it 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.070
 a few months ago the prospects of 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.850
 growth in europe next year 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.710
 are very weak 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.930
 I am told 0% we do not know exactly 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.920
 where we will be this plan is enough or 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.730
 you have to imagine adjusting it again 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.240
 economic institutions as it 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.040
 draws itself 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.660
 this plan is built on assumptions 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.520
 cautious obviously involves us 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.260
 also had the same uncertainties and 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.520
 the same fears about the evolution of the 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.810
 situation is a 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.120
 evolution that becomes clearer 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.210
 in any case for France where our 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.440
 reservations and whether for the for 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.420
 tourist trips or for 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.040
 business trips are in the process of 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.080
 slowing down very seriously 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.250
 the already you will hear it theoretically very 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.880
 disturbing it's also true for 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.290
 southern europe 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.240
 this is not true for northern europe 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.440
 and that's not true for the pole 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.180
 international that means is he 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.980
 will eventually need to review the plan I 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.540
 do not believe but you have to do it in 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.670
 full there is no is no 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.840
 compromise where you can not learn 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.820
 and falling behind 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.520
 we must note a singularity the state is 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.780
 shareholder at 15% of France yes he 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.400
 accompany you in this plan of 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.650
 restructuring which is still a 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.770
 important plan so that it is not 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.380
 shareholder at psa is then and psa he 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.660
 can not agree at all with a plan that 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.230
 also aims to guarantee the survival of 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.330
 now 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.129
 when you look at that 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.970
 you deduce what you say 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:46.599
 what the state has been with has been with air 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:48.280
 France extremely positive for 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.599
 several reasons first because we 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.370
 have practiced a stew the 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.659
 total transparency say that all the 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.169
 world was aware it was not that 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.310
 our employees 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.659
 but everyone knows about it 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.250
 situation of the company so the 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:58.659
 need to make this plan because 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.159
 then we made the commitment 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:01.419
 from the beginning trying to avoid the 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:02.979
 dismissals I had said that if he 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.870
 had to laugh and run it was recourse 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:06.099
 but if I could go fast and I 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.990
 will do everything to do it and we managed 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:10.000
 to avoid them so 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.069
 and then thirdly this plan was founded 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.349
 about social dialogue it's been for 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:16.509
 give you two three elements this has been 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:17.680
 the four men and four months of 

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:19.419
 negotiations several hundred 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.979
 meetings should reach agreements 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.180
 and so that's what makes the state 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:23.800
 behaved with you as a 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.229
 shareholder altran cif I believe that 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.610
 anyway the state supported the method that 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:28.150
 we had employed and the measures that 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.039
 we implement 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.990
 alexandre de juniac CEO of air france who 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:33.370
 advise you to look closely at 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.520
 information before you go to 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.520
 airport
