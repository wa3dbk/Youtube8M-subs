so the question you guys probably one
answer<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.590> not<00:04:23.980> assembly<00:04:24.490> quickly<00:04:24.850> worth

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
answer it is not assembly quickly worth

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.960 
answer it is not assembly quickly worth
300,000<00:04:26.320> coins<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.980> based<00:04:27.580> off<00:04:27.820> his

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
300,000 coins and based off his

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.900 
300,000 coins and based off his
attributes<00:04:28.540> not<00:04:29.320> really<00:04:29.800> probably<00:04:30.280> worth<00:04:30.669> the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
attributes not really probably worth the

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.480 
attributes not really probably worth the
same<00:04:31.210> price<00:04:31.570> as<00:04:31.840> its<00:04:32.169> 97<00:04:32.620> overall<00:04:33.070> limitation

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
same price as its 97 overall limitation

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.560 
same price as its 97 overall limitation
counterpart<00:04:33.970> which<00:04:34.120> would<00:04:34.240> be<00:04:34.330> right<00:04:34.479> around

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
counterpart which would be right around

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.360 
counterpart which would be right around
20,000<00:04:35.320> point<00:04:35.470> which<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.770> fair<00:04:35.950> price<00:04:36.130> for<00:04:36.190> a

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
20,000 point which is a fair price for a

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.800 
20,000 point which is a fair price for a
linebacker<00:04:36.729> but<00:04:37.000> going<00:04:37.240> for<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.450> same<00:04:37.660> price

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810

higher<00:04:50.530> category<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.370> think<00:04:51.639> he<00:04:51.760> may<00:04:52.000> be<00:04:52.030> a<00:04:52.120> lot

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270

faster<00:04:52.510> if<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.350> only<00:04:53.470> just<00:04:53.680> all<00:04:53.919> around

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
faster if you only just all around

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.129 
faster if you only just all around
