I have a simple fsm set up here on game
object<00:00:08.740> one<00:00:09.010> and<00:00:09.280> I<00:00:09.879> would<00:00:10.030> like<00:00:10.180> to<00:00:10.209> reuse<00:00:10.660> it

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
object one and I would like to reuse it

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.709 
object one and I would like to reuse it
exactly<00:00:11.620> as<00:00:11.830> it<00:00:11.950> is<00:00:11.980> on<00:00:12.100> game<00:00:12.519> object<00:00:12.880> to<00:00:13.179> now

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
exactly as it is on game object to now

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.120 
exactly as it is on game object to now
let's<00:00:13.900> say<00:00:14.019> I'd<00:00:14.080> created<00:00:14.290> something<00:00:14.679> really

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.130 
let's say I'd created something really

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.100 
let's say I'd created something really
important<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:15.879> I<00:00:16.000> didn't<00:00:16.209> want<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.360> redo<00:00:17.080> all

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
important and I didn't want to redo all

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.800 
important and I didn't want to redo all
that<00:00:17.410> work<00:00:17.590> there's<00:00:18.250> a<00:00:18.310> simple<00:00:18.700> way<00:00:18.730> to<00:00:19.240> save

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
that work there's a simple way to save

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.089 
that work there's a simple way to save
and<00:00:20.020> reuse<00:00:20.200> fsms<00:00:21.009> if<00:00:21.820> I<00:00:21.939> right<00:00:22.180> click<00:00:22.210> here<00:00:22.810> in

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
and reuse fsms if I right click here in

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.490 
and reuse fsms if I right click here in
the<00:00:24.099> playmaker<00:00:24.460> window<00:00:24.759> and<00:00:24.939> I<00:00:25.480> choose<00:00:25.779> save

the playmaker window and I choose save

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.299 
the playmaker window and I choose save
template<00:00:26.980> I<00:00:27.570> get<00:00:28.570> a<00:00:28.599> dialog<00:00:29.140> box<00:00:29.169> and<00:00:29.649> right

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:30.309 
template I get a dialog box and right

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.720 
template I get a dialog box and right
here<00:00:30.489> I<00:00:30.520> can<00:00:30.730> call<00:00:30.939> this<00:00:31.770> the<00:00:32.770> clock<00:00:32.980> random

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
here I can call this the clock random

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.760 
here I can call this the clock random
selector<00:00:34.420> because<00:00:35.170> that's<00:00:35.350> what<00:00:35.500> this<00:00:35.590> little

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
selector because that's what this little

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.860 
selector because that's what this little
thing<00:00:36.010> does<00:00:36.219> and<00:00:36.460> it'll<00:00:37.269> save<00:00:37.539> it<00:00:37.660> into<00:00:37.780> a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
thing does and it'll save it into a

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.139 
thing does and it'll save it into a
templates<00:00:38.379> folder<00:00:38.589> and<00:00:38.890> if<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:39.879> are

templates folder and if you are
interested<00:00:40.809> you<00:00:41.019> can<00:00:41.170> look<00:00:41.410> under<00:00:41.620> playmaker

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
interested you can look under playmaker

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.459 
interested you can look under playmaker
the<00:00:42.820> folder<00:00:43.210> here<00:00:43.329> in<00:00:43.420> your<00:00:43.539> project<00:00:43.960> under

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
the folder here in your project under

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.889 
the folder here in your project under
templates<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.280> you<00:00:45.879> will<00:00:45.999> see<00:00:46.269> that<00:00:46.719> it's

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
templates and you will see that it's

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.759 
templates and you will see that it's
saved<00:00:47.140> right<00:00:47.320> there<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:49.420> I<00:00:49.449> can<00:00:49.780> go<00:00:50.019> to<00:00:50.530> the

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
saved right there now I can go to the

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.250 
saved right there now I can go to the
second<00:00:51.219> game<00:00:51.370> object<00:00:51.820> right-click<00:00:52.749> and

second game object right-click and

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.709 
second game object right-click and
instead<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.010> just<00:00:54.129> adding<00:00:54.309> an<00:00:54.519> FSM<00:00:54.999> I<00:00:55.210> can<00:00:55.510> add

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
instead of just adding an FSM I can add

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.099 
instead of just adding an FSM I can add
a<00:00:55.989> template<00:00:56.589> and<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.969> see<00:00:58.210> random<00:00:58.690> selector

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
a template and you see random selector

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.559 
a template and you see random selector
is<00:00:59.260> available<00:00:59.890> for<00:01:00.039> me<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.339> click<00:01:01.269> an<00:01:01.390> ad<00:01:01.510> and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
is available for me I click an ad and

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.460 
is available for me I click an ad and
there<00:01:02.050> it<00:01:02.140> is<00:01:02.339> so<00:01:03.339> pretty<00:01:03.760> cool<00:01:04.030> I<00:01:04.300> can<00:01:04.690> just

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
there it is so pretty cool I can just

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.670 
there it is so pretty cool I can just
move<00:01:05.800> entire<00:01:06.550> as<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.690> can<00:01:07.810> see<00:01:07.990> it's<00:01:08.230> it's<00:01:08.560> the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
move entire as you can see it's it's the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.230 
move entire as you can see it's it's the
whole<00:01:08.890> thing<00:01:09.100> it's<00:01:09.280> got<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.610> same<00:01:09.820> like

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
whole thing it's got the same like

whole thing it's got the same like
there's<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.510> weight<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:11.530> random<00:01:11.800> pic<00:01:11.980> come

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
there's a weight and a random pic come

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.280 
there's a weight and a random pic come
in<00:01:13.060> here<00:01:13.180> it's<00:01:13.300> got<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.570> same<00:01:13.720> stuff<00:01:14.020> with<00:01:14.230> the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
in here it's got the same stuff with the

in here it's got the same stuff with the
same<00:01:14.470> values<00:01:14.860> now<00:01:15.700> it's<00:01:15.940> not<00:01:16.240> just<00:01:17.170> for<00:01:17.320> entire

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
same values now it's not just for entire

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.980 
same values now it's not just for entire
fsms<00:01:18.250> either<00:01:18.490> which<00:01:18.730> is<00:01:18.880> pretty<00:01:19.000> neat<00:01:19.270> say<00:01:19.960> I

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
fsms either which is pretty neat say I

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.110 
fsms either which is pretty neat say I
wanted<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.440> add<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.980> whole<00:01:21.310> new<00:01:21.370> state<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:21.940> do

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
wanted to add a whole new state to do

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.890 
wanted to add a whole new state to do
something<00:01:22.540> in<00:01:22.660> here<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:24.010> I<00:01:24.070> will<00:01:24.130> call<00:01:24.460> this

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
something in here and I will call this

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.650 
something in here and I will call this
whatever<00:01:25.900> new<00:01:26.560> state<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:28.090> give<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.260> color

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
whatever new state and give it a color

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.080 
whatever new state and give it a color
let's<00:01:31.660> just<00:01:31.690> make<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.020> cyan<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.920> let's<00:01:33.910> say<00:01:34.030> I

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
let's just make it cyan and let's say I

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.210 
let's just make it cyan and let's say I
have<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.300> new<00:01:34.540> event<00:01:34.780> I<00:01:35.350> just<00:01:35.710> make<00:01:35.800> an<00:01:35.920> entirely

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
have a new event I just make an entirely

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.250 
have a new event I just make an entirely
new<00:01:36.370> event<00:01:36.790> and<00:01:37.030> call<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:37.810> um<00:01:39.450> rotate<00:01:40.450> thing

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
new event and call it um rotate thing

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.330 
new event and call it um rotate thing
and<00:01:42.630> add<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.110> this<00:01:44.230> state<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:47.190> can<00:01:48.190> now

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
and add that to this state I can now

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.330 
and add that to this state I can now
save<00:01:48.790> just<00:01:49.540> this<00:01:50.170> one<00:01:50.500> state<00:01:50.890> I<00:01:50.920> could<00:01:51.220> also

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
save just this one state I could also

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.920 
save just this one state I could also
put<00:01:51.580> actions<00:01:51.940> in<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.210> do<00:01:52.300> anything<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.690> want<00:01:52.840> it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
put actions in it do anything I want it

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.760 
put actions in it do anything I want it
to<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.290> can<00:01:53.710> save<00:01:53.920> just<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.490> one<00:01:54.790> state<00:01:55.770> if

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
to it I can save just this one state if

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.650 
to it I can save just this one state if
I<00:01:56.860> come<00:01:57.010> down<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.730> save<00:01:58.000> template<00:01:58.360> which<00:01:58.510> is

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
I come down to save template which is

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.820 
I come down to save template which is
fallen<00:01:58.960> just<00:01:59.140> off<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.470> bottom<00:01:59.680> of<00:01:59.740> your

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
fallen just off the bottom of your

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.230 
fallen just off the bottom of your
screen<00:02:00.010> so<00:02:00.250> let<00:02:00.430> me<00:02:00.520> move<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.700> up<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.120> show

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
screen so let me move that up and show

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.040 
screen so let me move that up and show
you<00:02:01.300> so<00:02:02.080> i<00:02:02.110> can<00:02:02.320> save<00:02:02.590> template<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.430> once

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
you so i can save template and once

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.969 
you so i can save template and once
again<00:02:05.050> i<00:02:05.200> get<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.830> same<00:02:07.140> same<00:02:08.140> save<00:02:08.349> box<00:02:08.619> and

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
again i get the same same save box and

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.709 
again i get the same same save box and
now<00:02:09.670> i<00:02:09.700> can<00:02:09.940> choose<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:11.099> new<00:02:12.099> rotator<00:02:14.280> and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
now i can choose a new rotator and

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.880 
now i can choose a new rotator and
there's<00:02:16.719> my<00:02:16.959> thing

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
there's my thing

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.720 
there's my thing
so<00:02:18.670> let's<00:02:18.910> look<00:02:19.230> back<00:02:20.230> over<00:02:20.290> here<00:02:20.770> if<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.490> right

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
so let's look back over here if I right

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.559 
so let's look back over here if I right
click<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:23.650> look<00:02:23.800> in<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.130> add<00:02:24.459> just<00:02:25.300> that

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
click I can look in and add just that

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.140 
click I can look in and add just that
one<00:02:25.810> node<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.100> add<00:02:27.250> individual<00:02:27.880> nodes

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
one node so you can add individual nodes

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.300 
one node so you can add individual nodes
you<00:02:28.510> can<00:02:28.690> add<00:02:28.840> groups<00:02:29.319> of<00:02:29.530> nodes<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.130> could

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
you can add groups of nodes like I could

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.550 
you can add groups of nodes like I could
save<00:02:30.490> this<00:02:30.670> collection<00:02:31.300> or<00:02:31.450> if<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.530> just

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
save this collection or if you just

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.530 
save this collection or if you just
select<00:02:32.980> out<00:02:33.280> here<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.819> save<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.360> entire

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
select out here you can save the entire

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.710 
select out here you can save the entire
fsm<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.010> very<00:02:36.400> modular<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.000> very<00:02:37.450> cool

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
fsm so it's very modular and very cool

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.920 
fsm so it's very modular and very cool
way<00:02:38.020> for<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.410> put<00:02:38.650> things<00:02:38.800> together<00:02:39.930> let's

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
way for you to put things together let's

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.729 
way for you to put things together let's
take<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.170> look<00:02:41.500> at<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.310> template<00:02:42.850> browser

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
take a look at the template browser

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.530 
take a look at the template browser
template<00:02:44.739> browser<00:02:44.950> gives<00:02:45.370> us<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.880> little<00:02:46.420> more

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
template browser gives us a little more

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.570 
template browser gives us a little more
control<00:02:47.050> over<00:02:47.470> our<00:02:47.650> templates<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.370> we've

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
control over our templates that we've

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.520 
control over our templates that we've
made<00:02:48.819> you<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.810> see<00:02:49.930> I've<00:02:50.050> got<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.500> new

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
made you can see I've got the new

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.229 
made you can see I've got the new
rotator<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.400> shows<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.820> me<00:02:51.970> right<00:02:52.090> there

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
rotator it shows it to me right there

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.790 
rotator it shows it to me right there
that's<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.810> one<00:02:52.989> simple<00:02:53.380> state<00:02:53.560> and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
that's just that one simple state and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.890 
that's just that one simple state and
here's<00:02:54.280> our<00:02:54.370> random<00:02:54.700> selector<00:02:55.180> which<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.630> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
here's our random selector which is the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.479 
here's our random selector which is the
four<00:02:56.320> nodes<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:56.830> put<00:02:57.070> together<00:02:57.160> and

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
four nodes that I put together and

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.910 
four nodes that I put together and
they're<00:02:58.269> both<00:02:58.450> under<00:02:58.660> category<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.470> general

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
they're both under category of general

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.400 
they're both under category of general
and<00:03:00.850> let's<00:03:01.090> say<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.660> wanted<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.230> make<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:04.410> some

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
and let's say I wanted to make this some

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.890 
and let's say I wanted to make this some
new<00:03:05.440> category<00:03:07.350> movers<00:03:08.350> why<00:03:08.590> not<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:10.390> now

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
new category movers why not and I now

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.800 
new category movers why not and I now
have<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.500> new<00:03:12.070> set<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.550> categories<00:03:12.700> here<00:03:13.209> movers

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
have a new set of categories here movers

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.699 
have a new set of categories here movers
in<00:03:13.840> general<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:15.370> like<00:03:15.870> here<00:03:16.870> in<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.260> actions

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
in general just like here in the actions

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.070 
in general just like here in the actions
browser<00:03:17.950> if<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.910> select<00:03:19.269> on<00:03:19.510> these<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.870> get

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
browser if I select on these I get

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.660 
browser if I select on these I get
different<00:03:20.410> things<00:03:20.709> inside<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.190> them<00:03:21.310> all

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
different things inside of them all

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.830 
different things inside of them all
right<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.880> different<00:03:22.150> actions<00:03:22.420> are<00:03:22.540> listed

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
right the different actions are listed

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.870 
right the different actions are listed
so<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.350> works<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.739> same<00:03:23.920> way<00:03:23.980> if<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.700> look

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
so it works in the same way if you look

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.509 
so it works in the same way if you look
at<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.810> template<00:03:26.140> browser<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:27.160> can<00:03:27.310> add

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
at the template browser and you can add

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.460 
at the template browser and you can add
any<00:03:27.940> number<00:03:28.180> in<00:03:28.420> here<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.780> you'd<00:03:28.900> like<00:03:29.140> and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
any number in here that you'd like and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.530 
any number in here that you'd like and
you'll<00:03:30.130> see<00:03:30.340> multiple<00:03:30.700> ones<00:03:30.910> all<00:03:31.209> underneath

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
you'll see multiple ones all underneath

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.140 
you'll see multiple ones all underneath
these<00:03:31.810> categories<00:03:32.519> it's<00:03:33.519> also<00:03:33.700> very<00:03:33.880> cool

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
these categories it's also very cool

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.670 
these categories it's also very cool
because<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.570> can<00:03:34.600> dock<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.140> like<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.590> would

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
because you can dock it like you would

something<00:03:43.480> about<00:03:43.720> this<00:03:44.049> new<00:03:44.260> rotator<00:03:44.709> I've

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
something about this new rotator I've

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.280 
something about this new rotator I've
got<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.910> open<00:03:46.360> right<00:03:46.600> here<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.019> I'm<00:03:47.079> actually

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
got it open right here and I'm actually

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.710 
got it open right here and I'm actually
editing<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.400> template<00:03:48.850> I'm<00:03:49.030> not<00:03:49.239> editing

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
anything on one of these so instead of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.449 
anything on one of these so instead of
new<00:03:52.120> state<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.660> could<00:03:52.900> call<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:54.450> rotate<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:56.459> we

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
new state I could call it rotate and we

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.720 
new state I could call it rotate and we
could<00:03:57.610> put<00:03:57.730> in<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:57.910> description<00:03:58.000> this<00:03:58.959> does

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
could put in a description this does

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.229 
could put in a description this does
amazing<00:04:00.730> things<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:03.430> could<00:04:03.820> add<00:04:03.940> an<00:04:04.090> action

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
amazing things and I could add an action

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.050 
amazing things and I could add an action
even<00:04:05.110> let's<00:04:05.650> add<00:04:06.370> a<00:04:08.070> rotate<00:04:09.070> action<00:04:09.579> right

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
even let's add a rotate action right

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.319 
even let's add a rotate action right
there<00:04:10.090> into<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.310> if<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:12.610> switch<00:04:13.090> back<00:04:13.299> to

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
there into this and if I switch back to

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.030 
there into this and if I switch back to
my<00:04:13.450> window<00:04:13.780> which<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.320> probably<00:04:14.590> should<00:04:15.010> have

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
my window which I probably should have

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.870 
my window which I probably should have
docked<00:04:15.419> I<00:04:16.859> can<00:04:17.859> switch<00:04:18.039> away<00:04:18.190> see<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.760> other

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
docked I can switch away see the other

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.060 
docked I can switch away see the other
one<00:04:19.000> come<00:04:19.450> back<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.140> see<00:04:20.380> that<00:04:20.680> it<00:04:21.039> has

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
one come back and you see that it has

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.940 
one come back and you see that it has
indeed<00:04:21.489> held<00:04:22.240> on<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.660> those<00:04:22.780> updates<00:04:23.320> so<00:04:23.860> you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
indeed held on to those updates so you

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.969 
indeed held on to those updates so you
can<00:04:24.220> edit<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:25.110> template<00:04:26.110> directly<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.830> don't

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
can edit the template directly you don't

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.110 
can edit the template directly you don't
have<00:04:27.099> to<00:04:27.220> bring<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.520> out<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.729> put<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.910> on<00:04:28.000> an

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
have to bring it out and put it on an

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.700 
have to bring it out and put it on an
object<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.450> do<00:04:28.599> that<00:04:28.780> an<00:04:28.930> important

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
object to do that an important

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.390 
object to do that an important
distinction<00:04:30.010> though<00:04:30.370> if<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:31.120> look

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
distinction though if I look

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.189 
distinction though if I look
back<00:04:31.520> at<00:04:31.699> this<00:04:31.970> this<00:04:32.720> was<00:04:32.870> not<00:04:32.990> updated

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
back at this this was not updated

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.140 
back at this this was not updated
dynamically<00:04:33.979> ok<00:04:34.460> once<00:04:34.669> you've<00:04:34.820> applied<00:04:34.940> a

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
dynamically ok once you've applied a

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.240 
dynamically ok once you've applied a
template<00:04:35.660> you've<00:04:35.840> added<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.380> in<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.770> it's<00:04:37.009> no

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
template you've added it in and it's no

template you've added it in and it's no
longer<00:04:37.490> connected<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:38.750> could<00:04:39.050> really

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
longer connected but I could really

longer connected but I could really
simply<00:04:39.740> delete<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:40.370> come<00:04:41.360> back<00:04:41.479> in<00:04:41.690> and

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
simply delete that come back in and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.279 
simply delete that come back in and
paste<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.770> template<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:43.310> now<00:04:43.580> I've<00:04:43.789> got<00:04:44.289> movers

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
paste a template and now I've got movers

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.409 
paste a template and now I've got movers
in<00:04:45.500> general<00:04:45.860> which<00:04:46.280> are<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.789> two<00:04:46.940> categories

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
in general which are the two categories

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.920 
in general which are the two categories
i<00:04:47.509> set<00:04:47.720> up<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:48.190> choose<00:04:49.190> that<00:04:49.370> and<00:04:49.580> i<00:04:49.820> get<00:04:50.210> that

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
i set up and choose that and i get that

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.290 
i set up and choose that and i get that
with<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.630> action<00:04:53.630> that<00:04:53.720> was<00:04:53.810> in<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:54.050> with<00:04:54.199> the

the note i put on it with the new name
it<00:04:58.699> even<00:04:58.880> comes<00:04:58.940> in<00:04:59.210> with<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.449> event<00:04:59.720> the

it even comes in with the event the

it even comes in with the event the
rotate<00:05:00.259> thing<00:05:00.470> which<00:05:00.680> wasn't<00:05:00.919> on<00:05:01.190> this<00:05:01.880> fsm
