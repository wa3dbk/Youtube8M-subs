00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.500
Look at the child sleeping on the street
Sniffing glue, lying on the ground

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.400
That old starving there
Poor guy, with a "liter" in hand

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.400
Another kid killing for money
Look at the police in pursuit

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.200
He died less for so little
And Mr stole 1 million

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.400
There on the TV spoke of honesty
With a pocket full of corruption

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.100
Another mother who lost her son
Dreamed one day be "ace" in the selection

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.600
Not to be irony of life
Died for "playmaker" and with gun in hand

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.600
My God ...
