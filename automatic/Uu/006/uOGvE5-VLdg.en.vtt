00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
this time CA of super glue i'm going to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:24.730 
this time CA of super glue i'm going to
smut<00:03:06.379> these<00:03:06.620> guys<00:03:11.200> why<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.260> glue

with these pieces of wood and I doubt
somewhat<00:03:32.780> likely<00:03:40.900> take<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.050> other<00:03:42.170> one<00:03:42.430> take

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
somewhat likely take the other one take

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.420 
somewhat likely take the other one take
them<00:03:45.640> there'll<00:03:46.640> be<00:03:46.760> another<00:03:47.150> n<00:03:47.420> 1<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:49.280> will

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
them there'll be another n 1 this will

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:59.220 
them there'll be another n 1 this will
be<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:49.670> middle<00:03:51.160> what<00:03:52.160> glue<00:03:52.460> on<00:03:52.610> these<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:57.280> now

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
be the middle what glue on these and now

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.140 
be the middle what glue on these and now
it<00:04:00.230> is<00:04:00.290> time<00:04:00.830> for<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:02.090> rails<00:04:03.730> now<00:04:04.730> no<00:04:04.970> Mia

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:25.690 
take all my rails and there are about
even<00:04:17.870> length<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.980> I'm<00:04:21.980> going<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:24.430> just<00:04:25.430> line

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
even length and I'm going to just line

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:38.559 
even length and I'm going to just line
them<00:04:25.910> up<00:04:28.540> on<00:04:29.540> here

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:45.320 

okay<00:04:39.569> so<00:04:40.050> um<00:04:41.419> that's<00:04:42.419> like<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.870> now<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:44.330> it's

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
okay so um that's like that now and it's

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.909 
okay so um that's like that now and it's
kind<00:04:45.660> of<00:04:45.690> simulated<00:04:46.259> that<00:04:46.410> they<00:04:46.560> use<00:04:46.740> about

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
kind of simulated that they use about

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.490 
kind of simulated that they use about
half<00:04:46.979> half<00:04:47.849> of<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.120> pieces<00:04:48.360> of<00:04:48.630> rail<00:04:48.840> since<00:04:49.410> I

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
half half of the pieces of rail since I

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.400 
half half of the pieces of rail since I
actually<00:04:49.919> ran<00:04:50.280> out<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:52.020> looks<00:04:52.169> like<00:04:52.259> they

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
actually ran out and it looks like they

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.809 
actually ran out and it looks like they
used<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.680> have<00:04:52.800> them<00:04:53.009> and<00:04:53.220> just<00:04:53.430> put<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.729> last

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
used to have them and just put the last

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.360 
used to have them and just put the last
piece<00:04:53.970> across<00:04:54.660> like<00:04:54.930> that<00:04:54.979> so<00:04:55.979> that'll<00:04:56.280> be

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
piece across like that so that'll be

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.110 
piece across like that so that'll be
nice<00:04:56.520> when<00:04:56.759> it<00:04:56.880> dries<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:59.250> little<00:04:59.849> bit<00:04:59.970> more

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
nice when it dries and a little bit more

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.710 
nice when it dries and a little bit more
