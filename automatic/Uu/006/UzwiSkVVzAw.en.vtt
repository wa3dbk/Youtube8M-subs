00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
variant and then obviously like a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.700 
variant and then obviously like a
blackberry<00:00:20.820> no<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.300> gold<00:00:21.660> aren't<00:00:21.960> actually<00:00:22.260> so

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
blackberry no I gold aren't actually so

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.439 
blackberry no I gold aren't actually so
gold<00:00:22.920> variant<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.609> basically<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> variant<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
gold variant is basically a variant the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.269 
gold variant is basically a variant the
silver<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.529> same<00:00:25.830> kind<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.070> color

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
silver in this the same kind of color

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.740 
silver in this the same kind of color
set<00:00:26.490> up<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.670> think<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:26.970> were<00:00:27.420> running<00:00:27.720> with

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
set up I think they were running with

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.390 
set up I think they were running with
the<00:00:27.900> iphone<00:00:28.260> 5s<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> seems<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:29.369> are

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the iphone 5s so it seems like they are

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.160 
the iphone 5s so it seems like they are
going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> same<00:00:30.179> thing<00:00:30.539> maybe<00:00:30.840> with

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
going to do the same thing maybe with

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.090 
going to do the same thing maybe with
the<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:32.730> iphone<00:00:33.210> sex<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.590> they<00:00:34.829> wouldn't

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the the iphone sex so that they wouldn't

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.860 
the the iphone sex so that they wouldn't
ditch<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.640> immediately<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.570> would<00:00:36.719> be

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
ditch that immediately that would be

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.010 
ditch that immediately that would be
kind<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.200> nice<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.750> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
kind of nice so you can see a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.510 
kind of nice so you can see a
gold-colored<00:00:40.770> here<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.100> front<00:00:41.309> side<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
gold-colored here on the front side and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.420 
gold-colored here on the front side and
it<00:00:41.940> specifically<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> touch<00:00:43.260> ID<00:00:43.620> sound<00:00:44.280> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it specifically the touch ID sound so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
it specifically the touch ID sound so
it's<00:00:44.789> actually<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.660> these<00:00:45.780> different

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's actually on all of these different

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.200 
it's actually on all of these different
colors<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.129> which<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.550> probably<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.149> little

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
colors here which is probably a little

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.729 
colors here which is probably a little
bit<00:00:48.360> running<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.719> problem<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> benedita<00:00:49.469> but

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
