officially I mean we knew it we saw it
coming<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.279> mean<00:00:26.430> they<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.939> annually<00:00:27.480> now

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
coming I mean they do this annually now

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.019 
coming I mean they do this annually now
so<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.460> huge<00:00:29.640> surprise

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
so it's not like it's a huge surprise

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179 
so it's not like it's a huge surprise
but<00:00:30.390> they<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.779> some<00:00:30.960> features<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.830> let's<00:00:32.070> go

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
but they have some features so let's go

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
but they have some features so let's go
over<00:00:32.219> them<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.270> first<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.290> story

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
over them so first of all the story

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.950 
over them so first of all the story
seems<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.070> about<00:00:35.250> Garak<00:00:36.149> still<00:00:36.780> being

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

there's gonna be like a constructed
format<00:02:29.580> now<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:31.410> way<00:02:31.560> did<00:02:31.770> they<00:02:31.950> say<00:02:32.250> these

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
format now the way did they say these

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.800 
format now the way did they say these
things<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:32.880> always<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.330> bit<00:02:33.570> fake

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
things it's always a little bit fake

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.480

when<00:02:34.170> when<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> first<00:02:34.770> information<00:02:35.370> is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
when when the first information is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.480 
when when the first information is
coming<00:02:35.640> out<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.500> not<00:02:37.680> even<00:02:37.980> clear<00:02:38.190> that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
coming out so it's not even clear that

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.170 
coming out so it's not even clear that
we<00:02:38.640> still<00:02:38.880> have<00:02:39.120> our<00:02:39.320> normal<00:02:40.320> Jules<00:02:41.180> format

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
let's say are pretty balanced format is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.880 
let's say are pretty balanced format is
what<00:02:44.970> I'm<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.270> gonna<00:02:45.390> call<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.500> suppose

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
jewels game now who knows it could just

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.050 
jewels game now who knows it could just
be<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.950> will<00:03:47.070> replace<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.370> sealed<00:03:47.820> like

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
be that it will replace a sealed like

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.730 
be that it will replace a sealed like
seals<00:03:48.390> replaced<00:03:48.600> playing<00:03:49.170> chase<00:03:49.470> like

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
seals replaced playing chase like

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.040 
seals replaced playing chase like
playing<00:03:50.040> chase<00:03:50.250> replace<00:03:50.760> their<00:03:51.060> archenemy

playing chase replace their archenemy

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.910 
playing chase replace their archenemy
etc<00:03:53.040> which<00:03:53.580> honestly<00:03:54.180> I'm<00:03:54.840> gonna<00:03:55.560> catch

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
etc which honestly I'm gonna catch

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.190 
etc which honestly I'm gonna catch
that's<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> case<00:03:56.550> but<00:03:56.850> no<00:03:57.570> one<00:03:57.750> knows<00:03:57.900> right

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
that's the case but no one knows right

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.440 
that's the case but no one knows right
so<00:03:58.560> definitely<00:03:59.520> not<00:03:59.820> an<00:03:59.940> informed<00:04:00.390> guess

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
so definitely not an informed guess

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.580 
so definitely not an informed guess
they're<00:04:00.950> either<00:04:01.950> way<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.320> still<00:04:04.560> a

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
they're either way it is it is still a

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.260 
they're either way it is it is still a
question<00:04:04.800> whether<00:04:05.670> we<00:04:05.880> can<00:04:06.000> unlock

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
question whether we can unlock

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.120 
question whether we can unlock
everything<00:04:06.630> by<00:04:07.020> just<00:04:07.290> playing<00:04:07.470> through<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.800> or

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
everything by just playing through it or

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.100 
everything by just playing through it or
if<00:04:08.340> some<00:04:08.610> stuff<00:04:08.850> is<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.180> only<00:04:09.660> going<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.020> be

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
if some stuff is just only going to be

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.320 
if some stuff is just only going to be
available<00:04:10.980> if<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.220> actually<00:04:11.400> pay<00:04:11.730> for<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.090> but

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
available if you actually pay for it but

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.230 
available if you actually pay for it but
I<00:04:13.320> mean<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.730> those<00:04:14.880> things<00:04:15.090> that

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
I mean this is one of those things that

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.120 
I mean this is one of those things that
if<00:04:15.450> they<00:04:15.600> do<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.870> right<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.350> can<00:04:16.530> be<00:04:16.650> really<00:04:16.920> fun

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
if they do it right it can be really fun

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.400 
if they do it right it can be really fun
if<00:04:17.160> they<00:04:17.459> do<00:04:17.520> it<00:04:17.670> wrong<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.270> it<00:04:19.020> could<00:04:19.200> drive

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
if they do it wrong and it could drive

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.860 
if they do it wrong and it could drive
me<00:04:19.620> away<00:04:19.920> from<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> game<00:04:20.520> and<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:21.359> assume<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.750> lot

doesn't matter those are the decks you
should<00:05:24.440> be<00:05:24.560> building<00:05:24.770> so<00:05:25.099> then<00:05:25.699> there's<00:05:26.270> no

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
should be building so then there's no

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.689 
should be building so then there's no
point<00:05:26.630> in<00:05:26.960> having<00:05:27.080> constructed<00:05:27.650> in<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.460> first

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
point in having constructed in the first

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.060 
point in having constructed in the first
place<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.690> that's<00:05:29.900> that's<00:05:30.229> that's<00:05:30.530> one<00:05:30.830> thing

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
place so that's that's that's one thing

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.520 
place so that's that's that's one thing
that<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.490> hope<00:05:31.930> that<00:05:32.930> there's<00:05:33.110> gonna<00:05:33.199> be<00:05:33.349> a<00:05:33.380> lot

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
that I hope that there's gonna be a lot

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.170 
that I hope that there's gonna be a lot
of<00:05:33.590> cards<00:05:33.919> also<00:05:34.220> it's<00:05:34.669> not<00:05:34.729> gonna<00:05:35.000> be<00:05:35.150> like

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
of cards also it's not gonna be like

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.930 
of cards also it's not gonna be like
some<00:05:35.900> kind<00:05:36.110> of<00:05:36.169> pay2win<00:05:36.949> kind<00:05:37.639> of<00:05:37.759> thing

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
some kind of pay2win kind of thing

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.810 
some kind of pay2win kind of thing
because<00:05:38.120> that's<00:05:38.780> why<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:38.960> play<00:05:39.229> Jules<00:05:40.220> it's
