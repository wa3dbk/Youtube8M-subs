let all three of these you can do all
three<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.190> these<00:02:15.340> all<00:02:15.580> over<00:02:15.610> your<00:02:15.940> head<00:02:16.120> or

just in certain areas where you want
certain<00:02:18.190> looks<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.760> that's<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.020> give

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
certain looks and that's going to give

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.720 
certain looks and that's going to give
you<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.380> completely<00:02:20.860> different<00:02:21.220> look<00:02:21.460> from

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
you a completely different look from

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.930 
you a completely different look from
your<00:02:21.910> normal<00:02:22.270> natural<00:02:22.720> curl
