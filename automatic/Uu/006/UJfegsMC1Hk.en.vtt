00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
quickly he is not as scary as Tony Romo

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.780 
quickly he is not as scary as Tony Romo
wanted<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.560> talk<00:03:06.680> about<00:03:06.709> scariest<00:03:07.280> scariness

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
the Falcon strength they can run the

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.020 
the Falcon strength they can run the
football<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.770> Giants<00:04:31.250> are<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.460> passing<00:04:31.849> team

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
football the Giants are the passing team

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.629 
football the Giants are the passing team
that<00:04:32.510> they<00:04:32.720> hope<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:33.229> is<00:04:33.380> ideal<00:04:33.710> situations

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
that they hope that is ideal situations

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.550 
that they hope that is ideal situations
so<00:04:34.970> they<00:04:35.060> can<00:04:35.210> throw<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.389> football<00:04:35.570> I'm<00:04:36.169> going

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
so they can throw the football I'm going

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.839 
so they can throw the football I'm going
with<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.830> Falcons<00:04:37.190> in<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.370> game<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:37.669> like

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
with the Falcons in this game I like

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:38.980 
with the Falcons in this game I like
what<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.150> fellas<00:04:38.450> bring<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.750> table<00:04:38.840> I

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
what the fellas bring to the table I

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.450 
what the fellas bring to the table I
think<00:04:39.200> they<00:04:39.289> give<00:04:39.470> back<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:39.950> mindset<00:04:40.280> of

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
think they give back to that mindset of

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.310 
think they give back to that mindset of
running<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.789> football<00:04:40.940> and<00:04:41.330> chewing<00:04:42.050> up<00:04:42.289> the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
running the football and chewing up the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.890 
running the football and chewing up the
clock<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:42.800> forcing<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.789> Giants<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.330> maximize

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
clock and forcing the Giants to maximize

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.480 
clock and forcing the Giants to maximize
their<00:04:45.200> own<00:04:45.469> possessions<00:04:46.010> so<00:04:46.159> it's<00:04:46.310> going<00:04:46.400> to

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
their own possessions so it's going to
