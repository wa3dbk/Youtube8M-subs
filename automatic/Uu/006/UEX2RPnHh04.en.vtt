00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.960
 we defined she said and you've been fishing this year put on the 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.609
 chain 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.609
 very quickly the page I will make a makeup and words 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:17.199
 so% estimated that one of the beacons two damsels arfa it's about melanie 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.560
 thiebaut princess and he has this jump so here for 100 th 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 this is the message I realized 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.800
 I know a lot about the active thing before tomorrow that I did not have too much 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.160
 high 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.860
 the cpt terra and so to which I worked is a makeup that can 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.230
 to hit in a color 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.840
 yet with some patterns are a completely black makeup 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.460
 so we tried to do a good mix between the two 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.400
 and find a good marriage of colors to prove something gone out of three 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.239
 bright colors of the rose 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.660
 yellow and various traffics 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.720
 and then I added at least and small dots e and drawings for the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.860
 steel box gave way to your imagination and that's from what 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.860
 it gives 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.570
 and not yet added mascara 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.010
 it does not matter the principle was to really show e an alliance of 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.719
 colors 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.130
 whew 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.730
 hagetmau et cetera so she played however keep cayenne so you have 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.320
 Bazin 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.760
 and if to achieve this makeup you are going to need he left a base 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.940
 not like j 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.909
 from mexico these felines to get involved with a beautiful 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.840
 vgc 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.860
 in the inner corner and below so I used to next week 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.680
 indicated that it was 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.870
 you have a need obviously 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.790
 to skid on referenced sites 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.250
 the girl 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.600
 not a shout rihanna on your eyebrows 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.740
 already done beforehand 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.340
 this case rather following and you will need a palette of 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.710
 different colors so here's my occurrence I think I'm 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.710
 headed to the reds and yellows which is a little bit of 0 6 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.300
 you will need 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 but there is a little more than a pencil 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.979
 if that of chile I just read 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.139
 the italian trio 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.510
 and therefore say that I will also use the palette of oblates palette 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.059
 hickey or who gathers 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.059
 at the end 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.149
 I gradually climb the color 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.669
 practically pear 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.669
 until his style 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.049
 and you're going to go up jumpel 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.549
 Paris 6 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.479
 so here I blackened the underside of the eye it is confused with the glass there 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.809
 do not really see that it's input 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.629
 but it must be 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.669
 on the other hand at that level, so to fish 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.749
 draw a line why am I going to apply black makeup 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:01.890
 on the upper part 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.530
 of the haye and so I would like that to bring the enlargement of the haye and 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.530
 that it brings a form here a little more feline 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.549
 I join the palette and we will listen to it 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.359
 and so for 100 th I will choose I think 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.599
 the color of libertines 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.749
 so what is paid dear my father 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:26.900
 she needed all frankness we do not see him especially ashamed 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.860
 it's a pity of the farthest with glare 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.860
 but you have to knock down 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.240
 add a little bit more hard for them 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.240
 I wish that it slams a little more 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:58.409
 and now 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.409
 a near future that an hour 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.870
 the route entered 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.699
 like this one 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.089
 just that on the outside 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.490
 and you go 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.490
 join us 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:36.919
 in this way so act 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.589
 very simple it has to join 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.680
 so now what are we going to do 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.680
 it's con to come 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.620
 serve 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
 and I did something homogeneous 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:07.089
 for example something growing that goes from the smallest to the biggest 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.240
 you will come to have fun 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.270
 one of the small reasons like this 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.270
 so here is the result 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.289
 and so here is a makeup and mockery simple to achieve harvest 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:30.149
 but to look after the points where you can even do over 

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.940
 eyebrows 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.260
 it's coming up till then I still wanted something that I like 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.009
 but relatively discreet 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.400
 because they because if not this time it's this advantage can not 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.860
 invent with the people 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.839
 the nice little word animal I hope it attracts the summer months the country 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.629
 the winger 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:52.159
 and then he is also forever you have questions you do not hesitate as 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.880
 usually 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.249
 lg you feel that one day and I made plenty of provisions 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.919
 How's it going, girls
