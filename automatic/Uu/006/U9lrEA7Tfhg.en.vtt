put some lining in and it'll look just

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.060

simplistic<00:02:05.579> from<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.840> feel<00:02:07.079> where

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
simplistic from you I just feel where

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.690 
simplistic from you I just feel where
they<00:02:07.409> decided<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.860> go<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> white<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
they decided to go with the white and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.430 
they decided to go with the white and
stick<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.259> looks

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
stick with it and I think it looks

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
stick with it and I think it looks
fantastic<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> lower<00:02:11.580> body<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.599> legs

the<00:02:15.840> forearms<00:02:16.530> could<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.770> been<00:02:16.890> terrible

the forearms could have been terrible

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.980 
the forearms could have been terrible
with<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.580> claws<00:02:17.820> but<00:02:18.120> instead<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.600> claws<00:02:18.780> are

out<00:04:48.410> there<00:04:48.620> they've<00:04:49.160> done<00:04:49.310> a<00:04:49.370> good<00:04:49.550> job<00:04:49.610> of

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
out there they've done a good job of

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.129 
out there they've done a good job of

more to come as we all know but think of

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.689 
more to come as we all know but think of
how<00:04:53.870> many<00:04:53.930> HG<00:04:54.440> AC<00:04:54.650> kits<00:04:55.130> there<00:04:55.370> could<00:04:55.669> be

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
how many HG AC kits there could be
