00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
totally like this Apache Otto which is

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.940 
totally like this Apache Otto which is
much<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.270> technical<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.229> don't<00:01:34.439> know<00:01:34.590> in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
much more technical and I don't know in

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.190 
much more technical and I don't know in
what<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.549> level<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> are<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:36.990> far<00:01:37.170> as

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
what on what level you are but as far as

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
what on what level you are but as far as
the<00:01:37.380> sonatas<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.490> try<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.729> eat<00:01:38.850> flat

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
probably the e-flat is that it has a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
probably the e-flat is that it has a
very<00:01:41.070> very<00:01:41.549> difficult<00:01:41.820> piano<00:01:42.299> part<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.500> you
