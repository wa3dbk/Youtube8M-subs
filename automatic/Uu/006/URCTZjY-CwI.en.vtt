00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
today we're going to show you how to mix

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.660 
today we're going to show you how to mix
and<00:00:04.310> apply<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:06.089> epoxy<00:00:06.299> waterproofer<00:00:07.639> to<00:00:08.639> a

mixing ratio is 3 to 1 we supply it in
full<00:00:29.490> unit<00:00:29.880> quantities<00:00:30.500> but<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.650> don't<00:00:31.890> have

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
full unit quantities but you don't have

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.700 
full unit quantities but you don't have
to<00:00:32.219> mix<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.940> use<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.840> whole<00:00:34.020> unit<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.559> one

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to mix it and use the whole unit at one

with<00:01:11.220> color<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:12.030> gonna<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> look<00:01:12.720> down

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
with color just gonna have a look down

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.300 
with color just gonna have a look down
of<00:01:13.290> color<00:01:14.750> these<00:01:15.750> color<00:01:16.080> packs<00:01:16.409> are<00:01:16.680> made<00:01:16.860> for

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
of color these color packs are made for

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.999 
of color these color packs are made for
the<00:01:17.430> gallon<00:01:17.820> units<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.439> buy<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> gallon

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the gallon units so if you buy a gallon

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.460 
the gallon units so if you buy a gallon
unit<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.030> would<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.540> color<00:01:21.780> packed<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
unit you would get one color packed and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.830 
unit you would get one color packed and
you<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:23.159> simply<00:01:23.400> mix<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> into<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.360> Part<00:01:24.659> A

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you would simply mix it into the Part A

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.170 
you would simply mix it into the Part A
and<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.590> would<00:01:25.680> pick<00:01:25.920> them<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> system<00:01:26.670> if

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and it would pick them out the system if

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
and it would pick them out the system if
you<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.750> gray<00:01:28.020> wall<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.740> don't<00:01:28.920> want

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you have a gray wall and you don't want

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.730 
you have a gray wall and you don't want
a<00:01:29.100> clear<00:01:29.340> product<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.689> wall<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.710> can

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
a clear product on the wall you can

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.539 
a clear product on the wall you can
always<00:01:32.070> add<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> pigment<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> part<00:01:33.689> edge

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
always add the pigment to the part edge

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.560 
always add the pigment to the part edge
ok<00:01:35.549> we're<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> mix<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:39.150> mix<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
ok we're going to mix this up and mix it

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.179 
ok we're going to mix this up and mix it
well<00:01:40.369> for<00:01:41.369> two<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:41.670> three<00:01:41.880> minutes<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
well for two or three minutes so that it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:57.910 
well for two or three minutes so that it
all<00:01:44.310> comes<00:01:45.560> one<00:01:46.560> color

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.550 

okay<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.910> mix<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.510> color<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.990> nice<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
okay we have a mix the color is nice and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
okay we have a mix the color is nice and
gray<00:02:06.890> we're<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.100> take<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.780> it's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
gray we're going to take it and it's

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.180 
gray we're going to take it and it's
very<00:02:10.110> thick<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.979> doesn't<00:02:11.370> sag<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:13.190> we're

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
very thick it doesn't sag and we're

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.140 
very thick it doesn't sag and we're
going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.340> apply<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.670> nice<00:02:15.150> big<00:02:16.790> layer<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.970> it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
going to apply a nice big layer of it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.820 
going to apply a nice big layer of it
over<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.959> crack<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:20.010> bridge<00:02:20.340> it

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
over that crack so that we bridge it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.620 
over that crack so that we bridge it
we're<00:02:22.830> going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> overlap<00:02:23.459> on<00:02:23.820> both<00:02:24.030> sides<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
we're going to overlap on both sides the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:34.010 
we're going to overlap on both sides the
crack<00:02:28.489> fill<00:02:29.489> those<00:02:29.700> little<00:02:30.030> holes<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.480> we

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
crack fill those little holes and we

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.750 
crack fill those little holes and we
usually<00:02:34.320> start<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.800> at<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.130> bottom<00:02:35.580> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
usually start this at the bottom and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.930 
usually start this at the bottom and
work<00:02:36.150> your<00:02:36.390> way<00:02:36.450> up<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.459> want<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.820> make

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
work your way up but you want to make

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:50.980 
work your way up but you want to make
sure<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.660> work<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.050> material<00:02:40.230> in

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.030 

and<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.740> will<00:02:51.920> take<00:02:52.160> approximately<00:02:52.660> 24<00:02:53.660> to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
and this will take approximately 24 to

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.260 
and this will take approximately 24 to
48<00:02:55.040> hours<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.760> harden<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.360> once<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.380> hardens

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
48 hours to harden and once it hardens

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.530 
48 hours to harden and once it hardens
no<00:02:59.270> mortar<00:02:59.690> will<00:02:59.840> penetrate<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.590> crack<00:03:01.540> now
