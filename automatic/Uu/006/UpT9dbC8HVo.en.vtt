 once they have done this they will have a 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.980
 compressed file like this that we're 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.980
 watching here 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.640

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.820
 we have tested this on both windows 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:15.780
 xp windows 7 windows 8 and the process is 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.780
 it's exactly the same 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.280
 ok once the installation runs 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.580
 let's go install what is the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.800

 once we have this window because 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.810

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.720
 select here where it says firmware 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:20.530

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.440
 upgrade 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.139

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.479
 I do not have the tablet connected 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.639
 and here he will give me exactly the 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.379
 indications true let's go if the 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.909
