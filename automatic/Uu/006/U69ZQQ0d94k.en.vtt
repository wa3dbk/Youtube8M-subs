00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.480
 Markus Johann from Mertesdorf near Trier is one of the eyewitnesses on the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.190
 Returning from work he has an unusual encounter I had that 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.830
 thought voices collected to or Versace city it is not in any case 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.309
 Not 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.539
 Look closely at the disc 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.579
 it will be exciting start 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.679
 But nothing has done you have sometime made a turn must be skeptical I have 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.689
 only then seen a ghost but quickly was Markus Johann 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.160
 for sure 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.110
 it was a cat of the Jaguar family that no one was saying so well 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.880
 who used to work with big cats in the past 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.030
 Bacchus Johann Patio Custom door he can not understand that the upper one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.360
 Conservation Authority the animal after consultation with experts from the zoo 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.810
 Neuwied has given to conclusion 2 there are finally alternatives I have 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.730
 with that to the doctor 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.990
 Say Fred Spirit of the 9-headed 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.760
 and he only had one live trap for beavers in size but there are 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.320
 also for big cats a corresponding life trap 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.950
 and such a living trap he now mixed with colleagues among other things questions 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.440
 or could get that 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.980
 and then over here to Waldrach us Forstrevier could separate with a 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.320
 Lamb or a goat could be attracted to the panther and then in the life- 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.320
 Stun trap 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.870
 that is even safer than hunting says Markus Johann for the Ministry of the Environment 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.310
 on the other hand, targeted shooting is the only measure 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.990
 There is even a possible new home for the Panther the Eifelpark 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.810
 in Gondorf would quickly create space says the technical director 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.380
 That's why the hosts are going to us Poland and Werner Esser with the demands of the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.179
 Weir and shuffles recently have in the Valley of the Wolves so this area is called 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.380
 which housed and there you would build a department and the counter 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.250
 Providing a home that is a natural area are therefore something 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.470
 runs here are in natural tones have jumped shading so I think 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.229
 that's very close to what he is in the wild on 4 5 the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.729
 Park visitors would definitely appreciate the animal staying alive 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.049
 and coming to Bonndorf there is of course the most optimal solution 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.610
 if it can be so absorbed animals 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.310
 Of course that is ten times better than we all else so many there are many 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.319
 why should it be a final report of a less 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.109
 complete the internet 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.779
 if not dangerous he is still off
