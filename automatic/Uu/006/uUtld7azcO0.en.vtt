which<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.650> very<00:01:58.860> important<00:01:59.310> especially

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
which can be very important especially

kick boots come with the fourth element
in<00:02:05.130> soul<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:06.119> used<00:02:06.330> in<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.690> wet<00:02:06.840> boots<00:02:07.940> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
in soul that's used in the wet boots so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.740 
in soul that's used in the wet boots so
this<00:02:09.510> will<00:02:09.690> also<00:02:09.840> improve<00:02:10.580> comfort<00:02:11.660> for<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
this will also improve comfort for the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.420 
this will also improve comfort for the
diver

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
diver

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.309 
diver
especially<00:02:15.150> when<00:02:15.239> carrying<00:02:15.540> heavy<00:02:15.810> equipment

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
especially when carrying heavy equipment

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.039 
especially when carrying heavy equipment
as<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.950> quite<00:02:17.250> much<00:02:17.489> greater<00:02:17.819> support<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
as is quite much greater support of the

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.800 
as is quite much greater support of the
foot<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.640> instead

it's made with suspenders or braces

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.880 
it's made with suspenders or braces
basically<00:02:26.069> which<00:02:26.610> allows<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:28.200> better<00:02:28.590> fit

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
basically which allows the a better fit

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.130 
basically which allows the a better fit
because<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.490> telescopic<00:02:29.880> torso<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:31.080> the
