00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:16.750
 with a 7 a lot to get a 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.340
 feeling that we expect and now proceeds 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.340
 to try to do everything possible to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:37.450
 the elements is just a pride 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.350
 be able to share and be between hawk with 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.000
 players to select us is for me 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.129
 it's very nice, share with it that 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.870
 learn and it's going to be a healthy competition 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.579
 and that's going to help the group so that 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.309
 be stronger and be able to fight in the 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.309
 championship from teams 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.210
 what is it done for? 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.129
 we just made a very good one 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.740
 preseason we are made to say 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.479
 that we all want to achieve what he does 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.610
 a lot is not achieved among the people 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.740
 institution and also reach the maximum 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.479
 we competitions for that we did 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.990
 a good preseason and we are now 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.990
 giving 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.730
 I this institution also like the blue 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.920
 all play wants to stay here I was 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.690
 one of those works grace and god I 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.100
 gave the opportunity the teacher and good 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.920
 try to make the most of life 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.470
 communicates referent to contribute what 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:48.380
 does and even more to help you have 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:53.630
 Certain advantage of course is difficult 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.240
 by the 90s I think that when a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.640
 tournament always starts from scratch in one 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.300
 New preseason looks for a new 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.010
 objective and I believe that it surpasses any 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.869
 you always have to fight in good shape 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.240
 with colleagues and we can do that 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.240
 make him more motivated now that they make three 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.160
 tournaments for the blue cross and therefore 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.830
 greater turnover of the campus if that is 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.660
 good for everyone out there now is 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.510
 a player that stays out and I can not 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.850
 put league has the other one to demonstrate 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.890
 who is where they need it 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.230
 many actions found the situation 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.550
 of crisis now as Mexicans but the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.060
 situation from the end of argentina 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.590
 He says 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.349
 are are two different things training 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.030
 Argentina grace gave now I was given a 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.650
 update I'm very happy very 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.750
 proud also of belonging to this 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.720
 country and the truth has are things 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.670
 different but happy to be able 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.080
 play as a Mexican and now to see everything 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.080
 from me to get there 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.549
 it could have been won but good in the 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.939
 football when you do not do some things in 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.939
 the North
