00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.410 

as<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.710> even<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> main<00:01:05.430> menu<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
as you can see even on the main menu is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380 
as you can see even on the main menu is
still<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.800> frame<00:01:08.160> rate<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.550> very<00:01:08.670> low<00:01:08.970> but

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
still it the frame rate is very low but

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.760 
still it the frame rate is very low but
it<00:01:09.510> still<00:01:09.720> runs<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.440> I<00:01:10.470> would<00:01:10.560> consider

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it still runs at what I would consider

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
it still runs at what I would consider
full<00:01:11.340> speed<00:01:11.870> for<00:01:12.870> the<00:01:13.110> game<00:01:14.040> time<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:14.550> least

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
full speed for the game time at least

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.270 
full speed for the game time at least
game<00:01:15.060> speed<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.260> let's<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.800> mission<00:01:17.490> select

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
game speed so let's do mission select

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
the cuts the the cutscene let's skip it

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.660 
the cuts the the cutscene let's skip it
and<00:03:50.409> I'll<00:03:50.799> show<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.430> gameplay

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
and I'll show you that the gameplay

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:59.870 
and I'll show you that the gameplay
actually<00:03:52.269> works<00:03:52.510> too

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.260 

so<00:04:01.980> I'm<00:04:02.980> looking<00:04:03.220> around<00:04:03.520> the<00:04:03.850> camera

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
so I'm looking around the camera

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.400 
so I'm looking around the camera
everything's<00:04:05.200> fine<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:06.930> can't<00:04:07.930> really<00:04:08.110> play

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
everything's fine I can't really play

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.040 
everything's fine I can't really play
with<00:04:08.710> one<00:04:08.980> hand<00:04:09.280> but<00:04:09.640> I'll<00:04:10.000> move<00:04:10.420> around<00:04:10.750> for

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
with one hand but I'll move around for

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.860 
with one hand but I'll move around for
you<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:11.440> you<00:04:11.530> can<00:04:11.710> see<00:04:12.480> left<00:04:14.400> forward

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
you so you can see left forward

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.390 
you so you can see left forward
everything's<00:04:16.870> working<00:04:17.290> as<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.590> should

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
everything's working as it should

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.960 
everything's working as it should
so<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:20.389> still<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:21.460> wouldn't<00:04:22.460> consider<00:04:22.729> it<00:04:22.880> a

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
so it's still I wouldn't consider it a

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.270 
so it's still I wouldn't consider it a
playable<00:04:23.300> framerate<00:04:23.660> but<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.410> game<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.949> at

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
playable framerate but the game is at

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.969 
playable framerate but the game is at
least<00:04:25.490> running<00:04:25.790> out<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.000> playable<00:04:26.449> speed<00:04:26.979> it's

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
least running out of playable speed it's

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.840 
least running out of playable speed it's
full<00:04:28.550> speed<00:04:28.790> as<00:04:29.120> far<00:04:29.330> as<00:04:29.479> I<00:04:29.600> can<00:04:29.660> tell<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:31.520> I'm

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
full speed as far as I can tell so I'm

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.550 
full speed as far as I can tell so I'm
just<00:04:32.060> gonna<00:04:32.150> quit<00:04:32.479> the<00:04:32.600> game<00:04:32.750> with<00:04:32.960> an<00:04:33.110> alt<00:04:33.320> f4
