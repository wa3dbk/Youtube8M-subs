fishing<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:33.120> catfish<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:34.200> can't<00:00:34.770> imagine<00:00:34.860> why

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
fishing for catfish I can't imagine why

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.380 
fishing for catfish I can't imagine why
you<00:00:35.280> were<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> use<00:00:35.940> them<00:00:36.059> for<00:00:36.090> anything

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you were going to use them for anything

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290 
you were going to use them for anything
else<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.190> work<00:00:38.550> pretty<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:38.879> for

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
else but they do work pretty well for

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.990 
else but they do work pretty well for
Griff<00:00:39.450> fishing<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.800> don't<00:00:41.579> use<00:00:41.700> them<00:00:41.850> all<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
Griff fishing I don't use them all the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.540 
Griff fishing I don't use them all the
time<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.870> there<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.469> occasions<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.219> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
time but there are on occasions that I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
time but there are on occasions that I
do<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:44.969> them<00:00:45.120> pretty<00:00:45.329> heavily<00:00:45.510> especially<00:00:46.140> in

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
do use them pretty heavily especially in

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.170 
do use them pretty heavily especially in
the<00:00:46.590> wintertime<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.940> show<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the wintertime so I'm going to show you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180 
the wintertime so I'm going to show you
how<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> make<00:00:48.629> these<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.230> they're<00:00:50.039> pretty

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
how to make these and they're pretty

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520 
how to make these and they're pretty
simple<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> make<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.539> will<00:00:51.690> reduce<00:00:52.170> your

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
simple to make and they will reduce your

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.240 
simple to make and they will reduce your
probability<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.219> getting<00:00:53.370> snagged<00:00:55.129> all<00:00:56.129> right

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
probability of getting snagged all right

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.130 
probability of getting snagged all right
so<00:00:56.460> I've<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.579> 40<00:00:57.030> pound<00:00:57.270> leader<00:00:57.510> line<00:00:57.780> here

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
so I've got 40 pound leader line here

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
so I've got 40 pound leader line here
and<00:00:58.350> I've<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.579> egg<00:00:59.969> sinker<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.750> can

you want to do then you would just put

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.140 
you want to do then you would just put
your<00:01:54.850> correct<00:01:55.850> amount<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:56.810> sinkers<00:01:58.240> onto<00:02:01.150> your

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
your correct amount of sinkers onto your

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.180 
your correct amount of sinkers onto your
leader<00:02:02.420> line<00:02:02.690> here<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:03.440> I'm<00:02:03.590> going<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.800> put<00:02:04.040> me

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
leader line here so I'm going to put me

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.060 
leader line here so I'm going to put me
about<00:02:05.920> six<00:02:06.920> or<00:02:07.190> eight<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.550> them<00:02:07.729> on<00:02:07.850> here<00:02:09.070> just

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
about six or eight of them on here just

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.520 
about six or eight of them on here just
so<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.310> could<00:02:10.399> show<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.820> real<00:02:11.180> well

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.470 

there's<00:02:16.100> seven<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:19.120> eight

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.449 

now<00:02:23.050> there's<00:02:23.410> seven<00:02:24.090> there<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.180> go<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.400> I've

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
now there's seven there we go so I've

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.150 
now there's seven there we go so I've
got<00:02:27.640> any<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:28.060> them<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.300> here<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:29.950> see

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
got any of them on here and you can see

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.699 
got any of them on here and you can see
here<00:02:30.430> they're<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:30.910> stacked<00:02:31.900> on<00:02:32.170> top<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.470> each

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
here they're just stacked on top of each

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.440 
here they're just stacked on top of each
other<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.250> then<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:33.819> I'm<00:02:33.940> going<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.270> is

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
other so then what I'm going to do is

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.170 
other so then what I'm going to do is
just<00:02:34.630> take<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:35.050> leader<00:02:35.349> line<00:02:35.650> here<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:37.030> this

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
just take this leader line here and this

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.059 
just take this leader line here and this
is<00:02:37.360> really<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.780> trickiest<00:02:38.230> part<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
is really the trickiest part of the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.600 
is really the trickiest part of the
whole<00:02:39.220> thing<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:41.620> doubling<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.280> leader

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
whole thing it's doubling that leader

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.280 
whole thing it's doubling that leader
line<00:02:42.850> over<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:46.209> really<00:02:46.450> helps<00:02:47.020> if<00:02:47.140> you

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
line over and it really helps if you

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.140 
line over and it really helps if you
like<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.770> one<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:48.010> didn't<00:02:48.340> leave<00:02:48.550> enough<00:02:48.880> line

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
like this one I didn't leave enough line

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.270 
like this one I didn't leave enough line
to<00:02:49.660> work<00:02:49.840> with<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.530> makes<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.950> lot<00:02:51.100> more

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
to work with so it makes it a lot more

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.250 
to work with so it makes it a lot more
difficult<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:53.160> tie<00:02:57.330> all<00:02:58.330> right<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.810> let's<00:02:59.110> say

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
difficult to tie all right so let's say

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.809 
difficult to tie all right so let's say
this<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.530> really<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.860> most<00:03:00.040> difficult<00:03:00.130> part

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
this is really the most difficult part

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.539 
this is really the most difficult part
here<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.150> tying<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.630> swivel<00:03:01.959> on<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:03.040> you're

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
here is tying this swivel on and you're

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.610 
here is tying this swivel on and you're
just<00:03:03.580> going<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:03.940> tie<00:03:04.269> your<00:03:04.330> swivel<00:03:04.870> on<00:03:05.019> here<00:03:05.470> on

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
just going to tie your swivel on here on

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.699 
just going to tie your swivel on here on
the<00:03:05.739> top<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:07.569> try<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.840> get<00:03:08.019> this<00:03:08.230> down<00:03:08.470> as

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
the top and just try to get this down as

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.220 
the top and just try to get this down as
close<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.790> top<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.239> these<00:03:10.330> sinkers<00:03:10.870> if<00:03:11.080> you

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
close to the top of these sinkers if you

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.220 
close to the top of these sinkers if you
can<00:03:11.500> as<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:12.640> can<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.510> doesn't<00:03:13.750> have<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.110> be

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
can as you can it doesn't have to be

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.080 
can as you can it doesn't have to be
exact<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.980> there<00:03:15.190> can<00:03:15.370> be<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.519> little<00:03:15.760> bit<00:03:15.970> of

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
exact you there can be a little bit of

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.259 
exact you there can be a little bit of
slack<00:03:16.330> in<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.930> doesn't<00:03:17.140> really<00:03:17.319> matter<00:03:19.110> but

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
slack in it it doesn't really matter but

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.789 
slack in it it doesn't really matter but
tie<00:03:22.269> that<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:23.019> like<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.500> then

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
tie that on just like that then

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.890 
tie that on just like that then
obviously<00:03:23.980> cut<00:03:24.580> your<00:03:24.819> excess<00:03:25.209> lines<00:03:25.450> off<00:03:26.070> and

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
obviously cut your excess lines off and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.280 
obviously cut your excess lines off and
get<00:03:28.900> rid<00:03:29.079> of<00:03:29.200> those<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:31.299> can<00:03:31.480> use<00:03:31.660> this<00:03:31.930> on

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
get rid of those and you can use this on

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.220 
get rid of those and you can use this on
the<00:03:32.410> bottom<00:03:32.859> of<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.370> modified<00:03:34.299> freeway<00:03:34.959> ring

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the bottom of a modified freeway ring

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.190 
the bottom of a modified freeway ring
like<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.650> use<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.670> just<00:03:37.329> tie<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.600> on<00:03:37.989> at<00:03:38.109> the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
like I use and just tie this on at the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.009 
like I use and just tie this on at the
bottom<00:03:38.560> instead<00:03:38.859> of<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:40.030> egg<00:03:40.209> sinker<00:03:40.660> like<00:03:40.870> I

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
bottom instead of the egg sinker like I

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.560 
bottom instead of the egg sinker like I
used<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.410> in<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.560> other<00:03:41.680> video<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:43.239> can<00:03:43.420> also

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
used to in the other video you can also

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.780 
used to in the other video you can also
use<00:03:43.989> these<00:03:44.200> on<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.470> santi<00:03:44.950> rig<00:03:45.190> or<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.489> slip

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
use these on a santi rig or a slip

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.509 
use these on a santi rig or a slip
sinker<00:03:46.000> rig<00:03:46.329> by<00:03:47.109> just<00:03:47.470> threading<00:03:48.160> your<00:03:48.310> main

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
sinker rig by just threading your main

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.300 
sinker rig by just threading your main
line<00:03:48.790> through<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.600> swivel<00:03:50.019> here<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.530> then

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
line through the swivel here and then

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.430 
line through the swivel here and then
putting<00:03:51.549> another<00:03:51.880> swivel<00:03:52.390> here<00:03:52.660> running<00:03:53.200> into

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
putting another swivel here running into

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.319 
putting another swivel here running into
your<00:03:53.500> leader<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.609> this<00:03:54.790> would<00:03:54.970> butt<00:03:55.180> up

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
your leader so this would butt up

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.050 
your leader so this would butt up
against<00:03:55.870> your<00:03:56.350> your<00:03:56.709> rig<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.430> would<00:03:57.760> actually

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
against your your rig and would actually

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.720 
against your your rig and would actually
drive<00:03:58.329> on<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.720> bottom<00:03:59.049> like<00:03:59.230> this<00:03:59.579> if<00:04:00.579> you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
drive on the bottom like this if you

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.880 
drive on the bottom like this if you
want<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:00.940> get<00:04:01.120> really<00:04:01.329> fancy<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:02.140> can<00:04:02.709> get

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
want to get really fancy you can get

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.190 
want to get really fancy you can get
some<00:04:03.220> plastic<00:04:04.150> coat<00:04:04.359> which<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:05.019> liquid

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
some plastic coat which is liquid

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.870 
some plastic coat which is liquid
plastic<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:06.040> can<00:04:06.130> get<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.400> at<00:04:06.519> any<00:04:06.549> hardware

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
plastic you can get it at any hardware

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.110 
plastic you can get it at any hardware
store<00:04:07.090> or<00:04:07.540> Home<00:04:07.690> Depot<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.880> just<00:04:09.880> take<00:04:10.090> that
