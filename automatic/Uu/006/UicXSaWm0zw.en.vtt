00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
It's mashup time!

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.080
This time, MLP meets Monster High!

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.400
We asked for mashup requests, and a bunch of you voted for MLP + Monster High.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.780
So let's do this! My Little Monster High!

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.820
Let's start with one that's pretty obvious:

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.360
Fluttershy and Twilight.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.140
Both are super shy and we like their mashup name

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.360
Fluttertwy!

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.720
Draculaura and Fluttershy also make a great match!

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.300
After all... Fluttershy did go all vampire in the bats episode!

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.820
And just like Draculaura, she was a vegan vampire.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.060
She only ate apples!

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.400
So that hybrid would be

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.540
Dracushy!

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.000
Perfect! Next mashup,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.900
Twilight Sparkle and Frankie Stein.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.500
They have kind of similar origins, except, Twilight's not a monster...

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.900
Right. Twilight is obsessed with studying.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.000
So Princess Celestia sends her to Ponyville to learn about friendship.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.620
Then there's Frankie Stein who brought to un-life as a teen

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.060
and tries to learn everything there is to know about being a student at Monster High.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.040
Plus, they just look cool mashed up!

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.300
We give you Twilight Stein!

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.680
Special shoutout to Elizabeth for suggesting that one!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.100
Next up, Pinkie Pie and Marisol.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.180
Both are COMPLETELY random!

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.940
And they're both on maximum excitement level all the time.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.880
Here they are mashed up as Mari-pie Pinksi!

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.300
Rarity is a perfect match for Cleo de Nile,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.460
since they're both elegant fashionistas.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.700
Here's their mashup

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.660
Rare-De Nile!

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.660
But... I think Rarity's so much nicer than Cleo.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.260
Rarity should get matched up with Catrine DeMew

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.800
Also stylish, and they already look alike!

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.760
True. So here's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.860
Catrine DeRare!

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.920
Operetta and Applejack are matched up because of their accents.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.720
Eck-cents [laughing]

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.140
And because they both try to get sophisticated.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.720
Applejack in Mainhattan.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.180
And Operetta gets lessons from Cleo DeNile.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.000
And, their pony-monster hybrid is Appeletta

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.940
Rainbow Dash is super tough,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.100
and at Equestria Girls, she's the captain of every sports team!

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Even though she doesn't start out as an athlete,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.760
Toralei's competitive streak shows when she joins every team!

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.460
Their monster-pony mashup is

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.560
Toradash!

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.720
Fan poll time!

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.600
