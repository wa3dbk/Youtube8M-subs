that<00:00:31.410> spot<00:00:31.769> right<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:32.899> little<00:00:33.899> rough<00:00:34.079> right

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that spot right there little rough right

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.180 
that spot right there little rough right
there<00:00:34.559> surface<00:00:35.040> rust<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:36.980> believe<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
there surface rust I believe the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.700 
there surface rust I believe the
tailgate<00:00:38.670> also<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.870> little<00:00:40.200> rust<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
tailgate also that little rust on it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.180 
tailgate also that little rust on it
this<00:00:41.190> truck<00:00:42.469> got<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> little<00:00:43.680> run<00:00:48.980> versus<00:00:49.980> we're

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
this truck got a little run versus we're

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
this truck got a little run versus we're
in<00:00:50.280> Michigan<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.960> get<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> lot<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.320> rust<00:00:54.050> but

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
in Michigan so we get a lot of rust but

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.040 
in Michigan so we get a lot of rust but
uh<00:00:55.760> looks<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> surface<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.809> can

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
uh looks like the surface so we can

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.330 
uh looks like the surface so we can
clean<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.440> maybe<00:00:59.010> buff<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:01.129> on<00:01:02.129> this

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
clean that out maybe buff it so on this

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.000 
clean that out maybe buff it so on this
side<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.059> don't<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
side I don't you can see it on the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.969 
side I don't you can see it on the
camera<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.610> don't<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.180> know<00:01:06.290> if<00:01:07.290> that

camera but I don't you know if that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.380 
camera but I don't you know if that
shit's<00:01:08.400> gonna<00:01:08.610> go
