to 32 gigabytes the camera on the front

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.450 
to 32 gigabytes the camera on the front
is<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.020> 1.3<00:01:55.560> megapixel<00:01:56.130> camera

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
is going to be a 1.3 megapixel camera

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.649 
is going to be a 1.3 megapixel camera
and<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> back<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> 5

said<00:01:59.939> let's<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.390> ahead<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.570> check<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
said let's go ahead and check the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.569 
said let's go ahead and check the
contents<00:02:01.259> inside<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> box<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.490> we

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
contents inside of the box and here we

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.700 
contents inside of the box and here we
have<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.970> phone<00:02:03.180> itself<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.900> we<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.470> it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
have the phone itself as we can see it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.800 
have the phone itself as we can see it
is<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> blue<00:02:05.100> color<00:02:05.340> version<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.090> it's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
is the blue color version and it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050 
is the blue color version and it's
actually<00:02:07.200> quite<00:02:07.380> small<00:02:07.829> reminds<00:02:08.429> me<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.579> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
actually quite small reminds me of the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.090 
actually quite small reminds me of the
first<00:02:09.299> generations<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> iphone<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:11.009> at

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
first generations of the iphone or at

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.150 
first generations of the iphone or at
least<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.519> 5s<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.329> the<00:02:12.390> 4s<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.140> on<00:02:13.350> this

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
least the 5s and the 4s and so on this

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.430 
least the 5s and the 4s and so on this
time<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.549> have<00:02:14.700> only<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.030> 4.5<00:02:15.810> inch<00:02:16.049> is<00:02:16.260> not

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
time you have only a 4.5 inch is not

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.710 
time you have only a 4.5 inch is not
even<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.890> 4.7<00:02:17.579> inch<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.239> going<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.600> be

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
even a 4.7 inch so this is going to be

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.170 
even a 4.7 inch so this is going to be
great<00:02:18.959> for<00:02:19.170> people<00:02:19.320> who<00:02:19.620> text<00:02:19.889> a<00:02:20.070> lot<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.549> i

imei<00:04:43.240> so<00:04:43.660> that's<00:04:43.870> definitely<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.470> plus<00:04:44.880> now<00:04:45.880> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
imei so that's definitely a plus now the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.670 
imei so that's definitely a plus now the
construction<00:04:46.600> of<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.840> guys<00:04:47.080> you<00:04:47.290> have<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.530> take

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
construction of it guys you have to take

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.860 
construction of it guys you have to take
into<00:04:47.830> consideration<00:04:48.580> that<00:04:48.610> this<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:49.000> only<00:04:49.150> $88

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
into consideration that this is only $88

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.330 
into consideration that this is only $88
so<00:04:50.170> it's<00:04:50.320> not<00:04:50.440> going<00:04:50.590> to<00:04:50.680> be<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.860> most<00:04:51.040> solid

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
so it's not going to be the most solid

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.400 
so it's not going to be the most solid
device<00:04:51.610> out<00:04:51.820> there<00:04:51.880> but<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:52.870> think<00:04:53.140> it's<00:04:53.260> pretty

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
device out there but I think it's pretty

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.800 
device out there but I think it's pretty
decent<00:04:53.920> according<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.460> price<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:55.090> now

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
decent according to the price and now

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.540 
decent according to the price and now
let's<00:04:56.170> go<00:04:56.290> ahead<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:56.500> install<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.250> battery

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.610 
and see if it has any juice I believe it
does<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.730> this<00:05:13.510> time<00:05:13.660> we<00:05:13.810> got<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.080> do<00:05:14.200> g<00:05:14.410> logo

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
with a white background now something I

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.510 
with a white background now something I
notice<00:05:17.200> about<00:05:17.290> this<00:05:17.500> display<00:05:17.950> guys<00:05:18.190> is<00:05:18.370> that

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
notice about this display guys is that

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.790 
notice about this display guys is that
along<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.060> edges<00:05:19.240> we<00:05:19.840> have<00:05:19.990> this<00:05:20.140> black<00:05:20.440> line

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
along the edges we have this black line

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.520 
along the edges we have this black line
which<00:05:21.220> is<00:05:21.430> not<00:05:22.270> very<00:05:22.300> pleasant<00:05:22.750> to<00:05:23.140> see<00:05:23.170> it<00:05:23.380> on

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
which is not very pleasant to see it on

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.990 
which is not very pleasant to see it on
there<00:05:23.770> but<00:05:24.010> have<00:05:24.160> in<00:05:24.310> mind<00:05:24.520> that<00:05:24.700> this<00:05:24.820> is<00:05:24.970> a

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
there but have in mind that this is a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.730 
there but have in mind that this is a
budget<00:05:25.300> device<00:05:25.810> only<00:05:26.140> eighty<00:05:26.500> eight<00:05:26.710> dollars

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
budget device only eighty eight dollars

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.980 
budget device only eighty eight dollars
so<00:05:27.280> we<00:05:27.400> really<00:05:27.610> can't<00:05:28.000> expect<00:05:28.330> much<00:05:28.540> from<00:05:28.600> this

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
so we really can't expect much from this

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.320 
so we really can't expect much from this
phone<00:05:29.290> I<00:05:29.620> think<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:30.820> know<00:05:30.940> being<00:05:31.210> that

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
phone I think that you know being that

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.200 
phone I think that you know being that
it<00:05:31.660> has<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:32.020> android<00:05:32.260> kitkat<00:05:32.530> 4.4<00:05:32.940> point2<00:05:33.940> and

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
it has the android kitkat 4.4 point2 and

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.420 
it has the android kitkat 4.4 point2 and
that<00:05:34.390> if<00:05:34.600> Ali's<00:05:35.080> support<00:05:35.470> one<00:05:35.950> gigabyte<00:05:36.280> of

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
that if Ali's support one gigabyte of

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.070 
that if Ali's support one gigabyte of
ram<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.820> a<00:05:37.150> gigabyte<00:05:37.540> something<00:05:37.810> total

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
ram and a gigabyte something total

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.870 
ram and a gigabyte something total
storage<00:05:38.290> I<00:05:38.530> think<00:05:38.740> that's<00:05:38.890> sufficient<00:05:39.040> so<00:05:39.550> far

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
storage I think that's sufficient so far

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.510 
storage I think that's sufficient so far
according<00:05:40.810> to<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.020> price<00:05:41.260> and<00:05:41.620> I<00:05:41.980> think<00:05:42.040> it

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
according to the price and I think it

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.220 
according to the price and I think it
