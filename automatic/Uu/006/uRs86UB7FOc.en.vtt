version Fernandez my second guitar was

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.040 
version Fernandez my second guitar was
this<00:00:37.260> vortex<00:00:37.949> which<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.489> picked<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.840> not

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
this vortex which I picked up I'm not

this vortex which I picked up I'm not
going<00:00:40.199> to<00:00:40.260> say<00:00:40.440> where<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.650> got<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.040> because<00:00:41.129> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
going to say where I got it because I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.049 
going to say where I got it because I
probably<00:00:41.640> get<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.940> trouble<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.710> it

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059

um<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.360> vortex<00:01:37.660> guitar<00:01:38.410> is<00:01:38.970> essential<00:01:39.970> for<00:01:40.150> me

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
um the vortex guitar is essential for me

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.290 
um the vortex guitar is essential for me
as<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.570> guitar<00:01:41.050> player<00:01:41.080> I<00:01:41.740> would<00:01:42.400> never<00:01:42.790> switch

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
to any other guitar mainly because of

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.110 
to any other guitar mainly because of
the<00:01:45.340> feel<00:01:45.930> Flying<00:01:46.930> V<00:01:47.050> guitar<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:47.890> best<00:01:48.250> for

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
the feel Flying V guitar is the best for

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.140 
the feel Flying V guitar is the best for
me<00:01:49.150> as<00:01:49.540> far<00:01:49.840> as<00:01:50.020> positioning<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:51.070> my<00:01:51.520> back<00:01:51.730> and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
me as far as positioning of my back and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.260 
me as far as positioning of my back and
how<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.540> positioned<00:01:53.230> with<00:01:53.500> my<00:01:53.740> arms<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:55.060> very

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
how I positioned with my arms it's very

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.250 
how I positioned with my arms it's very
important<00:01:55.780> for<00:01:55.990> me<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.860> have<00:01:57.100> my<00:01:57.729> elbow<00:01:58.360> more

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
important for me to have my elbow more

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.860 
important for me to have my elbow more
at<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.590> lower<00:01:59.920> degree<00:02:00.370> versus<00:02:01.030> high<00:02:01.270> up<00:02:01.479> with<00:02:01.810> a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
at a lower degree versus high up with a

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.810 
at a lower degree versus high up with a
strat<00:02:02.320> mainly<00:02:03.040> because<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:03.460> starts<00:02:03.700> hurting

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
strat mainly because it starts hurting

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.469 
strat mainly because it starts hurting
my<00:02:04.090> my<00:02:04.660> elbow<00:02:05.080> I'm<00:02:05.260> sorry<00:02:05.470> my<00:02:05.620> shoulder<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.340> my

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
elbow so that's one of the main things

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.000 
elbow so that's one of the main things
of<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.540> Flying<00:02:10.840> V<00:02:10.929> basically<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.709> I<00:02:11.740> like<00:02:11.980> a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
of the Flying V basically that I like a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.810 
of the Flying V basically that I like a
lot<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:13.360> other<00:02:14.170> thing<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.730> also<00:02:15.910> has<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:17.820> non

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
lot the other thing is it also has a non

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.030 
lot the other thing is it also has a non
asset<00:02:19.090> neck<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.420> neck<00:02:19.630> through<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:20.860> makes

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
asset neck a neck through so that makes

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.620 
asset neck a neck through so that makes
it<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.220> lot<00:02:21.310> easier<00:02:21.490> for<00:02:21.820> me<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.970> play<00:02:22.209> my<00:02:22.240> leads

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
it a lot easier for me to play my leads

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.320 
it a lot easier for me to play my leads
and<00:02:23.020> that's<00:02:23.590> just<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.160> much<00:02:25.030> smooth

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
and that's just like a much smooth

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.090 
and that's just like a much smooth
smooth<00:02:25.660> transition<00:02:26.320> but<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.890> all<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
smooth transition but for all the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.130 
smooth transition but for all the
experience<00:02:27.310> guitar<00:02:27.850> players<00:02:28.120> they<00:02:28.420> sure<00:02:29.020> you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
experience guitar players they sure you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:44.270 
experience guitar players they sure you
already<00:02:29.290> know<00:02:29.770> that

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.720 

also<00:02:45.810> now<00:02:46.810> as<00:02:47.200> far<00:02:47.680> as<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.830> sustainer<00:02:48.280> pickup

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
also now as far as a sustainer pickup

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.589 
also now as far as a sustainer pickup
that<00:02:48.849> I<00:02:48.910> use<00:02:49.650> with<00:02:50.650> my<00:02:50.680> own<00:02:50.950> music<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:52.180> daily

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.160 
that I use with my own music on a daily
basis<00:02:52.989> as<00:02:53.140> well<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.849> options<00:02:55.810> are<00:02:55.959> unlimited

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
basis as well the options are unlimited

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.940 
basis as well the options are unlimited
really<00:02:56.950> not<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.000> much<00:02:58.290> not<00:02:59.290> only<00:02:59.680> live<00:02:59.920> but

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
really not so much not only live but

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.509 
really not so much not only live but
also<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.030> studio<00:03:01.799> meaning<00:03:02.799> basically

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
also in the studio meaning basically

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.100 
also in the studio meaning basically

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
like when you're going into another

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.530 
like when you're going into another
track<00:03:05.560> or<00:03:05.890> you're<00:03:06.129> you're<00:03:06.760> recording<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.330> third

track or you're you're recording a third
track<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.200> kind<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.470> need<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:09.269> feedback

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
track and you kind of need that feedback

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.830 
track and you kind of need that feedback
it's<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:12.069> it's<00:03:12.400> really<00:03:12.700> easy<00:03:12.879> just<00:03:13.269> just<00:03:13.720> to

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
it's a it's really easy just just to

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.809 
it's a it's really easy just just to
gain<00:03:14.099> I<00:03:15.099> use<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.120> live<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.709> in<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.040> studio<00:03:18.069> and
