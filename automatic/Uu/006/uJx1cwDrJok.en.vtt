you guys don't know what a vortex is is
pretty<00:00:21.300> much<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.660> combo<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.350> ends<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.070> your

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
pretty much a combo that ends with your

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.250 
pretty much a combo that ends with your
opponent<00:00:23.640> being<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.240> standing<00:00:24.779> state<00:00:25.050> where

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
opponent being in a standing state where

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.990 
opponent being in a standing state where
you<00:00:25.350> have<00:00:25.470> plus<00:00:25.769> frames<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.550> start<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
you have plus frames and you can start a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.390 
you have plus frames and you can start a
new<00:00:27.029> combo<00:00:27.570> by<00:00:27.750> mixing<00:00:28.019> them<00:00:28.260> up<00:00:28.380> high<00:00:28.949> low<00:00:29.369> or

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
new combo by mixing them up high low or

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.339 
new combo by mixing them up high low or
you<00:00:29.760> could<00:00:29.910> even<00:00:30.029> go<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> grab

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
you could even go for a grab

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.959 
you could even go for a grab
you<00:00:31.650> know<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:31.859> he's<00:00:32.099> guessing<00:00:32.369> right<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you know if he's guessing right and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.910 
you know if he's guessing right and
stuff<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.510> he<00:00:33.600> guesses<00:00:33.750> wrong<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.680> pretty

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
stuff so if he guesses wrong you pretty

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.010 
stuff so if he guesses wrong you pretty
much<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.520> full<00:00:35.910> combo<00:00:36.239> again<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.899> you

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
much get a full combo again and you

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.630 
much get a full combo again and you
could<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.380> repeat<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> cycle<00:00:38.190> that's<00:00:38.550> why

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
could just repeat the cycle that's why

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.010 
could just repeat the cycle that's why
it's<00:00:38.790> called<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> vortex<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:39.870> what

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
it's called the vortex so that's what

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.900 
it's called the vortex so that's what
you<00:00:40.079> want<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.559> scorpion<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.160> I'm

damaging combos that still end up in the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.410 
damaging combos that still end up in the
vortex<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> way<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.760> guys<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.059> seen<00:00:48.270> on

the screen right now like 36 percent and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.540 
the screen right now like 36 percent and
you<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.530> keep<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> vortex

scorpion<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.969> really<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.780> good

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
scorpion is a really really good

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.110 
scorpion is a really really good
character<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.949> his<00:00:59.160> best<00:00:59.430> variation<00:00:59.969> is

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
character I think his best variation is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.180 
character I think his best variation is
Hellfire<00:01:00.530> because<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> could<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.829> some<00:01:01.980> nasty

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
Hellfire because you could do some nasty

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.100 
Hellfire because you could do some nasty
stuff<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> fireball<00:01:03.359> run<00:01:03.539> cancelling

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
stuff with the fireball run cancelling

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.539 
stuff with the fireball run cancelling
but<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.189> hope<00:01:05.430> you
