 The fire is blowing off with snow and the gravel inside and outside the country suddenly makes a difference and is recognized in the tax payment passed in the prefecture 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.250
 I hope 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:30.600
 What use of flow was feeling make 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 The place I was named misunderstood that would have been described in no way, I guess it's a simple part 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.680
 The subscriber has topped 100 people before this 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.440
 Registrant in such mail was going to do something in every can eat by 100 people

 Onushi nice little whether the earth man jerk Shikoku unlike the way the alumni meet Whoo Datong 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.260
 It will be such an idea if you make a Yiwu 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.800
 Of course it was made in the game of course even though I wanted to have eight people on a rainy day 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.470
 The 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.800
 There's no quality at all, but if you say Mu Moo, g 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:11.370
 In fact, would you have made the bamboo in the way there because it Tama 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.370
 I wonder if the song found in Rassharu Nanjo wandering to make the Hida mountain province of Asia 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.290
 So it is here minecraft playstation 3 version 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.760

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.150
 I really wanted to do it in the PC version, but I couldn't operate the keyboard anyway 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.540
 There is also a behind, but I'm going to feel great Akono 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.660
 On this day, it was 66 and it was the work of boy why 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:37.240
 By the way , it is a residence space of Oyama in this 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.930
 During the presence or absence of the inside will be hollow and try to enter if it is quite good time 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.450
 Leave 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.450
 Let's go in and look at the shape and shape 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.240
 It 's quite a bit of making it now 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.250
 In addition, it will be in the east curve of the role side 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.630
 This Chigasaki-kan is the castle where Mr. Takeda of Kai is for three generations from Nobutora Takeda to Katsuyori 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.729
 It was Takeda's residence 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.570
 Currently selected as one of the 100 Japanese castles in Japan at Takeda Shrine Gari, which took over Shingen Takeda. 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.810
 It was done 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.890
 There is a certain restoration this time 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.420
 It is Chigasakikan around 1553 for strike reference 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.730
 The breath of the building seems to be quite different because it is my own image about the contents and 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.700
 2 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.620
 Signs that let's look at quite hated it do so Well then medium immediately to 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.940
 This will be a horseback in front of the west turn circle orphanage, in order to repel the enemy approaching here 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.870
 In what was made 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.819
 This Maidashi has become a mechanism to counterattack from the book to be both the name off the hand tree 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.090
 It will be a well-used thing in the castle of the injury Let's come in, and then come in 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.690
 You are the problem again This is here more and more 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.460
 Just like a strong bridge 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:44.960
 Outside Masu people here sound a thing is so is referred to as a juice-type form, which is in the urine 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.680
 Not the outside of here thundercloud was thigh dad entered the mansion Thats not go mad to see here 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.670
 Let's go 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:54.290
 These three songs are mainly believed to have lived by relatives and rituals of Mr. Takeda 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:59.120
 Let's take a look from the bedroom to the previous bedroom or private room has become the main Some in such of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.230
 You can see if you look at what the quality is right there 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.379
 Oh 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.739
 Next will be the entrance and private room of the mansion 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:11.060
 There is a gap in the sense here and there is a tea room here 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.590
 I used a green carpet to make me feel so gentle at the time when there is a grid 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.870
 Probably not 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.410
 Then it will be the courtyard in this is such as we have made in the sky 0841's 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.470
 In addition to this, we make building foundation of building 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:30.290
 He helped me with the production of moat and so on 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:32.580
 Then I will become a kitchen kitchen I learned that there was a cauldron for the first time in the middle of making this place 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.990
 And there is also a delivery date etc. in the back 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:42.420
 The insanity is over House - CHAN is cute Endo does not match 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:46.830
 Next, let's look at the east curve ring It is supposed that the administration was performed mainly by the east curve ring 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:51.450
 I tried to make a room or a room for a meeting . The left hand is a mansion for guests 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:56.980
 The mansion on the right is the conference hall The pond in front of the conference room was made by Mr. Sky 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:00.310
 Hmm There are Yaguramon and Bishamondo is in it 's good city back in the spartan feel, but at the a lot of array 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:05.709
 Let's enter the conference room by Do not I there that can not be Ise 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.580
 Day or night This will be the conference room where Shingen was discussing the strategy with the chiefs 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.379
 It will be 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.130
 If you look at it from the President , something will be hot, but I think it's a favorite out now 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.450
 That's too late 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.829
 Here everyone comes out from the conference room when I get to the hallway that leads middle and drawing-room Kuruwani 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:25.050
 At first let's see from the guest room 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.500
 There is a second intention in front of the guest room, and a banquet room is created in the back of Mr. Sky's wish 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.610
 The 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.000
 Mr. Sora likes it very much and this is a guest room 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.889
 The east curve is the end with something quite overly appropriate 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.620
 It will be medium followed Kuruwani 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.550
 Oh books was the image of a normal mansion has become a living space of everyday middle Kuruhaha pitcher 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.319
 There is room, too 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.669
 The epicenter Madou statement and also I wonder if over honor tried to make the library because I heard that this love 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.360
 This is the case with Shingen 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.880
 This mountain is the epicenter will enter and this I did call this toilet and mountain 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.240
 I'm sorry why there was a grassland I'm sorry map 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.710
 It will flow when you wipe this toilet lever 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:07.730
 Thank you Mr. Sora for producing this bathroom, which is a wasteful place 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:11.960
 Mr. Sora's variously made It continues and becomes here a shopkeeper 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:15.289
 There is no castle tower in Chigasakikan, so I made this completely by killing time 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:21.110
 So there is nothing inside 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:22.369
 To really care what What I will have is miso comes to east Kuruwa northwest is in the southeast scenery viewed from the top floor 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.399
 Sokuju is the name 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:30.259
 The explanation of Chigasakikan is the end above. 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:31.669
 Higuchi doesn't go, I'm just digging a moat, so I won't explain it. 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.059
 It may be explained 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.310
 Minutes Thank you for watching this time 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:39.900
 Next 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.560
 There is no such a thing its it 's not stand anymore if guess is prove to be at the time of the 300 people breakthrough Memorial 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.540
 gate 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:49.440
 By the way, what to make next is undecided, so there is a castle that you want the audience to make something 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:54.030
 Is a Japanese castle is good as long as you wishes you request If you have any 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.300
 By the way, it's about time has come, so I will watch it here 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.300
 Thank you very much 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.300
