00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
higher distances when I tested this I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.109 
higher distances when I tested this I
didn't<00:01:12.409> notice<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.829> big<00:01:13.250> difference<00:01:13.759> in<00:01:14.000> the

when<00:01:16.939> falling<00:01:17.380> but<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.859> mod<00:01:19.759> maker<00:01:20.030> says<00:01:20.390> that

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
when falling but the mod maker says that

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.270 
when falling but the mod maker says that
it<00:01:20.899> does<00:01:21.049> exist<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:21.619> I'm<00:01:21.799> going<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.100> have<00:01:22.189> to

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.490 
it does exist so I'm going to have to
just<00:01:22.490> take<00:01:22.640> his<00:01:22.850> word<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.119> on<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.390> now<00:01:24.320> in

order to make the needle with thread and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.990 
order to make the needle with thread and
things<00:01:26.390> like<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:27.409> need<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:28.000> actually

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
things like that you need to actually

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.660 
things like that you need to actually
create<00:01:29.329> them<00:01:29.899> you<00:01:30.500> use<00:01:30.799> three<00:01:31.100> gold<00:01:31.310> nuggets

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
organized in this fashion to create a

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.109 
organized in this fashion to create a
needle<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:33.859> then<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.399> add<00:01:34.579> some<00:01:34.850> thread

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
needle and then you just add some thread

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.770 
needle and then you just add some thread
not<00:01:35.689> 47<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.500> them<00:01:36.590> not<00:01:36.829> 47<00:01:37.399> strings<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:38.630> add

not 47 of them not 47 strings you add

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.910 
not 47 of them not 47 strings you add
these<00:01:38.960> two<00:01:39.140> together<00:01:39.259> get<00:01:39.619> your<00:01:39.679> needle

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
these two together get your needle

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.099 
these two together get your needle
thread<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:41.240> order<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.450> make<00:01:41.630> one<00:01:41.780> golden

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.080 
thread and in order to make one golden
leaf<00:01:42.259> you<00:01:42.469> actually<00:01:42.740> need<00:01:42.859> nine<00:01:43.159> blocks<00:01:43.670> of

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
here's an example of how fast it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.440 
here's an example of how fast it
actually<00:02:15.750> goes<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.470> cuts<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.880> this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
actually goes and cuts for you so this

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
is just with a regular machete it's um

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
is just with a regular machete it's um
it's<00:02:21.570> also<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.110> also<00:02:22.290> proves<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.740> be<00:02:22.800> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
it's also it also proves to be a

it's also it also proves to be a
fantastic<00:02:23.400> weapon<00:02:23.820> as<00:02:24.030> well<00:02:24.210> but<00:02:24.390> as<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.660> can

stronger it has more uses it can be used

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.370 
stronger it has more uses it can be used
as<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.650> better<00:03:07.770> weapon<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:10.110> the

you know I didn't I didn't make it
myself<00:04:48.849> I<00:04:49.150> made<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:49.870> myself<00:04:50.020> at<00:04:50.349> Chez<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.830> should

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
myself I made it myself at Chez I should

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.089 
myself I made it myself at Chez I should
say<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:52.060> gold<00:04:52.810> trees<00:04:53.169> they<00:04:53.620> can<00:04:53.800> spawn<00:04:54.039> in

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
say so gold trees they can spawn in

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.029 
say so gold trees they can spawn in
deserts<00:04:54.639> plains<00:04:55.030> rivers<00:04:55.900> forests<00:04:56.860> and

beaches there is no sapling for it so
you<00:05:00.159> know<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:00.340> cannot<00:05:00.669> create<00:05:00.969> them<00:05:01.330> or
