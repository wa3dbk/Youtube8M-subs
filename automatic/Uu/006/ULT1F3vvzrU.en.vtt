00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.200
 the brain is made up of tiny nerve cells called neurons and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.510
 stacey these neurons have very small ramifications made it 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.969
 tell you if they connect to other neurons forming a neural network 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.949
 at each connection point a thought was incubated a vague memory the brain 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.349
 creates all concepts from the law of associative memory higuaín 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.400
 the ideas the thoughts and the feelings are constructed 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.930
 interconnected in that neural network mestizos can relate to each other 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.490
 for this concept and the feeling of love for example are stored in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.019
 that extensive social network but we created the concept of love from many 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.739
 different ideas some people connect in love with disappointment when 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:37.710
 think of love 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.360
 I experienced in the memory of the pain the regret the anger and even the conare the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.660
 anger may be related to the penalty because it may be related 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 with a specific person who can be connected with love 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.810
 we always perceive things after losses reflected in the mirror of the 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.840
 memory 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.970
 the ipcc that was held in the cache memory museum what gives us the 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.170
 YouTube feeling but who knows he went 3-1 with what the difference 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.920
 between what they ask for their environment for what the company remembers 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.590
 and all because the same neural networks are activated physiology tells us 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.210
 that nerve cells that are activated simultaneously are 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.939
 connected if you do something over and over again these cells have a relationship 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.010
 prolonged or street if every day the father pointed out that although all the 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.159
 next days your diabetes frustrates if every day your partner santiago and 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.360
 growing pirate grounds to be a victim over that year all the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.780
 days is being collected or reintegrating the neural network in case that 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.220
 line has a lasting relationship with those other nerve cells 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.270
 called identities we also know in nerve cells that are not activated 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.830
 simultaneously in not connecting to the bull they stop having a relationship 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.350
 lasting because every time we interrupt the thought process 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.280
 that causes a chemical reaction in the body every time we do not interrupt two 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.920
 of those nerve cells that are connected to politicize to break that 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.730
 long relationship 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.970
 experiences influence what we know 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.820
 I think it's a death a fully operational analysis ended 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.709
 because the analysis we do in all things is related to 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.229
 to all this is experience in previous solutions 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.469
 here everything has an emotional weight we have never passed that the emotions then 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:29.420
 in spiritual and material things because they were not even Scottish things 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:34.219
 here for real molecules with inspective molecular weights 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:39.339
 consequences and structures sala ward science classroom knows that the 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.689
 hypothalamus make European qatarí shots that those neuropeptide are 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.069
 powerful chemical substances there is a part in the brain called hypothalamus 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.989
 the hypothalamus is like a mentality in the sixth place where they meet 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.960
 certain chemical substances 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.960
 that correspond to certain emotions that we experience not those 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.480
 chemical substances are called franquismo operatives are small 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.000
 chains of amino acids in essence the body is a carbon unit that 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.920
 manufactures a total of about 20 different amino acids 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.709
 to have the formula of its physical structure the body is a machine that 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.390
 produces proteins and mosquito movements we take a small chain of 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.669
 proteins called peptides 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.530
 ghilas we assemble 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.910
 in certain members of eta fled nippon euro the spain currency that 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.160
 correspond with emotional states 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.159
 that we experience daily 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.760
 so to those paralyzed chemical tanks and there are chemical substances 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.279
 for sadness 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.930
 the exchange of chemical substances to feel victim and for lust well 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:39.269
 2 0 there is a chemical for every emotional state that we experience 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.279
 who is at the moment in which we experience an emotional state of 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.440
 body the bohemian celebrated 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.050
 with the hypothalamus the young san blas immediately between 22 thousand loose vehicles 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.830
 by the pituitary gland in the bloodstream when the blood arrives 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.880
 he went on his way to different centers that forged different parts of the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.630
 body and even the cells of the body the offer has receptors in the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.989
 exterior of aosta 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.179
 a cell can have thousands of student teachers its surface 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.049
 to questions 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.439
 to the outside world in some way bwin when it started to come in it's about a 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.389
 health and food cell 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.190
 as if it were an attack that suffered a fracture 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.830
 is placed on the surface of the receiver secret management going very well 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.409
 as it is called the attention that one can give send a signal magazine 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.389
 also the piece 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.250
 finish 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.350
 the witness find the spectators 75 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.050
 has insisted 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.539
 you can also let go back to your understanding 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.379
 while these and transform affected 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.069
 other sectors that have effect conveyed the congratulations many 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.129
 Years of continuing like this 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.629
 the actual map of credentials that here only some of which attacked 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.689
 with changes in the same nucleus of the cells no doubt all the cells 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.520
 are alive the compass are aware of everything if we define 

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:06.469
 consciousness as by the point of view making the savior ues cent up 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:07.909
 the prospects of steel 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.949
 but where you do not know where you are 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.800
 the foundation institute and applications the resignation of his cabinet 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.120
 and designs and it is planned that the pontiff in Khartoum imposed the cell 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 is the only one that contemplates a mirage of the body 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.560
 We are her human beings her son 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.170
 physically and chemically materials that will incentivize is not bad 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.249
 but not only does it become an impression when we give ourselves more than 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:38.639
 access to the same emotions and ideas every day will be defined considered 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.569
 in terms of changing the axis of the new order to our people
