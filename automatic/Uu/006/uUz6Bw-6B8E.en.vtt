me anything I didn't already know but of

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.979 
me anything I didn't already know but of
course<00:02:52.440> then<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.830> question<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.569> raised<00:02:54.569> well

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
course then the question is raised well

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:07.910 
course then the question is raised well
how<00:02:55.890> did<00:02:56.040> he<00:02:56.160> know<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.739> needle

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
how did he know this is just a needle

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.530 
how did he know this is just a needle
cap<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:09.410> just<00:03:10.410> saved<00:03:10.769> my<00:03:10.950> fingers

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
cap we just just saved my fingers

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.539 
cap we just just saved my fingers
because<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.630> do<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.959> probably<00:03:13.530> 20<00:03:14.190> times<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
because I do this probably 20 times a

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.949 
because I do this probably 20 times a
day<00:03:14.579> or<00:03:14.760> more<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:16.100> what<00:03:17.100> I'm<00:03:17.220> checking<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:18.510> I'm

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
day or more and what I'm checking is I'm

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.500 
day or more and what I'm checking is I'm
checking<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:20.250> acupuncture<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.269> not<00:03:24.480> a

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
checking is acupuncture this is not a

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.400 
checking is acupuncture this is not a
hundred<00:03:24.750> percent

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.230 

scary<00:03:29.410> accurate<00:03:30.840> reflection<00:03:33.000> we're<00:03:34.000> putting

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
scary accurate reflection we're putting

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.360 
scary accurate reflection we're putting
pressure<00:03:34.570> on<00:03:34.720> acupuncture<00:03:35.380> points<00:03:35.920> I'm

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
pressure on acupuncture points I'm

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.440 
pressure on acupuncture points I'm
looking<00:03:36.760> for<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.090> reaction

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.610 

so<00:03:45.020> we're<00:03:45.260> back<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:47.769> this<00:03:48.769> is<00:03:48.980> this<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.519> the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
so we're back to this is this is the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.009 
so we're back to this is this is the
interestingly<00:03:51.620> okay<00:03:52.489> he<00:03:53.269> says<00:03:53.450> right<00:03:53.690> ankle

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
interestingly okay he says right ankle

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.630 
interestingly okay he says right ankle
interestingly<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:54.709> horse<00:03:55.099> has<00:03:55.190> never<00:03:55.430> had

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
interestingly this horse has never had

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.949 
interestingly this horse has never had
just<00:03:55.730> come<00:03:55.940> up<00:03:56.060> before<00:03:56.180> but<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.810> the

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
just come up before but that is the

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.949 
just come up before but that is the
right<00:03:57.110> ankle<00:03:57.319> for<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:57.739> so<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.519> can<00:03:58.580> see<00:03:58.970> we're

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
right ankle for you so you can see we're

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.420 
right ankle for you so you can see we're
getting<00:04:00.050> a<00:04:00.260> little<00:04:00.349> reaction<00:04:00.680> on<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:01.130> point

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
getting a little reaction on that point

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.820 
getting a little reaction on that point
that<00:04:02.120> point<00:04:02.510> coincides<00:04:03.410> with<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.560> right

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
that point coincides with the right

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.160 
that point coincides with the right
ankle<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:07.090> corroboration<00:04:08.090> Becker<00:04:08.569> operate

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
ankle so corroboration Becker operate

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.940 
ankle so corroboration Becker operate
now<00:04:10.480> that's<00:04:11.480> not<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.840> typical<00:04:12.170> thing<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.799> most

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
now that's not a typical thing that most

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.030 
now that's not a typical thing that most

to fresh tip deflection so I just an
interesting<00:04:41.120> correlation<00:04:41.300> there<00:04:42.040> right

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
interesting correlation there right

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.610 
interesting correlation there right
angle<00:04:44.650> hockley<00:04:46.600> dr<00:04:47.600> appoint<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.930> that's<00:04:51.500> a

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
angle hockley dr appoint and that's a

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.680 
angle hockley dr appoint and that's a
point<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.310> coincides<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.150> foot<00:04:53.419> in<00:04:53.600> the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
point that coincides to the foot in the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.670 
point that coincides to the foot in the
highway<00:04:54.460> if<00:04:55.460> anything<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.660> anatomical<00:04:57.470> so<00:04:57.620> is

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
highway if anything is anatomical so is

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.350 
highway if anything is anatomical so is
anything<00:04:57.889> from<00:04:58.160> the<00:04:58.250> angle<00:04:58.580> all<00:04:58.789> in<00:04:59.000> ailment

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
anything from the angle all in ailment

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.490 
anything from the angle all in ailment
works<00:05:00.340> but<00:05:01.340> again<00:05:01.580> very<00:05:02.060> positive<00:05:02.570> point<00:05:02.979> so

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
works but again very positive point so

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.090 
works but again very positive point so
can<00:05:06.500> we<00:05:06.590> corroborated<00:05:07.310> everything<00:05:07.430> bill<00:05:07.880> spin

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
can we corroborated everything bill spin

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.610 
can we corroborated everything bill spin
doesn't<00:05:10.100> always<00:05:10.370> happen<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.669> way<00:05:10.760> bit<00:05:11.060> early

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
doesn't always happen that way bit early

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.310 
doesn't always happen that way bit early
so<00:05:14.650> that<00:05:15.650> does<00:05:16.100> corroborate<00:05:16.669> but<00:05:17.150> again<00:05:17.320> by

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
so that does corroborate but again by

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.230 
so that does corroborate but again by
conventional<00:05:18.889> veterinary<00:05:19.340> medicine<00:05:19.729> you

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
conventional veterinary medicine you

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.550 
conventional veterinary medicine you
know<00:05:20.360> i'd<00:05:20.660> have<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:20.900> say<00:05:21.110> there's<00:05:21.289> nothing

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
know i'd have to say there's nothing

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.469 
know i'd have to say there's nothing
