at<00:01:29.009> his<00:01:29.159> tank<00:01:29.429> right<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:29.789> but<00:01:32.569> just<00:01:33.569> to<00:01:33.750> look

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
at his tank right now but just to look

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.230 
at his tank right now but just to look
at<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> plumbing<00:01:34.740> here

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.289 

there's<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:42.229> rest<00:01:42.409> of<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:46.030> got<00:01:47.030> holes

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
there's the rest of it I got holes

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.330 
there's the rest of it I got holes
drilled<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:47.990> top<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:48.650> case<00:01:48.860> on<00:01:49.130> had

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
drilled in the top in case on had

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.340 
drilled in the top in case on had
canister<00:01:50.119> filters<00:01:50.570> I'll<00:01:50.780> probably<00:01:50.990> end<00:01:51.229> up

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
canister filters I'll probably end up

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.600 
canister filters I'll probably end up
with<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:53.600> sump<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.140> an<00:01:54.229> mx-5<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:55.280> here

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
with the sump and an mx-5 on here

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.370 
with the sump and an mx-5 on here
eventually<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:02.570> know<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:02.810> really<00:02:03.050> turning

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
eventually you know it's really turning

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:20.260 
eventually you know it's really turning
all<00:02:03.590> good<00:02:03.860> I'm<00:02:04.070> liking<00:02:04.490> it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.690

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
than that I got a bunch of the lumber to

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.390 
than that I got a bunch of the lumber to
make<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.810> actually<00:02:23.990> look<00:02:24.230> nice<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.220> looks

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
make it actually look nice it just looks

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.730 
make it actually look nice it just looks
like<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.640> crappy<00:02:26.420> wooden<00:02:26.720> box<00:02:26.960> with<00:02:27.170> water<00:02:27.500> in

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
like a crappy wooden box with water in

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:39.250 
like a crappy wooden box with water in
it<00:02:27.890> now<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:30.460> shouldn't<00:02:31.460> come<00:02:31.640> around<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:38.260> you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.370 
it now but shouldn't come around so you
got<00:02:39.440> it

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.340
