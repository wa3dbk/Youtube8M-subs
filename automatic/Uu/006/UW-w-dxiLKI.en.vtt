00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.570
 very good everyone here we are again 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.320
 as always in the news more 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.720
 shocking at the moment many 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.139
 you will surprise not with the title of this 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.340
 video but it's exactly what they think 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.340
 the scientists 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 a recent research funded 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.100
 by the Nasa and carried out by a 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 numerous team of scientists 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.660
 International states that they have 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.329
 be perplexed with the last 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.500
 checking the telescope data 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.050
 hubble 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.400
 the hubble telescope has discovered us 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.070
 that the universe conceals 80% of the origin 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.350
 of its light which means that by 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.380
 some reason lack light in the vast 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.380
 universe 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.390
 the scientists that are part of the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.260
 national foundation of science and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 foundation to manson claim that the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.580
 spectrograph of space origins 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.010
 which is aboard the hubble telescope 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.710
 has detected that the hydrogen wires 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.310
 that unite the galaxies do not light up 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310
 as it was believed 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.299
 in fact they think they light up too 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.790
 but we can not observe neither light nor 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.400
 the sources from which light comes 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.360
 which means that in some way 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.640
 lack light in concrete is missing a lot of light 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.510
 ultraviolet where is all that light 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.820
 will be hidden in some way something or 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.070
 someone is hiding it from some 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.930
 way or is a natural process that does not 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.840
 we know 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.950
 and good as you just checked according to 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.230
 the astronomers 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.630
 something bad is happening precisely 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.619
 because that large amount is missing 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.619
 ultraviolet light 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.370
 now we just need to find out where it is 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.549
 that light and we're still going through the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.019
 start of the road tell you also that 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.810
 this article is published in the 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.080
 astrology journal journal letters a 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.500
 pretty broad article in English 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.420
 and that according to the textual words of those 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.420
 researchers who have drawn that 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.660
 article by those astronomers in the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.350
 Cosmic budget is missing a lot of light 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.100
 ultraviolet and that's why something is happening 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.410
 In the universe 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.410
 and good people now just wait 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.650
 and expect it to be something natural and not 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.400
 be nothing catastrophic that is 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.540
 and starting not in the whole universe and that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.989
 end the earth here 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.430
 thanks for being there and until another video 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.430
 of amazing news
