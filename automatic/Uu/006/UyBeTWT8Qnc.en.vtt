fondant<00:03:43.950> sticking<00:03:44.940> out<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:46.290> little<00:03:46.500> mold

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030

so<00:03:48.030> next<00:03:48.300> we're<00:03:48.570> going<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.720> add<00:03:48.810> our<00:03:48.990> second

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
so next we're going to add our second

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.700 
so next we're going to add our second
color<00:03:50.000> which<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.270> chose<00:03:51.690> as<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.050> pink<00:03:52.470> feather

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
color which I chose as a pink feather

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.750 
color which I chose as a pink feather
for<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.250> hearts<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:55.230> just<00:03:55.680> take<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.730> know

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
for the hearts so you just take you know

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760 
for the hearts so you just take you know
enough<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.540> squeeze<00:03:57.840> into<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.350> mold<00:03:58.590> you

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
enough to squeeze into the mold you

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.830 
enough to squeeze into the mold you
don't<00:03:58.950> want<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.400> overlap<00:03:59.790> once<00:04:00.060> again<00:04:00.510> and

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
don't want it to overlap once again and

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.860 
don't want it to overlap once again and
it's<00:04:01.680> critical<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:03.300> don't<00:04:03.480> put<00:04:03.690> too

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
it's critical that you don't put too

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.110 
it's critical that you don't put too
much<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.470> because<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:06.120> don't<00:04:06.330> want<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:08.120> be

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
much in because you don't want it to be

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.680 
much in because you don't want it to be
too<00:04:09.150> thick<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.170> that<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:11.610> doesn't<00:04:11.940> stick<00:04:12.150> to

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
too thick so that it doesn't stick to

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.140 
too thick so that it doesn't stick to
the<00:04:13.200> circles<00:04:13.710> so<00:04:14.340> we're<00:04:14.520> just<00:04:14.550> going<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.940> put

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.890 
the circles so we're just going to put
just<00:04:15.859> what<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:17.040> need<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.580> press<00:04:18.270> it<00:04:18.299> down<00:04:18.510> in

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
there as best we can make it as flat as

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.700

would<00:04:50.740> probably<00:04:50.919> let<00:04:51.250> this<00:04:51.460> sit<00:04:51.789> for<00:04:51.819> a<00:04:52.150> few

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
would probably let this sit for a few

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.050 
would probably let this sit for a few
minutes<00:04:52.650> so<00:04:53.650> that<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:54.039> hardens<00:04:54.490> up<00:04:54.639> a<00:04:54.789> little

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
minutes so that it hardens up a little

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.040 
minutes so that it hardens up a little
bit<00:04:55.270> but<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:55.960> don't<00:04:56.800> have<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.130> luxury<00:04:57.340> of<00:04:57.610> that

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
bit but I don't have the luxury of that

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.020 
bit but I don't have the luxury of that
doing<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.169> demo<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.889> you<00:05:00.370> can<00:05:00.550> even<00:05:00.669> see

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
doing the demo and you can even see

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.870 
doing the demo and you can even see
where<00:05:01.240> some<00:05:01.509> of<00:05:01.570> my<00:05:01.810> fondant<00:05:02.460> bled<00:05:03.460> over<00:05:03.490> a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
where some of my fondant bled over a

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.800 
where some of my fondant bled over a
little<00:05:04.090> bit<00:05:04.410> but<00:05:05.410> work<00:05:05.650> with<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.039> and<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.280> can

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
little bit but work with it and you can

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.550 
little bit but work with it and you can
perfect<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:08.139> method<00:05:09.099> that<00:05:09.130> works<00:05:09.460> best<00:05:09.789> for<00:05:10.090> you

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
perfect a method that works best for you

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.330 
perfect a method that works best for you
so<00:05:11.560> let<00:05:11.860> me<00:05:11.889> try<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.280> remove<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.880> fondant<00:05:14.340> from

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
so let me try to remove the fondant from

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.330 
so let me try to remove the fondant from
the<00:05:15.490> mold<00:05:15.789> and<00:05:16.270> again<00:05:17.169> making<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.860> as<00:05:17.979> flat<00:05:18.280> as

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
the mold and again making it as flat as

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.370 
the mold and again making it as flat as
possible<00:05:18.580> because<00:05:19.270> you're<00:05:19.780> going<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.110> glue

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
possible because you're going to glue

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.899 
possible because you're going to glue
this<00:05:20.620> on<00:05:20.889> to<00:05:21.819> your<00:05:22.000> circles<00:05:23.520> okay<00:05:24.520> now<00:05:24.759> what

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
this on to your circles okay now what

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.670 
this on to your circles okay now what
I'm<00:05:25.060> going<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.360> do<00:05:25.509> is<00:05:25.690> I'm<00:05:25.840> going<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.169> pinch

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
I'm going to do is I'm going to pinch

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.490 
I'm going to do is I'm going to pinch
the<00:05:27.780> fondant<00:05:28.780> out<00:05:28.930> of<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.590> mold<00:05:30.419> and<00:05:31.419> as<00:05:32.320> you

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
the fondant out of the mold and as you

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.659 
the fondant out of the mold and as you
can<00:05:32.710> see<00:05:32.740> it<00:05:33.580> just<00:05:33.820> stuck<00:05:34.210> to<00:05:37.919> the<00:05:38.919> back<00:05:39.130> it

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
can see it just stuck to the back it

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.020 
can see it just stuck to the back it
didn't<00:05:40.000> really<00:05:40.120> affect<00:05:40.389> the<00:05:40.840> heart<00:05:41.789> just<00:05:42.789> want

do have a little crack but i'm making
this<00:06:08.740> this<00:06:09.580> video<00:06:10.000> really<00:06:10.300> quickly<00:06:10.810> something

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
this this video really quickly something

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.379 
this this video really quickly something
normally<00:06:12.280> i<00:06:12.310> would<00:06:12.520> take<00:06:12.639> a<00:06:12.699> little<00:06:12.909> more<00:06:13.090> time

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
normally i would take a little more time

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.330 
normally i would take a little more time
so<00:06:14.380> we're<00:06:14.560> going<00:06:14.650> to<00:06:14.740> take<00:06:14.919> a<00:06:14.949> little<00:06:15.130> bit<00:06:15.280> of

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
so we're going to take a little bit of

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.839 
so we're going to take a little bit of
water<00:06:15.610> and<00:06:16.090> put<00:06:16.270> it<00:06:16.389> on<00:06:16.509> the<00:06:16.840> circle<00:06:17.770> not<00:06:18.610> too

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
water and put it on the circle not too

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:21.420 
water and put it on the circle not too
much<00:06:19.060> you<00:06:19.120> don't<00:06:19.360> want<00:06:19.719> it<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:20.050> be<00:06:20.889> too<00:06:20.919> wet

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
much you don't want it to be too wet

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.490 
much you don't want it to be too wet
here<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.930> i'm<00:06:23.110> going<00:06:23.289> to<00:06:23.380> attach<00:06:23.650> the<00:06:24.060> heart

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.800 

and<00:06:29.220> just<00:06:29.400> touch<00:06:29.670> up<00:06:29.700> the<00:06:30.150> center<00:06:30.660> of<00:06:30.690> the

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
and just touch up the center of the

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.300 
and just touch up the center of the
heart<00:06:30.960> with<00:06:31.590> the<00:06:31.770> edge<00:06:31.890> of<00:06:32.310> my<00:06:32.400> pink<00:06:33.180> brush<00:06:35.840> and

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
heart with the edge of my pink brush and

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.560 
heart with the edge of my pink brush and
normally<00:06:38.310> I<00:06:38.340> would<00:06:38.580> let<00:06:38.730> this<00:06:38.940> sit<00:06:39.270> a<00:06:39.300> little

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
normally I would let this sit a little

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:48.200 
normally I would let this sit a little
bit<00:06:39.930> until<00:06:40.400> it<00:06:41.400> dries<00:06:44.960> and<00:06:46.730> it's<00:06:47.730> still<00:06:47.910> kind

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
bit until it dries and it's still kind

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.970 
bit until it dries and it's still kind
of<00:06:48.270> soft<00:06:48.570> because<00:06:48.810> a<00:06:48.990> fondant<00:06:49.590> hasn't

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
of soft because a fondant hasn't

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.620 
of soft because a fondant hasn't
hardened<00:06:50.310> up<00:06:50.370> but<00:06:50.640> this<00:06:50.790> is<00:06:50.970> why<00:06:51.120> you<00:06:51.180> end<00:06:51.450> up

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
hardened up but this is why you end up

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.920 
hardened up but this is why you end up
with<00:06:51.810> this<00:06:51.870> beautiful<00:06:53.000> cameo<00:06:54.000> mold<00:06:54.300> when

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
with this beautiful cameo mold when

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.750 
with this beautiful cameo mold when
you're<00:06:55.080> done<00:06:55.290> and<00:06:55.590> you<00:06:55.890> can<00:06:56.070> use<00:06:56.250> any<00:06:56.460> of<00:06:56.610> the

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
you're done and you can use any of the

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.660 
you're done and you can use any of the
modes<00:06:57.560> actually<00:06:58.560> the<00:06:58.710> first<00:06:58.920> one<00:06:59.220> that<00:06:59.340> I<00:06:59.430> made

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670 
modes actually the first one that I made

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.790 
modes actually the first one that I made
is<00:06:59.820> a<00:06:59.850> little<00:07:00.240> better<00:07:00.420> looks<00:07:00.720> looks<00:07:01.260> nicer

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
is a little better looks looks nicer

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.190 
is a little better looks looks nicer
than<00:07:01.950> the<00:07:02.220> one<00:07:02.460> that<00:07:03.000> I<00:07:03.060> just<00:07:03.360> made<00:07:03.600> on<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.900> fly

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
than the one that I just made on the fly

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.360 
than the one that I just made on the fly
but<00:07:05.480> i<00:07:06.480> hope<00:07:06.660> the<00:07:06.870> eye<00:07:06.900> you<00:07:07.050> can<00:07:07.500> use<00:07:07.710> this<00:07:07.919> and
