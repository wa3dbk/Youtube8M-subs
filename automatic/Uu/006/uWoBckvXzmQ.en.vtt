inside this mechanism here is where the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.630 
inside this mechanism here is where the
the<00:01:55.640> pin<00:01:55.939> will<00:01:56.330> actually<00:01:56.720> come<00:01:57.020> out<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.650> don't

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
the pin will actually come out I don't

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.370 
the pin will actually come out I don't
know<00:01:58.729> if<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:58.880> can<00:01:59.000> see<00:01:59.150> that<00:01:59.360> there<00:01:59.659> but

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380

know if you can see that there but
that's<00:02:00.470> where<00:02:00.650> it'll<00:02:00.860> actually<00:02:01.070> come<00:02:01.490> out<00:02:01.520> to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
that's where it'll actually come out to

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.600 
that's where it'll actually come out to
break<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.200> chain<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.979> actually<00:02:04.280> press<00:02:04.580> the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
break the chain to actually press the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.179 
break the chain to actually press the
pin<00:02:04.970> through<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:06.470> order<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.770> change<00:02:07.040> that

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
pin through and in order to change that

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.159 
pin through and in order to change that
out<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:08.119> just<00:02:08.299> back<00:02:08.569> this<00:02:08.929> all<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.860> way<00:02:09.979> out

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:11.169 
out you just back this all the way out

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.710 
out you just back this all the way out
like<00:02:12.169> so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.710 

and<00:02:14.810> then<00:02:15.140> gone<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.650> there<00:02:16.450> then<00:02:17.450> there's<00:02:17.660> a

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
and then gone in there then there's a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.660 
and then gone in there then there's a
little<00:02:17.990> spring<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.710> then<00:02:19.220> there's<00:02:19.460> your

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
little spring and then there's your

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.270 
little spring and then there's your
there's<00:02:20.450> your<00:02:20.570> pin<00:02:20.750> I'll<00:02:21.410> throw<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.710> back<00:02:22.040> on

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
there's your pin I'll throw that back on

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.090 
there's your pin I'll throw that back on
there<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:23.480> probably<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.500> most<00:02:24.650> unique

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
there and probably the most unique

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.180 
there and probably the most unique
feature<00:02:25.580> about<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.350> little<00:02:27.560> anvil

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
feature about this is this little anvil

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.550 
feature about this is this little anvil
that<00:02:28.460> they<00:02:28.610> have<00:02:28.820> here<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.360> they<00:02:30.110> try<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.380> make

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
that they have here and they try to make

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.890 
that they have here and they try to make
it<00:02:30.590> as<00:02:30.800> foolproof<00:02:31.130> as<00:02:31.310> possible<00:02:32.180> by<00:02:32.540> putting

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
it as foolproof as possible by putting

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.770 
it as foolproof as possible by putting
little<00:02:33.380> letters<00:02:34.100> on<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.180> if<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.540> want<00:02:35.720> to

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
little letters on it so if you want to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.410 
little letters on it so if you want to
rip<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.680> chain<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.250> mark<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.880> line<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.270> r

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
rip it the chain you mark you line the r

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.990 
rip it the chain you mark you line the r
up<00:02:38.630> with<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.050> are<00:02:39.200> over<00:02:39.440> there<00:02:39.850> just<00:02:40.850> like

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
up with the are over there just like

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.110 
up with the are over there just like
that<00:02:41.240> now<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.200> anvil<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.130> in<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.700> right<00:02:43.880> place

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
that now the anvil is in the right place

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.050 
that now the anvil is in the right place
to<00:02:44.870> rivet<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.440> chain<00:02:45.740> if<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.550> want<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.760> break

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
to rivet the chain if you want to break

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.090 
to rivet the chain if you want to break
the<00:02:47.360> chain<00:02:49.150> move<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.270> over<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:51.040> now<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
the chain move it over like that now the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.730 
the chain move it over like that now the
B<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.760> lined<00:02:53.150> up<00:02:53.300> with<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> break<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.560> now

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
B is lined up with the break and now

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.470 
B is lined up with the break and now
you're<00:02:54.920> ready<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.490> anvil<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.330> right
