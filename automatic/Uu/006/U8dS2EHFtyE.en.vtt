00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.509
 Colleague of mine I am to the efsa and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.849
 Although today the review on this case 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.040
 here for the iphone 5 from the home flix 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.809
 The model is now called smudge 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 do not have to draw the three color variants 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.139
 once every white model here that 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.720
 orange and black 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 The whole thing is still in red and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.590
 I will tell you all about it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.539
 first demonstrate this model 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.500
 as I have on the front now 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.510
 this gumming the whole there is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.590
 just said in different colors 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.630
 selection options 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.489
 the back is always so claire now 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.079
 that is to say that you were there from 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.250
 iphone can recognize very nice 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.120
 we'll just teach it 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.850
 you just have to go here now 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.250
 buttons side create the other side 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.170
 pull it off then that's it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 already ready for use if we are here now 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.940
 we can see from the front 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.719
 that now even on the white model 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.329
 not noticeable 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.969
 So the white case my ans iphone 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.760
 makes and yes I think it looks up 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.739
 every case really cool from the whole 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.409
 we can look at animals from the side 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.540
 see that the buttons so the volume 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.619
 Governor now also through this crisis 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.330
 are protected 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.979
 here is still the recess for the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.909
 switch sides you come here 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.640
 ran smoothly 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.740
 up here then the gumming for 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.509
 he had the power button is also 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.549
 protected 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.110
 here the bottom is then natural 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.240
 the opening once for the licon 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.220
 connection and for the 35 jack plug 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.490
 and then we are still cutouts 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.890
 for the speakers when it's all over here 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.590
 From the back we can look 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.509
 see that here you have very nice iphone 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.430
 can recognize design and me personally 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.680
 likes it the most 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.329
 so if you look at the design of the iphone 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.790
 can see because of the design of iphone 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.500
 just really hot looks around her 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.570
 I also like it a lot 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.250
 i dont if the case somehow 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.479
 the design of the iphone falsified or 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.610
 you just can not see anymore 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.130
 If I'm definitely positive 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.229
 at this case here and now 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.530
 the camera cutouts is also very 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.110
 well done so you can see 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.270
 that you can easily take pictures here 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.490
 can synonymous with the led lightning there 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.160
 not so firm and yes then it is now too 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.170
 still very nice this gumming in white 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.360
 I think it all fits 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.580
 really good looks very chic and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.720
 to look at escalating from the side 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.970
 we can also see that the iphone 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.800
 So one is very nearly as thin 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.470
 bad case you directly on the iphone 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.100
 and that's why we have no 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.700
 label design So that's the case 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.890
 as high as the display and yes 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.290
 iPhone does not offer much more 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.090
 I can give you a short break now 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.560
 demonstrate how the other 2 case is 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.170
 look at the white iphone 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.670
 so if you have a white iphone without 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.290
 case you hardly want to notice 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.709
 i can definitely do this for you 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.360
 recommend white model here if you have one 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.430
 then you can have black iphone 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.019
 get the black here then you see 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.640
 with you the case also not more 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.830
 but I'll show you how it works 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.180
 the white would look the on the 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.860
 front you can the black 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.470
 then see gumming actually looks 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.390
 also pretty chic out here on the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.400
 Of course you can go back again 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.209
 very nice the design of iphone 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.110
 recognize 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.540
 I think that's right in any case 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.100
 cool and now I bring it again 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.100
 short the orange model ran 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.670
 that looks like that you have now 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.470
 here too about these oranges 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.570
 Regulation I find that orange 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.880
 model even most iphone best 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.410
 looks from the three looks here 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.959
 really chic is definitely 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.130
 also a real eye-catcher especially 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.200
 with here from the back 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.390
 You can also do very nice here 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.459
 iphone design recognize over the other 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.340
 case, of course, and inserts to the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:50.090
 the orange side gumming down here 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.890
 then the flix logo also in orange and yes 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.079
 I think you're pretty pretty 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.820
 Send her out to the bottom 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.930

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.760
