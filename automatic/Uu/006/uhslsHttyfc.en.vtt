00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.229 
clove buds this holiday season but I
know<00:02:21.290> she<00:02:21.440> has<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.739> fresh<00:02:22.069> one<00:02:22.310> she's<00:02:22.940> just

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
know she has a fresh one she's just

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.660 
know she has a fresh one she's just
starting<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.690> melt<00:02:24.019> so<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.709> decided<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.459> get<00:02:25.580> her

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
starting to melt so I decided to get her

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.180 
starting to melt so I decided to get her
cinnamon<00:02:26.060> frosting<00:02:26.239> because<00:02:26.780> she<00:02:27.769> does<00:02:27.980> like

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
cinnamon frosting because she does like

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.360 
cinnamon frosting because she does like
the<00:02:28.370> spiciness<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.470> candles<00:02:30.470> but<00:02:30.769> this<00:02:31.099> has<00:02:31.340> a

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
the spiciness and candles but this has a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.420 
the spiciness and candles but this has a
little<00:02:31.549> bit<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.819> creaminess<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.410> mean<00:02:34.400> if

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
little bit of creaminess to so I mean if

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.039 
little bit of creaminess to so I mean if
she<00:02:34.730> doesn't<00:02:35.090> love<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.569> she<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:35.900> always

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
she doesn't love it she can always

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.140 
she doesn't love it she can always
exchange<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.670> got<00:02:37.849> cinnamon<00:02:38.120> frosting

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
have weight issues because sometimes you

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.930 
have weight issues because sometimes you
just<00:03:24.440> love<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.680> scent<00:03:25.069> a<00:03:25.190> lot<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.489> still<00:03:25.730> want

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
to have the scent even though the wicks

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.660 
to have the scent even though the wicks
don't<00:03:28.549> work<00:03:28.670> very<00:03:28.700> well<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.709> I'll<00:03:30.709> probably<00:03:30.980> do

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
don't work very well so I'll probably do

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.300 
don't work very well so I'll probably do
a<00:03:31.700> haul<00:03:32.150> about<00:03:32.569> that<00:03:32.810> warmer<00:03:33.290> whenever<00:03:33.889> I<00:03:34.040> get

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.309 
a haul about that warmer whenever I get
it<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.670> then<00:03:35.000> let<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.359> know<00:03:35.480> my<00:03:35.660> experience

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
it and then let you know my experience

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.710 
it and then let you know my experience
with<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.680> as<00:03:36.799> well<00:03:39.340> then<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.670> got<00:03:40.849> sliced<00:03:41.209> Apple

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
with it as well then I got sliced Apple

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.379 
with it as well then I got sliced Apple
toddy<00:03:41.989> which<00:03:42.530> probably<00:03:43.430> is<00:03:43.940> kind<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.269> a

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
toddy which probably is kind of a

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.140 
toddy which probably is kind of a
strange<00:03:44.690> pick<00:03:45.109> for<00:03:45.380> me<00:03:45.530> but<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.489> kind<00:03:46.849> of<00:03:46.940> saw

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
strange pick for me but I kind of saw

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.500 
strange pick for me but I kind of saw
that<00:03:47.389> it<00:03:47.510> was<00:03:47.630> similar<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.169> leave<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:50.389> I

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
that it was similar to leave and I

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.849 
that it was similar to leave and I
thought<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.840> would<00:03:50.900> be<00:03:51.169> good<00:03:51.319> just<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.709> keep

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
thought this would be good just to keep

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.819 
thought this would be good just to keep
around<00:03:52.069> for<00:03:52.519> like<00:03:52.849> next<00:03:53.690> August<00:03:54.200> whenever<00:03:54.680> I

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
around for like next August whenever I

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.259 
around for like next August whenever I
just<00:03:55.280> love<00:03:56.239> having<00:03:56.660> fall<00:03:57.169> since<00:03:57.650> early<00:03:58.310> for

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
just love having fall since early for

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.729 
just love having fall since early for
some<00:03:59.419> reason<00:03:59.780> it's<00:03:59.900> getting<00:04:00.139> like<00:04:00.290> earlier

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
some reason it's getting like earlier

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.920 
some reason it's getting like earlier
and<00:04:00.980> earlier<00:04:01.069> every<00:04:01.340> year<00:04:01.730> when<00:04:02.359> I<00:04:02.389> want<00:04:02.660> false

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
and earlier every year when I want false

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.589 
and earlier every year when I want false
ends<00:04:03.349> and<00:04:03.730> then<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.910> next<00:04:04.940> three<00:04:05.480> are<00:04:05.510> from

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599
