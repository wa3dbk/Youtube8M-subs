number two is has healing wound healing

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.740 
number two is has healing wound healing
property<00:02:31.350> number<00:02:32.130> three<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:33.060> peripheral

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
property number three is a peripheral

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.500 
property number three is a peripheral
vasodilator<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.580> therefore<00:02:35.970> we'd<00:02:36.090> help<00:02:36.300> with

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
vasodilator so therefore we'd help with

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.660 
vasodilator so therefore we'd help with
circulation<00:02:36.840> or<00:02:37.530> blood<00:02:37.860> circulation<00:02:38.310> around

the<00:02:38.940> body<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:40.280> also<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.970> used<00:02:42.870> as<00:02:43.050> a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
the body and also is used as a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.810 
the body and also is used as a
detoxifier<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:46.050> detoxes<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
detoxifier so it detoxes the the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.860 
detoxifier so it detoxes the the
impurity<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.840> your<00:02:49.200> system<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.480> have<00:02:51.480> here<00:02:51.660> with

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
impurity in your system I have here with

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.480 
impurity in your system I have here with
me<00:02:51.900> some<00:02:52.470> scent<00:02:53.040> Ella

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
me some scent Ella

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.760 
me some scent Ella
tap<00:02:53.640> root<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.870> think<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.380> will<00:02:55.590> be<00:02:55.740> the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
tap root and I think this will be the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.880 
tap root and I think this will be the
best<00:02:56.070> example<00:02:56.340> because<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.330> got<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:58.050> has<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
best example because it got it has the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.070 
best example because it got it has the
most<00:02:59.070> root<00:02:59.690> system<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:02.240> also<00:03:03.240> this<00:03:03.630> one<00:03:03.840> I

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
most root system and also this one I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.340 
most root system and also this one I
would<00:03:04.500> go<00:03:04.800> so<00:03:05.130> far<00:03:05.160> as<00:03:06.350> removing<00:03:08.959> that's<00:03:09.959> until

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
would go so far as removing that's until

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.130 
would go so far as removing that's until
are<00:03:10.500> there<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.370> maybe<00:03:11.580> that's<00:03:12.150> them<00:03:12.450> well

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
are there and maybe that's them well

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.020 
are there and maybe that's them well
because<00:03:13.680> it's<00:03:13.890> just<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.400> help<00:03:14.610> promoting

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
because it's just to help promoting

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.020 
because it's just to help promoting
growth<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> whole<00:03:16.470> leaf<00:03:17.040> like

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
growth and if you have a whole leaf like

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.090 
growth and if you have a whole leaf like
this<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:19.410> would<00:03:19.830> die<00:03:20.010> quite<00:03:20.400> easily<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:22.100> give

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
this it would die quite easily so give

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.720 
this it would die quite easily so give
it<00:03:23.220> one<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:24.920> put<00:03:25.920> them<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.220> some<00:03:26.400> potting

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
it one like so put them in some potting

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.580 
it one like so put them in some potting
mix<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.959> roots<00:03:31.170> down

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
mix the roots down

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:46.070 
mix the roots down
and<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:33.670> cover<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.180> that's<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:37.980> likewise

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.170 

and<00:03:47.080> from<00:03:47.500> there<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:48.099> would<00:03:48.280> recommend<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.030> put

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
and from there I would recommend you put

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.030 
and from there I would recommend you put
it<00:03:49.300> in<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.480> container<00:03:49.900> with<00:03:50.110> lots<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.620> water<00:03:50.860> and

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
it in a container with lots of water and

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.120 
it in a container with lots of water and
just<00:03:51.250> leave<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.730> soak<00:03:52.269> for<00:03:52.660> maybe<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.650> week<00:03:53.920> or

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
just leave it soak for maybe a week or

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.839
