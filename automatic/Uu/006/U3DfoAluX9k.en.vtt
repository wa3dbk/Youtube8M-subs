 already the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.100
 calm 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.900
 enhanced 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.900
 quality 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.870
 the two meters 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 the maternal serotype 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.060
 with two owners the networks 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.750
 two sides and one 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.110
 we try to make a 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.110
 still quite aggressive varies quite a bit 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 extensive 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.140
 mauricio ramos 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 the infiltration 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.280
 I think we have 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.700
 I felt quite balanced has experienced players more players 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.590
 new 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.340
 the state can be always growing enough each seeking its space 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.629
 you can keep your space more and more 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.319
 and I think we are prepared that we have played for all purposes 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.620
 where they teach fatal they admit that I made goals like that 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.370
 fact that the latest expectations of the best technical times in which it simulates the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.799
 best 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.209
 we had analysts' expectations of entry 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.699
 if you are not a champion, come from fifa 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.699
 how will she return to the old rival 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.289
 it's an easy decision 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:42.869
 - it's a more optimistic expectation 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.869
 in the final minutes 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:47.949
 is a great player 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:49.879
 the new constant evolution 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.669
 until the 23rd 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.609
 a great championship tiradentes 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.259
 704 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.649
 it's critical it's big 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.689
 the notion you need to trust 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.689
 it's a joke this team restructuring 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.729
 the basic work 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.619
 of course 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.959
 the base team 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.149
 where do we want 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.359
 from four years to here 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.359
 boavista is afraid to fly 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.319
 we have 10 players rotated 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 six seven or eight 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.029
 this year cadu was the corinthians 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.319
 the photo is the class ab 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.089
 the Eduardo 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.759
 broke shot 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.279
 some matches 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.739
 the Brazilian national team 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.399
 piazzolla 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:44.699
 only school in the sesi 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.369
 the departments 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:50.369
 it's right too 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.419
 flavia 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.419
 those of the house 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:04.119
 the work of the agreement that already 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.949
 From Rio 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.229
 the black box 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.229
 the highlight here 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.469
 in fernandinho himself 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.009
 because he has to be 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.009
 he is 24 years old 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.150
 the shooter himself 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.150
 the younger players we try 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.509
 are matter 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.759
 left adds value 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.189
 tite 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.189
 meeting still on the planet white chocolate 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.669
 the way we like it but it's fitting 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.999
 Is everyone looking for your space? 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.580
 Let's do the best. 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.889
 for the team I think 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.419
 myself 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.330
 I have a nice soul 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.520
 punctuation 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.840
 at the time to get quite strong I think my game is more physical so I think 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.479
 what 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.339
 inside of it and I try to help the most here about the game all 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.920
 Limits 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.760
 according to psd but the socialists were older I got this year 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.000
 a different game that I'm looking for more to pass the ball 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.200
 the driver also does not take away my characteristic from his consortium with 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.309
 this UN peacekeeping force 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:40.759
 that our bridge team can hire kimi and veterans the team is a 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.589
 less leaked time 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:44.430
 suzana santos 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.080
 is a test for a very fast team 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.189
 a very great confidence of each 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.650
 what we can improve without grace and crosses 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.319
 we are there 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.559
 some players were hired and oceans 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:58.699
 like me more 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.770
 the gallup 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.849
 when we are starting to get more and more involved 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.119
 I think that from that moment we only entered the second half 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:08.659
 It will work a lot 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.979
 well our expectation is to make a good championship like in the past 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.689
 the rush traditions 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:17.689
 it's a desert city 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.159
 a team 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.159
 it is middle jungle 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.089
 queirÃ³ that falls on top 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.089
 stay where the 4 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.919
 very balanced team batting 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.729
 and we know that to get you between the four 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.009
 in the third world's first issue 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.240
 working with only four 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.789
 and with certainty 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:51.439
 We're going to work 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:52.749
 locke 

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:54.539
 what 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.539
 bush 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.580
 netto 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.599
 to participate 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:07.580
 netto
