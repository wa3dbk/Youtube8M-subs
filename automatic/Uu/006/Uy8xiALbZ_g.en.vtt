00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:09.380
 what are the goals 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.380
 of local teams 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.130
 the veins per year 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.320
 win the classics 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.570
 which wins above the other 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.130
 sort out 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:30.279
 and if possible be a champion is that not 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.379
 you start with being a champion are not that 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.100
 way to win the classics is what 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:39.040
 priority is what is fundamental is what 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.440
 Mata is what cheers and is what 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.070
 grieves 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.800
 because when you win a classic, you give 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.800
 all and when you lose a classic you go 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 quietly 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.829
 tigers was in the year below the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.130
 monterrey 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:09.130
 and that to me I re-registered because as 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.369
 it may be possible that being so bad 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.140
 monterrey is in the tigueres below the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:22.210
 monterrey in 34 days 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:27.670
 the best team of the year is the america 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:31.540
 the america has 63 points a 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:37.090
 goal difference plus 25 shut up 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:39.250
 that you have miguel herrera bailo abuse and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.460
 to tuca and all those who are 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.670
 they faced in that amount of goals that 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.970
 score and points that wins is the team 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.400
 which more matches won with a total of 17 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:59.910
 in america in second place 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:02.700
 xolos de tijuana with 62 points pay attention to 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:07.350

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.780
 few goals 41 few goals against 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.780

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:34.140
 place with 59 points four points down 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.440
 of the best Mexican soccer team and 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.180
 they just ran to the technician make me the 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.940
 refabrón cavor as it is possible that they are 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.560
 running to the technician who is in third 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.290
 place in the entire Mexican republic for 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.400
 bring a Portuguese who did not know where 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.560
 I was Mexico and when I arrived in Mexico 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.530
 when a questioning 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.459
 bosé does not know where turrión is 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.560
 a torreón turret tower where is left 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.380
 tower or was wondering which author 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.800
 he does not know where the turret remains were brought 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.100
 a Portuguese that smells like a business 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.870
 two that three people 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.049
 in fourth the morelia 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.670
 in fifth the toluca and here comes the 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:31.720
 good in sixth the monterrey and in seventh 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.069
 the tigers takes me and suffers for your love 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.870
 sebastián a como el monterrey 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:43.769
 playing so bad is above the 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.769
 tigers and come here come here monterrey 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:55.700
 55 goals tigers 45 goals in the year 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:01.790
 10 goals above the tigers 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:06.129
 what is that in tigers points has 34 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.390
 points 152 points and the monterrey 55 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.370
 because the monterrey is above the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.959
 tigers because they follow us they did a bad 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.920
 all work everyone did a lousy 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.370
 work 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.709
 - the public 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.880
 the question is 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.280
 villa do you believe that we save this 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.650
 ridiculous to be below the monterrey 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.660
 for a ridiculous is a shame 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.880
 it's a shame to be below the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.950
 monterrey forgive me if not one is a 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.110
 classic 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.500
 as it is below the monterrey 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.490
 we are already filled with crossbreed 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.470
 in the spirit of the cross to the south 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.050
 blue cross was lower than monterrey 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.260
 tigers because it's a team that does not have 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.570
 spirit and already the tiger is the same already 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.610
 They grabbed the same they play when they want 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.190
 obviously in lucas wolves that have not 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.280
 signed is that he did not play well in the 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.560
 last matches never committed not 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.630
 he grabbed the ball for the same as the 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.970
 pacifier in the monterrey as they are going to 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.880
 sign if the last matches he gave 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.639
 they were from a soccer poverty very 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.099
 special 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.099
 believe you believe 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.970
 that tito villa is the solution for 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.220
 tigers today in the morning a person said 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.960
 a phrase I thought 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.960
 that they were going for something better
