my<00:00:51.040> biggest<00:00:51.250> qualms<00:00:51.699> about<00:00:51.790> this<00:00:52.089> figure<00:00:52.390> are

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
my biggest qualms about this figure are

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.509 
my biggest qualms about this figure are
the<00:00:52.839> matte<00:00:53.080> finish<00:00:53.110> on<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:54.010> paint

the matte finish on the paint

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.670 
the matte finish on the paint
applications<00:00:55.150> through<00:00:55.479> the<00:00:55.570> purple<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.440> does

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
applications through the purple it does

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.500 
applications through the purple it does
give<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.100> figure<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.400> slightly<00:00:57.879> cheap<00:00:58.180> feel

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
give the figure a slightly cheap feel

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.109 
give the figure a slightly cheap feel
like<00:00:58.930> it<00:00:59.080> was<00:00:59.199> hand<00:00:59.470> painted<00:00:59.820> not<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.850> deal

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
like it was hand painted not a deal

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.880

breaker<00:01:01.299> for<00:01:01.510> me<00:01:01.750> my<00:01:02.229> other<00:01:02.260> complain<00:01:02.769> about

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
breaker for me my other complain about

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.229 
breaker for me my other complain about
the<00:01:03.129> figure<00:01:03.400> is<00:01:03.580> that<00:01:03.760> they<00:01:03.909> do<00:01:03.970> use<00:01:04.210> a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
the figure is that they do use a

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.850 
the figure is that they do use a
slightly<00:01:04.629> rubbery<00:01:05.260> plastic<00:01:05.850> which<00:01:07.860> also

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
slightly rubbery plastic which also

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.920 
slightly rubbery plastic which also
lends<00:01:09.159> to<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.430> figures<00:01:09.729> cheap<00:01:10.000> feel<00:01:10.240> there's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
lends to the figures cheap feel there's

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.990 
lends to the figures cheap feel there's
a<00:01:11.080> little<00:01:11.290> bit<00:01:11.500> of<00:01:11.530> QC<00:01:11.830> issue<00:01:12.159> is<00:01:12.490> if<00:01:12.729> you<00:01:12.850> can

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
a little bit of QC issue is if you can

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.550 
a little bit of QC issue is if you can
notice<00:01:13.299> here<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.590> pin<00:01:15.070> that<00:01:15.250> holds<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:16.560> elbow

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560

pushed<00:01:20.110> through<00:01:20.500> which<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.040> something<00:01:21.220> that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
pushed through which is something that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.670

size<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.830> do<00:01:59.890> think<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:01.320> GI<00:02:02.320> Joe<00:02:02.409> got<00:02:02.770> here<00:02:02.950> does

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
size I do think the GI Joe got here does

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.250

have<00:02:03.370> a<00:02:03.640> little<00:02:04.120> bit<00:02:04.479> of<00:02:04.570> height<00:02:04.690> advantage<00:02:04.840> on

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
have a little bit of height advantage on

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.880 
have a little bit of height advantage on
them<00:02:05.610> maybe<00:02:06.610> magneto<00:02:07.090> 2<00:02:07.259> with<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.379> stand<00:02:08.649> or

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
them maybe magneto 2 with the stand or

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.589 
them maybe magneto 2 with the stand or
without<00:02:09.129> the<00:02:09.280> stand<00:02:09.489> probably<00:02:10.299> do<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.569> a

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
without the stand probably do that a

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.970 
without the stand probably do that a

helmet molding on both of them

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.820

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
but they do scale nicely go ahead and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.080 
but they do scale nicely go ahead and
take<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> look<00:02:15.069> at<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.250> articulation<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.940> this
