we're always been intrigued me on the
fact<00:01:11.150> that<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.479> was<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:12.530> had<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.710> be<00:01:12.830> so

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
fact that it was so you had to be so

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.859 
fact that it was so you had to be so
precise<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:13.820> everything<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.479> did<00:01:14.659> to

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869

precise and everything that you did to
get<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.049> quicker<00:01:15.770> time<00:01:16.070> or<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.340> faster<00:01:16.729> time<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.240> I

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
get a quicker time or a faster time so I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.929 
get a quicker time or a faster time so I
just<00:01:17.360> kept<00:01:17.900> trying<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:18.290> evolve<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:19.070> how<00:01:19.640> could

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
just kept trying to evolve of how could

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.730 
just kept trying to evolve of how could
I<00:01:20.000> get<00:01:20.060> quicker<00:01:20.420> how<00:01:20.720> could<00:01:20.960> I<00:01:21.020> get<00:01:21.200> better<00:01:21.380> how

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
I get quicker how could I get better how

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.710 
I get quicker how could I get better how
could<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.040> be<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.159> better<00:01:22.400> rider<00:01:22.700> how<00:01:23.479> could<00:01:23.689> I

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
could it be a better rider how could I

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.660 
could it be a better rider how could I
get<00:01:23.900> my<00:01:24.020> times<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.619> increase<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.159> I<00:01:25.189> would<00:01:25.490> try

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
get my times to increase so I would try

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.580 
get my times to increase so I would try
to<00:01:25.729> watch<00:01:26.030> everybody<00:01:26.450> learn<00:01:26.990> from<00:01:27.259> everybody

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
to watch everybody learn from everybody

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.249 
to watch everybody learn from everybody
develop<00:01:28.549> my<00:01:28.670> own<00:01:28.700> style<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.720> then<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.049> just

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
develop my own style and then it just

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.139 
develop my own style and then it just
kept<00:01:30.560> as<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:31.130> started<00:01:31.460> doing<00:01:31.700> more<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.030> more

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
thought well maybe I'd go for a few

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.400 
thought well maybe I'd go for a few
months<00:02:17.100> try<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.760> get<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> top<00:02:18.390> 40<00:02:18.690> or<00:02:18.870> 50<00:02:19.260> to

make some winter rodeos here in Texas
and<00:02:21.570> then<00:02:21.960> we'd<00:02:22.110> go<00:02:22.290> from<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.190> it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
and then we'd go from there and it it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.370 
and then we'd go from there and it it
just<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.240> unbelievable<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.350> we

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
just is unbelievable that we

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.730 
just is unbelievable that we
accomplished<00:02:25.920> what<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.130> accomplished<00:02:27.740> it's

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
accomplished what we accomplished it's

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.380 
accomplished what we accomplished it's
so<00:02:29.100> important<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.760> take<00:02:29.970> care<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.270> these

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
so important to take care of these

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.850 
so important to take care of these
horses<00:02:30.450> when<00:02:31.050> their<00:02:31.230> halt<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.620> you're<00:02:31.710> going

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
horses when their halt and you're going

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.410 
horses when their halt and you're going
down<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.190> road<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> lot<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.090> times

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
down the road because a lot of times

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.090 
down the road because a lot of times
they're<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.960> trailer<00:02:34.350> actually<00:02:34.830> more

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
they're in the trailer actually more

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.520 
they're in the trailer actually more
than<00:02:35.340> you're<00:02:35.610> running<00:02:36.360> barrels<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
than you're running barrels and the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.040 
than you're running barrels and the
stress<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.220> them<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.990> unbelievable

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
stress on them and that is unbelievable

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.350 
stress on them and that is unbelievable
so<00:02:40.320> there's<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.980> lot<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.490> different<00:02:41.790> options<00:02:42.270> to

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
so there's a lot of different options to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.640 
so there's a lot of different options to
do<00:02:42.600> out<00:02:42.750> there<00:02:42.900> there's<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.200> lot<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.470> things

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
do out there there's a lot of things

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.800 
do out there there's a lot of things
that<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:43.980> be<00:02:44.070> done<00:02:44.100> but<00:02:44.460> I<00:02:44.670> think<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.510> get<00:02:45.660> in

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
that can be done but I think you get in

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.660 
that can be done but I think you get in
your<00:02:45.960> own<00:02:45.990> program<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.680> focus<00:02:47.100> on<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> things

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
your own program you focus on the things

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.580 
your own program you focus on the things
that<00:02:47.850> work<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.230> think<00:02:49.440> it's

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that work for you and I think it's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.500 
that work for you and I think it's
really<00:02:50.070> really<00:02:50.370> important<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> find<00:02:51.270> those

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
really really important to find those

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.120 
really really important to find those
things<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.900> work<00:02:52.140> well<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:52.980> your
