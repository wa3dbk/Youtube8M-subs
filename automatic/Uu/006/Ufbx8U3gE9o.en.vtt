favorite game type when I don't have

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.030 
favorite game type when I don't have
time<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> full<00:01:30.060> game<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.540> rush<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.590> conquest

time for a full game of rush or conquest

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.819 
time for a full game of rush or conquest
because<00:01:32.430> those<00:01:32.700> game<00:01:33.090> types<00:01:33.360> tend<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.530> take

because those game types tend to take

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.490 
because those game types tend to take
more<00:01:34.890> time<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.729> I'll<00:01:36.570> address<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
more time but I'll address that in a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.249 
more time but I'll address that in a
future<00:01:37.860> countering<00:01:38.759> when<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> take<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> look<00:01:39.600> on

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
future countering when I take a look on

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.530 
future countering when I take a look on

all been waiting for and honestly I
still<00:01:52.740> haven't<00:01:52.950> decided<00:01:53.159> myself<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.600> is

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
still haven't decided myself if this is

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.289 
still haven't decided myself if this is
the<00:01:54.930> best<00:01:55.140> shooter<00:01:55.530> I've<00:01:55.829> ever<00:01:56.310> played<00:01:56.670> or<00:01:57.030> not

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the best shooter I've ever played or not

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.929 
the best shooter I've ever played or not
and<00:01:57.600> quite<00:01:58.530> frankly<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:59.219> don't<00:01:59.399> think<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.880> will

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and quite frankly I don't think I will

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.090 
and quite frankly I don't think I will
even<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> coming<00:02:01.259> months<00:02:01.560> because

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
even in the coming months because

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100 
even in the coming months because
battlefield<00:02:03.000> bad<00:02:03.149> company<00:02:03.299> 2<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.810> something

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
battlefield bad company 2 was something

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.140 
battlefield bad company 2 was something
that

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
that

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.780 
that
you<00:02:05.480> know<00:02:05.620> in<00:02:06.620> the<00:02:06.800> ending<00:02:07.100> was<00:02:07.280> an<00:02:07.430> amazing

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
you know in the ending was an amazing

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.359 
you know in the ending was an amazing
experience<00:02:07.910> but<00:02:08.600> what<00:02:09.200> most<00:02:09.380> people<00:02:09.560> forgot

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
experience but what most people forgot

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.820 
experience but what most people forgot
is<00:02:10.790> that<00:02:11.060> bad<00:02:11.270> company<00:02:11.690> 2<00:02:11.900> was<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.560> real

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
is that bad company 2 was a real

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.450 
is that bad company 2 was a real
nightmare<00:02:13.190> real<00:02:13.970> nightmare<00:02:14.570> when<00:02:14.930> he<00:02:14.960> came<00:02:15.140> to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
nightmare real nightmare when he came to

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.680 
nightmare real nightmare when he came to
connection<00:02:16.460> problems<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.120> stuff<00:02:17.300> but<00:02:17.510> they

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
connection problems and stuff but they

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.320 
connection problems and stuff but they
solved<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.230> like<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.250> month<00:02:19.580> after<00:02:19.850> release

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
solved that like a month after release

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.540 
solved that like a month after release
and<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.960> think<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.380> was<00:02:21.500> even<00:02:21.680> worse<00:02:21.800> on<00:02:22.190> pc<00:02:22.520> i

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
and I think it was even worse on pc i

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.970 
and I think it was even worse on pc i

reading on Twitter two months ago like

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.530 
reading on Twitter two months ago like
back<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:48.080> August<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.830> battlefield<00:02:49.370> 3<00:02:49.790> would

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
back in August that battlefield 3 would

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.980 
back in August that battlefield 3 would
be<00:02:50.570> one<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.350> biggest<00:02:51.590> letdowns<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.990> 2011

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
be one of the biggest letdowns of 2011

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.770 
be one of the biggest letdowns of 2011
and<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:55.070> know<00:02:55.370> it's<00:02:55.580> quite<00:02:55.790> harsh<00:02:56.120> but<00:02:56.600> I

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
and I know it's quite harsh but I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.660 
and I know it's quite harsh but I
couldn't<00:02:57.170> agree<00:02:57.350> more<00:02:57.440> with<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.400> week

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
couldn't agree more with that week

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.330 
couldn't agree more with that week
because<00:02:59.540> this<00:02:59.780> doesn't<00:03:00.140> necessarily<00:03:00.680> mean

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
because this doesn't necessarily mean

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.250 
because this doesn't necessarily mean
that<00:03:01.400> it's<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.940> bad<00:03:02.120> game<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.750> just<00:03:02.959> means<00:03:03.110> that

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
that it's a bad game it just means that

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.280 
that it's a bad game it just means that
people<00:03:03.560> were<00:03:03.890> expecting<00:03:04.580> way<00:03:05.240> too<00:03:05.300> much<00:03:05.660> from

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
civilized manner but yeah the baseline

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.940 
civilized manner but yeah the baseline
is<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:05.120> baffle<00:04:05.570> 3<00:04:05.810> didn't<00:04:06.230> even<00:04:06.410> come<00:04:06.560> out<00:04:06.680> a

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
is that baffle 3 didn't even come out a

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.670 
is that baffle 3 didn't even come out a
week<00:04:07.280> ago<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:07.970> it's<00:04:08.480> probably<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.900> bit<00:04:09.049> early<00:04:09.440> to

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
week ago so it's probably a bit early to

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.580
