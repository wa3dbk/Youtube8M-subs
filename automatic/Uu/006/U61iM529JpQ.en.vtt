lashes and some black eyeliner to my
waterline<00:05:33.670> okay<00:05:34.570> so<00:05:34.630> honestly<00:05:35.230> I<00:05:35.290> decided<00:05:35.770> to

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
waterline okay so honestly I decided to

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.220 
waterline okay so honestly I decided to
go<00:05:36.040> with<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.280> really<00:05:36.610> dramatic<00:05:37.180> lashes<00:05:37.480> just

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
go with the really dramatic lashes just

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.629 
go with the really dramatic lashes just
because<00:05:38.470> I've<00:05:38.620> never<00:05:38.650> used<00:05:39.100> them<00:05:39.310> before<00:05:39.370> and

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
because I've never used them before and

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.279 
because I've never used them before and
