00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.060
 then people to the body of 198 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.300
 commenting and delivering that a job 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.900
 He commented on his life he formulated char 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.880
 2013 with the Indian force of adrian subtle 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.070
 in Monaco a circuit that personally 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.220
 I like it a lot to see it to run in 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.730
 he is not an urban circuit very streets 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.640
 narrow barriers very close there's no 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.970
 theories escape escapes into the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.260
 first curve and little and little more for 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.379
 labels that well the positions of 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.379
 exit 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.240
 and good about this I hope you like it 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.660
 something in first one has asked me for a 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.000
 subscriber 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.810
 and well here it is going to have, I hope that 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.280
 you like it and good from 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.020
 probably some series in 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.570
 the one that I'm going to run in all 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.250
 circuits one by one followed 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.040
 start in melbourne until you finish 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 females and some circuit is missing in this 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.640
 game then 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.430
 then not being able to at all lack it seems 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.179
 which is the one from turkey and the one from germany 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.840
 that also but good surely I will 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.840
 that's the output 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.810
 barack and jump a wing 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.060
 as two or three ailerons have jumped to 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.729
 watch 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.970
 it would be important to get ahead of the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.060
 williams got well and ahead 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.310
 of this perfect ticket because the williams 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.140
 does not lead to valerÃ³n so very slow and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.869
 the other was going to no rear wing and was 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.720
 a caterham then a caterham is 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.299
 slow in case you imagine jazzing without 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.960
 rear spoiler is worth here let's say 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.909
 ok if any double here is a like no 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.429
 you have me still beating for that 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.810
 overtaking the let's see here if 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:08.349
 I can now with 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.620
 with the lotus I could not there what 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:16.060
 I will try now surely on the girl 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.000
 to the sergio perez I will try to run 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.610
 I'm going to run to the ace that operates playing 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.890
 I maximized because 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.680
 I do not have a car to win then 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.810
 more or less I do not care 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.150
 like everyone skipping here the girls 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.709
 as it comes out of the eggs but xian 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.629
 also that goes right behind it 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.200
 ahead of that but hey he has not 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.500
 touched the eggs a lot so 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.720
 so nothing happens shit of touched 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.660
 but that does not give you any serious damage in 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.950
 rear wing that would be a bitch 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.720
 Pretty curious but not because you have 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.900
 when braking I would have left but pretty 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.750
 we touch 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.390
 It's my turn to have another pilot from 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.269
 coloradismo I do not remember what it was but 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.920
 it has gone quite badly stopped the I do not 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.709
 much 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.489
 to the taste of me is jean eric vergne the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.160
 French then as you know Ricardo has 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.950
 signed is in order 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.690
 to see who they catch for pink tones to 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.080
 see if there is luck and carlos sainz sounds 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.870
 junior of the gp3's let's see if 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.480
 lucky because he is a great driver Carlos 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.600
 sainz junior and so we would have another 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.770
 Spanish driver in good good williams and 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.530
 turned around to see here convert 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.490
 Fucking shit like he gave it back to me 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.350
 outside 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.920
 it's worth it now, I 'll touch you inside 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.920
 inside 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.990
 I'm already in 11th place 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.050
 next stop raikkonen to see if 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.000
 I arrive are only three laps here 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.250
 it is here we have it 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.959
 I'm against the wheel pretty much 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.209
 helps came to the usual me none 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.890
 I only carry all the marches 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.690
 why 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.780
 for me it is quite and it will be 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.939
 changing gear 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.060
 then it's ok and I'm going to change the cast 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:14.879
 of braking forward to 60 40 to see 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.359
 that does not shock me very well well good 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:21.600
 not because it hits me today and that's very 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.240
 good for my car because I lose 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.410
 points of aerodynamic points 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.530
 important to see 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.460
 last round with now would be in zone 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.390
 of points to see what happens raikkonen and the 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.430
 Mercedes 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.140
 I'm having enough pace because 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.810
 they caught with a this car not the force 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.240
 India is not to have the pace that 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.370
 can have for example this grants to 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.380
 I hugo that past you 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.530
 I'm already ninth let's see with 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.410
 raikkonen because raikkonen is a pilot 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.790
 rather crappy to overtake and 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.680
 hold back 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:07.729
 I'm touching the walls a lot 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.509
 so it may be that it gets better 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.509
 Car 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.640
 ok let's see and I thought that what 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:20.420
 played uncle we're going to see there well spent 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.320
 the chicane hurrying to the fullest 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.450
 now the thing is that in this sector the 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.400
 sector 3 there are not many places to 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.070
 overtake and that's what I'm going to 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.250
 harm 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.300
 because he could have gone to king with him 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:39.460
 if I got more to ghana the career shit 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.630
 God came out to overtake and the 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.420
 good trigger let's see how well I'm going 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.880
 to be eighth I guess 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.740
 ok ok well ok eighth is nothing 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.910
 badly I lost the eaves in the last 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.920
 back but good 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.340
 has won felipe massa 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.590
 not bad 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.080
 it was not bad the race I believe in me 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.169
 opinion coming out last that to the eighth the 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.210
 Monaco pretty much overtaking some 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.310
 some pretty piggy overtaking 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.169
 another pretty good but good but 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.410
 especially that you liked the 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.750
 gameplay let me your favorite 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.040
 if you liked it so good here 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.530
 you have the table of how they have been 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.500
 Fernando has been second to three seconds 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.000
 three seconds from fernando vettel os 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.430
 I say the podium the rest if you want what 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.330
 you can go see until the 13th place 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.770
 we'll see 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:37.419
 here is going down vale but xiang 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:40.439
 abandoned by accident 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:44.620
 charles pic also and maldonado also 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:47.530
 bad I do not think it can be I do not know if it will be 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.169
 with which I have touched myself or the one 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.610
 it was turned around because I think that 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.210
 is that right now I do not remember well 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.160
 with which one it was with the one that touched me 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.830
 but I hope you liked it 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.850
 so I say goodbye until the next 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.850
 video goodbye people
