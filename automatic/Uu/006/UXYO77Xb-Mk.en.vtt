classical music I took piano lessons I
think<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.660> started<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.140> six<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.890> only<00:00:53.309> lasted<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
think I started at six I only lasted a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.910 
think I started at six I only lasted a
couple<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.149> years<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.960> college<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.620> heard

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
couple of years but in college I heard

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
couple of years but in college I heard
the<00:00:56.039> kinks<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.940> yardbirds<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the kinks in the yardbirds in that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.849 
the kinks in the yardbirds in that
English<00:00:58.230> sound

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
English sound

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:16.620 
English sound
not<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.090> done<00:01:00.660> Anna<00:01:01.730> dhaan<00:01:02.760> dead

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.840 

Tanna<00:01:16.810> then<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.650> got<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.890> bug<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.340> so<00:01:18.580> then<00:01:18.759> I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
Tanna then I got the bug and so then I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.270 
Tanna then I got the bug and so then I
started<00:01:19.180> trying<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.600> pound<00:01:19.869> out<00:01:20.200> some<00:01:20.740> simple

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
started trying to pound out some simple

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.520 
started trying to pound out some simple
chords<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:21.970> things<00:01:22.210> on<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.479> piano<00:01:22.689> but<00:01:23.290> the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
chords and things on a piano but the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.160 
chords and things on a piano but the
music<00:01:23.830> was<00:01:23.860> still<00:01:24.220> strictly<00:01:24.759> for<00:01:25.119> fun<00:01:25.150> after<00:01:26.140> I

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
music was still strictly for fun after I

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.680 
music was still strictly for fun after I
graduated<00:01:27.009> I<00:01:27.310> became<00:01:27.369> a<00:01:27.759> product<00:01:28.390> design

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
graduated I became a product design

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.899 
graduated I became a product design
engineer<00:01:29.200> for<00:01:29.229> Polaroid<00:01:29.770> I<00:01:30.159> worked<00:01:30.790> on

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
engineer for Polaroid I worked on

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.910 
engineer for Polaroid I worked on
several<00:01:31.180> different<00:01:31.659> projects<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.619> one<00:01:32.799> that

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
several different projects the one that

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.090 
several different projects the one that
I<00:01:32.979> liked<00:01:33.190> best<00:01:33.430> was<00:01:33.580> building<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.570> sound<00:01:35.470> system

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
I liked best was building a sound system

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.510 
I liked best was building a sound system
for<00:01:36.520> analog<00:01:37.420> instant<00:01:38.229> movies<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:39.250> that's

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
for analog instant movies and that's

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.899 
for analog instant movies and that's
where<00:01:39.759> I<00:01:39.789> learned<00:01:40.119> how<00:01:40.780> tape<00:01:41.170> recording<00:01:41.710> work

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
where I learned how tape recording work

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.170 
where I learned how tape recording work
so<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:43.210> started<00:01:43.869> buying<00:01:44.289> time<00:01:44.619> at<00:01:45.100> studios<00:01:45.940> and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
so I started buying time at studios and

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.430 
so I started buying time at studios and
he<00:01:46.780> did<00:01:46.960> for<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.259> few<00:01:47.470> years<00:01:48.070> and<00:01:48.430> it<00:01:48.549> just<00:01:48.850> never

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
he did for a few years and it just never

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.419 
he did for a few years and it just never
came<00:01:50.440> out<00:01:50.679> of<00:01:51.039> there

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
came out of there

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.330 
came out of there
with<00:01:51.580> what<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:51.819> was<00:01:52.000> looking<00:01:52.300> for<00:01:52.539> I<00:01:53.009> decided<00:01:54.009> if

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
with what I was looking for I decided if

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.130 
with what I was looking for I decided if
I<00:01:54.520> was<00:01:54.670> going<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.909> do<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.569> have<00:01:55.810> things

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
I was going to do this and have things

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.139 
I was going to do this and have things
sound<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.770> way<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:56.920> imagined<00:01:57.610> them<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:57.940> was

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
sound the way I imagined them I was

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.480 
sound the way I imagined them I was
gonna<00:01:58.240> have<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.539> do<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.750> myself<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.710> built<00:02:00.369> a

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
gonna have to do it myself so I built a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.880 
gonna have to do it myself so I built a
very<00:02:00.610> crude<00:02:01.090> studio<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.319> basement<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.740> my

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
very crude studio in a basement of my

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.040 
very crude studio in a basement of my
apartment<00:02:03.130> house<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.789> learned<00:02:04.240> everything<00:02:04.780> I

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
apartment house I learned everything I

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.529 
apartment house I learned everything I
could<00:02:05.500> about<00:02:05.800> engineering<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:06.970> producing

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
could about engineering and producing

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.960 
could about engineering and producing
and<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.840> started<00:02:08.410> trying<00:02:08.590> my<00:02:08.830> hand<00:02:08.979> at<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.340> from

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and I started trying my hand at it from

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.259 
and I started trying my hand at it from
studying<00:02:10.569> physics<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:11.110> learned<00:02:11.430> basically<00:02:12.430> how

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
studying physics I learned basically how

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.270 
studying physics I learned basically how
music<00:02:13.690> worked<00:02:13.900> how<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.200> human<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.769> heard<00:02:15.069> it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
music worked how the human you heard it
