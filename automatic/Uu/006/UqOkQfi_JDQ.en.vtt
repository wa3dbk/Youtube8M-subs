 the challenge is a round 50 on the difficulty 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.259

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.780

 play 3 that I think normally my 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.600
 subscribers in sync play 3 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.790
 true that it is a great coincidence but 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.210
 good 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.569
 I'm not here to tell you about it 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.890

 I simply upload what you 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.319

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.120

 have a good time with you guys 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.030
 that simply to what we all come to 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.030
 watch videos on youtube to have fun 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.819
 with our favorite youtubers and others 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.170
 well also tell you that I make series 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.640
 like road to round 50 and others clear me 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.260
 I always try to help how I go back to 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.300
 say sorry for repeating myself but 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.650
 it's always the most important thing my channel is 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.930
 how help is to help them 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.030
 get your people in 50 is not like 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.560
 to teach games like he does wrong 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.870
 cut round 100 because the truth that 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.430
 shadowed you can not fall and always 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.400
 get to high rounds and teach them to 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.650
 you how to get it also 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.220
 can play on different maps we can 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.870
 play village farm ni oct still got 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.060
 get to the gunsmith 50 we can also 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.550
 make a series with subscribers of 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.170
 inventory arrive with you being 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.549
 four people to the branch 40 the truth 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.530
 which is very difficult to achieve 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.600
 but good 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.080
 also say that on the map of trànsit 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.750
 we can reach the round 40 50 60 70 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.000
 really very easily with the weapon of 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.860
 the jet cam that is through a trick 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.730
 that so you never spend that you can 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.159
 see in the web channel 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.200
 As you can see in my channel, I have 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.780
 about 700 subscribers but the truth is 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.940
 something a little false since all 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.440
 Subscribers who subscribe but 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.450
 usually do not see the videos something that 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.250
 I do not understand, but usually your 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.569
 missions see about 50 people but I 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.390
 connect and with a song in the teeth 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.520
 because they like 50 or 40 people 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.860
 who watch the videos also gives me 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.720
 you give me already I do not need more visits 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.640
 also with that is not enough but 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.260
 good all the people who want to come and 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.810
 you know this is going to be a zombie channel 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.340
 and if you want multiplayer I too 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.870
 was cannes multiplayer as I say 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.940
 I'm saying I'm going to upload everything 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.040
 that you want, I do not have any 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.320
 problem to tell you a game of the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.990
 starting distributed I'm seeing a 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.270
 summary from round 45 round 50 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.220
 with different stretches in the magician of 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.739
 people so you can see how I make a 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.450
 24 zombie ball that is run by the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.880
 zone below the titan and doing as 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.670
 eights and in this way together list the 24 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.230
 very easily the truth that in this 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.840
 map and everything else from the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.120
 round 45 the only weapon that serves are the 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.370
 mustang and the ray gun comes out the 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.900
 raigal water it needs to be 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.640
 improved but good it costs a lot 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.650
 kill with the reagan you have to shoot at 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.240
 strong feet and not zombies do not 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.010
 They die neither backwards is something that good 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.690
 that you have to understand everything is a 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.000
 complicated round and you have to take hours 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.490
 with each round of being I used to take 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.230
 about ten minutes to spend the one me 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.740
 I was left without the last occurrence you go in the 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.120
 round 47 then since since already 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.530
 I had been killed three times before and 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.150
 I was already a bit rushed for the end 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.610
 to integrate my challenge that I put that 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.290
 was to reach round 50 and it was something that 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.700
 I wanted to achieve since few people who 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.680
 I have seen you on YouTube 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.780
 get to round 50 on these maps the 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.090
 white 2 only that in this white author 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.360
 there are no definitive weapons like they were the 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.460
 sandero or the van der base in the black 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.170
 ops 1 and this is what makes the game more 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.790
 fun and harder to climb rounds 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.440
 since on the target if you do not 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.290
 the records were shot on each map the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.910
 rounds 100 120 130 and it was something very 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.190
 hard to get and that lasted a lot 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.110
 time then to me that's why I like it 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.930
 a lot this black like all my games 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.310
 preferred by these game modes 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.900
 also say that it's going to be a new one 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.190
 new mode of playing model tours net that 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.260
 we are not going to be able to get in 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.790
 zombies in the next risk dlc 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.550
 It will be very nice to see you try it 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.080
 good guys the bid and you're already 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.760
 finishing I hope you liked it and 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.930
 above all it is worth 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.510
 I like the video give me an opportunity 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.310
