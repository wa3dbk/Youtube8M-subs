load for a long time we'll skip the
intro<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> think<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.290> been<00:01:22.470> shown<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.890> YouTube

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
intro I think it's been shown on YouTube

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.249 
intro I think it's been shown on YouTube
er<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.610> few<00:01:24.090> times<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> haven't<00:01:24.930> seen<00:01:25.080> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
er a few times if you haven't seen it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.990 
er a few times if you haven't seen it
then<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.460> around<00:01:26.580> you'll

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
then if you have a look around you'll

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.420 
then if you have a look around you'll
probably<00:01:27.119> find<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.570> intro

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430
