00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.410
 before we break it down 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.250
 I want to break that again 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 Folders compare breaks in the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.830
 center point 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.670
 I have indicated this several times 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.130
 and also some of our helpful bills 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.740
 reasoning that among other things 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.510
 it is necessary to break with each other 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.850
 to be able to compare or rank 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.930
 By the way, such a work can be 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.079
 folder of breaks is often considered small 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.399
 Partial exams final exam of the class 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.030
 10 so it is quite good if 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.550
 one certainly mastered so folder 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 crime somewhere 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.100
 I give myself this big one now 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.730
 Headline but would like to go now 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.710
 Write to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.660
 what possibilities there are 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.559
 the rai people are now completely 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.309
 arbitrarily one can break one another 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.309
 to compare 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.229
 first, an old familiar method by 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.880
 you represent them on a timeline 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.880
 So representation 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.100
 on a pay dispenser 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.930
 we'll sometimes in a very 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.950
 arbitrarily elected peoples too 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.140
 practice 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.480
 on the other hand you can book with each other 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.690
 Compare by looking at the circle 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.060
 Diagrams or similar 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.060
 Compare diagrams with each other 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.150
 I'd say papa 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.050
 another comparison is possible if 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.690
 you break as a kiddie be given 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.650
 said casual in relatively easy yet 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:35.500
 Comparison in front so comparison with bread 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:37.780
 by mixed numbers 4 can be 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:48.520
 comparing breaks with each other 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:50.560
 Immediately I took her and then the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.870
 compare counters with each other i have 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.760
 so same emma i need one 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.860
 compare counters with each other and one 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.650
 other possibility that too 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.500
 it is helpful that I mean then 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.350
 just break into the two 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.090
 breaks or was already given that 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:19.450
 we compare with each other 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:23.519
 as a comparison of dz fractions so we 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.690
 as we have an enumeration of 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.170
 Comparisons for broken 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.970
 pay just try at the times 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.700
 some examples in a pretty 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.190
 arbitrarily reinfeldt too 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.489
 visualize and also to 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.489
 internalize 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.890
 a possibility of comparison races 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.160
 to be broken 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.750
 who knows the illustration on one 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.769
 Timeline I have my little one 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.290
 Part of a sketch of his quarrel 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.070
 and consciously chosen the units so 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:04.510
 that it is possible for us some times 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.680
 I'll ask one-on-one or something too close 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.959
 to let in here 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.519
 we do have time to zero once the 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:15.030
 second one does not dare to do some 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.030
 Examples include a quarter here 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:30.150
 here we would have one 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:30.150
 in this book main unites because of 3813 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.660
 still does not demand three quarters 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:44.460
 half between 78 and know one too 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:50.200
 very dense, namely 89 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:57.060
 that will be this one or three times 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:01.060
 half or 175th 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:05.650
 well, always be there 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.780
 So each can break one 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.530
 such point on the pay beach too 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.000
 Arrange and it is the rule if I 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.210
 say if then want to compare 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.770
 that the time which lies further to the left 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.710
 always the smaller one 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.120
 if i follow up the task now and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.669
 38 to compare 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.080
 this iphone is further to the left than 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.970
 So I can easily say that 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.720
 just my unfortunately that is left asking 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.910
 less than 38 though I'm from the 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.530
 structure of the book because it 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.900
 different men are not 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.270
 Immediately recognizing this could be even clearer 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.350
 also use if for example my 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:52.710
 is gone 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:54.880
 3 front comparisons let's say 89 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.660
 you will not always be there straightaway 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.030
 Immediately recognize who is the 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.460
 larger first smaller but at one 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.790
 it is an open discussion 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.050
 possible raptor left 189 is called 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.060
 should then also this relationship 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.720
 I really know that 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.990
 continue 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:18.210
 So it does not matter because I'm in 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:22.479
 three half is less than 1 75 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.680
 where it does not matter if form 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.900
 now these breaks 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.090
 given as a base price to the 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.050
 book that would be interesting 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.039
 So that would be a possibility I said 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.590
 ever 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.169
 It is also often a series of breaks 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.360
 given and this message from view 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:45.520
 it can be useful so 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:47.410
 to proceed one arranges these breaks thus 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.770
 usually in size 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.060
 that means you start in the cloud 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.310
 not usually meter with the 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.590
 smallest book if not express 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.120
 otherwise in advance what 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.220
 So this bridge now in one 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.160
 would build up such a relationship 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.400
 I say he wants a formula is smaller 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.470
 than 38 and that's less than three 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.880
 quarter 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:14.560
 that you can now freely percent 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:18.520
 less than 78 be less than eight and 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.039
 so on according to this seduce 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.190
 according to this shed bring so 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:27.250
 So that's a possible comparison 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.169
 with the help of such a dispute 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.720
 the other option would be now 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:33.220
 I also apply that now 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.380
 just out that for example the 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.240
 make breaks uniform and then have 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.560
 I immediately in emma and then needed 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.220
 I only use the counter to each other 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.380
 to compare 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.860
 maybe that too at some 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.860
 examples
