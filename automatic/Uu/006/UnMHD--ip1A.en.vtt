well in this segment we're going to talk
about<00:00:01.800> internal<00:00:02.429> engine<00:00:02.760> components<00:00:03.330> and

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
about internal engine components and

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
different types of components you need

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.710 
different types of components you need
to<00:00:05.130> really<00:00:05.520> make<00:00:05.790> an<00:00:05.940> engine<00:00:06.180> strong<00:00:06.509> enough

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
to really make an engine strong enough

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.660 
to really make an engine strong enough
to<00:00:06.810> withstand<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.290> big<00:00:07.500> shot<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.770> nitrous<00:00:07.980> of

course<00:00:08.880> we<00:00:08.970> have<00:00:09.059> said<00:00:09.269> earlier<00:00:09.540> if<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.719> have

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
course we have said earlier if you have

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.970 
course we have said earlier if you have
a<00:00:09.840> stock<00:00:10.110> engine<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.620> you're<00:00:10.710> running<00:00:10.889> a

a stock engine and you're running a

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.650 
a stock engine and you're running a
moderate<00:00:11.460> amount<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.790> nitrous<00:00:12.240> that's<00:00:12.450> within

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
moderate amount of nitrous that's within

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.720 
moderate amount of nitrous that's within
reason<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.799> engine<00:00:14.009> can<00:00:14.099> handle<00:00:14.400> you

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
reason of what the engine can handle you

reason of what the engine can handle you
don't<00:00:14.880> need<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> doing<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:16.170> if

just<00:01:26.700> talking<00:01:26.909> about<00:01:27.000> stock<00:01:27.299> blocks<00:01:27.570> right

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
just talking about stock blocks right

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.480 
just talking about stock blocks right
here<00:01:27.810> something<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:28.290> reasonably<00:01:29.070> priced

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
here something that's reasonably priced

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.980 
here something that's reasonably priced
that<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.090> majority<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.750> would<00:01:30.869> probably

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that the majority of you would probably

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.440 
that the majority of you would probably
using<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> 4<00:01:32.759> bolt<00:01:32.909> main<00:01:33.030> that's

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
using out there so a 4 bolt main that's

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.760 
using out there so a 4 bolt main that's
basically<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.229> means<00:01:34.590> there's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
basically all it is just means there's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.710 
basically all it is just means there's
four<00:01:35.100> bolts<00:01:35.490> holding<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> main<00:01:36.060> caps<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
four bolts holding the main caps in and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.359 
four bolts holding the main caps in and
what<00:01:36.810> holds<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.079> crankshaft<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.189> main

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
what holds the crankshaft in the main

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.390 
what holds the crankshaft in the main
caps<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.869> there's<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.200> twice<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
caps so you know there's just twice the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.340 
caps so you know there's just twice the
clamping<00:01:41.759> power<00:01:41.970> or<00:01:42.540> twice<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> clamping

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
clamping power or twice the clamping

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
clamping power or twice the clamping
forces<00:01:43.740> holding<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.189> main<00:01:44.340> caps<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.880> let's

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
forces holding the main caps in let's

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.810 
forces holding the main caps in let's
look<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> Ford<00:01:46.049> right<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.670> that's<00:01:47.670> right

mains not as strong as a 4 bolt and a
lot<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.310> people<00:02:31.520> think<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.150> that's

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
lot of people think that and that's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.810 
lot of people think that and that's
wrong<00:02:32.710> there's<00:02:33.710> other<00:02:33.920> factors<00:02:34.490> that<00:02:34.520> could

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
wrong there's other factors that could

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.730 
wrong there's other factors that could
become<00:02:35.090> involved<00:02:35.360> with<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.810> one<00:02:36.380> thing<00:02:36.590> is

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.910 
got one that's the size of my middle
finger<00:02:50.390> here<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:51.080> got<00:02:51.230> one<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.500> size<00:02:51.709> my

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
finger here and you got one this size my

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.190 
finger here and you got one this size my
little<00:02:52.160> finger<00:02:52.430> okay<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.570> mean<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.900> Chevy's

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
little finger okay so I mean the Chevy's

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.540 
little finger okay so I mean the Chevy's
have<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.350> little<00:02:54.590> little<00:02:54.950> bolt<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.340> fours

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
have a little little bolt and the fours

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.250 
have a little little bolt and the fours
have<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.760> big<00:02:55.970> one<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.330> maybe<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:56.870> only<00:02:57.020> two

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
have a big one so maybe it's only two

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.790 
have a big one so maybe it's only two
bolt<00:02:57.500> main<00:02:57.740> but<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.900> studs<00:03:00.290> or<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.560> bolts

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
bolt main but the the studs or the bolts

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.260 
bolt main but the the studs or the bolts
holding<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.100> in<00:03:01.250> are<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> lot<00:03:01.670> bigger<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
holding it in are a lot bigger and the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.730 
holding it in are a lot bigger and the
main<00:03:02.450> caps<00:03:02.720> are<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:02.930> lot<00:03:03.110> bigger<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.560> stronger

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
main caps are a lot bigger and stronger

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.220 
main caps are a lot bigger and stronger
so<00:03:04.490> there's<00:03:04.730> there's<00:03:05.330> always<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.630> give<00:03:05.930> for<00:03:06.200> a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
so there's there's always a give for a

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.630 
so there's there's always a give for a
take<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.770> just<00:03:06.920> depends<00:03:07.250> on<00:03:07.310> what<00:03:07.490> you're

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
take it just depends on what you're

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.710 
take it just depends on what you're
looking<00:03:07.670> at<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.209> always<00:03:08.330> have<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.540> compare

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
looking at so you always have to compare

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.320 
looking at so you always have to compare
apples<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.290> apples<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:09.770> oranges<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.160> oranges

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
apples to apples and oranges to oranges

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.550 
apples to apples and oranges to oranges
so<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.360> lot<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.600> people<00:03:11.840> say<00:03:11.930> Oh<00:03:11.959> Chevy's<00:03:12.410> are<00:03:12.500> a

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
so a lot of people say Oh Chevy's are a

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
so a lot of people say Oh Chevy's are a
lot<00:03:12.680> stronger<00:03:12.920> because<00:03:13.190> they<00:03:13.250> have<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.400> four

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
lot stronger because they have the four

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.480 
lot stronger because they have the four
bolts<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.000> Fords<00:03:14.270> don't<00:03:14.480> that's<00:03:15.140> not<00:03:15.440> true<00:03:15.709> so

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
bolts and Fords don't that's not true so

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.860 
bolts and Fords don't that's not true so
we're<00:03:16.850> looking<00:03:17.060> at<00:03:17.150> something<00:03:17.390> like<00:03:17.450> this<00:03:17.660> I

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
we're looking at something like this I

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.970 
we're looking at something like this I
mean<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.019> thing<00:03:18.290> right<00:03:18.470> here<00:03:18.500> like<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:18.890> say

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
mean this thing right here like I say

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.100 
mean this thing right here like I say
it's<00:03:19.100> 545<00:03:19.880> cubic<00:03:20.239> engine<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:20.570> got<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.720> billet

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
it's 545 cubic engine it's got a billet

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.410 
it's 545 cubic engine it's got a billet
steel<00:03:21.320> crankshaft<00:03:21.620> in<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.280> it's<00:03:22.760> got<00:03:22.970> six

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.770 
steel H beam rods j.e Pistons I mean
it's<00:03:28.250> got<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.400> whole<00:03:28.670> whole<00:03:29.060> works<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.510> solid

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
it's got the whole whole works a solid

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.990 
it's got the whole whole works a solid
roller<00:03:29.989> camshaft<00:03:30.500> it's<00:03:30.920> an<00:03:31.010> animal<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:31.910> you

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
roller camshaft it's an animal but you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.160 
roller camshaft it's an animal but you
might<00:03:32.150> be<00:03:32.239> noticing<00:03:32.390> something<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:32.930> here<00:03:33.140> that

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
might be noticing something on here that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.740 
might be noticing something on here that
a<00:03:33.560> lot<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:33.950> times<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.430> don't<00:03:34.580> notice<00:03:34.790> this<00:03:35.600> has

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
a lot of times you don't notice this has

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.259 
a lot of times you don't notice this has
a<00:03:35.810> billet<00:03:36.170> main<00:03:36.320> support<00:03:36.910> these<00:03:37.910> things<00:03:38.090> right

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
a billet main support these things right

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.790 
a billet main support these things right
here<00:03:38.390> designed<00:03:38.750> for<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.170> forward<00:03:39.440> motors

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
here designed for the forward motors

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.560 
here designed for the forward motors
they<00:03:39.980> make<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.580> for<00:03:40.670> other<00:03:40.790> motors<00:03:41.060> also<00:03:41.390> but

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
they make it for other motors also but

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.570 
they make it for other motors also but
Ford's<00:03:41.900> mainly<00:03:42.230> because<00:03:42.590> what<00:03:42.860> it<00:03:42.950> does<00:03:43.130> is<00:03:43.459> it

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
Ford's mainly because what it does is it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.120 
Ford's mainly because what it does is it
ties<00:03:43.910> all<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:45.080> main<00:03:45.260> caps<00:03:45.590> together

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
ties all the main caps together

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.509 
ties all the main caps together
so<00:03:46.880> yes<00:03:47.180> it's<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.600> bolt<00:03:47.870> block<00:03:48.130> but<00:03:49.130> yes<00:03:49.310> it's

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
so yes it's a to bolt block but yes it's

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.740 
so yes it's a to bolt block but yes it's
stronger<00:03:49.880> because<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.209> main<00:03:50.360> caps<00:03:50.570> are

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
stronger because the main caps are

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.990 
stronger because the main caps are
bigger<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.320> studs<00:03:51.590> are<00:03:51.739> larger<00:03:52.100> but<00:03:52.610> this

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
bigger and the studs are larger but this

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.400 
bigger and the studs are larger but this
girdle<00:03:53.390> right<00:03:53.660> here<00:03:53.780> some<00:03:53.900> people<00:03:53.989> call<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.260> a

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
girdle right here some people call it a

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.770 
girdle right here some people call it a
girdle<00:03:55.040> but<00:03:55.280> it's<00:03:55.400> really<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:55.580> main<00:03:55.790> support<00:03:56.180> it

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
girdle but it's really a main support it

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.440 
girdle but it's really a main support it
ties<00:03:57.140> all<00:03:57.500> these<00:03:57.709> together<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.300> really<00:03:59.300> what

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
ties all these together so really what

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.740 
ties all these together so really what
kills<00:03:59.750> an<00:03:59.959> engine<00:04:00.830> is<00:04:00.980> main<00:04:01.700> cap<00:04:02.000> walk<00:04:02.450> and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
kills an engine is main cap walk and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.720 
kills an engine is main cap walk and
block<00:04:03.170> deflection<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.100> that<00:04:04.190> just<00:04:04.400> means<00:04:04.580> the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
block deflection and that just means the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.759 
block deflection and that just means the
block<00:04:04.940> flexing<00:04:05.600> as<00:04:05.720> your<00:04:05.870> as<00:04:05.989> its<00:04:06.410> making<00:04:06.680> all

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
block flexing as your as its making all

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:07.900 
block flexing as your as its making all
the<00:04:06.860> power<00:04:07.010> you're<00:04:07.190> on<00:04:07.250> wide<00:04:07.430> open<00:04:07.700> throttle

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
the power you're on wide open throttle

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.160 
the power you're on wide open throttle
you<00:04:08.120> got<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.330> nitrous<00:04:08.660> on<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.959> got<00:04:09.140> a

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
you got the nitrous on you got a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.479 
you got the nitrous on you got a
supercharger<00:04:09.769> or<00:04:09.860> something<00:04:10.100> like<00:04:10.160> that<00:04:10.220> and

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
supercharger or something like that and

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.520 
supercharger or something like that and
it<00:04:10.549> blocks<00:04:10.820> you<00:04:11.360> get<00:04:11.510> deflection<00:04:12.019> it's<00:04:12.140> moving

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
it blocks you get deflection it's moving

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.620 
it blocks you get deflection it's moving
or<00:04:12.709> main<00:04:13.459> cap<00:04:13.730> walk<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.239> that's<00:04:14.360> when<00:04:14.540> these

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
or main cap walk and that's when these

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.390 
or main cap walk and that's when these
main<00:04:14.870> caps<00:04:15.140> on<00:04:15.350> here<00:04:15.560> start<00:04:15.890> wiggling<00:04:16.100> back

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
main caps on here start wiggling back

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.070 
main caps on here start wiggling back
and<00:04:16.459> forth<00:04:16.880> well<00:04:17.390> there<00:04:17.660> goes<00:04:17.810> your<00:04:17.840> main

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
and forth well there goes your main

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.199 
and forth well there goes your main
bearings<00:04:18.470> okay<00:04:18.919> just<00:04:19.519> because<00:04:19.640> of<00:04:19.910> wiggle

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
bearings okay just because of wiggle

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.940 
bearings okay just because of wiggle
well<00:04:20.600> what<00:04:20.750> happens<00:04:21.080> is<00:04:21.229> this<00:04:21.380> main<00:04:21.560> support

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
well what happens is this main support

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.920 
well what happens is this main support
ties<00:04:22.190> them<00:04:22.460> all<00:04:22.520> together<00:04:22.729> so<00:04:23.210> if<00:04:23.570> this<00:04:23.720> one

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
ties them all together so if this one

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.810 
ties them all together so if this one
right<00:04:24.110> here<00:04:24.320> wants<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.680> try<00:04:24.890> and<00:04:25.010> wiggle<00:04:25.160> it's

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
right here wants to try and wiggle it's

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.710 
right here wants to try and wiggle it's
got<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.060> trend<00:04:26.360> wiggle

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
got a trend wiggle

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.090 
got a trend wiggle
all<00:04:26.780> these<00:04:26.960> others<00:04:27.230> also<00:04:27.590> not<00:04:27.830> going<00:04:28.040> to

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
all these others also not going to

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.650 
all these others also not going to
happen<00:04:28.400> because<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.700> load<00:04:29.030> is<00:04:29.060> changing

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
happen because the load is changing

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.090 
happen because the load is changing
throughout<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.050> crankshaft<00:04:30.320> is<00:04:30.620> every<00:04:30.860> fire

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
throughout the crankshaft is every fire

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.300 
throughout the crankshaft is every fire
the<00:04:31.640> loads<00:04:31.850> changing
