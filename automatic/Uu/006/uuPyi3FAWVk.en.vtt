tight<00:03:35.710> but<00:03:36.070> when<00:03:36.520> you're<00:03:36.700> mixing<00:03:36.820> an<00:03:37.150> album

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
tight but when you're mixing an album

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.210 
tight but when you're mixing an album
you're<00:03:38.140> always<00:03:38.290> trying<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.680> think<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.040> note

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
you're always trying to think the note

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.920 
you're always trying to think the note
out<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.490> little<00:03:39.730> bit<00:03:39.910> more<00:03:40.090> so<00:03:40.450> it's<00:03:40.750> got<00:03:40.900> its

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
out a little bit more so it's got its

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.780 
out a little bit more so it's got its
own<00:03:41.080> little<00:03:41.140> space<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:41.950> mix<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:42.580> has

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
own little space in the mix and this has

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.840 
own little space in the mix and this has
got<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.180> but<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:43.720> wasn't<00:03:44.110> like<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.890> honky-tonk

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
got it but it wasn't like a honky-tonk

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.520 
got it but it wasn't like a honky-tonk
mid-range<00:03:46.270> that<00:03:46.510> was<00:03:46.630> there<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.960> got<00:03:47.170> more<00:03:47.410> of

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
mid-range that was there it got more of

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.150 
mid-range that was there it got more of
a<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.920> natural<00:03:48.700> openness<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:49.960> and<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.890> seemed

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
a a natural openness to it and it seemed

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.590 
a a natural openness to it and it seemed
to<00:03:51.250> have<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.430> lot<00:03:51.610> of<00:03:51.760> headroom<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.510> it

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
to have a lot of headroom to it it

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.950

didn't<00:03:52.870> feel<00:03:52.990> compressed<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:55.000> was<00:03:55.150> tight<00:03:55.450> the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
didn't feel compressed it was tight the

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.490 
didn't feel compressed it was tight the
top<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:57.300> again<00:03:58.300> with<00:03:58.660> breakfast<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.410> know

would be I'm not losing this the

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.580 
would be I'm not losing this the
contraceptive<00:04:01.540> life<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:01.900> it's<00:04:02.020> really<00:04:02.230> tight

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590

tried to keep my eye on the ball of what

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.640 
tried to keep my eye on the ball of what
where<00:04:55.510> things<00:04:55.780> are<00:04:55.960> going<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.350> think<00:04:56.530> it's

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
where things are going I think it's

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.440 
where things are going I think it's
important<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.190> do<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.520> which<00:04:58.090> is<00:04:58.240> why<00:04:58.390> you

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
important to do that which is why you

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.120 
important to do that which is why you
know<00:04:58.750> we<00:04:58.840> look<00:04:58.960> at<00:04:59.050> these<00:04:59.170> pickups<00:04:59.620> I<00:04:59.830> was<00:04:59.980> very
