 they come out good morning I'm happy

 because today you are going to cover part of the 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.449
 routine of the curriculum of the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.090
 center and for this I am going to present you 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.360

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.640

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.560
 good regards pect what is the importance 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.300
 from colombia vas do exercises then 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.520
 they looked at preschool kids at this age 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.840
 they are exploring with their body so 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.030
 it is very important to develop these 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.380
 skills as soon as we can and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.760
 besides that we know that in puerto rico 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.890
 there is a very big problem about 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.180
 childhood obesity therefore 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.040
 we have to start promoting that 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.990
 physical activity from early stages 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.400
 of childhood and because of this concern of 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.240
 the current obesity developed a 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.800
 Program 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.420
 for preschool children what is the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.220
 name of this Caribbean program feel the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.350
 for kids is dedicated to promoting 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.600
 physical activity in the children started 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.610
 from a year and a half to possibly 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.100
 seven or eight years because she 8 years old 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 9 can happen as adults is a class 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.550
 fun educational dynamic is a 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.810
 mix of dance music and theater 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.950
 encouraging exercise for the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.890
 children can develop certain 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.380
 skills like running move arms 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.700
 Musicality balance coordination can 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.370
 share with your group because it 's for 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.900
 boys and girls in the same room and 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.920
 I definitely enjoy it 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.510
 very much because they are doing 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.860
 exercises and really no account are given 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.020
 and how long must they be doing 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.790
 these children so small exercises then 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.320
 that varies depending on the children of the year and 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.450
 medium to two for example they can do 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.490
 about 15 minutes the children who are already climbing 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.080
 from 4 or 5 years to 6 can last until 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.510
 half an hour but after those children 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.010
 they are developing with their condition 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.680
 physical and cardiovascular they are going to 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.960
 achieve to last more or less routines 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.729
 of 40 minutes 30 minutes of it that is 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.220
 what we do more or less an adult the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.360
 cardiovascular which is excellent for 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.360
 to take them little by little mom 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.500
 it's going to be a progress little by little class 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.030
 after class and then they are children will be 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.759
 recognizable because we have this children 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.190
 who have autism and those children have 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.180
 a social activity 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.470
 psychologically educationally they have 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.510
 learned so much that you can even 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.770
 prepare a stage without fear of the public 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.300
 and the parents are surprised 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.760
 changes that are children can have 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.770
 because something is added to the routine 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.660
 spectacular and tell me what is this 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.370
 experience of the law exercise to children 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.840
 so small two years for me is 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.120
 enriching because they do not have 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.739
 no charge I am with that dynamism 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.390
 with that desire to learn with those 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.130
 desire for adventure and how we make a 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.380
 interesting mix between dances the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.300
 theater the music those children what you 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.590
 like is all that music are allies 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.720
 is an ally of children since 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.700
 little one so we use that to 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.650
 our favor to be able to encourage these 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.690
 skills to them that are essential 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.800
 for your life and subsist and for 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.810
 example for encouraging this activity 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.300
 physical that is so important because the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.580
 obese children who suffer from this problem do not 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.470
 they have the opportunity or they do not understand 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.180
 this disease what it entails so 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.110
 it's very important I congratulate
