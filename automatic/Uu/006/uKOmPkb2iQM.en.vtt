gray<00:01:28.170> color<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.890> from<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.400> distance<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.030> can

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
gray color like from a distance it can

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.240 
gray color like from a distance it can
look<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.659> great<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.100> up

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
look really great but when you get up

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.800 
look really great but when you get up
close<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> there's<00:01:33.600> like

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
close you can see that there's like

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.550 
close you can see that there's like
hints<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.439> purple<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.340> lilac<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
hints of purple and lilac so I think the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.039 
hints of purple and lilac so I think the
gray<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.250> overpowers<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.479> purple<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.020> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
gray really overpowers the purple but I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.469 
gray really overpowers the purple but I
think<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.829> super<00:01:41.280> unique<00:01:41.640> color<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
think that it's a super unique color and

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.450 
think that it's a super unique color and
it<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:44.450> 377<00:01:45.450> i<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:45.960> at<00:01:46.189> walmart<00:01:47.189> i
