know we have had luck in the past

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.210 
know we have had luck in the past
talking<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.139> people<00:00:16.320> about<00:00:16.650> very<00:00:16.980> basic

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
talking to people about very basic

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.730 
talking to people about very basic
nutrients<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.270> they<00:00:18.480> need<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.560> very

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
nutrients that they need one of the very

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.529 
nutrients that they need one of the very
basic<00:00:19.920> new<00:00:20.250> trees<00:00:20.430> along<00:00:20.640> with<00:00:20.760> omega-3<00:00:21.300> fatty

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
basic new trees along with omega-3 fatty

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.450 
basic new trees along with omega-3 fatty
acid<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.020> know<00:00:22.109> how<00:00:22.199> much<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.470> push<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.859> but

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
acid you know how much I push that but

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.980 
acid you know how much I push that but
ultimately<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> nutrients<00:00:24.840> that

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
ultimately one of the nutrients that

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.300 
ultimately one of the nutrients that
we're<00:00:25.109> missing<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.560> our<00:00:25.680> diet<00:00:25.890> John<00:00:26.160> is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
we're missing in our diet John is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.750 
we're missing in our diet John is
magnesium<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.349> a<00:00:28.349> topical<00:00:29.010> magnesium<00:00:29.609> now

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
magnesium and a topical magnesium now

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.519 
magnesium and a topical magnesium now
we're<00:00:29.970> finding<00:00:30.210> actually<00:00:30.630> assimilates<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
we're finding actually assimilates a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.080 
we're finding actually assimilates a
little<00:00:31.710> better<00:00:31.890> into<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> sale<00:00:32.430> point<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:32.969> we

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
little better into the sale point so we

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
little better into the sale point so we
find<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.719> topical<00:00:34.230> jail<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.800> top

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
find now that the topical jail on top

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.920 
find now that the topical jail on top
delivers<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.969> magnesium<00:00:36.540> into<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> cell

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
delivers that magnesium into the cell

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.119 
delivers that magnesium into the cell
more<00:00:37.110> effectively<00:00:37.590> than<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> magnesium

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
more effectively than the magnesium

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.889 
more effectively than the magnesium
internally<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.820> we're<00:00:39.360> gonna<00:00:39.480> hit<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
internally so we're gonna hit on that

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.690 
internally so we're gonna hit on that
and<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.710> how<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.160> helps<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and then and how that helps with the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240 
and then and how that helps with the
body<00:00:41.940> relaxation<00:00:42.629> John<00:00:43.070> magnesium<00:00:44.070> calcium

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
body relaxation John magnesium calcium

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
body relaxation John magnesium calcium
flex<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> muscle<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.899> ou<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
flex is the muscle you can ou have the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
flex is the muscle you can ou have the
magnesium<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.890> relax<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.489> you're<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.940> stay

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
magnesium to relax it you're gonna stay

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
magnesium to relax it you're gonna stay
tight<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.809> muscles<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> stay<00:00:49.620> tight

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
tight that muscles going to stay tight

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.500 
tight that muscles going to stay tight
that's<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> reason<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.000> lot<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.149> muscle

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
that's the reason for a lot of muscle

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.959 
that's the reason for a lot of muscle
stiffness<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.289> excess<00:00:52.800> calcium<00:00:53.039> not<00:00:53.699> enough

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
stiffness is excess calcium not enough

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
stiffness is excess calcium not enough
magnesium<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.899> way<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> correct<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> simple

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
magnesium the way to correct that simple

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.069 
magnesium the way to correct that simple
either<00:00:56.430> take<00:00:56.789> magnesium<00:00:57.149> internally<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
either take magnesium internally and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.229 
either take magnesium internally and
take<00:00:58.680> anywhere<00:00:59.070> from<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.370> year<00:00:59.399> sometimes<00:00:59.879> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
take anywhere from a year sometimes to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.670 
take anywhere from a year sometimes to
build<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.539> level<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.140> put<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
build that level up or put it on the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
build that level up or put it on the
skin<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.190> help<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.609> goes<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.090> work<00:01:03.149> pretty

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
skin and it help it goes to work pretty

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.729 
skin and it help it goes to work pretty
quickly<00:01:03.629> well<00:01:03.809> actually<00:01:03.930> I've<00:01:04.290> been<00:01:04.439> taking

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739

the oil since you've been talking about

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.090 
the oil since you've been talking about
it<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> help<00:01:07.140> me<00:01:07.229> relax<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> sleep

because<00:01:08.850> though<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> magnesium<00:01:09.600> has<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.930> over

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
because though a magnesium has what over

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
because though a magnesium has what over
three<00:01:10.350> hundred<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.680> eighty-five<00:01:11.180> elements

basic elements magnesium oil is one of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.080 
basic elements magnesium oil is one of
them

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
them

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.060 
them
we're<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.720> back<00:01:42.840> real<00:01:43.049> quick<00:01:43.200> 85%<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
we're going back real quick 85% of

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.289 
we're going back real quick 85% of
Americans<00:01:44.490> are<00:01:44.670> deficient<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.149> magnesium

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
Americans are deficient in magnesium

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.810 
Americans are deficient in magnesium
that's<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.020> fact<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> fact<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.040> why<00:01:47.250> we

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that's a fact that is a fact is why we

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.230 
that's a fact that is a fact is why we
don't<00:01:47.939> eat<00:01:48.149> enough<00:01:48.180> green<00:01:48.960> leafy<00:01:49.259> vegetable

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
don't eat enough green leafy vegetable

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.700 
don't eat enough green leafy vegetable

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.190 
oil is to Center at the center of that
molecule<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.369> magnesium<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.570> get<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> lot<00:01:55.049> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
molecule is magnesium so we get a lot of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.630 
molecule is magnesium so we get a lot of
our<00:01:55.320> magnesium<00:01:55.890> from<00:01:56.070> green<00:01:56.310> leafy

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
our magnesium from green leafy

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249 
our magnesium from green leafy
vegetables<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.540> eat<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:58.140> this

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
vegetables we don't eat that in this

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.230 
vegetables we don't eat that in this
country<00:01:58.469> secondly<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.520> all<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.790> Matt<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
country secondly of all that Matt the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
country secondly of all that Matt the
soils<00:02:00.659> are<00:02:00.750> deficient<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.350> magnesium<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
soils are deficient in magnesium so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.280 
soils are deficient in magnesium so
magnesium<00:02:03.210> deficiencies<00:02:03.780> they<00:02:03.930> feel<00:02:04.110> like

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
magnesium deficiencies they feel like

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.139 
magnesium deficiencies they feel like
are<00:02:04.530> number<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.399> country<00:02:05.759> right<00:02:05.939> now

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
are number one in this country right now

yeah calm him down and everything it's
like<00:02:37.590> I've<00:02:38.310> seen<00:02:38.550> him<00:02:39.060> even<00:02:39.390> says<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.630> to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
like I've seen him even says that to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.190 
like I've seen him even says that to
everybody<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.270> especially<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:43.050> people

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
everybody and especially with people

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.380 
everybody and especially with people
with<00:02:43.470> fibromyalgia<00:02:44.340> people<00:02:44.640> who<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:45.090> these

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
with fibromyalgia people who have these

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.199 
with fibromyalgia people who have these
diseases<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.950> keep<00:02:47.130> them<00:02:47.340> tense<00:02:47.820> and

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
diseases that that keep them tense and

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.240 
diseases that that keep them tense and
keep<00:02:48.450> them<00:02:48.630> locked<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.320> magnesium<00:02:49.739> most<00:02:50.160> of

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
keep them locked the magnesium most of

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.920 
keep them locked the magnesium most of
time<00:02:50.400> they're<00:02:50.550> deficient<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.030> magnesium<00:02:51.150> they

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
time they're deficient in magnesium they

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.479 
time they're deficient in magnesium they
put<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.470> their<00:02:52.620> feet<00:02:52.860> before<00:02:52.980> they<00:02:53.310> go<00:02:53.459> to

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
put this on their feet before they go to

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.580 
put this on their feet before they go to
bed<00:02:53.580> at<00:02:53.850> night<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.300> helps<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.930> relax<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
bed at night it helps you relax and

bed at night it helps you relax and
sleep<00:02:55.739> probably<00:02:56.040> better<00:02:56.430> than<00:02:56.580> any<00:02:56.820> other

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
sleep probably better than any other

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.759 
sleep probably better than any other
product<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.600> I've<00:02:57.810> seen<00:02:58.050> out<00:02:58.260> there<00:02:58.290> and
