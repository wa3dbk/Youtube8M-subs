so when you've got your Lamborghini and
very<00:04:22.280> much<00:04:22.400> similar<00:04:22.640> process<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.240> parameters

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
very much similar process the parameters

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.230 
very much similar process the parameters
you<00:04:24.410> want<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.710> we<00:04:24.830> allow<00:04:25.100> or<00:04:25.910> they'll<00:04:26.120> play

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
you want that we allow or they'll play

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.120 
you want that we allow or they'll play
you<00:04:26.300> have<00:04:26.450> it<00:04:26.600> use<00:04:26.930> that<00:04:27.170> width<00:04:27.380> on<00:04:27.590> my<00:04:27.710> exit

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
you have it use that width on my exit

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.040 
you have it use that width on my exit
right<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:28.880> same<00:04:29.120> as<00:04:29.270> I'm<00:04:29.390> in<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.540> no<00:04:29.690> tighter

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
right so same as I'm in a no tighter

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.330 
right so same as I'm in a no tighter
because<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.530> was<00:04:30.620> way<00:04:30.770> higher<00:04:31.010> before

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
because it was way higher before

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.040 
because it was way higher before
apparently<00:04:31.580> yeah<00:04:31.940> put<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.270> again<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.750> was<00:04:32.900> it

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
apparently yeah put it again it was it

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.150 
apparently yeah put it again it was it
wouldn't<00:04:33.200> let<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.500> are<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.800> from<00:04:33.980> wheels

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
wouldn't let you are you from wheels

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.220 
wouldn't let you are you from wheels
attacks<00:04:34.490> like<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:35.000> think<00:04:35.150> this<00:04:35.570> all<00:04:35.720> open<00:04:36.080> out

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
attacks like I think this all open out

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.270 
attacks like I think this all open out
as<00:04:36.350> much<00:04:36.500> as<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:36.650> can<00:04:36.890> power<00:04:37.460> up<00:04:39.100> there<00:04:40.100> when

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
as much as you can power up there when

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.860 
as much as you can power up there when
you<00:04:40.340> has<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.580> come<00:04:40.760> out<00:04:40.910> of<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.150> if<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.720> come

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
you has to come out of the if you come

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.110 
you has to come out of the if you come
out<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.080> chicane<00:04:42.430> why<00:04:43.430> not<00:04:43.610> if<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:43.790> have<00:04:43.970> your

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
out the chicane why not if you have your

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.340 
out the chicane why not if you have your
wheel<00:04:44.240> straight<00:04:44.630> when<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:44.960> hit<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.170> power

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
wheel straight when you hit the power

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.750 
wheel straight when you hit the power
