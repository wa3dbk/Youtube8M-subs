00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
to be way cheaper than buying this is my

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.910 
to be way cheaper than buying this is my
logic<00:00:40.829> anyway<00:00:41.250> son<00:00:42.239> butter<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:42.960> awfully

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
logic anyway son butter which is awfully

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.200 
logic anyway son butter which is awfully
hard<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> find<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:45.030> pretty

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
hard to find and actually pretty

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.209 
hard to find and actually pretty
expensive<00:00:45.390> when<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.920> alongside<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:48.090> my

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
expensive when you do so alongside of my

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.619 
expensive when you do so alongside of my
sunflower<00:00:50.219> seeds<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.670> also<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> little<00:00:51.539> bit

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
of honey cuz I thinking it may need some

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.040 
of honey cuz I thinking it may need some
sweetness<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.239> I'm<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> add<00:00:54.870> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
until I decide it does and then a little

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.979 
until I decide it does and then a little
bit<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.980> salt<00:00:59.250> again<00:00:59.609> because<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> did<00:01:00.809> buy

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
bit of salt again because I did buy

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.450 
bit of salt again because I did buy
that's<00:01:01.530> kosher<00:01:02.039> salt

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that's kosher salt

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.149 
that's kosher salt
I<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.940> glaring<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.809> um<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.530> did

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
I know it's glaring at you but um I did

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.219 
I know it's glaring at you but um I did
buy<00:01:05.280> unsalted<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.210> could<00:01:06.420> buy<00:01:06.570> salted

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
buy unsalted you could buy salted

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.510 
buy unsalted you could buy salted
sunflower<00:01:07.560> seeds<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> can't

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
sunflower seeds but then you can't

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
sunflower seeds but then you can't
control<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> amount<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.180> salt<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.530> now

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
control the amount of salt so right now

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.880 
control the amount of salt so right now

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
I'm going to scrape down the sides with

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.219 
I'm going to scrape down the sides with
my<00:01:47.850> trusty<00:01:48.500> spatula<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
my trusty spatula and then I'm going to

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.600 
my trusty spatula and then I'm going to
let<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> run<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> good<00:01:53.610> minute<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.380> see<00:01:55.380> how

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
let it run for a good minute and see how

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.249 
let it run for a good minute and see how
it<00:01:56.610> looks<00:01:56.939> after<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.420> okay<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.810> don't<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it looks after that okay I don't think I

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.469 
it looks after that okay I don't think I
quite<00:01:58.320> lasted<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> minute<00:01:59.130> maybe<00:01:59.640> 45<00:02:00.090> seconds

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
quite lasted a minute maybe 45 seconds

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.679 
quite lasted a minute maybe 45 seconds
and<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:02.100> starting<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.850> work

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
and you can see it's starting to work

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.149 
and you can see it's starting to work
its<00:02:03.840> way<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> sides<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.799> I'm<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.040> have

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
its way to the sides and I'm gonna have

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.730 
its way to the sides and I'm gonna have
to<00:02:05.219> scrape<00:02:05.490> down<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.450> I'm<00:02:06.960> gonna<00:02:07.170> probably<00:02:07.409> do

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
to scrape down so I'm gonna probably do

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.800 
to scrape down so I'm gonna probably do
this<00:02:07.920> technique<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.610> few<00:02:08.819> more<00:02:08.940> times<00:02:09.239> where<00:02:09.539> as

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
this technique a few more times where as

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.700 
this technique a few more times where as
as<00:02:10.349> soon<00:02:10.530> as<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.739> realize<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.220> nothing<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.640> being

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
as soon as I realize if nothing is being

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.410 
as soon as I realize if nothing is being
process<00:02:13.070> I'll<00:02:13.340> stop<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.910> scrape<00:02:14.240> down<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
process I'll stop it scrape down the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.060 
process I'll stop it scrape down the
sides<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.780> spatula<00:02:14.990> turn<00:02:15.410> back<00:02:15.620> on<00:02:15.770> until

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
sides of a spatula turn back on until

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.400 
sides of a spatula turn back on until
that<00:02:16.100> happens<00:02:16.490> again<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.910> only<00:02:17.570> had<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.080> my

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
that happens again I only had to do my

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.070 
that happens again I only had to do my
scrape<00:02:18.740> down<00:02:18.890> technique<00:02:19.310> twice<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:20.840> I'm

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
scrape down technique twice and then I'm

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.660 
scrape down technique twice and then I'm
starting<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.470> get<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.830> ball<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.790> mass<00:02:23.180> of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
starting to get this ball this mass of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.180 
starting to get this ball this mass of
dry<00:02:25.670> uh<00:02:28.150> Sun<00:02:29.150> butter<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.470> was<00:02:30.860> trying<00:02:31.070> to

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
dry uh Sun butter so I was trying to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.760 
dry uh Sun butter so I was trying to
avoid<00:02:31.400> adding<00:02:31.970> oil<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.930> wanted<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.440> see<00:02:33.590> if<00:02:33.710> I

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
avoid adding oil I wanted to see if I

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.260 
avoid adding oil I wanted to see if I
can<00:02:33.920> get<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.220> natural<00:02:34.550> oils<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.880> do<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:35.240> I

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
can get the natural oils to do it but I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.820 
can get the natural oils to do it but I
might<00:02:35.510> add<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> little<00:02:36.140> we'll<00:02:36.290> see<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:36.680> going

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
might add a little we'll see I'm going

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.430 
might add a little we'll see I'm going
to<00:02:36.890> scrape<00:02:37.490> down<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.940> one<00:02:38.120> more<00:02:38.270> time<00:02:39.080> and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
to scrape down this one more time and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.710 
to scrape down this one more time and
add<00:02:39.830> about<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.070> tablespoon<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.910> honey<00:02:40.970> which

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
add about a tablespoon of honey which

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.970 
add about a tablespoon of honey which
will<00:02:41.840> give<00:02:41.960> it<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.080> little<00:02:42.290> bit<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.560> liquid

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
will give it a little bit of a liquid

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.090 
will give it a little bit of a liquid
and<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.280> pinch<00:02:44.120> or<00:02:44.240> two<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.420> salt<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.830> I'm<00:02:45.950> going

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
and a pinch or two of salt so I'm going

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.880 
and a pinch or two of salt so I'm going
to<00:02:46.190> run<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:47.210> around<00:02:47.390> I'm<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.200> scrape

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
to run this around I'm going to scrape

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.110 
to run this around I'm going to scrape
in<00:02:49.070> there<00:02:49.190> get<00:02:49.370> everything<00:02:49.550> off<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> sides

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
in there get everything off the sides

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.460 
in there get everything off the sides
and<00:02:50.300> make<00:02:50.390> sure<00:02:50.570> it's<00:02:50.720> not<00:02:50.870> sticking<00:02:51.080> on<00:02:51.380> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
and make sure it's not sticking on the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.080 
and make sure it's not sticking on the
spot<00:02:51.740> I'm<00:02:51.890> here<00:02:52.040> see<00:02:52.250> how<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:52.760> know<00:02:52.790> you

want to get all that up the spatula and
I'm<00:02:55.220> going<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.430> run<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:55.730> again<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.000> let<00:02:56.240> the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
I'm going to run it again and let the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.660 
I'm going to run it again and let the
ball<00:02:56.510> form<00:02:56.990> again<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.890> then<00:02:58.040> we'll<00:02:58.190> assess<00:02:58.520> if

ball form again and then we'll assess if

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.650 
ball form again and then we'll assess if
we<00:02:58.790> need<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.000> little<00:02:59.150> bit<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.450> oil<00:02:59.630> in<00:02:59.780> there<00:03:01.660> we

oil<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.870> just<00:03:39.140> think<00:03:39.290> olive<00:03:39.860> oil<00:03:40.070> would<00:03:40.730> be

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
oil and I just think olive oil would be

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.910 
oil and I just think olive oil would be
too<00:03:41.030> strong<00:03:41.330> and<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.960> thinking<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.470> sweetness

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
too strong and I thinking the sweetness

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.530 
too strong and I thinking the sweetness
of<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.220> coconut<00:03:43.430> oil<00:03:43.820> might<00:03:44.090> actually<00:03:44.270> add

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
of the coconut oil might actually add

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.720 
of the coconut oil might actually add
kind<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.870> fun<00:03:45.080> flavor<00:03:45.800> so<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.220> know<00:03:46.310> not

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
kind of a fun flavor so I know not

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.060 
kind of a fun flavor so I know not
everybody's<00:03:47.090> coconut<00:03:47.450> oil<00:03:47.630> pan<00:03:47.810> we<00:03:48.770> could<00:03:48.920> use

want to do but I I just I'm not a big
fan<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:53.960> this<00:03:54.170> consistency<00:03:54.830> so<00:03:55.070> I<00:03:55.250> added<00:03:55.490> my

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
fan of this consistency so I added my

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.000 
fan of this consistency so I added my
tablespoon<00:03:56.210> of<00:03:56.330> oil<00:03:56.480> I'm<00:03:57.080> going<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.530> mash<00:03:57.800> this

tablespoon of oil I'm going to mash this

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.610 
tablespoon of oil I'm going to mash this
up<00:03:58.070> with<00:03:58.640> my<00:03:58.670> spatula<00:03:59.060> spread<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.080> around<00:04:00.170> and

up with my spatula spread it around and

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.620 
up with my spatula spread it around and
do<00:04:00.950> hopefully<00:04:01.280> one<00:04:01.940> last<00:04:02.830> processing<00:04:03.830> round

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
do hopefully one last processing round

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.880 
do hopefully one last processing round
it<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:06.820> creamy<00:04:07.820> Sun<00:04:08.390> butter<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:09.380> went<00:04:09.590> with

that little bit of oil it definitely
went<00:04:11.570> down<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:11.840> went<00:04:12.200> around<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.500> processor

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
went down and went around the processor

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.310 
went down and went around the processor
a<00:04:13.010> little<00:04:13.250> bit<00:04:13.340> smoother<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:13.880> easier<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.510> might

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
a little bit smoother and easier I might

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.510 
a little bit smoother and easier I might
run<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.560> through<00:04:15.680> more<00:04:15.860> time<00:04:16.070> it's<00:04:16.280> still<00:04:16.460> a

run it through more time it's still a

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.640 
run it through more time it's still a
little<00:04:16.850> little<00:04:17.299> kind<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.049> gritty<00:04:18.290> I'm<00:04:18.500> gonna

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
little little kind of gritty I'm gonna

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.950 
little little kind of gritty I'm gonna
run<00:04:18.799> it<00:04:18.920> maybe<00:04:19.100> another<00:04:19.310> minute<00:04:19.720> just<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.810> see

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
run it maybe another minute just to see

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.810 
run it maybe another minute just to see
how<00:04:21.020> smooth<00:04:21.260> I<00:04:21.350> can<00:04:21.470> get<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.710> I<00:04:21.859> let<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.550> run
