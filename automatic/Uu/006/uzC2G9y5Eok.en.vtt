00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
me from the moment I first early I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.820 
me from the moment I first early I
thought<00:01:20.150> I<00:01:20.390> can't<00:01:21.350> imagine<00:01:21.409> somebody

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
actually writing that music it's as if

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.430 
actually writing that music it's as if
it<00:01:23.960> always<00:01:24.470> existed<00:01:25.190> it<00:01:25.340> sort<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.640> starts<00:01:26.440> it

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
it always existed it sort of starts it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.960 
it always existed it sort of starts it
almost<00:01:27.710> starts<00:01:28.100> as<00:01:28.220> if<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.670> middle

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
almost starts as if it's in the middle

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.410 
almost starts as if it's in the middle
of<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.090> work<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.979> ends<00:01:31.490> as<00:01:31.760> if<00:01:32.120> it's<00:01:32.270> in

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
of the work and it ends as if it's in

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.940 
of the work and it ends as if it's in
the<00:01:32.510> middle<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.870> work<00:01:33.110> it's<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:33.620> a<00:01:33.650> it's

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950

see the end of the world either all you
see<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:52.760> this<00:01:52.940> kind<00:01:53.150> of<00:01:53.210> monolithic<00:01:54.400> you<00:01:55.400> know

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
see is this kind of monolithic you know

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.770 
see is this kind of monolithic you know
statement<00:01:56.090> in

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
statement in

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.010 
statement in
the<00:01:56.869> middle<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:58.250> yeah<00:01:58.940> definitely<00:01:59.119> I<00:01:59.630> hear<00:01:59.900> it

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
the middle so yeah definitely I hear it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.520 
the middle so yeah definitely I hear it
in<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.350> those<00:02:00.799> crunchy<00:02:01.520> brass<00:02:02.119> sections<00:02:02.750> that

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
in in those crunchy brass sections that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.399 
in in those crunchy brass sections that
are<00:02:03.590> like<00:02:04.490> at<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.880> same<00:02:05.060> time<00:02:05.380> full<00:02:06.380> of

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
are like at the same time full of

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.070 
are like at the same time full of
tension<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:08.380> angst<00:02:09.380> or<00:02:09.590> something<00:02:10.810> but<00:02:11.810> then

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
tension and angst or something but then

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.990 
tension and angst or something but then
also<00:02:13.239> there's<00:02:14.239> these<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:14.900> heroic

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
also there's these really heroic

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.710 
also there's these really heroic
fanfares<00:02:17.319> layer<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.470> in<00:02:18.590> there<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.510> think

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
fanfares layer it in there and I think

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.740 
fanfares layer it in there and I think
that<00:02:20.930> coupled<00:02:21.440> with<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:22.610> really<00:02:25.600> kind<00:02:26.600> of

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
that coupled with this really kind of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.580 
that coupled with this really kind of
beautiful<00:02:27.230> silence<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.489> he<00:02:28.820> marks<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:29.959> each

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
beautiful silence that he marks in each

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.449 
beautiful silence that he marks in each
of<00:02:30.739> his<00:02:30.769> pieces<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:32.860> mean<00:02:33.860> that's<00:02:33.950> really<00:02:34.310> where

of his pieces I mean that's really where

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.759 
of his pieces I mean that's really where
I<00:02:34.489> get<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.420> sense<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.810> Sisu<00:02:36.200> in<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
I get that that sense of Sisu in the

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.240 
I get that that sense of Sisu in the
music<00:02:37.180> it's<00:02:38.180> hard<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.230> talk<00:02:39.410> about<00:02:39.470> from<00:02:39.980> under

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
music it's hard to talk about from under

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.400 
music it's hard to talk about from under
friends<00:02:40.580> without<00:02:40.760> civility<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.900> again<00:02:42.260> it's

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
friends without civility and again it's

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.620 
friends without civility and again it's
really<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:43.030> what<00:02:44.030> got<00:02:44.209> them<00:02:44.360> through<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
really that what got them through the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.949 
really that what got them through the
winter<00:02:44.780> warz<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.500> second<00:02:45.910> again<00:02:46.959> that

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
winter warz in the second again that

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.320 
winter warz in the second again that
kind<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.230> deep<00:02:48.440> deep<00:02:49.010> rooted<00:02:49.459> in<00:02:49.760> the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
kind of deep deep rooted in the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.630 
kind of deep deep rooted in the
character<00:02:51.050> for<00:02:51.350> most<00:02:51.590> fins<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.100> I've<00:02:52.340> met

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
character for most fins that I've met

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.320 
character for most fins that I've met
they<00:02:53.360> respect<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:54.400> mean<00:02:55.400> part<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.180> is

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
they respect I mean part of it is

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.630 
they respect I mean part of it is
knowing<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.840> Sebelius<00:02:57.709> was<00:02:58.250> so

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
knowing that Sebelius was so

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.060 
knowing that Sebelius was so
instrumental<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.330> creating<00:02:59.650> finish<00:03:00.650> ness<00:03:00.890> and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
instrumental in creating finish ness and

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.900 
instrumental in creating finish ness and
creating<00:03:01.549> this<00:03:02.500> cultural<00:03:03.500> identity<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:06.910> and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
creating this cultural identity and and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.930 
creating this cultural identity and and
so<00:03:08.209> hearing<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.930> there<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.620> certain<00:03:10.190> power<00:03:10.430> and

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
so hearing it there is certain power and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.300 
so hearing it there is certain power and
I<00:03:11.510> think<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.930> power<00:03:12.170> could<00:03:12.530> be<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.890> Cecil

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
I think that power could be the Cecil

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.440 
I think that power could be the Cecil
but<00:03:14.060> it's<00:03:14.269> it's<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:16.310> unexplainable<00:03:16.880> part

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
but it's it's the unexplainable part

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.490 
but it's it's the unexplainable part
that<00:03:17.690> drug<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:19.450> moves<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.989> touches

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
that drug that moves you that touches

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:36.040 
that drug that moves you that touches
you<00:03:21.680> in<00:03:21.920> his<00:03:22.250> music

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.110
