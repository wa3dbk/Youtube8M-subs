stabilizer a lot of you guys may be
thinking<00:00:48.479> well<00:00:48.659> there's<00:00:48.809> other<00:00:48.989> dsm2

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:49.499 
thinking well there's other dsm2

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:51.680 
thinking well there's other dsm2
receivers<00:00:50.069> out<00:00:50.219> there<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.819> built-in

stabilizers<00:00:52.289> what<00:00:52.559> makes<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.979> any<00:00:53.159> better

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
stabilizers what makes this any better

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.399 
stabilizers what makes this any better
well<00:00:53.909> aside<00:00:54.239> from<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.569> lightweight<00:00:55.109> and<00:00:55.319> the

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
well aside from the lightweight and the

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.309 
well aside from the lightweight and the
ultra<00:00:55.710> compact<00:00:56.039> design<00:00:56.249> this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.479> I<00:00:57.870> believe

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
ultra compact design this is I believe

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:03.410 
ultra compact design this is I believe
