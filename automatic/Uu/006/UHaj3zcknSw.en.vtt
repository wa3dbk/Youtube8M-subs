say<00:02:07.970> now<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.510> is<00:02:09.840> only<00:02:10.020> four<00:02:10.770> times<00:02:11.070> as<00:02:11.490> fast

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
say now this is only four times as fast

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.600 
say now this is only four times as fast
as<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.270> did<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.540> real<00:02:12.959> life<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:14.070> took<00:02:14.400> about

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
as it did in real life it took about

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.600 
as it did in real life it took about
five<00:02:15.150> minutes<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> whole<00:02:16.800> setup<00:02:17.220> to

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
five minutes for the whole setup to

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.870 
five minutes for the whole setup to
complete<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:19.530> pretty<00:02:19.800> good<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:22.550> we<00:02:24.650> had

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
complete so it's pretty good and we had

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.390 
complete so it's pretty good and we had
we've<00:02:26.880> never<00:02:27.740> experienced<00:02:28.740> an<00:02:28.860> issue<00:02:29.040> where

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
we've never experienced an issue where

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.570 
we've never experienced an issue where
it<00:02:29.520> would<00:02:29.670> stop<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.320> total<00:02:31.980> installs<00:02:32.340> on

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
it would stop so total installs on

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.520 
it would stop so total installs on
normal<00:02:32.880> machines<00:02:33.239> think<00:02:33.600> about<00:02:33.900> half<00:02:34.200> an<00:02:34.380> hour

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
normal machines think about half an hour

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.030 
normal machines think about half an hour
maybe<00:02:34.940> at<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.239> most

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
maybe at the most

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.810 
maybe at the most
we're<00:02:38.040> directly<00:02:39.030> upgrading<00:02:39.600> takes<00:02:39.989> about<00:02:40.820> 25

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
we're directly upgrading takes about 25

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.340 
we're directly upgrading takes about 25
minutes<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.050> differently<00:02:43.620> quicker

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
minutes so it's differently quicker
