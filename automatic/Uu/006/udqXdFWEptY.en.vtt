00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.069 

what<00:02:14.159> request<00:02:14.400> number<00:02:14.609> today<00:02:14.819> at<00:02:14.969> what<00:02:15.090> boost

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.670 

14<00:02:19.079> to<00:02:19.139> 20<00:02:19.349> psi

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
14 to 20 psi

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.289 
14 to 20 psi
yeah<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:22.340> you've<00:02:23.340> netted<00:02:23.760> two<00:02:23.939> pounds<00:02:24.209> of

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
yeah so you've netted two pounds of

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.640 
yeah so you've netted two pounds of
boost<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.659> same<00:02:24.810> port<00:02:25.019> like<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.260> dropped<00:02:25.469> two

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
boost the same port like you dropped two

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.140 
boost the same port like you dropped two
pounds<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:25.980> boost<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.400> same<00:02:26.549> horsepower

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
pounds of boost in the same horsepower

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.369 
pounds of boost in the same horsepower
well<00:02:27.299> actually<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.569> draw<00:02:27.719> for<00:02:27.930> console<00:02:28.230> boost

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
well actually I draw for console boost

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.539 
well actually I draw for console boost
because<00:02:28.680> I've<00:02:28.980> got<00:02:29.099> 24<00:02:29.489> for<00:02:29.760> all<00:02:29.969> right<00:02:31.280> 20<00:02:32.280> psi

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
because I've got 24 for all right 20 psi

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.760 
because I've got 24 for all right 20 psi
was<00:02:32.909> the<00:02:33.030> larger

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
was the larger

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.020 
was the larger
Sam<00:02:35.430> Gunners<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.720> little<00:02:36.990> higher<00:02:37.140> torque

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
Sam Gunners with a little higher torque

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.490 
Sam Gunners with a little higher torque
thinking<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.830> torque<00:02:40.100> before<00:02:40.400> was<00:02:40.690> 381<00:02:41.690> this

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
thinking the torque before was 381 this

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.300 
thinking the torque before was 381 this
time<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.710> hit<00:02:42.920> what<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.070> like

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
time I hit what I like

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.220 
time I hit what I like
oh<00:02:44.370> really<00:02:45.209> yeah<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.810> was<00:02:45.870> Carly

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
oh really yeah I think it was Carly

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.300 
oh really yeah I think it was Carly
hired<00:02:46.410> tour

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
hired tour

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.449 
hired tour
yeah<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.840> like<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.440> thing<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.740> looked<00:02:50.250> at<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
yeah it's like the thing I looked at the

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.130 
yeah it's like the thing I looked at the
most<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:50.940> was<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.780> torque<00:02:51.990> curve

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
most on it was it the torque curve

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.840 
most on it was it the torque curve
before<00:02:52.319> like<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:53.069> looked<00:02:53.280> as<00:02:53.400> if<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.550> was<00:02:53.760> like

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
before like it looked as if it was like

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.240 
before like it looked as if it was like
just<00:02:54.030> intercooler<00:02:54.540> he<00:02:54.720> saw<00:02:54.900> because<00:02:55.250> when

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
just intercooler he saw because when

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.370 
just intercooler he saw because when
torque<00:02:56.700> spiked<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.090> before<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.780> much<00:02:58.110> more

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
torque spiked up before and much more

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.830 
torque spiked up before and much more
like<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.640> look<00:02:59.640> like<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.330> was<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:00.690> really

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
like a look like it was just like really

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.410 
like a look like it was just like really
spiky<00:03:01.260> yeah<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:02.100> spiked<00:03:02.400> up<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.700> lot<00:03:02.850> they<00:03:03.240> drop

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
spiky yeah it spiked up a lot they drop

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.540 
spiky yeah it spiked up a lot they drop
back<00:03:03.540> down<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.709> was<00:03:04.830> smooth<00:03:05.100> after<00:03:05.400> that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
back down and it was smooth after that

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.830 
back down and it was smooth after that
this<00:03:05.700> time<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.060> was<00:03:06.180> smooth<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.600> whole<00:03:06.720> area

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
this time it was smooth the whole area

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.570 
this time it was smooth the whole area
actually

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:44.700 

Thapa<00:03:12.580> test<00:03:12.850> on<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.030> street

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.770
