00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
videos I even simple mistake small

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.719 
videos I even simple mistake small
mistakes<00:05:05.150> like<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.530> quality<00:05:07.070> i<00:05:07.099> recorded

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
mistakes like the the quality i recorded

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.900 
mistakes like the the quality i recorded
my<00:05:07.759> voice<00:05:07.880> in<00:05:08.419> um<00:05:09.039> I've<00:05:10.039> got<00:05:10.250> a<00:05:10.280> pretty<00:05:10.669> decent

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
my voice in um I've got a pretty decent

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.529 
my voice in um I've got a pretty decent
quality<00:05:11.270> mic<00:05:11.660> but<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:12.759> was<00:05:13.759> using<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:14.210> program

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
quality mic but I was using this program

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.490 
quality mic but I was using this program
and<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.470> I<00:05:15.830> guess<00:05:16.130> I<00:05:16.310> switched<00:05:16.669> on<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.930> quality

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
and I I guess I switched on the quality

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.969 
and I I guess I switched on the quality
to<00:05:19.430> record<00:05:19.940> at<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.870> really<00:05:21.139> low<00:05:21.229> quality<00:05:21.590> so<00:05:21.949> i

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
to record at a really low quality so i

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.570 
to record at a really low quality so i
was<00:05:22.190> able<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.490> record<00:05:22.789> a<00:05:22.909> lot<00:05:23.060> more<00:05:24.580> voice

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
was able to record a lot more voice

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.480 
was able to record a lot more voice
because<00:05:27.070> keeping<00:05:28.070> it<00:05:28.190> at<00:05:28.310> a<00:05:28.340> low<00:05:29.260> bitrate

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
because keeping it at a low bitrate

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.760 
because keeping it at a low bitrate
keeping<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.550> file<00:05:31.729> smaller<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.360> such<00:05:32.770> but

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
keeping the file smaller and such but

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.469 
keeping the file smaller and such but
when<00:05:33.949> i<00:05:33.979> uploaded<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.610> video<00:05:34.849> i<00:05:35.150> didn't

when i uploaded the video i didn't

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.469 
when i uploaded the video i didn't
realize<00:05:35.810> that<00:05:36.010> this<00:05:37.010> quality<00:05:37.550> was<00:05:37.760> so<00:05:38.060> low<00:05:38.300> it

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
realize that this quality was so low it

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.649 
realize that this quality was so low it
made<00:05:38.720> my<00:05:38.900> voice<00:05:39.139> sound<00:05:39.590> muffled<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:43.820> at
