00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
but me personally I don't see him as a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.690 
but me personally I don't see him as a
number<00:01:28.470> two<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.070> bring<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.430> Sammy

Watkins<00:01:30.030> he<00:01:30.780> could<00:01:30.960> potentially<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.590> number

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
Watkins he could potentially be number

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
then Golden Tate I understand that he's

now<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> potential<00:02:23.849> scenario<00:02:24.299> here

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
now this is a potential scenario here

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.300 
now this is a potential scenario here
they<00:02:25.230> would<00:02:25.379> obviously<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.920> give<00:02:26.069> up<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
they would obviously have to give up the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.490 
they would obviously have to give up the
10th<00:02:26.519> overall<00:02:26.670> pick<00:02:27.000> i<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:28.319> they<00:02:28.409> would

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
10th overall pick i think they would

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.050 
10th overall pick i think they would
also<00:02:28.620> give<00:02:28.890> up<00:02:29.040> their<00:02:29.220> second-round<00:02:29.700> pick<00:02:30.030> in

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
also give up their second-round pick in

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.119 
also give up their second-round pick in
this<00:02:30.299> year's<00:02:30.360> draft<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.200> then<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.920> next

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
this year's draft and then the next

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.800 
this year's draft and then the next
year's<00:02:32.400> draft<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:32.879> potentially<00:02:33.299> also<00:02:33.540> give

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
year's draft they potentially also give

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.630 
year's draft they potentially also give
up<00:02:33.959> their<00:02:34.140> first<00:02:34.349> as<00:02:34.590> well<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.980> first<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.549> a

Sammy<00:02:38.280> Watkins<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:40.470> an<00:02:40.680> interesting

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
Sammy Watkins it's an interesting

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.009 
Sammy Watkins it's an interesting

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
what better guy to find them the best

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.619 
what better guy to find them the best
receiver<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.409> this<00:03:04.560> draft<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.069> Sammy<00:03:05.280> Watkins

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
receiver in this draft and Sammy Watkins

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.930 
receiver in this draft and Sammy Watkins
but<00:03:06.629> I<00:03:06.840> think<00:03:07.290> Sammy<00:03:07.530> Watkins<00:03:07.890> could<00:03:08.760> also

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
but I think Sammy Watkins could also

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.170 
but I think Sammy Watkins could also
potentially<00:03:09.180> be<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.370> number<00:03:11.370> one<00:03:11.489> receiver<00:03:11.879> on

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
potentially be a number one receiver on

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.690 
potentially be a number one receiver on
most<00:03:12.480> NFL<00:03:12.810> teams<00:03:13.290> if<00:03:13.859> you<00:03:14.040> pair<00:03:14.280> him<00:03:14.459> up<00:03:14.519> with

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
most NFL teams if you pair him up with

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.629 
most NFL teams if you pair him up with
calvin<00:03:15.090> johnson<00:03:15.750> i<00:03:16.099> think<00:03:17.099> that<00:03:17.310> might<00:03:17.609> be

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
calvin johnson i think that might be

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.280 
calvin johnson i think that might be
potentially<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.750> best<00:03:18.989> wide<00:03:19.260> receiver

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
potentially the best wide receiver

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.080 
potentially the best wide receiver
