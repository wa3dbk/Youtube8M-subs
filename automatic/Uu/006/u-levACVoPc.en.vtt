00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
I thought that a brown gel eyeliner

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.390 
I thought that a brown gel eyeliner
would<00:01:57.220> make<00:01:57.430> my<00:01:57.610> eyeline<00:01:58.150> look<00:01:58.420> more<00:01:58.750> natural

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
would make my eyeline look more natural

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400 
would make my eyeline look more natural
just<00:02:00.400> try<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.640> gently<00:02:01.000> draw<00:02:01.120> thin<00:02:01.750> eyeline

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
just try to gently draw thin eyeline

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.880 
just try to gently draw thin eyeline
following<00:02:03.010> my<00:02:03.190> eye<00:02:03.220> shape<00:02:04.740> curling<00:02:05.740> my<00:02:05.860> lashes

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
following my eye shape curling my lashes

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.070 
following my eye shape curling my lashes
and<00:02:06.580> applying<00:02:07.540> mascara

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
and applying mascara

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.460 
and applying mascara
