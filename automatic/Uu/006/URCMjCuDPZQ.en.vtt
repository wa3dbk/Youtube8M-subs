years<00:01:50.940> now<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.720> think<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.320> might<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.619> been

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
years now but I think it might have been

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.120 
years now but I think it might have been
this<00:01:52.920> year<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.580> they<00:01:53.700> added<00:01:54.470> shocks<00:01:55.470> to

this year that they added shocks to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.440 
this year that they added shocks to
leave<00:01:56.280> which<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:56.940> nice<00:01:57.119> future

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
leave which is a really nice future

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.490 
leave which is a really nice future
because<00:01:57.630> these<00:01:57.780> things<00:01:57.990> themselves<00:01:58.229> are

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
because these things themselves are

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.460 
because these things themselves are
pretty<00:01:58.740> damn<00:01:58.860> heavy<00:01:59.100> need<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> move<00:02:00.149> around

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.570 
actually they still feel even a little
bit<00:02:02.670> lighter<00:02:02.880> than<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> predecessors<00:02:03.840> but

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
bit lighter than the predecessors but

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.160 
bit lighter than the predecessors but
it's<00:02:05.580> cool<00:02:05.759> feature<00:02:05.970> we<00:02:06.690> got<00:02:06.840> cloth
