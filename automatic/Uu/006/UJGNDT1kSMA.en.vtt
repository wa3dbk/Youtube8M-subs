00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.570 
priest I think it changes for like the
different<00:01:04.809> classes<00:01:05.649> so<00:01:05.680> if<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.040> choose<00:01:06.250> about

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
different classes so if you choose about

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.340 
different classes so if you choose about
the<00:01:07.360> fighter

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.500 

first<00:02:23.980> off<00:02:24.219> is<00:02:24.400> I'm<00:02:24.549> gonna<00:02:24.700> say<00:02:24.909> that<00:02:25.150> this

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
first off is I'm gonna say that this

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.099 
first off is I'm gonna say that this
game<00:02:25.810> isn't<00:02:26.079> as<00:02:26.439> good<00:02:26.650> as<00:02:30.120> absolute<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.719> that

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
game isn't as good as absolute that that

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.099 
game isn't as good as absolute that that
much<00:02:32.319> is<00:02:32.469> obvious<00:02:33.329> it's<00:02:34.329> still<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.659> brilliant

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
much is obvious it's still a brilliant

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.800 
much is obvious it's still a brilliant
game<00:02:35.290> it's<00:02:35.650> still<00:02:35.769> really<00:02:36.189> fun

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
game it's still really fun

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.970 
game it's still really fun
the<00:02:38.260> graphics<00:02:39.030> obviously<00:02:40.030> ain't<00:02:40.150> as<00:02:40.359> good<00:02:40.569> as

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the graphics obviously ain't as good as

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.429 
the graphics obviously ain't as good as
I've<00:02:41.980> seen<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:42.609> can<00:02:42.760> see<00:02:43.000> what<00:02:43.299> fits<00:02:43.540> still

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
I've seen as you can see what fits still

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.990 
I've seen as you can see what fits still
still<00:02:45.340> looks<00:02:45.489> really<00:02:45.579> nice<00:02:47.730> still<00:02:48.730> readable

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
still looks really nice still readable

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.599 
still looks really nice still readable
game<00:02:49.329> just<00:02:49.689> isn't<00:02:50.590> quite<00:02:50.739> as<00:02:50.980> good<00:02:51.010> as<00:02:51.340> you

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
game just isn't quite as good as you

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
can't read it worth taking update it's

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.640 
can't read it worth taking update it's
really<00:02:58.629> weird<00:02:58.840> though<00:02:59.019> this<00:02:59.200> as<00:02:59.379> well<00:02:59.530> because

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
really weird though this as well because

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.390 
really weird though this as well because
instead<00:03:00.159> of<00:03:00.389> the<00:03:01.389> first<00:03:01.689> person<00:03:02.199> like<00:03:02.409> Shiva

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
instead of the first person like Shiva

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.830 
instead of the first person like Shiva
it's<00:03:03.900> kind<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.019> like<00:03:05.230> first<00:03:05.530> person<00:03:05.709> Mele

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
it's kind of like first person Mele

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.809 
it's kind of like first person Mele
as<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.989> can<00:03:08.109> tell<00:03:08.169> which<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:09.400> only<00:03:09.639> other

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
as you can tell which the only other

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:20.360 
as you can tell which the only other
game<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.269> played<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:10.870> 15<00:03:11.680> business<00:03:12.219> days<00:03:19.019> is

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
game I played and 15 business days is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:29.060 
game I played and 15 business days is
condemned<00:03:21.370> which<00:03:21.939> was<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.209> pretty<00:03:22.689> good<00:03:22.840> game

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.850 

the<00:03:30.070> framerate<00:03:30.540> isn't<00:03:31.540> quite<00:03:31.930> as<00:03:32.290> good<00:03:32.320> as

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
the framerate isn't quite as good as

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.370 
the framerate isn't quite as good as
exceed<00:03:33.520> I<00:03:33.700> think<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.030> probably<00:03:34.960> feeding

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
exceed I think it's probably feeding

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:46.830 
exceed I think it's probably feeding
away<00:03:35.740> with<00:03:35.980> its<00:03:36.250> framerate<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.450> stuff<00:03:45.840> there

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
away with its framerate and stuff there

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
away with its framerate and stuff there
is<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:47.020> really<00:03:47.380> good<00:03:47.560> intro<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.900> CG<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:49.930> think<00:03:50.530> at

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
is a really good intro and CG I think at

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.790 
is a really good intro and CG I think at
the<00:03:51.100> start<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.520> the<00:03:51.640> video<00:03:51.850> game<00:03:52.300> I<00:03:53.290> haven't

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
the start of the video game I haven't

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.660 
the start of the video game I haven't
shown<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.430> because<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:56.050> was<00:03:56.550> there<00:03:57.550> was

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
shown you that because it was there was

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.670 
shown you that because it was there was
a<00:03:57.700> bit<00:03:57.910> glitchy<00:03:58.120> within<00:03:58.870> six<00:03:59.230> theories<00:03:59.530> it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
a bit glitchy within six theories it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.160 
a bit glitchy within six theories it
could<00:03:59.830> be<00:03:59.920> like<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.570> when<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.720> ended<00:04:01.960> six

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
could be like that when the ended six

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.860 
could be like that when the ended six
gears<00:04:02.410> for<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.720> CT<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:06.730> animation<00:04:07.690> was

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
gears for the CT I like animation was

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.190 
gears for the CT I like animation was
really<00:04:08.830> really<00:04:09.100> good<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:13.450> don't<00:04:13.690> see<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.020> went

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
really really good and don't see it went

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.470 
really really good and don't see it went
into<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.920> story<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.610> story<00:04:15.640> is<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.180> led

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
into the the story the story is just led

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.910 
into the the story the story is just led
to<00:04:16.510> balance<00:04:16.900> really<00:04:17.200> well

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
to balance really well

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:53.420 
to balance really well
doctor<00:04:18.519> CGI<00:04:19.090> use<00:04:19.420> they're<00:04:19.690> pretty<00:04:20.019> damn<00:04:20.230> sweet

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.980 

now<00:04:54.430> that's<00:04:54.670> not<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:54.940> was<00:04:55.120> able<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.420> throw<00:04:55.720> these

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
now that's not I was able to throw these

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.900 
now that's not I was able to throw these
things<00:04:56.050> and<00:04:56.500> those<00:04:56.920> it<00:04:57.100> smooth<00:04:57.430> sailing<00:04:57.880> to

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
things and those it smooth sailing to

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.980 
things and those it smooth sailing to
know<00:04:58.120> why<00:04:58.800> that's<00:04:59.800> not<00:05:00.160> know<00:05:00.760> you<00:05:01.750> can

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
know why that's not know you can

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:11.250 
know why that's not know you can
actually<00:05:02.200> jump<00:05:02.560> in<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:08.640> Australian<00:05:10.110> so<00:05:11.110> that

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
actually jump in this Australian so that

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.760 
actually jump in this Australian so that
obviously<00:05:11.560> leaves<00:05:11.800> some<00:05:12.040> poison<00:05:12.520> gas<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:16.770> know

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
obviously leaves some poison gas to know

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:33.870 
obviously leaves some poison gas to know
maybe<00:05:17.980> I<00:05:18.160> haven't<00:05:18.400> got<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.610> right<00:05:18.820> things

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.210 

oh<00:05:33.910> yeah<00:05:34.480> that's<00:05:34.630> one<00:05:34.750> thing<00:05:34.930> that<00:05:34.980> to<00:05:35.980> read

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
oh yeah that's one thing that to read

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.480 
oh yeah that's one thing that to read
the<00:05:36.370> controls<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:38.680> controls<00:05:38.800> are<00:05:39.250> actually

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
the controls the controls are actually

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.940 
the controls the controls are actually
really<00:05:39.760> good<00:05:42.090> not<00:05:43.090> as<00:05:43.330> good<00:05:43.660> as<00:05:43.870> it<00:05:44.680> seemed

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
really good not as good as it seemed

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.010 
really good not as good as it seemed
again<00:05:45.370> I<00:05:45.580> keep<00:05:45.700> getting<00:05:45.970> back<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.240> exudes<00:05:46.630> but

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
again I keep getting back to exudes but

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.290 
again I keep getting back to exudes but
there<00:05:47.650> is<00:05:47.920> a<00:05:47.950> period<00:05:48.700> when<00:05:48.940> they're<00:05:49.060> still

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
there is a period when they're still

00:05:49.300 --> 00:06:18.379 
there is a period when they're still
quite<00:05:49.600> consistent<00:05:53.280> I've<00:05:54.280> no<00:05:54.790> fucking<00:05:55.270> clue

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:32.420 

oh<00:06:20.479> shit<00:06:25.159> that's<00:06:26.159> us<00:06:27.259> stupid<00:06:29.569> well<00:06:30.569> I<00:06:31.430> think

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
oh shit that's us stupid well I think

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.070 
oh shit that's us stupid well I think
I'm<00:06:32.699> even<00:06:32.849> there<00:06:33.000> guys<00:06:33.330> as<00:06:33.599> you<00:06:33.689> can<00:06:33.719> see

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
I'm even there guys as you can see

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.659 
I'm even there guys as you can see
pretty<00:06:35.039> decent<00:06:35.580> game<00:06:36.800> not<00:06:37.800> quite<00:06:38.099> on<00:06:38.310> par<00:06:38.610> with

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
pretty decent game not quite on par with

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.350 
pretty decent game not quite on par with
it<00:06:39.210> seems<00:06:39.620> we're<00:06:40.620> picking<00:06:41.009> up<00:06:41.069> though<00:06:41.310> as<00:06:42.210> I

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
it seems we're picking up though as I

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.230 
it seems we're picking up though as I
said<00:06:42.389> it's<00:06:42.750> a<00:06:42.900> first-person<00:06:43.490> melee<00:06:44.490> combat

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
said it's a first-person melee combat

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.659 
said it's a first-person melee combat
game<00:06:45.569> which<00:06:46.199> is<00:06:46.379> a<00:06:46.409> lot<00:06:46.680> different<00:06:46.860> which

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
game which is a lot different which

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.640 
game which is a lot different which
gives<00:06:47.969> it<00:06:48.120> an<00:06:48.240> edge<00:06:48.419> a<00:06:48.449> bit<00:06:49.099> but<00:06:50.099> the<00:06:51.409> story<00:06:52.409> is

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
gives it an edge a bit but the story is

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.309 
gives it an edge a bit but the story is
just<00:06:52.860> the<00:06:53.039> load<00:06:53.219> of<00:06:53.430> knife<00:06:53.939> really<00:06:54.509> in<00:06:54.689> which

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
just the load of knife really in which

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.320 
just the load of knife really in which
the<00:06:55.770> gameplay<00:06:56.219> does<00:06:56.460> stand<00:06:56.729> out<00:06:56.879> enough<00:06:57.029> I

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
the gameplay does stand out enough I

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.820 
the gameplay does stand out enough I
think<00:06:57.539> it's<00:06:57.719> definitely<00:06:57.990> worth<00:06:58.229> picking<00:06:58.560> up

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
think it's definitely worth picking up

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:16.070 
think it's definitely worth picking up
you<00:06:58.979> can<00:06:59.159> get<00:06:59.279> pretty<00:06:59.639> cheap<00:07:00.090> so<00:07:14.750> once<00:07:15.750> again

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 
you can get pretty cheap so once again

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.740 
you can get pretty cheap so once again
