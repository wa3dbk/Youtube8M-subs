 for children and their parents 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.830
 just so or so just we will be taught 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.290
 and show how easy it is to make 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.130
 material something unusual and donate 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.430
 this gift 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.059
 just like that today my assistants 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.860
 will be a student of our school or all of his 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.390
 Darina today I want to offer you 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.800
 make a very interesting butterfly shape 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.690
 we will work with plastic 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.449
 material though sticks called 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.870
 rattan they bend beautifully from them you can 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.500
 make any form with these 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.510
 chopsticks 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.820
 we will do the wings first 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.780
 we will fasten our wands with the help 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.370
 wire 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 it is very important that the wire 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.130
 twist as a cross y.k. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.740
 we made the preparations of our wings for 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 butterflies have turned yellow and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.020
 green and hit the glasses pink and white 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.900
 very gentle color now we need 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.550
 arrange these wings for this we take 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.520
 sisal canvas 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.760
 This is a natural leaf material. 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.830
 agave made transparent and will 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.830
 our wings look very wonderful 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.000
 amazing tool hot gun 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.070
 with it you can stick all that 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.830
 I like very much to work with it 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.220
 tool and we glue sisal 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.220
 fiber 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.849
 with the wing of the blue left we are 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.579
 impose insert inside the wing 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.230
 more creates us the volume we made 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.019
 wings for our butterfly 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.650
 now we need to make a little body for 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.629
 of this we take two sticks we join them 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.579
 together 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.579
 fastened on both sides with wire 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.780
 inside we put the sizo left canvas and 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.780
 we get a calf 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.409
 now we fasten all our parts 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.560
 help wire and fix hot 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.560
 a pistol 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.879
 Butterfly we should fly it should 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.310
 to be beautiful and smart 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.849
 for this we will use live 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.769
 flowers amazing universal 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.069
 material 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.709
 floristic foam called azis this 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.840
 very hydras kopek material porous 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.989
 absorbs a large amount of water 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.450
 so that fresh flowers do not look like 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.989
 always fresh we will be with you today 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.920
 Darina to work with changed here such 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.840
 interesting forms that we attach to 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.569
 torso of our butterfly and it will be very 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.709
 nice and can it be the second time 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:05.290
 use oasis oasis material 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.269
 disposable reuse it 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.989
 can not be because he loses all his 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.760
 properties in order for aziz to wet it 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.069
 just put on 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.370
 the surface of the water he quickly absorb 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.850
 moisture and sink to the bottom of the vessel than 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.950
 comfortable 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.750
 this one has changed that he is already 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.880
 on a plastic backing 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.960
 the system no longer needs any reason 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.060
 and he also has a special hole 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.840
 we can attach our butterfly with 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.800
 using wire there is a sticky tape 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.639
 which should fixed wonderful 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.639
 on any surface 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.120
 in order to start making a composition 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.970
 you need one technical material first 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:59.540
 be sure to cover up lead us to you 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:02.010
 there are salalah leaves and fern leaves 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:07.880
 lead salal we can twist here 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.880
 use such tubes as a stapler 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.889
 with green we emphasized 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:25.080
 torso elongated by our butterfly and us 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.210
 Remains small accents this living 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.479
 flowers to our butterfly 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.979
 watch were attract practically 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.800
 our butterflies are ready 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.289
 but worth them to give a little glamor for 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.460
 We use the beads for 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:43.280
 to issue 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.280
 antennae use color a.y. 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:04.240
 our butterflies succeeded and my butterfly 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.060
 I'll give mom just like that 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.610
 unusual things we teach to do children and 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.039
 adults of our school studio florid 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.699
 it's so easy to do something 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.699
 just
