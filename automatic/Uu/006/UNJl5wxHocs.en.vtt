00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.500 
game-tying shot my guess is that a
Jeremy<00:02:31.799> Lin<00:02:31.829> were<00:02:32.549> on<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.879> court<00:02:33.209> for<00:02:33.480> that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
Jeremy Lin were on the court for that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.690 
Jeremy Lin were on the court for that
things<00:02:34.440> might<00:02:34.769> have<00:02:34.920> gone<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.159> little<00:02:35.400> bit

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
things might have gone a little bit

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.399 
things might have gone a little bit
differently<00:02:38.000> tonight<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.750> Lakers<00:02:40.140> was

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
differently tonight for the Lakers was

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.539 
differently tonight for the Lakers was
about<00:02:40.739> Lin<00:02:41.459> sanity<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.409> about<00:02:43.409> Kobe<00:02:43.980> sanity

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
about Lin sanity and about Kobe sanity

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.369 
about Lin sanity and about Kobe sanity
