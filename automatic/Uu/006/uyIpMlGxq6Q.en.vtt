box and time to make the volume without

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.510 
box and time to make the volume without
let<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.209> ball<00:01:32.360> bounce<00:01:32.509> on<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.810> ground<00:01:33.520> and

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
let the ball bounce on the ground and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.960 
let the ball bounce on the ground and
here's<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.060> problem<00:01:35.479> people<00:01:35.690> serve<00:01:36.850> first<00:01:37.850> of

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
here's the problem people serve first of

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.460 
here's the problem people serve first of
all<00:01:38.119> commit<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.509> mistake<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.840> tossing<00:01:39.410> the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
all commit the mistake of tossing the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.949 
all commit the mistake of tossing the
ball<00:01:39.590> above<00:01:39.890> their<00:01:40.100> head<00:01:40.630> therefore<00:01:41.630> they<00:01:41.780> hit

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
ball above their head therefore they hit

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.260 
ball above their head therefore they hit
the<00:01:42.170> ball<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.649> land<00:01:42.950> exactly<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.090> same

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
the ball and land exactly in the same

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.080 
the ball and land exactly in the same
spot<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.899> then<00:01:45.050> they<00:01:45.200> have<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.500> run<00:01:45.619> forward

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
spot and then they have to run forward

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.160 
spot and then they have to run forward
therefore<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:47.209> hard<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.600> get<00:01:47.780> all<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.050> way

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
therefore it's hard to get all the way

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.529 
therefore it's hard to get all the way
up<00:01:48.200> here<00:01:48.619> before<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.729> return<00:01:50.030> comes<00:01:50.360> back<00:01:50.709> and

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
up here before the return comes back and

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.419 
up here before the return comes back and
the<00:01:53.539> second<00:01:53.869> problem<00:01:54.050> I<00:01:54.319> see<00:01:54.560> besides<00:01:55.039> that

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
the second problem I see besides that

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.370 
the second problem I see besides that
the<00:01:56.090> toss<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.569> the<00:01:56.599> serve<00:01:56.899> not<00:01:57.140> really

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the toss of the serve not really

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.339 
the toss of the serve not really
propelling<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.039> server<00:01:58.310> forward<00:01:58.819> is<00:01:59.599> the<00:02:00.170> run

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
propelling the server forward is the run

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.020 
propelling the server forward is the run
itself<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.039> know<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.550> net<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.759> know<00:02:02.000> a

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
itself you know to the net you know a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.760 
itself you know to the net you know a
lot<00:02:02.209> of<00:02:02.300> people<00:02:02.599> serve<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.349> then<00:02:03.470> kind<00:02:03.709> of

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
lot of people serve and then kind of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.770 
lot of people serve and then kind of
like<00:02:03.890> jog<00:02:04.250> up<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.789> take<00:02:05.030> their<00:02:05.209> time<00:02:05.420> getting

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
like jog up and take their time getting

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.870 
like jog up and take their time getting
in<00:02:05.869> there<00:02:06.190> most<00:02:07.190> of<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.399> time<00:02:07.490> they're

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
in there most of the time they're

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.330 
in there most of the time they're
getting<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.149> return<00:02:08.450> back<00:02:08.660> at<00:02:08.840> their<00:02:08.959> feet

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
getting the return back at their feet

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.180 
getting the return back at their feet
having<00:02:10.340> trouble<00:02:10.670> with<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.789> shot<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:13.010> then

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
having trouble with that shot so so then

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.830 
having trouble with that shot so so then

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
too efficient check it out from here

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.590 
too efficient check it out from here
Ronnie<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.560> then<00:03:01.680> he<00:03:01.770> takes<00:03:01.950> his<00:03:02.130> time<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:03.450> at

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
Ronnie and then he takes his time but at

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.910 
Ronnie and then he takes his time but at
any<00:03:03.870> Goods<00:03:04.050> here<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.320> bows<00:03:04.440> already<00:03:04.710> coming

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
any Goods here the bows already coming

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.410 
any Goods here the bows already coming
back<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.690> other<00:03:06.810> hand<00:03:07.760> if<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.910> toss<00:03:09.210> this

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
back the other hand if you toss this

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.800 
back the other hand if you toss this
ball<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.690> little<00:03:09.810> further<00:03:09.960> out<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.470> pride<00:03:10.740> I

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
ball a little further out the pride I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.130 
ball a little further out the pride I
guess<00:03:13.610> so<00:03:14.610> then<00:03:14.820> you're<00:03:15.210> on<00:03:15.360> your<00:03:15.570> way<00:03:15.600> board

guess so then you're on your way board

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:26.540 
guess so then you're on your way board
