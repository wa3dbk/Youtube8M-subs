so I'm going to clean it up put it in a
fresh<00:02:30.430> battery<00:02:30.670> pack<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.060> then<00:02:31.330> sell<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:32.040> but

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.790 
fresh battery pack and then sell it but
in<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.280> process<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:34.030> think<00:02:34.060> I'll<00:02:34.690> produce<00:02:35.530> a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
in the process I think I'll produce a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.070 
in the process I think I'll produce a
set<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.130> videos<00:02:36.280> going<00:02:36.760> over<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.840> if<00:02:37.959> we

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
set of videos going over it so if we

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.600 
set of videos going over it so if we
just<00:02:38.230> start<00:02:38.560> with<00:02:39.450> some<00:02:40.450> things<00:02:41.370> that's<00:02:42.370> the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
just start with some things that's the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.040 
just start with some things that's the
motor<00:02:44.160> okay<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.220> if<00:02:45.760> we<00:02:46.060> back<00:02:46.330> out<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.810> give

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
motor okay so if we back out and give

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.170 
motor okay so if we back out and give
you<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.200> little<00:02:47.320> bit<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.620> context<00:02:48.310> that's<00:02:49.000> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
you a little bit of context that's the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.530 
you a little bit of context that's the
whole<00:02:49.209> scooter<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:51.580> motor<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.880> sitting<00:02:52.360> back

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
whole scooter the motor is sitting back

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.979 
whole scooter the motor is sitting back
here<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:54.459> got<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.640> belt<00:02:55.030> drive<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:55.660> goes<00:02:55.810> to

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
here it's got a belt drive that goes to

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:07.470 
here it's got a belt drive that goes to
the<00:02:56.050> rear<00:02:56.290> wheel<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.910> then<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.970> then<00:03:07.300> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
the rear wheel and then so and then the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.590 
the rear wheel and then so and then the
next<00:03:07.510> basic<00:03:07.989> item<00:03:08.770> is<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.190> controller<00:03:09.820> this

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
next basic item is this controller this

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.449 
next basic item is this controller this
controller<00:03:11.080> sits<00:03:11.410> between<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.770> battery<00:03:12.040> pack

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
controller sits between the battery pack

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.539 
controller sits between the battery pack
and<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:13.000> motor<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:15.750> gauge<00:03:16.750> how<00:03:17.019> much<00:03:17.280> power<00:03:18.280> is

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
and the motor to gauge how much power is

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.840 
and the motor to gauge how much power is
going<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.820> go<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.030> motor<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.980> then<00:03:20.980> up

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
going to go to the motor and then up

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.050 
going to go to the motor and then up
here<00:03:22.560> that's<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.709> throttle<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.880> on<00:03:25.030> the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
here that's a throttle it's on the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.140 
here that's a throttle it's on the
handlebars<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.489> user<00:03:27.670> input

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
handlebars and this is the user input

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.640 
handlebars and this is the user input
that<00:03:28.360> tells<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.690> controller<00:03:29.049> how<00:03:29.230> much<00:03:29.380> power

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
that tells the controller how much power

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.759 
that tells the controller how much power
to<00:03:29.830> put<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.760> motor<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:32.019> that's<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.290> basics

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
to put to the motor so that's the basics

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.009 
to put to the motor so that's the basics
of<00:03:32.950> an<00:03:33.220> electric<00:03:33.700> vehicle<00:03:33.820> system<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.630> we'll

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
of an electric vehicle system and we'll

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.600 
of an electric vehicle system and we'll
be<00:03:35.140> going<00:03:35.350> over<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.739> in<00:03:35.980> more<00:03:36.160> detail<00:03:36.580> in

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
be going over this in more detail in

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.880 
be going over this in more detail in
future<00:03:36.940> videos<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:38.519> guess<00:03:40.739> overview<00:03:41.739> of<00:03:41.829> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
future videos I guess overview of the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.160 
future videos I guess overview of the
parts<00:03:42.190> will<00:03:42.310> be<00:03:42.400> using<00:03:42.610> i'll<00:03:43.239> be<00:03:43.570> using<00:03:43.780> this

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
parts will be using i'll be using this

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.509 
parts will be using i'll be using this
thing<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:46.620> provide<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.739> main<00:03:47.890> battery<00:03:48.310> bus

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
thing to provide the main battery bus

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.479 
thing to provide the main battery bus
the<00:03:49.019> 36<00:03:50.019> volts<00:03:50.410> there's<00:03:50.890> going<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.130> be<00:03:51.190> three

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
the 36 volts there's going to be three

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.970 
the 36 volts there's going to be three
batteries<00:03:52.000> in<00:03:52.239> here<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:53.079> it'll<00:03:53.230> be<00:03:53.290> three<00:03:53.680> lead

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
batteries in here so it'll be three lead

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.400 
batteries in here so it'll be three lead
acid<00:03:54.310> batteries<00:03:54.780> there<00:03:55.780> are<00:03:55.840> 12<00:03:56.019> volt<00:03:56.200> seats

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
acid batteries there are 12 volt seats

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.580 
acid batteries there are 12 volt seats
so<00:03:56.590> it'll<00:03:56.739> be<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.860> 36<00:03:57.549> volt<00:03:57.730> system<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:59.380> they'll

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
so it'll be a 36 volt system and they'll

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.390 
so it'll be a 36 volt system and they'll
connect<00:03:59.890> right<00:04:00.040> here<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:02.380> then<00:04:02.620> all<00:04:02.920> of<00:04:02.980> the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
connect right here and then all of the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.970 
connect right here and then all of the
wiring<00:04:03.970> will<00:04:04.600> be<00:04:04.780> connected<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.530> these<00:04:05.650> screws

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
wiring will be connected to these screws

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.960 
wiring will be connected to these screws
here<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:08.470> then<00:04:08.950> I've<00:04:09.070> got<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.280> switch<00:04:09.700> down

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
here and then I've got a switch down

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.910 
here and then I've got a switch down
here<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:12.130> used<00:04:12.970> for<00:04:13.120> turning<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.920> lights

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
here the is used for turning the lights

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.990 
here the is used for turning the lights
on<00:04:15.100> and<00:04:15.160> off<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.959> then<00:04:17.100> there's<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.250> charging

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
on and off and then there's a charging

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.789 
on and off and then there's a charging
port<00:04:19.180> on<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.479> other<00:04:19.599> side<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.440> hook<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.770> a

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
port on the other side to hook in a

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.120 
port on the other side to hook in a
charger<00:04:21.690> if<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.870> remember<00:04:22.900> correctly<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.650> set<00:04:24.010> up

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
charger if I remember correctly I set up

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.110 
charger if I remember correctly I set up
these<00:04:24.400> rare

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
these rare

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.700 
these rare
so<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:26.290> these<00:04:26.650> are<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:26.979> top<00:04:28.080> would<00:04:29.080> activate

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
so that these are the top would activate

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.810 
so that these are the top would activate
when<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.550> brakes<00:04:30.850> are<00:04:31.199> activated<00:04:32.199> and<00:04:32.949> this

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
when the brakes are activated and this

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.719 
when the brakes are activated and this
one<00:04:34.000> down<00:04:34.120> here<00:04:34.180> would<00:04:34.510> be<00:04:34.630> always<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:36.250> this

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
one down here would be always on so this

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.879 
one down here would be always on so this
means<00:04:36.940> this<00:04:37.210> scooter<00:04:37.630> if<00:04:38.290> i<00:04:38.830> remember

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
means this scooter if i remember

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.439 
means this scooter if i remember
correctly<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:39.669> scooter<00:04:39.910> will<00:04:40.150> be<00:04:40.270> able<00:04:40.330> to

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
correctly this scooter will be able to

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.170 
correctly this scooter will be able to
have<00:04:40.979> tail<00:04:41.979> lights<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.370> turn<00:04:42.490> on<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:42.850> off<00:04:42.940> as

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
have tail lights that turn on and off as

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.390 
have tail lights that turn on and off as
use<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.630> brakes<00:04:43.870> which<00:04:44.740> i<00:04:44.919> think<00:04:44.979> that<00:04:45.280> would

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
use the brakes which i think that would

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.370 
use the brakes which i think that would
be<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:45.550> cool<00:04:46.210> feature<00:04:48.090> otherwise<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.600> the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
be a cool feature otherwise the the

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.560 
be a cool feature otherwise the the
wheels<00:04:50.590> are<00:04:52.110> just<00:04:53.110> normal<00:04:53.910> 12<00:04:54.910> inch<00:04:55.120> scooter

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
wheels are just normal 12 inch scooter

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.560 
wheels are just normal 12 inch scooter
wheels<00:04:55.780> it's<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:59.520> yeah<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:00.789> in<00:05:01.000> future<00:05:01.300> videos

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
wheels it's a yeah so in future videos

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.560 
wheels it's a yeah so in future videos
i'll<00:05:01.960> be<00:05:02.110> going<00:05:02.380> over<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:04.030> steps<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.479> the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
i'll be going over the steps of the

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.070 
i'll be going over the steps of the
conversion<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:06.900> be<00:05:07.900> doing<00:05:09.660> quite<00:05:10.660> a<00:05:10.720> bit<00:05:10.780> with

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
conversion and be doing quite a bit with

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.710 
conversion and be doing quite a bit with
this<00:05:11.229> it<00:05:12.160> should<00:05:12.430> take<00:05:12.669> several<00:05:13.030> videos<00:05:13.449> to<00:05:13.600> go

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
this it should take several videos to go

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.529 
this it should take several videos to go
through<00:05:13.930> this<00:05:14.050> process<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.970> again<00:05:16.210> I'm<00:05:16.330> David

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
through this process so again I'm David
