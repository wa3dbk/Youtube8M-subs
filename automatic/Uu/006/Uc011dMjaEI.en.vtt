see two different cases packaging looks

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.940 
see two different cases packaging looks
pretty<00:00:47.340> much<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> same<00:00:48.170> but<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.800> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
pretty much the same but this here is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.600 
pretty much the same but this here is
the<00:00:50.489> case<00:00:50.820> may<00:00:51.000> barely<00:00:51.239> there<00:00:51.539> case<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:52.110> white

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.160 
the case may barely there case in white
and<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.940> also<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.449> build<00:00:55.020> for

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and then I also have the build for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.590 
and then I also have the build for
blackberry<00:00:55.590> hardshell<00:00:56.250> case<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:57.420> is

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
direct from blackberry this one is in a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.039 
direct from blackberry this one is in a
just<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.079> black<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:02.000> color<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.809> we'll<00:01:03.899> take

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
just a black kind of color so we'll take

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.760 
just a black kind of color so we'll take
a<00:01:04.080> look<00:01:04.710> first<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.630> way<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
a look first at the way there so as you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.560 
a look first at the way there so as you
can<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:07.890> pretty<00:01:08.159> much<00:01:08.280> standard<00:01:08.820> case<00:01:09.360> mate

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
can see pretty much standard case mate

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.730 
can see pretty much standard case mate
packaging<00:01:10.549> nothing<00:01:11.549> too<00:01:11.670> different<00:01:11.970> there

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
packaging nothing too different there

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.020 
packaging nothing too different there

steel bezel the showing through it not

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.350 
steel bezel the showing through it not
completely<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:05.969> you're<00:02:06.119> not<00:02:06.180> completely

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
completely so you're not completely

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.449 
completely so you're not completely
hiding<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.110> again<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> whole<00:02:08.039> top<00:02:08.250> is

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
hiding it again the whole top is

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.180 
hiding it again the whole top is
accessible

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
accessible

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.210 
accessible
so<00:02:09.340> everything's<00:02:09.730> successful<00:02:10.240> Matt<00:02:10.420> so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
so everything's successful Matt so

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.020 
so everything's successful Matt so
really<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.610> white<00:02:12.820> color

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
really like in the white color

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.750 
really like in the white color
definitely<00:02:13.600> makes<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.020> pop<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> really<00:02:15.610> nice

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
definitely makes it pop so a really nice

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.290 
definitely makes it pop so a really nice
case<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.710> let's<00:02:18.100> see<00:02:18.280> if<00:02:18.400> we<00:02:18.550> can<00:02:18.700> easily<00:02:18.970> get

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
case so let's see if we can easily get

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.070 
case so let's see if we can easily get
this<00:02:19.510> one<00:02:19.690> off<00:02:20.760> there<00:02:21.760> we<00:02:21.910> go<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.630> put<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:22.900> one

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
this one off there we go so put that one

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.220 
this one off there we go so put that one
to<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.410> side<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.660> next<00:02:25.810> one<00:02:25.960> will<00:02:26.110> look

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
to the side so the next one will look

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.780 
to the side so the next one will look
out<00:02:26.440> here<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:28.860> hardshell<00:02:29.860> case<00:02:30.070> which<00:02:30.640> is

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
out here is a hardshell case which is

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.300 
out here is a hardshell case which is
part<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.150> belt<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.600> blackberry<00:02:32.110> series

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.650 

again<00:02:36.310> packaging<00:02:36.850> pretty<00:02:37.270> much<00:02:37.420> looks<00:02:37.600> like

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
again packaging pretty much looks like

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.380 
again packaging pretty much looks like
Danakil<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.380> case<00:02:38.560> made<00:02:38.800> but<00:02:39.640> no<00:02:39.970> case<00:02:40.210> mate

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
Danakil the case made but no case mate

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.030 
Danakil the case made but no case mate
logo<00:02:40.720> same<00:02:41.170> color<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.560> everything<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.980> that

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
the edge and then the battery door

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.270 
the edge and then the battery door
that's<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.020> bit<00:03:20.170> of<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.350> texture<00:03:20.770> to<00:03:20.890> it

that's a bit of a texture to it

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.699 
that's a bit of a texture to it
so<00:03:21.400> it's<00:03:21.550> actually<00:03:21.670> really<00:03:22.120> nice<00:03:22.470> pops<00:03:23.470> in

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
so it's actually really nice pops in

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.220 
so it's actually really nice pops in

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
there and again this covers all the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.930 
there and again this covers all the
bezels<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:26.740> that<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.280> know<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.610> can<00:03:27.760> see<00:03:27.910> a

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
bezels so that you know you can see a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.580 
bezels so that you know you can see a
little<00:03:28.270> bit<00:03:28.480> on<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.780> edge<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.200> doesn't<00:03:29.230> cover

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
little bit on the edge it doesn't cover

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.870 
little bit on the edge it doesn't cover
completely<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:30.160> can<00:03:30.310> kind<00:03:30.520> of<00:03:30.610> see<00:03:30.760> that

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
completely you can kind of see that

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.030 
completely you can kind of see that
silver<00:03:31.209> but<00:03:31.990> for<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.230> most<00:03:32.350> part<00:03:32.470> covers<00:03:32.890> it

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
silver but for the most part covers it

keys<00:03:46.720> are<00:03:46.870> covered<00:03:47.260> but<00:03:47.410> obviously<00:03:47.920> there's

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
keys are covered but obviously there's

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.590 
keys are covered but obviously there's
little<00:03:48.580> raised<00:03:48.730> bits<00:03:49.000> there<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.450> still

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
little raised bits there so you still

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.750
