00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
of sexy design which is even better than

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
it's exciting it's going to be awesome

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.610 
it's exciting it's going to be awesome
hopefully<00:02:27.270> they<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:27.750> also<00:02:28.020> improve<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
hopefully they can also improve the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.940 
hopefully they can also improve the
battery<00:02:28.950> life<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.430> bit<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:30.890> i'm<00:02:31.890> a

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
battery life a little bit but i'm a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.350 
battery life a little bit but i'm a
little<00:02:32.069> bit<00:02:32.400> skeptical<00:02:32.849> about<00:02:32.879> that<00:02:33.209> because

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
little bit skeptical about that because

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.540 
little bit skeptical about that because
they<00:02:33.720> they<00:02:34.500> don't<00:02:34.680> make<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.069> phone<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.370> much

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
they they don't make the phone that much

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.050 
they they don't make the phone that much
bigger<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.709> will<00:02:37.920> be<00:02:38.129> more<00:02:38.340> powerful

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
bigger and then it will be more powerful

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.800 
bigger and then it will be more powerful
in<00:02:39.300> terms<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.019> internal<00:02:40.890> stuff<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.450> when

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
in terms of the internal stuff so when

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.270 
in terms of the internal stuff so when
it's<00:02:43.290> gonna<00:02:43.379> be<00:02:43.500> awesome<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:44.040> going<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.220> be

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
it's gonna be awesome it's going to be

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.040 
it's gonna be awesome it's going to be
great<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.360> time<00:02:45.540> at<00:02:45.690> fourth<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.680> coming
