00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.549
 by that is art story that you go 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.280
 well guys so today without 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.719
 doubt for a new tutorial video of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.490
 most useful technical gestures of 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.160
 fifa so I had made a video on 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.900
 all the technical gestures of fifa 15 i 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.550
 invite you to click on the notation 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.260
 which is currently displayed on the screen if 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.850
 you are on pc then if you are on 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.750
 mobile that you can not read them 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.609
 annotations you go in the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.779
 description there is the video link 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.000
 with all the united states that I you 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.619
 invite to see before going to see this 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.790
 video so in the video where I had all 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.800
 technical gestures to customs who 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.930
 was his daughter is there as his gestures 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.190
 quite simple techniques and then if you 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.390
 really arrive not you can go 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.719
 see my video or gesture stuff 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.730
 technical 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.140
 they are present so that's gesture 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.690
 technique is no longer here so go no 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.700
 wasting time on vacation and fear for 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.879
 me the most useful is the scoop both the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.719
 pretense of striking earlier here we are there 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.430
 just have to do so the square key and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.390
 so believe if you are sure safe sure 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.420
 xbox is the one both shot more 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.619
 the most two-pass keys including 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.030
 you do it very quickly and that 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.740
 makes a feint of typing that you 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.170
 allows to eliminate it make me very very 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.000
 quickly the opponents so the ranks 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.189
 I have super useful you can besides 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.860
 eliminated the goalkeeper I think with we're going 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.790
 immediately tried 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.100
 so here I eliminated the guardian on 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.439
 just shoot after noguÃ¨s really great 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.759
 useful then we have the gesture a new 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.060
 technical gesture is really super helpful 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.920
 it's this one for me it's one of 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.970
 most useful of fifa this is a new 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.600
 so it's really great so 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.119
 imagine that you go into the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.070
 direction of the guardian it is necessary to put two 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.020
 shots in the direction in the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.920
 diagonal in fact for my part I put 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 two shots with the joystick down to 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.729
 left like this and then if you go 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 to where does it at the top right 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.549
 so that's pretty simple it takes 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.530
 take the hand do not get me 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.790
 really a very simple technical game we 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.899
 will try to find it keep with 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.280
 but it's a little harder with his 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.140
 excuses and especially for your rib the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.960
 here I am successful it is especially for 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.850
 to clear the defender then we have the gesture 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.560
 technical the elastic at the shop so I 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.489
 am here and I love you very much there 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.489
 really a lot of stylus 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.320
 I will try to look with whom I 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.450
 explain to you immediately how 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.820
 do it so it's a little bit more here I have 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.490
 successful so he really super stylish in 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.630
 plus the super helpful so imagine that 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.730
 you go to the guardian you put 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.080
 a shot in the player's doubs and a 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.400
 kick on the side in the interaction you 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.990
 want to go so you can do it at 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.520
 the stop that to do that is a little less 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.320
 useful it is especially current that it is 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.760
 useful so a player look and 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.810
 a cost of a direction wanted to go on 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.170
 the right on the watch tac 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.240
 this is very very simple really 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.500
 very very simple about techniques 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.330
 super super helpful because it is very 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.310
 easy two dribbles and players 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.700
 with so that's really a gesture 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.960
 technique that I appreciate a lot and 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.010
 the last technical gesture that I use 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.900
 a lot so actually all these gestures 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.710
 enix and especially for when I play for 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.850
 to win 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.340
 if the leg fills simply 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.500
 so it's enough to actually shake logistic 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.920
 we will say two three hours to 9 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.020
 hours it's logistic was a clock 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.460
 imagine that you are moving forward with your 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.080
 player towards the goalkeeper is three 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.360
 hours until 9 o'clock and then you 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.780
 switch with the left joystick to 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.240
 one side so in fact if you go to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.470
 where you do it from 6am to noon so 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.880
 I think you understood me and 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.290
 just after having it rocked you 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.210
 on one side or can even rocked into 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.820
 back I'm going to show you 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.500
 so here it is really super useful 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.180
 you can go back on 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.560
 one side on a diagonal 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.120
 really I was great here because he 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.340
 actually accelerates on one side 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.930
 without knowing how to do that you'll 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.070
 see it's a bit slow here when I 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.210
 make it simple to change direction 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.440
 it's a little slow while there with 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.320
 overtaking during it's really very 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.420
 fast you see it speeds up on on 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.980
 his stride so here it is against 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.450
 for the caretaker it's a little hot with 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.550
 leg patches but for 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.650
 to drain players is really 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.500
 super simple new there I say no more 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.140
 of technical gestures than that kankan 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.340
 I live so won again so 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.430
 you want to see all the gestures 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.430
 techniques of 2,2 fifa 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.810
 the notation she is currently at 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.430
 the screen throughout the video 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.599
 and then if you are on mobile had 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.189
 in the description so you have a 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.150
 description and you click here 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:15.040
 it was out of cash by you have 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.040
 enjoyed the video udder
