00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.520
 trying to rescue a little what 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.449
 the videos that had the other channel that 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.850
 I bring you a link that the video did 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.430
 a while ago but I did not do it in hd 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.870
 in the old channel and is how to get 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.870
 infinite money infinite de monet with 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.559
 idea of ​​experts remember that for the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.790
 day of space 1 there was already a link in which 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.690
 you got infinite credits too 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.690
 and this 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.550
 back where we came from is in the 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.190
 chapter 3 when you enter as a 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.159
 flag you see in the video also not 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.620
 you have loss and you get high speak a 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.250
 bunch of kids those little kids 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.840
 what is going 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.730
 they are screaming and jumping and others and if you 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.310
 you see there are two windows with some 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.490
 small blocks toy boxes 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.580
 in you below them we have some 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.060
 cards that are then 200 300 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.860
 credits etc. well then what I just 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.340
 do is make me a lot on the ground and 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.340
 I'm taking them 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.830
 works collect those that conform with you 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.570
 with me I cry I do it as well as 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.820
 I said or come back with the part 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.759
 volunteers come or you can be with 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 costs to go up the elevator that 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.460
 now later you go 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.790
 you see him 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.729
 the biggest bucs I've seen in the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 story of the game there's a lot because to 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.830
 see there is another 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.170
 there is another pair of bed bugs 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.330
 in this game there are another couple of mistakes 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.990
 that has not infinities and also 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.760
 I have it on my channel + 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.830
 because everything in an amount between 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.570
 reproductions and visits and likes 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.940
 that is, it has been very helpful 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.780
 especially for the impossibly 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.290
 remember a mode that is quite solid 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.100
 since we can only save from 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.770
 amount three times then the truth 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.230
 but not to die for example I saved in the 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.680
 chapter 7 by my first grief 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.810
 must go to die before 1 to 7 is a 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.840
 authentic burrada 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.700
 and there are people because without money what 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.980
 we buy here I'll buy sides 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.709
 and others and the truth because they cost them 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.680
 more today this ship is the help that 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.420
 we all need for the impossible way 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.739
 answering that you are wrong to 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.230
 top with nodes with di with credits for 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.000
 other sections of who and others I over 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.400
 Anyway, it's the key to the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.980
 nodes equal to force 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.470
 and nothing good guys I have here with the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.370
 weekend 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.959
 but we like the unit is the hdmi 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.970
 do not forget to comment subscribe 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.190
 ilike please and favorites if you have 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.760
 liked that above all is the most 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.400
 important above all remember that 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.799
 although it seems to you that my channel is new 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.629
 it is not that it is not yes that is what 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.349
 only thing that happens is that on the other channel 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.299
 that had 420 subscribers when requesting 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.799
 the partner 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.579
 It seems that I have had a problem with 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.859
 adsense is and I have not been able to 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.780
 achieve my goal of being a partner 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.750
 from YouTube 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.490
 but well I do not get discouraged if later 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.100
 you can try this account 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.740
 despite having asked for an explanation 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.640
 respect 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.910
 to the lack that I said I had not me 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.910
 has entered 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.590
 an application and so on because it seems to be 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:20.019
 that according to them 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.050
 there is a misuse of the adsense account 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.419
 the more so when it's not like that because I do not 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.580
 I have no need with 420 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.910
 subscribers and 300 thousand reproductions of 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.889
 video that I had from the other channel that 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.850
 done I still have that channel I follow 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.280
 I will continue being an active artist of 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.620
 brito it happens that I do not go to my 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.229
 I 'm not going to be able to fulfill this objective 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.130
 but good new good new us 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:52.930
