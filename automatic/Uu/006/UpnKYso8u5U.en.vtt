essentially<00:00:28.439> winter<00:00:28.830> mode<00:00:29.010> helps<00:00:30.260> reduce

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
essentially winter mode helps reduce

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.440 
essentially winter mode helps reduce
wheel<00:00:31.560> spin<00:00:31.890> during<00:00:32.189> wintery<00:00:32.669> or<00:00:32.969> slippery

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
wheel spin during wintery or slippery

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900 
wheel spin during wintery or slippery
conditions<00:00:33.690> by<00:00:34.559> making<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> car<00:00:35.340> take<00:00:35.610> off<00:00:35.730> in

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
conditions by making the car take off in

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.910 
conditions by making the car take off in
second<00:00:36.270> gear<00:00:36.480> well<00:00:36.840> well<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.559> pretty<00:00:37.800> much

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
second gear well well that's pretty much

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.010 
second gear well well that's pretty much
what<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> think<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> does<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:39.690> that's<00:00:39.870> what

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
what I think it does because that's what

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.080 
what I think it does because that's what
it<00:00:40.110> feels<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.520> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.640> see<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it feels like you can see one of the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.360 
it feels like you can see one of the
lights<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.450> instrument<00:00:43.020> Erzberg<00:00:43.370> alright

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
lights on the instrument Erzberg alright

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.580 
lights on the instrument Erzberg alright
so<00:00:44.550> let<00:00:44.789> me<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.210> zero<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> whatever<00:00:45.809> in

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
so let me do a zero in to whatever in

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.299 
so let me do a zero in to whatever in
winter<00:00:46.890> mode<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:48.000> my<00:00:48.149> dad's<00:00:48.420> Volvo<00:00:48.989> s40<00:00:49.920> it's

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
winter mode with my dad's Volvo s40 it's

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.060 
winter mode with my dad's Volvo s40 it's
a<00:00:50.370> 2001<00:00:50.969> model<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.510> point<00:00:51.719> ninety<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
a 2001 model one point ninety so this is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.560 
a 2001 model one point ninety so this is
going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.340> be<00:00:53.430> floored<00:00:53.699> without<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> kick

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
going to be floored without the kick

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
going to be floored without the kick
down<00:00:54.750> button<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> kick<00:00:55.559> down<00:00:55.710> button

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
down button because the kick down button

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:20.120 
down button because the kick down button
will<00:00:56.129> actually<00:00:56.489> bypass<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.180> winter<00:00:57.449> mode

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.490 

that<00:01:20.490> wasn't<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:21.030> short<00:01:21.570> shift<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:22.049> anything<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that wasn't a short shift or anything I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.679 
that wasn't a short shift or anything I
actually<00:01:22.590> released<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.759> say<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.509> guys

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
actually released it but say you guys

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.330 
actually released it but say you guys
get<00:01:24.840> an<00:01:24.930> idea

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.820 

all<00:01:30.340> right<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:30.700> without<00:01:31.300> flooring<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:31.990> I'm

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
all right so without flooring it I'm

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.740 
all right so without flooring it I'm
gonna<00:01:33.010> do<00:01:33.130> another<00:01:33.310> demo<00:01:33.670> or<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.090> winter<00:01:34.570> mode

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
gonna do another demo or the winter mode

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.450 
gonna do another demo or the winter mode
and<00:01:35.080> you're<00:01:35.200> gonna<00:01:35.290> see<00:01:35.530> how<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.830> processes

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
and you're gonna see how it processes

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.790 
and you're gonna see how it processes
right<00:01:36.730> through<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.060> gears<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:37.930> I'm<00:01:38.320> gonna<00:01:38.470> try

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
right through the gears so I'm gonna try

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.310 
right through the gears so I'm gonna try
to<00:01:38.910> keep<00:01:39.910> focus<00:01:40.360> on<00:01:40.480> the<00:01:40.540> tack<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:40.960> can<00:01:41.110> still

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
to keep focus on the tack you can still

00:01:41.320 --> 00:02:00.890 
to keep focus on the tack you can still
see<00:01:41.640> winter<00:01:42.640> mode<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.030> still<00:01:43.180> activated

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.100 

so<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.500> hit<00:02:01.770> 40<00:02:02.450> pretty<00:02:03.450> much<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.810> went<00:02:03.900> right

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
so I hit 40 pretty much it went right

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.130 
so I hit 40 pretty much it went right
through<00:02:04.140> all<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> years<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.980> way
