00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810 

I<00:00:00.120> think<00:00:00.630> it's<00:00:00.750> just<00:00:00.870> amateur<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:02.159> matter<00:00:02.730> of

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
I think it's just amateur a matter of

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.999 
I think it's just amateur a matter of
maturity<00:00:03.300> on<00:00:03.480> our<00:00:03.659> part<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.589> think<00:00:04.620> it's

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
maturity on our part and I think it's

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.600 
maturity on our part and I think it's
it's<00:00:05.910> obvious<00:00:06.690> sped<00:00:07.290> up<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.500> process<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:08.160> to

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
it's obvious sped up the process that to

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.910 
it's obvious sped up the process that to
have<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> champion<00:00:09.510> like<00:00:09.870> bachelor<00:00:10.559> come<00:00:10.740> in

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
have a champion like bachelor come in

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.249 
have a champion like bachelor come in

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
special and especially because during

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.000 
special and especially because during
the<00:03:15.989> year<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.200> don't<00:03:16.320> get<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.650> see<00:03:16.769> them<00:03:16.890> at

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
the year you don't get to see them at

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.220 
the year you don't get to see them at
all<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.820> make<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.180> most<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.870> time<00:03:19.049> that

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
all you make the most of the time that

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.960 
all you make the most of the time that
you<00:03:19.320> get<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:25.310> mean<00:03:26.310> they're<00:03:26.489> they're<00:03:26.790> good

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
you get I mean they're they're good

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.690 
you get I mean they're they're good
young<00:03:27.269> skilled<00:03:27.780> teams<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> expect<00:03:28.829> nothing

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
young skilled teams so I expect nothing

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.509 
young skilled teams so I expect nothing
less<00:03:29.910> they're<00:03:30.209> gonna<00:03:30.329> keep<00:03:30.570> coming<00:03:30.900> hard<00:03:31.049> and

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
less they're gonna keep coming hard and

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.800 
less they're gonna keep coming hard and
they<00:03:32.519> play<00:03:32.549> pretty<00:03:32.880> fast<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.390> think<00:03:33.480> if<00:03:33.690> we

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
they play pretty fast so I think if we

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.030 
they play pretty fast so I think if we
can<00:03:34.519> beat<00:03:35.519> their<00:03:35.760> their<00:03:36.150> speed<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:37.040> really

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
can beat their their speed and really

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.530 
can beat their their speed and really
limit<00:03:38.430> their<00:03:38.549> time<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:38.850> space<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.209> think<00:03:39.329> that's

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
limit their time in space I think that's

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.310 
limit their time in space I think that's
going<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.750> play<00:03:39.870> right<00:03:40.079> into<00:03:40.230> our<00:03:40.350> our<00:03:41.040> game
