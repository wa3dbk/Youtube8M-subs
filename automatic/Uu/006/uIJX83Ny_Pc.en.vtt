00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
about that as they dry and settle they

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.309 
about that as they dry and settle they
create<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.799> nice<00:01:22.159> domed<00:01:22.850> round<00:01:23.539> domed<00:01:24.140> effect

so you don't have to worry about having

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.989 
so you don't have to worry about having
a<00:01:26.780> point<00:01:27.109> we're<00:01:27.890> having<00:01:28.189> to<00:01:28.310> do<00:01:28.460> anything<00:01:28.700> with

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
a point we're having to do anything with

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:34.690 
a point we're having to do anything with
it<00:01:29.030> after<00:01:29.569> the<00:01:29.719> fact<00:01:31.929> very<00:01:32.929> easy<00:01:33.139> to<00:01:33.409> use<00:01:33.700> and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
it after the fact very easy to use and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.050 
it after the fact very easy to use and
again<00:01:35.380> once<00:01:36.380> they<00:01:36.560> dry<00:01:36.859> they<00:01:37.100> are<00:01:37.130> hard<00:01:37.520> I'm

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
again once they dry they are hard I'm

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.499 
again once they dry they are hard I'm
pushing<00:01:38.509> down<00:01:38.569> on<00:01:38.719> my<00:01:38.929> fingernail<00:01:39.409> with<00:01:40.069> the

pushing down on my fingernail with the

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.859 
pushing down on my fingernail with the
and<00:01:41.509> it<00:01:41.840> does<00:01:41.990> not<00:01:42.340> do<00:01:43.340> anything<00:01:43.719> so<00:01:44.719> they're

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
and it does not do anything so they're

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.840 
and it does not do anything so they're
very<00:01:45.139> hard<00:01:45.439> once<00:01:45.710> they<00:01:45.889> are<00:01:45.950> cured<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.460> dry

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
very hard once they are cured and dry

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.069 
very hard once they are cured and dry
you<00:01:46.909> do<00:01:47.209> not<00:01:47.329> have<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.600> worry<00:01:47.749> about<00:01:47.840> them

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
you do not have to worry about them

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.169 
you do not have to worry about them
coming<00:01:48.109> off<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:49.189> also<00:01:49.310> do<00:01:49.579> not<00:01:49.609> have<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.030> worry
