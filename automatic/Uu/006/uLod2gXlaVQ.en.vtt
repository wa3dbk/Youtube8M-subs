00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.230
 if we forget the word diet 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.099
 what is the diet that makes 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.570
 to lose weight and that is fun 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.860
 that makes you want to eat and you can 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.020
 eat three four five times a day 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.790
 and losing weight would have been the only 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.829
 reference that is valid is to see 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.020
 how to eat our ancestors or even our 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.940
 rear great grandparents at the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.860
 campaign still two two generations 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.570
 people were eating well in town there are 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.700
 two generations they were already eating badly 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.320
 so their father is what it is 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.210
 that they eat and who said eat 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.310
 like a king in the morning or a prince of the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.290
 morning as a prince coiro at noon and 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.870
 like a poor at night but we can 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.329
 maybe clarify a little bit about 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.040
 eat like a rich as poor 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.260
 was the evening you have to eat like a 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.090
 poor in starchy food ie not 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.860
 fill up do not miss the train 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.079
 especially if you are not a great sportsman 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.450
 or if we are not a profession that makes 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.579
 we spend a lot of energy 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.140
 during the day in the morning however 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.870
 is indispensable it is essential 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.909
 to eat well in the morning because the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.200
 morning food will already influenced this 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.540
 that we will do during the day at 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 meal level in the morning this can be 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.729
 eat an egg or 2nd there are some good this 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.560
 you can eat ham in the morning to 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.229
 world is something else a piece of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.600
 cheese was not too much bread at noon 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.340
 what can we do at noon is eat the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.590
 best possible is to undo the meal 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.810
 at noon but it's a meal 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.670
 rich tapped out it is better 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.740
 avoid the paws a two apples of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.260
 transit land or three slices for 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.549
 some good old-fashioned bread and 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.350
 to eat a piece of meat and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.510
 vegetables at noon and in the evening 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.159
 in the evening we can eat vegetables on 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.930
 can eat a salade niÃ§oise if we 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.400
 wants but we limit ourselves to one or two 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.259
 slices of bread and we also avoid 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.000
 the people are croquettes and 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.240
 fries be even worse or reading and the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.240
 evening
