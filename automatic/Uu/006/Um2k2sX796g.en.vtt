00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.960
 and then people on the attack have to do more 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.490
 will prevent blackouts waiting for you already 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.470
 whether they are seeing a piece of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.779
 handle day 3 but I'll explain 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.390
 why this video is a consensus neither by the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.400
 title to a comparison is one thing 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 also has a lot of that time is simple only 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.460
 I'll tell you later, I'll do it. 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.010
 the test you will understand now I will 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.619
 talking everything is too much pressure and speaking 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.800
 the i fairy to use laser 7 is not bi 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.399
 and I 'm going to sister to my opinion than 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.280
 I think it's right and why it's not a thing. 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.320
 again I will have straight talk and opinion 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.440
 then I'll bring a test using 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.000
 stern and miller site does not give 362 etc was and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.950
 it's very simple 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 Everyone knows they have not played. 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.910
 absolutely well balanced not 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 You're right, not because 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.780
 people speak ah but msm c &amp; w are very 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.980
 good 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.039
 they are not very good she was 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.229
 balanced if it is to see is the example smc is 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.750
 good from close up a good from afar but she has 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.400
 8 was low which high all have their 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.170
 advantages and disadvantages 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.299
 the kaka will give each of them an opinion 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.610
 I think the best you think best year of 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.500
 play photon factors is a very play 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.180
 no one can deny this and 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.430
 stop talking you have something like that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.380
 just missing is even a game very well 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.960
 balanced compared to example the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 mw 3 a year w2 not saying they are games 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 with this I love the two main 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.430
 players as a favorite but in fact did not 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.930
 is they are not a well balanced and ben 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.540
 there deep plate and I had talked about for 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.780
 a while ago that I played on ps3 and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.250
 Ana and had taken a maneuver did 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.530
 three and only in the background while I'm 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.740
 speaking this is a fashion piece and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.560
 And you know that I am 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.570
 well in the country they then if you talk mp7 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.750
 I do not know what sleep is and come back 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.000
 subject and I said what I found 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.780
 and how is a very balanced game 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.790
 players 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.340
 Obviously he has to find a mistake. 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.530
 even if any laser 7 is good it is 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.189
 good it elements just need ipefae 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 etc 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.319
 but he has nothing to appeal he is a 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.580
 punk balanced and you will anyway he 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.790
 is not a little balanced he is mine 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.560
 fado 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.969
 you will see by the criterion and 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.140
 that the same thing as a 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.390
 exercise for those who do not know the name of the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.209
 actress is much more appealing and I've never seen 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.909
 a person in my life complaining about 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.730
 stern I never was and never paddle you get 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:31.180
 just from nike fire to osteria and never saw in 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.890
 my life because he simply he 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.959
 it was better just as it had many 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.030
 worse things for selamat in general is 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.140
 that they put the blame on it 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.760
 case of a 2 with the game very well 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.889
 balanced the Spanish police 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.599
 Do you agree? Write the comments if 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.420
 Do not give us your opinion, let's go. 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.799
 discuss a bit and then make the bora 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.419
 test to show a little of my 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:54.609
 opinion beginning there by b2 well 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:57.189
 It's there at the beginning I'm so seeing myself 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.780
 I'm using the iaa pw a laser that where 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.500
 that he killed him easily and 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.030
 three xirus I will not be able to count 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.739
 because when I'm going to go far 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.430
 seeing many shots there because the team 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.620
 fire 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.419
 So you guys are seeing stuff there 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.419
 understanding both the staff speaks 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:16.989
 kills then demanded r 314 the shot to leave 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:19.269
 with the laser site showing there is not 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.310
 so good and efficient and from afar and then I 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.459
 earn enough you will see 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.609
 That's where a five- round vise I do not know. 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.489
 and now I will show and with the ads using the 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.760
 look that everyone says it's worse 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.150
 talks between the closer to there chimes 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.609
 you will normally see three shots there 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.129
 easily is normal without any errors 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.940
 average distance will end up killing a 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:48.819
 little more 44 four shots and kills and 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.769
 or 3d and I was not too far anymore 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.340
 If you were at the door a little bit 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:57.760
 back I would have been 4 and by far 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.979
 with 45 team out with pw it is I 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.439
 I'm showing this with ds then already 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:04.030
 They are seeing where the deficit is higher 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.979
 exercise is the only difference is the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.419
 mobility you move play more 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:10.329
 slowly with exercise this is the advantage 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:13.329
 that everyone says she's gone 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.120
 being appeal to the eurocopa and w100 17 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.829
 first with this you can already see is oo 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.609
 it happens there that those white dots 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.099
 Those girls there that is not so is so 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.210
 small as big as it would be with 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.060
 laser 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.520
 I'll easily go 3x out of normal 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.919
 same as another of medium distance he 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.650
 missed the same amount of shots 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.780
 I told then the only difference is 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.120
 far from it, it ends up gaining a 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.120
 or two pounds more but you're done 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.009
 seeing the laser site there it is not like that 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.560
 as efficient as many speak 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:51.400
 the only thing that is good this game is the rifle 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.520
 point laser site or Ipanema is good 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.250
 cable is not appeals the laser site soy a 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.070
 little good is usable 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.050
 but he is stage a friend you 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.780
 could see from the tests that the advantage 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.210
 It's quite small with a shot at most one 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.539
 Bugs are seeing there though. 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.139
 now to 3 to show how she 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:15.160
 also be so seeing there still three 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.380
 first thing she talked already 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.940
 selling the transition year without sound of 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.009
 A problem, but okay? 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.960
 what matters is the test and the first 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.000
 class that I 'm on the 27th with esther in 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.220
 which is the same thing as the laser site 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.190
 you saw three near xirus there now 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.820
 half-distance again three shots 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.560
 or is already up in the bel 2 and by far 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.740
 four shots 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.789
 so you know that almost never 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.229
 err there I'll miss a shot so I 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.919
 I hoped to recharge life and start 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.469
 new 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:50.979
 You saw him there, he was almost never a 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:54.280
 take number 2 and now I'll have to 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.590
 leaving the next class will be without being 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.380
 and evoked the stock car box instead of it 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.469
 but only to change and now we will 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.219
 test yes or in case laser site you 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:08.139
 you will see that what is Mr. 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:11.469
 company equivalent to laser site number 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:15.099
 10 do not see normal tranche up close is 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:17.409
 average distance and also gave from 3 to 4 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:19.780
 By far I've given more to these 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:23.770
 will continue to have four 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:27.280
 shots then do not walk 3 that's it basque 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.840
 and they did not complain because that's what I said 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.630
 before as the game was very balanced 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.669
 that was my smallest of problems 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.500
 players since 2 is a very game 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.240
 balanced any error yes it already 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.669
 caught the blame of the whole game 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.460
 he is but then it is this to take possession like this 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.770
 The video is liked there if you liked it. 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.880
 forget to click there and did not like 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.580
 talk video to help in 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.620
 disclosure and then this 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.449
 do not forget to write a comment to 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.979
 your opinion and I hope you 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:58.020
 like to compare this video and 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.020
 until the next spoke
