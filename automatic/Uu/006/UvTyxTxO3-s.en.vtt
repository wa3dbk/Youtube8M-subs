00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
format the partition now should be noted

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.680 
format the partition now should be noted
that<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.729> moment<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.119> deleted<00:02:09.569> that

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
partition all of the data on it was lost

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.000 
partition all of the data on it was lost
so

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.130 
so
make<00:02:13.099> sure<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.370> had<00:02:13.549> a<00:02:13.580> backup<00:02:14.120> now<00:02:14.930> you're

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
make sure you had a backup now you're

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.710 
make sure you had a backup now you're
going<00:02:15.409> to<00:02:15.470> now<00:02:16.340> format<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:16.970> drive<00:02:17.120> using<00:02:17.599> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
going to now format the drive using the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.130 
going to now format the drive using the
NTFS<00:02:18.349> system<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.879> use<00:02:19.909> the<00:02:20.329> quick<00:02:20.599> system

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
NTFS system you can use the quick system

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.259 
NTFS system you can use the quick system
but<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.829> won't<00:02:22.099> scan<00:02:22.519> your<00:02:22.730> hard<00:02:22.970> drive<00:02:23.239> for

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
but that won't scan your hard drive for

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.569 
but that won't scan your hard drive for
problems<00:02:24.049> while<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.439> installing<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.549> I

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
problems while it's installing so I

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.699 
problems while it's installing so I
suggest<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.090> use<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.569> long<00:02:26.870> term<00:02:27.349> process

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
suggest you use the long term process

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.350 
suggest you use the long term process
I'm<00:02:28.250> going<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.489> actually<00:02:28.610> go<00:02:28.879> with<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.120> quick

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
I'm going to actually go with the quick

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.740 
I'm going to actually go with the quick
but<00:02:29.629> choose<00:02:29.840> number<00:02:30.200> 3<00:02:30.530> here<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:32.540> is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
but choose number 3 here this is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.440 
but choose number 3 here this is
formatting<00:02:33.349> our<00:02:33.440> system<00:02:33.890> now<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:34.450> basically

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
formatting our system now and basically

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.059 
formatting our system now and basically
what's<00:02:35.780> doing<00:02:36.049> is<00:02:36.230> going<00:02:36.470> through<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.860> hard

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
what's doing is going through the hard

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.949 
what's doing is going through the hard
drive<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.879> preparing<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.690> hard

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
drive and it is preparing that hard

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.190 
drive and it is preparing that hard
drive<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.620> store<00:02:40.000> windows-based<00:02:41.000> files<00:02:41.780> and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
drive to store windows-based files and

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.300 
drive to store windows-based files and
that's<00:02:42.769> what<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.129> NTFS<00:02:43.970> file<00:02:44.390> system<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:45.310> once

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
that's what the NTFS file system is once

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.339 
that's what the NTFS file system is once
the<00:02:46.459> formatting<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.060> complete<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:47.989> going

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
the formatting is complete it's going

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.539 
the formatting is complete it's going
through<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.650> system<00:02:49.040> now<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.370> actually

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
through the system now of actually

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.210 
through the system now of actually
copying<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.450> files<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:51.019> disk<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.590> installing

copying the files to disk and installing

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.349 
copying the files to disk and installing
