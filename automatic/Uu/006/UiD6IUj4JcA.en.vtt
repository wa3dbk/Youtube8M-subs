00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
score and it does take it out because

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.520 
score and it does take it out because
class<00:02:03.180> score<00:02:03.450> doesn't<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.810> good<00:02:04.049> stress<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
class score doesn't have good stress the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.190 
class score doesn't have good stress the
fence<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.130> stuff<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.090> now<00:02:06.270> you're

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
fence and stuff like that so now you're

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.740 
fence and stuff like that so now you're
bruising<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.590> infernape<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.569> go

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
bruising this infernape and I just go

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.930 
bruising this infernape and I just go
for<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.080> size<00:02:10.800> shock<00:02:11.069> trigons<00:02:11.580> what<00:02:11.760> stands

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
for the size shock trigons what stands

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.670 
for the size shock trigons what stands
as<00:02:12.120> possible<00:02:12.630> even<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.959> special<00:02:13.380> attack

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
as possible even with a special attack

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.620 
as possible even with a special attack
drop<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.130> he<00:02:14.160> does<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.880> Mach<00:02:15.030> bunch<00:02:15.330> and

drop but he does have the Mach bunch and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.840 
drop but he does have the Mach bunch and
he<00:02:16.500> goes<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.890> block<00:02:17.100> punch<00:02:17.370> take<00:02:17.640> that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
he goes for the block punch take that

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.500 
he goes for the block punch take that
law<00:02:17.970> do<00:02:18.170> not<00:02:19.170> going<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.590> Calvillo<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:21.300> pre

law do not going to the Calvillo the pre
sharka<00:02:21.840> do<00:02:21.989> could<00:02:22.170> take<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> mock<00:02:22.680> punch<00:02:23.330> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
sharka do could take the mock punch and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.059 
sharka do could take the mock punch and
I<00:02:24.780> go<00:02:24.959> for<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.230> hydro<00:02:25.500> pump<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.830> just

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
I go for the hydro pump you just

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.030 
I go for the hydro pump you just
predicting<00:02:27.030> going<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.569> starving<00:02:27.930> here<00:02:28.200> but

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
predicting going and starving here but

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.420 
predicting going and starving here but
it<00:02:29.450> even<00:02:30.450> with<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> resist<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.620> does<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.400> same

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
it even with the resist it does the same

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.630 
it even with the resist it does the same
amount<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:32.940> damage<00:02:33.799> so<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:34.830> decided<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> go<00:02:35.519> into

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
amount of damage so I decided to go into

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.020 
amount of damage so I decided to go into
Kim<00:02:35.940> here<00:02:36.269> goes<00:02:36.569> predicting<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.319> thunderbolt

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
Kim here goes predicting a thunderbolt

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.970 
Kim here goes predicting a thunderbolt
but<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.150> does<00:02:39.299> go<00:02:39.450> psyshock<00:02:40.140> which<00:02:40.560> would<00:02:40.860> be

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
but it does go psyshock which would be

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.340 
but it does go psyshock which would be
the<00:02:41.160> obvious<00:02:41.430> choice<00:02:41.760> because<00:02:42.239> he'll<00:02:42.900> do<00:02:43.049> is

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
the obvious choice because he'll do is

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.920 
the obvious choice because he'll do is
fighting<00:02:44.100> type<00:02:44.250> as<00:02:44.430> well<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.750> wasn't

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
fighting type as well I just wasn't

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.140 
fighting type as well I just wasn't
thinking<00:02:46.019> straight<00:02:46.350> there<00:02:46.910> but<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:47.940> do

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
thinking straight there but I do

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.550 
thinking straight there but I do
off-speed<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.840> kill<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.049> with<00:02:49.140> an<00:02:49.200> outrage

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
off-speed and kill it with an outrage

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.350 
off-speed and kill it with an outrage
because<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:51.079> was<00:02:52.079> Kyra<00:02:52.410> miss<00:02:52.590> car<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:54.329> was

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
because I was Kyra miss car and I was

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.759 
because I was Kyra miss car and I was
thinking<00:02:54.480> he<00:02:54.780> was<00:02:54.959> probably<00:02:55.170> bringing<00:02:55.530> his

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
thinking he was probably bringing his

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.460 
thinking he was probably bringing his
infernape<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.640> mock<00:02:57.060> punch<00:02:57.359> me<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.870> death<00:02:58.140> but

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
infernape and mock punch me to death but

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.830 
infernape and mock punch me to death but
guess<00:02:59.190> who<00:02:59.340> brings<00:02:59.549> in<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.820> salamence<00:03:00.480> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
guess who brings in this salamence and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.120 
guess who brings in this salamence and
it<00:03:01.620> ends<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.010> being<00:03:02.070> scarf<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.530> now<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.769> go<00:03:05.070> to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
it ends up being scarf so now I go to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.509 
it ends up being scarf so now I go to
the<00:03:05.459> ox's<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.030> try<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.269> paralyze<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:08.370> that

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
the ox's to try to paralyze it so that

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.099 
the ox's to try to paralyze it so that
my<00:03:08.640> other<00:03:08.820> guys<00:03:09.030> can<00:03:09.359> take<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.840> out<00:03:09.959> without

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
my other guys can take it out without

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.729 
my other guys can take it out without
getting<00:03:10.829> hit<00:03:11.690> but<00:03:12.690> he<00:03:12.810> actually<00:03:12.959> goes<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.709> a

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
getting hit but he actually goes to a

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.450 
getting hit but he actually goes to a
Swamper<00:03:14.310> here

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
Swamper here

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.680 
Swamper here
and<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:18.560> know<00:03:18.680> doing<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.130> paralyzed<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:20.540> now<00:03:20.660> I

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
and you know doing it paralyzed so now I

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.560 
and you know doing it paralyzed so now I
just<00:03:20.720> go<00:03:20.990> for<00:03:21.020> a<00:03:21.230> nice<00:03:21.770> shading<00:03:22.220> toxic<00:03:23.210> missed

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
just go for a nice shading toxic missed

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.670 
just go for a nice shading toxic missed
the<00:03:23.810> turn<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.440> go<00:03:25.370> for<00:03:25.550> another<00:03:25.640> one<00:03:25.910> because

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the turn I go for another one because

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.220 
the turn I go for another one because
it's<00:03:27.680> pretty<00:03:28.460> low<00:03:28.580> on<00:03:28.610> health<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.180> after<00:03:30.080> that

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
it's pretty low on health and after that

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.220 
it's pretty low on health and after that
one<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.770> only<00:03:31.130> need<00:03:31.340> one<00:03:31.520> word<00:03:31.700> I<00:03:31.940> he<00:03:32.930> does<00:03:33.110> get

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
one I only need one word I he does get

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.950 
one I only need one word I he does get
the<00:03:33.350> poison<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:33.860> me<00:03:34.070> now<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.750> was<00:03:35.750> kind<00:03:35.930> of

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
the poison on me now I was kind of

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.360 
the poison on me now I was kind of
thinking<00:03:36.020> he<00:03:36.350> would<00:03:36.440> probably<00:03:36.740> protect<00:03:37.220> or

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
thinking he would probably protect or

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
thinking he would probably protect or
something<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:39.190> he<00:03:40.190> just<00:03:40.310> switches<00:03:40.730> Infernape

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
something but he just switches Infernape

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.970 
something but he just switches Infernape
here<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.870> take<00:03:42.080> some<00:03:42.290> damage<00:03:42.500> from<00:03:42.920> the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
here and take some damage from the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.750 
here and take some damage from the
nightshade<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:44.830> just<00:03:45.830> go<00:03:45.950> for<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.190> night<00:03:46.280> shade

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
nightshade and just go for a night shade

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.190 
nightshade and just go for a night shade
because<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.210> didn't<00:03:47.660> really<00:03:47.810> want<00:03:47.960> to<00:03:47.990> switch

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
because I didn't really want to switch

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.410 
because I didn't really want to switch
into<00:03:48.320> someone<00:03:48.770> else<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.040> take<00:03:49.190> have<00:03:50.180> them<00:03:50.270> take

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
into someone else to take have them take

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.210 
into someone else to take have them take
damage<00:03:50.660> but<00:03:51.020> he<00:03:51.080> goes<00:03:51.320> for<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.530> u-turn<00:03:51.890> here

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
damage but he goes for the u-turn here

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.730 
damage but he goes for the u-turn here
and<00:03:52.430> brings<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.540> his<00:03:53.660> salad<00:03:53.990> mask<00:03:54.200> which<00:03:54.470> takes

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
and brings in his salad mask which takes

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.370 
and brings in his salad mask which takes
delferahk<00:03:55.190> damage<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:55.880> then<00:03:56.380> nightshade

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
delferahk damage and then nightshade
