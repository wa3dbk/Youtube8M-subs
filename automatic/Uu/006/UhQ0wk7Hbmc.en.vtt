wasn't too patient and I just couldn't

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.550 
wasn't too patient and I just couldn't
wait<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.120> rip<00:00:15.269> into<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.630> box<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.199> I've<00:00:16.440> been

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
wait to rip into the box but I've been

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.109

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
it might keep it a secret it makes it a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.630 
it might keep it a secret it makes it a
little<00:00:40.200> bit<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:41.070> bit<00:00:41.160> easier<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.520> a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
really really small this is uh this is

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.369 
really really small this is uh this is
really<00:02:48.280> small<00:02:48.340> actually<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.780> comparison<00:02:50.349> to

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
really small actually in comparison to

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.839 
really small actually in comparison to
the<00:02:50.560> resilience<00:02:51.129> which<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.459> last<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:51.760> I

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
the resilience which is the last one I

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.330 
the resilience which is the last one I
got<00:02:51.879> which<00:02:52.239> is<00:02:52.359> extremely<00:02:52.840> huge<00:02:53.260> but<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.950> know

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
got which is extremely huge but you know

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.180 
got which is extremely huge but you know
really<00:02:54.760> really<00:02:54.940> nice<00:02:55.120> shape<00:02:55.420> here<00:02:56.019> is<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.470> the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
really really nice shape here is the the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.670 
really really nice shape here is the the
tenacious<00:02:57.459> now<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.420> know<00:02:58.599> there's<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.560> know

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
tenacious now I know there's a you know

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.050 
tenacious now I know there's a you know
obviously<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.099> persistence<00:03:00.640> which<00:03:00.790> would<00:03:00.970> be

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
obviously the persistence which would be

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.729 
obviously the persistence which would be
in<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.269> middle<00:03:01.390> in<00:03:01.599> between<00:03:01.870> these<00:03:02.019> two<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.500> a

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
in the middle in between these two but a

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.369 
in the middle in between these two but a
majority<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.430> people<00:03:03.670> do<00:03:03.879> have<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.780> tenacious

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
majority of people do have a tenacious

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.589 
majority of people do have a tenacious
and<00:03:05.859> know<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.129> size<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:07.239> know<00:03:07.329> this<00:03:07.480> will

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
and know the size so you know this will

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.990 
and know the size so you know this will
give<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.900> good<00:03:08.019> size<00:03:08.230> comparison<00:03:09.000> really

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
give you a good size comparison really

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.970 
give you a good size comparison really
small<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.690> comparison<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:11.500> know<00:03:11.560> even<00:03:11.859> though

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
small in comparison you know even though

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.430 
small in comparison you know even though
there's<00:03:12.159> like<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.730> said<00:03:12.909> a<00:03:12.940> third<00:03:13.930> one<00:03:14.140> in<00:03:14.260> there

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
there's like I said a third one in there

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.069 
there's like I said a third one in there
but<00:03:14.709> really<00:03:15.640> good<00:03:15.819> really<00:03:16.180> nice<00:03:16.359> this<00:03:16.900> is

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
but really good really nice this is

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.330 
but really good really nice this is
definitely<00:03:17.349> something<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.859> would<00:03:18.069> use

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
definitely something that I would use

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.300 
definitely something that I would use
let's<00:03:18.880> say<00:03:19.000> if<00:03:19.060> I'm<00:03:19.239> wearing<00:03:19.769> thin<00:03:20.769> shorts

right
obviously<00:06:19.330> by<00:06:19.450> way<00:06:19.630> of<00:06:19.660> comparison<00:06:20.140> as<00:06:20.380> I

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
obviously by way of comparison as I

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.630 
obviously by way of comparison as I
always<00:06:20.650> try<00:06:20.950> and<00:06:21.040> do<00:06:21.190> it<00:06:21.340> this<00:06:21.460> is<00:06:21.520> the

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
obviously a tad bit smaller as far as

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.550 
obviously a tad bit smaller as far as
size<00:06:32.800> goes<00:06:33.130> you<00:06:33.670> know<00:06:33.790> handle<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:34.540> blade<00:06:34.750> I'll

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
size goes you know handle and blade I'll

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
guys can see so you know almost a

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.310 
guys can see so you know almost a
scaled-down<00:06:40.090> version<00:06:40.150> I

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
scaled-down version I

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.500 
scaled-down version I
see<00:06:41.440> this<00:06:41.530> one<00:06:41.710> has<00:06:41.800> a<00:06:41.860> liner<00:06:42.160> lock<00:06:42.400> but<00:06:43.150> as<00:06:43.300> far

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
see this one has a liner lock but as far

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.170 
see this one has a liner lock but as far
as<00:06:43.540> width<00:06:44.380> and<00:06:44.800> just<00:06:45.310> everything<00:06:45.730> it's<00:06:45.940> it's

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 
assuming that's why a lot of a lot more

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.690 
assuming that's why a lot of a lot more
people<00:07:19.540> favor<00:07:20.290> this<00:07:20.590> particular<00:07:21.040> style<00:07:21.310> and

definitely does stick out a lot so it

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.820 
definitely does stick out a lot so it
rides<00:07:32.950> really<00:07:33.810> thick<00:07:34.810> in<00:07:35.050> the<00:07:35.230> pocket<00:07:35.680> you
