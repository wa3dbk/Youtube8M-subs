00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:12.750
 people here at gaming hh for the second 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.690
 weapons guide finally comes the times 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.539
 this time from the pioneer and first 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.240
 comes the hks 74 then come still m41 k 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.890
 h &amp; m 4 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.240
 and then the weapons I get 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 Actually you have only played now 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.570
 I did not play correctly 291 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.300
 and g 36 c there is a difference to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.420
 last weapons guide and indeed we have 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.879
 this time the magazine size is still installed 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.760
 I know now that we are on the pc 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.920
 battlefield game that the weapon gang 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.289
 not really much for pc 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.750
 why say it again it is for the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:59.399
 ps3 thought so it goes off then 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.890
 with the ak 74 the aks 74 I have just 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.800
 forget it because that is a weapon 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.650
 which has car celebration and single shot though 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.150
 none of the fire fire rate is 650 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.040
 Full average 1 click range 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.979
 medium for drive the organic 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.560
 together and has a magazine size of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.329
 30 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.040
 here in recoil you can see 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.780
 actually a pretty normal weapon 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.399
 recoil just does not give high 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.100
 any rip-offs to the right 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.930
 or on the left you can actually quite well 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.880
 I can control it anyway 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.829
 Not 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.479
 this is what the female and the young are talking about 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.479
 then it continues with the next 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:46.290
 week yes and that would be the m41 that is 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.110
 this example for the initial weapon 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.909
 whatever the cosmo has the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.700
 exactly the same is the difference 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.530
 the fire rate with the same high 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.570
 reach and same magazine size 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.640
 that means, according to magazine fast empty 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.049
 shot 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.000
 I did not understand that either 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.560
 I can not say anything about it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.049
 I usually always have some pd 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.869
 Weapons played but rebound here 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.150
 you can see that the rebound slightly 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.630
 on the upper right goes away and not there after 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.000
 above 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.310
 like the Russians are 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.310
 go directly to the next week 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.720
 and that would be kh that's the first one 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.610
 I really like to gamble for gamblers 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.490
 I know a little bit more like that 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.320
 out of the head now has no again 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.870
 Best celebration the other two shows modes 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.360
 which has a firing rate of 600 something 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.500
 I think it's pretty slow 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.640
 reach again in the middle and one 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.920
 twenties magazine size which i very much 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.510
 small I find do not know whether the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.239
 magazine extension is now available 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.830
 remains the last patch but we have 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.690
 they did not gamble as much as they did 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.630
 just gambled for the mission and yes 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.850
 the recoil, you can see that they are so 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.350
 The string is still pulled straight up 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.030
 recoilless which is very cool is normal is 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.900
 you always all on the left and so on 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.700
 I do not remember 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:12.120
 I think they are really nice 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:15.450
 and then from the next watch there 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.550
 is the m4 that is, so to speak, the m41 only 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.250
 that she does not have a car driver but 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.320
 Instead, burst celebration has just that 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.620
 same values ​​everything is just the same 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.660
 recoil is in burst celebration is sure 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.130
 funny you can not do that much together 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.980
 is actually exactly the same as the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.799
 m41 I never really play with burst 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.620
 celebration except somehow for extreme 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.790
 distance if I'm somewhere behind 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.970
 laserpointer see because I'm with times 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.709
 burst on it because otherwise not so 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.030
 there is not much to say and then 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.670
 also directly with the next 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.209
 week 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.970
 yes that would be the a 91 has again 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.209
 everything except burst bursting fire rate of 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.299
 800 range medium magazine largest 30 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.090
 is actually just like the m41 the 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.100
 I've been looking for a lot because 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.840
 been at the beginning of the right way 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.880
 and I thought you just have to be horny 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.079
 so i drew her she got me right 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.269
 looking forward to seeing her 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.100
 unlocked came also quite well 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.269
 Clearly cleared but really big 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.970
 I have not with it and yes recoil is 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.310
 for a relatively straight up a bit 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.889
 then go left but you do not feel 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.499
 and then 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:34.580
 also for the last weapon the g36 c 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:36.949
 The G36 10 has all the fire modes a bit 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.889
 slower rate of fire with 7 50 euro than 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.680
 the other weapon in addition to reach 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.139
 medium and also in the magazine size of 30 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.939
 I think the weapon is very cool I have 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.930
 you also as softer if you first 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:55.460
 so recoil goes a little lower 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.409
 on the right side, but I think it's a small one 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.520
 who was already the best pioneer for 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.289
 I think probably 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.310
 so you turn them on as well 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:06.830
 Last free I would say that was it 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.909
 from the weapons was until next time at 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.909
