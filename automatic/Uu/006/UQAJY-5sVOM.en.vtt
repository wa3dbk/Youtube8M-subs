some plants so I'm going to take kind of
a<00:00:31.560> simple<00:00:31.920> approach<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.550> these<00:00:32.669> baskets<00:00:33.450> just

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
a simple approach to these baskets just

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.479 
a simple approach to these baskets just
a<00:00:33.960> few<00:00:34.230> different<00:00:34.410> selections<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.190> plants

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
a few different selections of plants

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.560 
a few different selections of plants
instead<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.850> whole<00:00:36.030> bunch<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.300> different

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
instead of a whole bunch of different

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.080 
instead of a whole bunch of different
kinds<00:00:36.989> these<00:00:37.410> baskets<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.219> Sun<00:00:38.489> until<00:00:38.670> about

2:00 or so in the afternoon so I'm going
to<00:00:40.890> use<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> mixture<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> shade<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.390> Sun<00:00:42.570> plants

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to use a mixture of shade and Sun plants

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.389 
to use a mixture of shade and Sun plants
I<00:00:43.050> love<00:00:43.290> planters<00:00:43.710> where<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.160> kind<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
I love planters where you can kind of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.430 
I love planters where you can kind of
blur<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> lines<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.969> little<00:00:45.059> bit<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> first

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
blur the lines a little bit the first

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.170 
blur the lines a little bit the first
plant<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> use<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:47.550> centerpiece

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
plant I'm going to use as my centerpiece

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.150 
plant I'm going to use as my centerpiece
is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> hardy<00:00:49.050> white<00:00:49.230> calla<00:00:49.500> lily<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.070> they're

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
is a hardy white calla lily and they're

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
is a hardy white calla lily and they're
actually<00:00:50.340> Hardy<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> negative<00:00:51.329> ten<00:00:51.570> usually

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
actually Hardy to negative ten usually

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.260 
actually Hardy to negative ten usually
in<00:00:52.500> my<00:00:52.649> area<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> plant<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.850> zone<00:00:54.030> 5

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
in my area you have to plant a zone 5

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.299 
in my area you have to plant a zone 5
plant<00:00:54.600> which<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.750> Hardy<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> negative<00:00:55.530> 20<00:00:55.829> so

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
plant which is Hardy to negative 20 so

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.069 
plant which is Hardy to negative 20 so
I'm<00:00:56.370> hoping<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.879> fall<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.300> pop<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
I'm hoping this fall to pop this out of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.510 
I'm hoping this fall to pop this out of
this<00:00:58.199> planter<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.829> plant<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
this planter and plant it out in the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.889 
this planter and plant it out in the
landscape<00:00:59.940> and<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.239> mulch<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.719> really

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
landscape and then mulch it up really

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.209 
landscape and then mulch it up really
good<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.140> I'm<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> hope<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.070> it

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
good and I'm going to hope that it

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.979 
good and I'm going to hope that it
survives<00:01:02.550> we'll<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.090> it'll<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> fun

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
survives we'll see it'll be a fun

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.570 
survives we'll see it'll be a fun
experiment<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
experiment but this is going to be the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.300 
experiment but this is going to be the
centerpiece<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.510> middle

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.310 

I<00:01:09.340> like<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.240> rough<00:01:10.420> up<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.690> roots<00:01:10.869> just<00:01:11.229> a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
I like to rough up the roots just a

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.080 
I like to rough up the roots just a
little<00:01:11.560> bit<00:01:11.710> on<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.310> plants<00:01:12.580> that<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:12.729> put<00:01:12.970> in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
little bit on the plants that I put in

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.490 
little bit on the plants that I put in
here<00:01:13.119> and<00:01:13.450> kind<00:01:13.600> of<00:01:13.659> break<00:01:13.840> that<00:01:13.869> root<00:01:14.200> memory

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
here and kind of break that root memory

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.800 
here and kind of break that root memory
for<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.340> sides<00:01:15.670> I'm<00:01:16.119> going<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.330> actually<00:01:16.780> use

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
for the sides I'm going to actually use

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.270 
for the sides I'm going to actually use
a<00:01:17.140> hoe<00:01:17.530> Connick<00:01:17.890> Chloe

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
a hoe Connick Chloe

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.730 
a hoe Connick Chloe
which<00:01:18.400> is<00:01:18.549> a<00:01:18.580> perennial<00:01:18.960> shade<00:01:19.960> grass<00:01:20.259> and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
which is a perennial shade grass and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.320 
which is a perennial shade grass and
it's<00:01:21.159> one<00:01:21.280> of<00:01:21.340> my<00:01:21.430> favorite<00:01:21.700> shade<00:01:21.909> grasses

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
it's one of my favorite shade grasses

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.570 
it's one of my favorite shade grasses
and<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:22.750> use<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:22.960> in<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.290> ton<00:01:23.500> of<00:01:23.530> planters<00:01:24.400> and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
and I use it in a ton of planters and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.370 
and I use it in a ton of planters and
I'm<00:01:24.700> actually<00:01:24.850> using<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.420> more<00:01:25.930> implanted

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
I'm actually using it more implanted

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.630 
I'm actually using it more implanted
this<00:01:26.500> year<00:01:26.680> because<00:01:26.830> I<00:01:26.950> have<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.159> spot<00:01:27.460> out<00:01:27.610> in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
this year because I have a spot out in

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.280 
this year because I have a spot out in
my<00:01:27.850> yard<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.210> I<00:01:28.270> actually<00:01:28.390> want<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.810> big<00:01:28.990> drift

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290

gorgeous
I<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.780> them<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.650> only

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
I really like them but this is the only

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.230 
I really like them but this is the only
other<00:01:59.130> plant<00:01:59.460> I'm<00:01:59.580> going<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> use<00:01:59.940> in<00:02:00.150> this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
other plant I'm going to use in this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.780 
other plant I'm going to use in this
container<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.830> by<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.220> using<00:02:02.610> three

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
container I think by just using three

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.719 
container I think by just using three
plants<00:02:03.150> it<00:02:03.330> gives<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:04.020> simplistic

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
plants it gives it kind of a simplistic

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.240 
plants it gives it kind of a simplistic
kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.820> more<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> clean<00:02:06.630> look<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.470> also

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
kind of more of a clean look and also

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.699 
kind of more of a clean look and also
I'm<00:02:08.819> not<00:02:08.880> Jam<00:02:09.569> packing<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.080> full<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.530> plants

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
I'm not Jam packing these full of plants

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.290 
I'm not Jam packing these full of plants
like<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.100> with<00:02:11.310> my<00:02:11.489> fall<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.760> spring

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
like I do with my fall and spring

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.180 
like I do with my fall and spring
planters<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.200> everything<00:02:13.590> has<00:02:13.739> room<00:02:14.040> to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
planters so that everything has room to

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.280 
planters so that everything has room to
grow<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.580> expand<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.810> spring<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.230> fall

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
grow and expand in the spring and fall

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.500 
grow and expand in the spring and fall
I'm<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:16.709> too<00:02:16.860> worried<00:02:17.130> about<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.550> because

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
I'm not too worried about that because

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.080 
I'm not too worried about that because
usually<00:02:19.290> when<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:19.980> plant<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.400> spring<00:02:20.700> they're

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
usually when I plant the spring they're

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.670 
usually when I plant the spring they're
not<00:02:21.239> in<00:02:21.360> there<00:02:21.480> long<00:02:21.660> before<00:02:21.690> I'm<00:02:22.080> replanting

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
not in there long before I'm replanting

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.470 
not in there long before I'm replanting
them<00:02:22.739> for<00:02:22.980> summer<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.489> in<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:23.970> fall<00:02:24.090> it's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
them for summer and in the fall it's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.540 
them for summer and in the fall it's
cooling<00:02:24.720> down<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.230> much<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.440> they<00:02:26.190> don't<00:02:26.310> put

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
cooling down so much that they don't put

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.610 
cooling down so much that they don't put
on<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> ton<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:26.970> growth<00:02:27.180> anyway<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.630> summer<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
on a ton of growth anyway so summer is

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.050 
on a ton of growth anyway so summer is
the<00:02:28.769> only<00:02:29.070> season<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.489> really<00:02:29.519> worry<00:02:29.970> about

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
the only season I really worry about

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.470 
the only season I really worry about
keeping<00:02:30.540> some<00:02:31.140> good<00:02:31.320> fakes<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.830> there<00:02:32.480> really

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
keeping some good fakes in there really

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.120 
keeping some good fakes in there really
