00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
of these little antennas here that can

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.519 
of these little antennas here that can

you just get hub ghost but I went ahead

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.730 
you just get hub ghost but I went ahead
and<00:01:50.520> got<00:01:50.610> three<00:01:51.049> just<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.320> more<00:01:52.530> sure
