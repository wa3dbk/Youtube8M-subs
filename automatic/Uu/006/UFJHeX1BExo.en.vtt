00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and this is the product and then this is

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.799 
and this is the product and then this is
a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.649> applicator<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.739> comes<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.309> it

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
a little applicator that comes with it

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.209 
a little applicator that comes with it
and<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:48.960> kind<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.350> salah'<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.039> guess

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and it's kind of like a salah' I guess

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.799 
and it's kind of like a salah' I guess
that's<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> best<00:00:50.760> way<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.059> describe<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.629> so

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that's the best way I can describe it so

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.350 
that's the best way I can describe it so
it's<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.110> solid<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.489> when<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.120> can't

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it's a solid and then when you can't

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.520 
it's a solid and then when you can't
really<00:00:54.480> see<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:54.989> finger<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
really see it on your finger when you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.920 
really see it on your finger when you
put<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.940> kind<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.510> dries

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
put it on and then it kind of dries

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.430 
put it on and then it kind of dries
really<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:58.920> fast<00:00:59.219> too<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> powdery

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
really really fast too like a powdery

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.779 
really really fast too like a powdery
texture<00:01:01.440> almost<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.460> really

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
texture almost so it's really really

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.179 
texture almost so it's really really
different<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.239> unique<00:01:03.680> like<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.799> said<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.070> think

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
different and unique like I said I think

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.359 
different and unique like I said I think
it's<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.930> amazing<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it's just amazing so what you do with it

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.520 
it's just amazing so what you do with it
is<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.729> put<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.689> face<00:01:09.930> before<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
put your foundation on and then you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
put your foundation on and then you

the whole rest of the day I do like

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.130 
the whole rest of the day I do like
using<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.150> pad<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> comes<00:01:21.990> with

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
using the little pad that it comes with

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710 
using the little pad that it comes with
I'm<00:01:22.530> using<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.310> brush<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.659> don't

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
I'm using a brush and with this I don't

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.480 
I'm using a brush and with this I don't
know<00:01:25.259> how<00:01:25.290> well<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.860> work<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
know how well it would work because I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.399 
know how well it would work because I
think<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> little<00:01:27.420> patchy<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.200> I

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
think it would be a little patchy and I

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.289 
think it would be a little patchy and I
don't<00:01:28.799> know<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.820> brushes

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
all up in this texture of the stuff but

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.120 
all up in this texture of the stuff but
the<00:01:33.810> pad<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.350> comes<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.619> does<00:01:34.920> work

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the pad that it comes with does work

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.330 
the pad that it comes with does work
really<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:35.670> good<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:37.049> put<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.890> put<00:01:38.220> your

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
really really good so put it on put your

makeup on and you're good to go

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.770 
makeup on and you're good to go
I've<00:01:40.170> had<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.729> for<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:42.210> hours<00:01:42.240> now

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
I've had it on for about two hours now

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170 
I've had it on for about two hours now
and<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.259> think<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:43.619> still<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.670> really

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and I think I'm still really really

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 
and I think I'm still really really
pretty<00:01:45.960> matte<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.100> pretty<00:01:47.250> matte

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
pretty matte really really pretty matte

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.889 
pretty matte really really pretty matte
yeah<00:01:47.850> okay<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:48.960> pretty<00:01:49.290> matte<00:01:49.500> still<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> think

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
yeah okay I'm pretty matte still I think

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.719 
yeah okay I'm pretty matte still I think
and<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.560> put<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> test<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and I have put it to the test for like a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.670 
and I have put it to the test for like a
full<00:01:54.060> day's<00:01:54.329> worth<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.750> makeup<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.350> feel

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
full day's worth of makeup and I feel

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.429 
full day's worth of makeup and I feel
that<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.009> definitely<00:01:56.930> can<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> talk<00:01:58.229> tonight

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that it definitely can I talk tonight

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.249 
that it definitely can I talk tonight
can<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.799> talk<00:01:59.009> ever<00:01:59.219> really<00:01:59.700> no<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.110> think<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
can I talk ever really no I think that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.139 
can I talk ever really no I think that
it<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.530> really<00:02:02.009> does<00:02:02.189> last<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.729> day<00:02:02.939> long

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
it really really does last all day long

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.590 
it really really does last all day long
which<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.600> awesome<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.710> then<00:02:05.219> another<00:02:06.180> thing

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600

which is awesome and then another thing

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
actually layer it on top of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
actually layer it on top of
your<00:02:12.030> makeup<00:02:12.360> I've<00:02:12.810> only<00:02:13.020> done<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> couple

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
your makeup I've only done that a couple

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.010 
your makeup I've only done that a couple
of<00:02:13.890> times<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.640> does<00:02:14.850> transfer<00:02:15.720> some<00:02:15.900> of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
of times and it does transfer some of

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.320 
of times and it does transfer some of
your<00:02:16.140> foundation<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> pad<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.790> keep

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
your foundation on to the pad so keep

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.760 
your foundation on to the pad so keep
that<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.570> mind<00:02:18.690> mine's<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.200> little<00:02:19.410> dirty<00:02:19.650> now

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
that in mind mine's a little dirty now

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.240 
that in mind mine's a little dirty now
because<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.590> think<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:23.160> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
because of that and I think that if you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.100 
because of that and I think that if you
kept<00:02:23.460> layering<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.150> top<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.690> your

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
kept layering it on top of your

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.720 
kept layering it on top of your
foundation<00:02:25.260> multiple<00:02:26.040> times<00:02:26.280> throughout<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
foundation multiple times throughout the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.370 
foundation multiple times throughout the
day<00:02:26.760> would<00:02:27.180> start<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.570> look<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.810> little<00:02:27.900> cakey

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
day would start to look a little cakey

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.170 
day would start to look a little cakey
and<00:02:28.530> get<00:02:28.680> really<00:02:28.920> really<00:02:29.130> heavy<00:02:29.400> otherwise

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
and get really really heavy otherwise

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.490 
and get really really heavy otherwise
this<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.570> really<00:02:30.900> nice<00:02:31.080> lightweight

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
this is a really nice lightweight

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.010 
this is a really nice lightweight
formula<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.330> keep<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.570> in<00:02:33.630> mind<00:02:33.750> if

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
formula but just keep that in mind if

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.450 
formula but just keep that in mind if
you<00:02:34.110> were<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.410> like<00:02:34.560> keep<00:02:34.890> building<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.310> up

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
you were to like keep building it up

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.980 
you were to like keep building it up
though<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> don't<00:02:35.850> think<00:02:36.030> you'd<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.540> need

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
though I don't think you'd really need

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.840 
though I don't think you'd really need
to<00:02:37.200> unless<00:02:37.500> you're<00:02:37.650> super<00:02:38.130> super<00:02:38.310> oily

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
to unless you're super super oily

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.150 
to unless you're super super oily
because<00:02:39.000> one<00:02:39.870> application<00:02:40.500> before<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.860> put<00:02:41.100> my

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
because one application before I put my

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.980 
because one application before I put my
foundation<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.970> really<00:02:42.360> all<00:02:42.510> I've<00:02:42.750> ever

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
foundation on is really all I've ever

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.920 
foundation on is really all I've ever
needed<00:02:43.460> but<00:02:44.460> I'm<00:02:44.610> not<00:02:44.730> super<00:02:45.180> oily<00:02:45.360> anymore<00:02:45.900> I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
needed but I'm not super oily anymore I

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.210 
needed but I'm not super oily anymore I
used<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.530> when<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.710> was<00:02:46.770> younger<00:02:47.130> and

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
used to be when I was younger and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.280 
used to be when I was younger and
especially<00:02:47.610> no<00:02:47.910> because<00:02:48.240> it's<00:02:48.450> been<00:02:48.870> colder

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
especially no because it's been colder

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.420 
especially no because it's been colder
and<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> winter<00:02:49.830> time<00:02:50.130> I'm<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> little

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and it's the winter time I'm a little

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.250 
and it's the winter time I'm a little
bit<00:02:50.880> more<00:02:51.090> dry<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.720> have<00:02:51.900> been<00:02:52.080> pretty

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
bit more dry and I have been pretty

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.060 
bit more dry and I have been pretty
flate<00:02:52.620> flaky<00:02:53.490> but<00:02:54.300> um<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.680> held<00:02:55.920> up

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
flate flaky but um this is held up

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.780 
flate flaky but um this is held up
really<00:02:56.370> really<00:02:56.550> well

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
really really well

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.060 
really really well
so<00:02:57.060> I'm<00:02:57.180> kind<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.450> normal<00:02:58.110> combo<00:02:58.560> skin<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.920> would

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
so I'm kind of normal combo skin I would

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.250 
so I'm kind of normal combo skin I would
say<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.580> do<00:02:59.820> get<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> little<00:03:00.210> bit<00:03:00.420> oily<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.840> here

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
say I do get a little bit oily in here

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.480 
say I do get a little bit oily in here
and<00:03:01.380> then<00:03:01.470> down<00:03:01.620> my<00:03:01.740> nose<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.100> like<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.340> inner

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
and then down my nose and like the inner

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
face is pretty dry um so yeah I think

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.620 
face is pretty dry um so yeah I think
that's<00:03:08.430> all<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.580> want<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.910> say<00:03:09.030> about<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.330> um

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
that's all I want to say about it um

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.990 
that's all I want to say about it um
just<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.710> just<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.040> real<00:03:11.190> quick<00:03:11.430> review<00:03:11.610> but

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
just so just a real quick review but

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.670 
just so just a real quick review but
this<00:03:12.150> stuff<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.660> said<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:13.020> really<00:03:13.470> really

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
this stuff like I said is really really

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.010 
this stuff like I said is really really
great<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.160> think<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.580> definitely<00:03:14.970> works<00:03:15.210> just

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
great I think it definitely works just

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.040 
great I think it definitely works just
as<00:03:16.170> well<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.620> not<00:03:16.680> even<00:03:17.160> better<00:03:17.550> than<00:03:18.020> like<00:03:19.020> a

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
as well if not even better than like a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.460 
as well if not even better than like a
high-end<00:03:20.030> primer<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.480> used<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.840> smashbox

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
high-end primer like I used the smashbox

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.500 
high-end primer like I used the smashbox
one<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.310> i<00:03:23.370> really<00:03:23.700> really<00:03:23.850> liked<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.120> one

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
one and i really really liked that one

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.449 
one and i really really liked that one
but<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.110> think<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.680> might<00:03:25.890> even<00:03:26.130> be<00:03:26.430> better

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
but I think this might even be better

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.699 
but I think this might even be better
this<00:03:26.970> one<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.480> know<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.080> one<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.230> think<00:03:28.500> just

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
this one I know that one I think just

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.470 
this one I know that one I think just
it's<00:03:29.100> not<00:03:29.280> supposed<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.580> keep<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.910> mad<00:03:30.090> just

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
it's not supposed to keep you mad just

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.060 
it's not supposed to keep you mad just
supposed<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.810> keep<00:03:30.930> your<00:03:31.080> makeup<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.040> place

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
but this one I feel does keep your

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.370 
but this one I feel does keep your
makeup<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.560> place<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.950> keeps<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.280> very<00:03:35.310> very
