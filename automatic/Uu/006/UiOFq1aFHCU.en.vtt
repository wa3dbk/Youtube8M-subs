00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:24.029
 so what is going on people here and today 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.450
 again with the topic to the body 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.489
 health and indeed has a wonder 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.739
 I read on facebook to 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.480
 he has brought this topic 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.149
 So wrote my friend scott video 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 he saw that 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.980
 strangely, always with the warmup 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.710
 So put in the warmup very extreme 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.079
 has knee pain and then suddenly 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.730
 from record to record it gets better and 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.460
 put the heavy then did not feel 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.079
 nothing more and the next day is all 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.989
 is gone you have it really only ever 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.089
 in the beginning it is extremely imitating 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.620
 as always painful in the beginning people 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.019
 and it's actually very very very 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.730
 simple if you look like this 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.250
 joints are built to and how they 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.500
 do the joints have that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.960
 getting this joint fluid, the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.070
 joint dope and is 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.530
 excreted 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.480
 if they are charged accordingly 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.360
 that is, a healthy load a 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.290
 a healthy burden on these joints 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.300
 is even of advantage and persisted 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.250
 one of a healthy functioning 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.120
 body work body that is 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.430
 Actually, I am saying this 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.130
 fitness training even very healthy for 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.320
 The joints also bodybuilding came a lot 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.910
 be healthy for the joints provided 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.890
 It does not exaggerate with the weight or 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.570
 just all wrapped technics 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.610
 that is, every time now for 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.310
 for example 150 kilo or 100 kilo 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.440
 makes it squat and it puts pressure on the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.050
 joints are then these joints 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.460
 automatically also more resistant it 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.530
 is actually like the muscle too 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.600
 these joints stronger and stronger 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.600
 Eating is directed by a bodybuilder 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.670
 After five years of training, if you can see 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.830
 has done a lot even right 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.990
 Stable outside steered by a guy 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.789
 who has never trained what is 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.280
 Of course it can be that it is 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.250
 overloaded that too much 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.660
 load too much stress or has begrudge 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.220
 also because of the nutrition 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.400
 not optimal 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.560
 or is a sorry that structured 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.770
 Just stop according to this 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.300
 joint fluid does not reproduce 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.010
 fast enough there's also the 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.590
 we have supplements there now 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.450
 profile is also Pole released the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.370
 in my eyes of that 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.040
 most advanced supplement on the market 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.380
 currently six times off manganese 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.570
 with glucosamine and the whole course 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.790
 100% vegan that means no harm 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.570
 Animals will be there in this assortment 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.920
 Use and use these joints 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.040
 she refuses she does not do anything 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.690
 other than the joint production the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.790
 crank lubrication production crank 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.430
 and speed up 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.430
 that means it came for top athletes 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.830
 be extremely beneficial from a so 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.470
 joint supplements to come to do so 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.730
 to get some time and that's best for 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.100
 at least three months 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.720
 I even recommend it for half a year 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.980
 just notice that long-term 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.140
 Use this case when it comes to 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.959
 brings a lot more than short-term 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.280
 is also then the long-term effect 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.650
 that is, if you look so times as a 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.060
 Rhine cow and half a year then pulls 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.440
 you can assume that you too 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.480
 has rest for a few years now 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.150
 as long as you give then again everything 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.870
 that's right, it makes you bend properly 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.030
 you do everything right and deadlift 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.040
 the foundation and let in muscle 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.080
 that is not healthy fitness training 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.730
 usually should anyway anyway 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.920
 not a problem for everyone 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.540
 athletes do it once 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.250
 have had little knee problems or 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.019
 got and it was not easy 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.420
 so going away I can either 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.220
 Recommend insert with small break 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.030
 time to go to the doctor maybe or 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.190
 just preventively the lubricant too 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.709
