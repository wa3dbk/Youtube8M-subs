going to be teaching you guys how to fly
a<00:00:02.639> helicopter<00:00:02.879> in<00:00:03.419> battlefield<00:00:03.929> 4<00:00:03.990> actually

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
a helicopter in battlefield 4 actually

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.019 
a helicopter in battlefield 4 actually
learned<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.890> little<00:00:05.040> bit<00:00:05.160> ago<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.609> decided<00:00:05.850> I

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
learned a little bit ago and decided I

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.430 
learned a little bit ago and decided I
would<00:00:06.089> make<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.299> tutorial<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.960> teach<00:00:07.080> you<00:00:07.259> how

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
would make a tutorial and teach you how

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.810 
would make a tutorial and teach you how
I<00:00:07.470> learn<00:00:07.830> because<00:00:07.980> it's<00:00:08.220> actually<00:00:08.340> pretty

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
I learn because it's actually pretty

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.700 
I learn because it's actually pretty
simple<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.389> learn<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:10.170> what<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.440> want<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.620> do

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
simple to learn so what you want to do

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.169 
simple to learn so what you want to do
is<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.830> want<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.130> load<00:00:11.280> up<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.580> test<00:00:11.849> range

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
is you want to load up the test range

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.180 
is you want to load up the test range
and<00:00:12.420> then<00:00:12.509> go<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.230> little<00:00:13.559> bird<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:14.130> you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and then go on the little bird now you

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.799 
and then go on the little bird now you
can<00:00:14.370> fly<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.880> other<00:00:15.000> helicopters<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:15.780> i

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
can fly with the other helicopters but i

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.300 
can fly with the other helicopters but i
recommend<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.500> learn<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.949> little<00:00:17.190> bird

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
recommend you learn with the little bird

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189 
recommend you learn with the little bird
first<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:17.820> it's<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.119> easiest<00:00:18.210> one<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
first because it's the easiest one to to

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.990 
first because it's the easiest one to to
get<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> hang<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.400> now<00:00:20.520> we're<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> go

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
get the hang of so now we're going to go

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.460 
get the hang of so now we're going to go
over<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.330> controls<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.080> there's<00:00:22.320> two

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
over the controls so there's two

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.750 
over the controls so there's two
controls<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> mainly<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.580> need

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
controls that you mainly really need

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.700 
controls that you mainly really need
that<00:00:23.789> use<00:00:24.119> its<00:00:24.390> left<00:00:24.810> thumbstick<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that use its left thumbstick and the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.870 
that use its left thumbstick and the
right<00:00:25.859> thumbstick<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.490> we're<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> go

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
right thumbstick so we're going to go

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.609 
right thumbstick so we're going to go
over<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> last<00:00:27.269> left<00:00:27.840> thumbstick<00:00:28.140> first

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
over the last left thumbstick first

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.160 
over the last left thumbstick first
going<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.519> pushing<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> left<00:00:30.929> some

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
going up pushing up on the left some

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.229 
going up pushing up on the left some
stick<00:00:31.590> will<00:00:31.800> make<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.070> go<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.399> pushing<00:00:33.030> down

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
stick will make you go up pushing down

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.270 
stick will make you go up pushing down
will<00:00:33.420> make<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:33.840> down<00:00:34.079> pushing<00:00:34.680> right<00:00:35.010> will

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
will make you go down pushing right will

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.819 
will make you go down pushing right will
make<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.610> spin<00:00:36.000> right<00:00:36.840> you're<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.410> spinning

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
make you spin right you're just spinning

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.040 
make you spin right you're just spinning
and<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.489> pushing<00:00:38.820> left<00:00:39.059> will<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.570> spin

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
and then pushing left will make you spin

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.780 
and then pushing left will make you spin
left<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.800> spin<00:00:40.980> around<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.579> spin

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
left so you spin around right and spin

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
left so you spin around right and spin
around<00:00:41.879> left<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.480> that's<00:00:42.600> mainly<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
around left and that's mainly all you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.779 
around left and that's mainly all you
need<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.280> left<00:00:44.460> analog<00:00:44.610> stick

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
need to know for the left analog stick

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.270 
need to know for the left analog stick
it's<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> movement<00:00:46.050> now<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:46.980> analog

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it's for a movement now the right analog

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.520 
it's for a movement now the right analog
stick<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:48.180> will<00:00:48.600> fly<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.350> push

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
stick will will will fly up if you push

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.080 
stick will will will fly up if you push
it<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.039> go<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.370> third<00:00:50.579> person<00:00:50.820> which

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it in you can go on a third person which

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.490 
it in you can go on a third person which
you<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.360> need<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.780> fly<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.170> third<00:00:52.350> person

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
you don't need to fly in third person

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.380 
you don't need to fly in third person
but<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.949> would<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
but if you would like to you can if you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
but if you would like to you can if you
push<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.320> analog<00:00:55.680> stick<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
push up on the right analog stick you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.889 
push up on the right analog stick you
will<00:00:56.399> point<00:00:57.120> down<00:00:57.360> you'll<00:00:57.629> start

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
will point down you'll start

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
will point down you'll start
dive-bombing<00:00:58.379> into<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> ground<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.730> if

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
dive-bombing into the ground and then if

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.330 
dive-bombing into the ground and then if
you<00:01:00.000> pull<00:01:00.270> back<00:01:00.539> pushing<00:01:01.530> down<00:01:01.859> you'll

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you pull back pushing down you'll

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.750 
you pull back pushing down you'll
actually<00:01:02.520> start<00:01:02.730> looking<00:01:03.239> up<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.799> then<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.489> we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
actually start looking up and then if we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760 
actually start looking up and then if we
go<00:01:06.030> into<00:01:06.150> third<00:01:06.330> person<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
go into third person we can see the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.230 
go into third person we can see the
right<00:01:07.950> analog<00:01:08.250> stick<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> push<00:01:09.030> white

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
right analog stick if you push white

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 
right analog stick if you push white
right<00:01:09.659> will<00:01:09.900> make<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.170> lean<00:01:10.380> right<00:01:10.590> pushing

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
right will make you lean right pushing

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.100 
right will make you lean right pushing
left<00:01:11.580> will<00:01:11.729> make<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.000> lean<00:01:12.210> left<00:01:12.450> now<00:01:12.630> that's

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
left will make you lean left now that's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.750 
left will make you lean left now that's
pretty<00:01:13.380> much<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.740> precision<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.430> turn<00:01:14.610> around

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
pretty much for precision to turn around

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.130 
pretty much for precision to turn around
and<00:01:15.090> stuff<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.780> use<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and stuff like that you can use that to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.080 
and stuff like that you can use that to
turn<00:01:16.409> around<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.759> hard<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> explain

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
turn around it's kind of hard to explain

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.870 
turn around it's kind of hard to explain
exactly<00:01:18.720> how<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.470> turning<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.490> like

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
exactly how to do it one turning I like

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.550 
exactly how to do it one turning I like
to<00:01:21.000> turn<00:01:21.150> left<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.110> use<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to turn left and then I just use the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
to turn left and then I just use the
analog<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.820> right<00:01:23.939> analog<00:01:24.210> stick<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.630> balance

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
analog the right analog stick to balance

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.990 
analog the right analog stick to balance
it<00:01:25.049> out<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.380> make<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.650> go<00:01:25.770> faster<00:01:26.250> otherwise

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
it out and make it go faster otherwise

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.340 
it out and make it go faster otherwise
you're<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> yeah

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you're going to be like this and yeah

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.749 
you're going to be like this and yeah
that's<00:01:28.500> pretty<00:01:28.619> quick<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> set<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> bone

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that's pretty quick but you set the bone

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.580 
that's pretty quick but you set the bone
you<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.060> bounce<00:01:30.240> yourself<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.380> get

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
you just bounce yourself out so you get

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.319 
you just bounce yourself out so you get
the<00:01:31.710> hang<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> once<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.759> start<00:01:33.000> using<00:01:33.119> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the hang of it once you start using it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.700 
the hang of it once you start using it
like<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.570> said<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.079> kind<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.350> hard<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.560> explain

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
like I said it's kind of hard to explain

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
like I said it's kind of hard to explain
turning<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:35.939> you'll<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> hang<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
turning but you'll get the hang of it

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.120 
turning but you'll get the hang of it
and<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.140> balance<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.100> you'll

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and just balance it out and then you'll

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.800 
and just balance it out and then you'll
probably<00:01:38.490> perfect<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> last

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
probably perfect it and then the last

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.300 
probably perfect it and then the last
thing<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> tell<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.710> about<00:01:40.829> learning

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
thing I want to tell you about learning

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.429 
thing I want to tell you about learning
is<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> good<00:01:42.180> thing<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> learn<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.840> once<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.290> get

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
is a good thing to learn is once you get

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
is a good thing to learn is once you get
the<00:01:43.560> controls<00:01:43.950> down<00:01:44.040> start<00:01:44.700> dive-bombing<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the controls down start dive-bombing the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.789 
the controls down start dive-bombing the
ground<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.079> how<00:01:46.140> close<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
ground and see how close you can get to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.620 
ground and see how close you can get to
the<00:01:46.920> ground<00:01:47.189> without<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:48.240> hitting<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the ground without actually hitting the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.600 
the ground without actually hitting the
ground<00:01:48.780> I've<00:01:49.290> done<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> lot<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.340> feel

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
ground I've done this a lot and I feel

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
ground I've done this a lot and I feel
it<00:01:50.790> gives<00:01:50.970> me<00:01:51.180> more<00:01:51.390> precision<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.290> I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it gives me more precision and then I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.440 
it gives me more precision and then I
just<00:01:52.950> pull<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> hang<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
just pull up and then I get the hang of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.179 
just pull up and then I get the hang of
it<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.829> turned<00:01:56.070> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it and then and then I just turned it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.880 
it and then and then I just turned it
around<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.020> yeah<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.680> keep

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
around and and and yeah so keep

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.440 
around and and and yeah so keep
practicing<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> said<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> hardest<00:02:00.329> thing

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
practicing like I said the hardest thing

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
practicing like I said the hardest thing
to<00:02:00.479> learn<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.719> actually<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.829> turnaround

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
to learn is actually the turnaround

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.469 
to learn is actually the turnaround
mainly<00:02:02.729> because<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.000> can't<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.360> explain

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
mainly because I can't really explain

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.200 
mainly because I can't really explain
how<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.280> dive<00:02:05.549> bomb<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
how to do it but just a dive bomb the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.789 
how to do it but just a dive bomb the
ground<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.840> try<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.320> close<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.680> you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
ground and try to get as close as you

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.339 
ground and try to get as close as you
can<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:08.879> turn<00:02:09.179> around<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.110> go

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
can and then turn around and then go

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.260 
can and then turn around and then go
back<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.739> now<00:02:11.009> again<00:02:11.550> real<00:02:11.790> quick<00:02:11.819> though<00:02:12.090> you

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
back up now again real quick though you

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.090 
back up now again real quick though you
have<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.599> hole

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
have to hole

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.770 
have to hole
the<00:02:13.310> left<00:02:13.550> analog<00:02:13.700> stick<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.240> go<00:02:14.360> forward

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
the left analog stick to go forward

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.630 
the left analog stick to go forward
because<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.320> making<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.770> go<00:02:16.100> up<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.460> when<00:02:16.580> you

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
because it's making go go up so when you

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.550 
because it's making go go up so when you
push<00:02:16.820> down<00:02:16.850> you're<00:02:17.180> actually<00:02:17.270> making<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.350> go

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
push down you're actually making it go

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.770 
push down you're actually making it go
down<00:02:18.800> into<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.310> ground<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.910> left<00:02:20.420> analog

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
down into the ground so left analog

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.420 
down into the ground so left analog
stick<00:02:20.810> should<00:02:21.260> always<00:02:21.500> be<00:02:21.650> forward<00:02:22.130> except

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
stick should always be forward except

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.920 
stick should always be forward except
for<00:02:22.610> when<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:22.940> turn<00:02:23.090> around<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.630> change

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
for when you turn around you can change

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.320 
for when you turn around you can change
it<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:25.190> if<00:02:25.460> you're<00:02:25.670> landing<00:02:25.940> but

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
it and and if you're landing but

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.940 
it and and if you're landing but
hopefully<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.750> helped<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.110> hopefully

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
hopefully this helped you hopefully

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.140 
hopefully this helped you hopefully
someone<00:02:28.220> that's<00:02:28.460> actually<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:28.940> good<00:02:29.030> at

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
someone that's actually really good at

flying leave comments below to help you

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.340 
flying leave comments below to help you
that<00:02:31.880> because<00:02:32.420> I'm<00:02:32.600> not<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:33.050> know<00:02:33.080> I'm<00:02:33.200> not

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
that because I'm not you know I'm not

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.230 
that because I'm not you know I'm not
that<00:02:33.560> good<00:02:33.710> I<00:02:33.950> just<00:02:34.400> didn't<00:02:34.670> wreck<00:02:34.760> there<00:02:34.970> but

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
that good I just didn't wreck there but

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.580 
that good I just didn't wreck there but
I'm<00:02:35.630> not<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.930> good<00:02:36.050> I've<00:02:36.260> actually<00:02:36.410> only

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
I'm not that good I've actually only

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.760 
I'm not that good I've actually only
been<00:02:36.740> flying<00:02:37.070> for<00:02:37.190> 20<00:02:37.910> minutes<00:02:38.360> but<00:02:38.770> it's

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
been flying for 20 minutes but it's

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.650 
been flying for 20 minutes but it's
really<00:02:39.890> easy<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.340> pick<00:02:40.580> up<00:02:40.700> on<00:02:40.910> when<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.510> do

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660
