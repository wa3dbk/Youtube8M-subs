minecraft PlayStation as well as a mod
for<00:00:12.269> minecraft<00:00:12.630> console<00:00:12.990> which<00:00:13.080> actually

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
for minecraft console which actually

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.680 
for minecraft console which actually
shows<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:14.099> know<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.730> practice<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> can

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
shows you know this in practice so I can

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.029 
shows you know this in practice so I can
not<00:00:15.809> only<00:00:15.929> talk<00:00:16.139> about<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.410> dimensions<00:00:16.710> but

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
not only talk about the dimensions but

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.500 
not only talk about the dimensions but
show<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.340> an<00:00:17.460> example<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:17.970> one<00:00:18.330> could

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
show you an example of how one could

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.820 
show you an example of how one could
work<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.960> think<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.560> cool<00:00:19.619> video

video if you do like it because that is
the<00:00:22.890> dumb<00:00:23.070> dimensions<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:23.910> over<00:00:24.300> there<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the dumb dimensions just over there and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.939 
the dumb dimensions just over there and
here<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:24.990> diamond<00:00:25.350> dimension<00:00:25.769> pulse

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
here are some diamond dimension pulse

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.320 
here are some diamond dimension pulse
which<00:00:26.130> are<00:00:26.250> coming<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> attack<00:00:26.730> me<00:00:26.910> right<00:00:26.939> now

video<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.340> let's<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.580> straight<00:00:29.910> into<00:00:30.029> this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
video and let's get straight into this

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.030 
video and let's get straight into this
one<00:00:30.660> by<00:00:30.869> showing<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.710> know<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> whole

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
one by showing you you know the whole

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.500 
one by showing you you know the whole
thing<00:00:32.070> works<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.940> mutapa<00:00:33.270> how<00:00:33.390> this

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
thing works and the mutapa how this

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.970 
thing works and the mutapa how this
could<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.690> implemented<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> game<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.800> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
could be implemented in the game so it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.440 
could be implemented in the game so it
was<00:00:35.130> actually<00:00:35.340> made<00:00:35.610> by<00:00:35.640> notice<00:00:36.090> gaming<00:00:36.360> let

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
was actually made by notice gaming let

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.850 
was actually made by notice gaming let
me<00:00:36.510> quickly<00:00:36.690> clarify<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.170> right<00:00:37.380> now<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
me quickly clarify that right now and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.290 
me quickly clarify that right now and
let's<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.340> kill<00:00:38.489> these<00:00:38.610> diamond<00:00:38.940> mobs<00:00:39.120> as

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
let's go just kill these diamond mobs as

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.639 
let's go just kill these diamond mobs as
you<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.510> see<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.840> diamond<00:00:40.020> blocks<00:00:40.350> holding

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
you can see that diamond blocks holding

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.080 
you can see that diamond blocks holding
diamond<00:00:40.980> swords<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.430> mean<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.940> pretty

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
diamond swords I mean that's a pretty

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.760 
diamond swords I mean that's a pretty
cool<00:00:42.300> idea<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.840> movie<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.140> ask<00:00:43.320> me<00:00:43.440> but

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
cool idea for a movie if you ask me but

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.049 
cool idea for a movie if you ask me but
yeah<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.040> let's<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.280> quickly<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.700> explain

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
yeah so let's so quickly just explain

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.459 
yeah so let's so quickly just explain
how<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.300> dumb<00:00:45.510> dimension<00:00:45.960> works<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.379> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
how this dumb dimension works so of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.990 
how this dumb dimension works so of
course<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.860> craft<00:00:47.129> your<00:00:47.219> portal<00:00:47.670> out<00:00:47.820> for

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
course you craft your portal out for

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.610 
course you craft your portal out for
your<00:00:48.090> diamond<00:00:48.510> blocks<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> head

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
your diamond blocks then when you head

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.560 
your diamond blocks then when you head
inside<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.789> obviously<00:00:51.149> based<00:00:51.390> on

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
inside it's you know obviously based on

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.000 
inside it's you know obviously based on
the<00:00:51.660> nether<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.350> stuff<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.739> based

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the nether like all this stuff is based

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.740 
the nether like all this stuff is based
on<00:00:53.190> existing<00:00:53.430> things<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> game<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
on existing things in the game just you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.060 
on existing things in the game just you
know<00:00:54.870> cleverly<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.620> views<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.010> stuff

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
know cleverly you know views and stuff

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
know cleverly you know views and stuff
and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.120> when<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> never<00:00:57.899> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and then when you get to the never you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.779 
and then when you get to the never you
can<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.890> elsewhere<00:00:59.219> when<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
can see it elsewhere when you get to the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
can see it elsewhere when you get to the
dam<00:00:59.940> dimension<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.109> place

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
dam dimension you can see it this place

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.349 
dam dimension you can see it this place
is<00:01:01.590> actually<00:01:01.859> really<00:01:02.340> cool<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
is actually really cool because of the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.939 
is actually really cool because of the
fact<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.530> entirely

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
fact that it's so you know entirely

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.620 
fact that it's so you know entirely
entirely<00:01:05.400> blocked<00:01:05.729> swapped<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.240> which<00:01:06.420> means

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
entirely blocked swapped out which means

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.359 
entirely blocked swapped out which means
that<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.530> only<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:08.010> core

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that not only do you have your core

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340 
that not only do you have your core
where<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.610> know<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.000> semi<00:01:09.390> exclusive<00:01:10.140> there

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
where you know a semi exclusive there

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
where you know a semi exclusive there
you<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.710> mobs<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.220> which<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.670> don't

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you know like mobs here which I don't

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.980 
you know like mobs here which I don't
know<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.299> even<00:01:12.659> though<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.780> know

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
know like it even though you know

ways
because<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> fact<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.250> diamonds<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
because of the fact that diamonds are a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149 
because of the fact that diamonds are a
very<00:01:30.390> pretty<00:01:30.750> block<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.259> obviously<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.979> get

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
very pretty block and obviously you get

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.649 
very pretty block and obviously you get
a<00:01:32.189> lot<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.640> one<00:01:32.820> place<00:01:33.060> combine<00:01:33.509> them

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
a lot of them one place combine them

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.120 
a lot of them one place combine them
with<00:01:33.750> some<00:01:33.900> combat<00:01:34.200> she<00:01:34.350> blocks<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.740> water

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
with some combat she blocks like water

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.890 
with some combat she blocks like water
and<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> nether<00:01:36.210> quartz<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.720> get<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and like the nether quartz and you get a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.870 
and like the nether quartz and you get a
place<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.380> looks<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.310> just

like<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.730> can't<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:27.300> don't<00:02:27.780> see<00:02:27.870> you

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
like so I can't I really don't see you

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.930 
like so I can't I really don't see you
know<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.440> dime<00:02:28.680> dimension<00:02:29.099> being<00:02:29.280> realistic<00:02:29.430> if

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
know a dime dimension being realistic if

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.160 
know a dime dimension being realistic if
you<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.330> all<00:02:30.450> these<00:02:30.540> diamonds<00:02:31.019> than

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
you have all these diamonds than

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.809 
you have all these diamonds than
diamonds<00:02:31.500> lose<00:02:31.620> value<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.130> ruins<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.519> game

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
diamonds lose value that ruins the game

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.460 
diamonds lose value that ruins the game
and<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.269> know<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.870> kind<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.170> see<00:02:34.319> your

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and you know I can kind of see your

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.350 
and you know I can kind of see your
point<00:02:34.709> there<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.069> does<00:02:35.280> definitely<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.239> know

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
point there it does definitely you know

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.820 
point there it does definitely you know
ruin<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.750> game<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:37.019> like<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.530> mined<00:02:37.739> all

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
ruin the game if like if I mined all

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.259 
ruin the game if like if I mined all
these<00:02:37.950> diamonds<00:02:38.130> then<00:02:38.400> I've<00:02:38.489> got<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.910> hundred

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
these diamonds then I've got a hundred

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.180 
these diamonds then I've got a hundred
diamonds<00:02:39.780> already<00:02:40.049> in<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.290> ten<00:02:40.500> blocks<00:02:40.650> but

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
diamonds already in like ten blocks but

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.130 
diamonds already in like ten blocks but
I<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.880> know<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.239> down<00:02:42.420> dimension<00:02:42.989> you

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
I think you know the down dimension you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.360 
I think you know the down dimension you
could<00:02:43.319> do<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.650> could<00:02:43.769> balance<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.310> a

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
could do it you could balance this in a

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.710 
could do it you could balance this in a
couple<00:02:44.640> ways<00:02:44.730> first<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.150> all<00:02:45.239> you've<00:02:45.599> got<00:02:45.629> a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
couple ways first of all you've got a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.509 
couple ways first of all you've got a
bear<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:45.900> mind<00:02:46.049> it<00:02:46.200> only<00:02:46.380> takes<00:02:46.590> 12<00:02:46.950> diamond

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
bear in mind it only takes 12 diamond

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.970 
bear in mind it only takes 12 diamond
blocks<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.819> go<00:02:48.000> here<00:02:48.180> which<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.510> my<00:02:49.410> basic<00:02:49.769> Maps

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
blocks to go here which is my basic Maps

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.979 
blocks to go here which is my basic Maps
on<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.220> spots<00:02:50.459> there's<00:02:50.640> 108<00:02:51.180> diamonds<00:02:51.599> just

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
on the spots there's 108 diamonds just

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.930 
on the spots there's 108 diamonds just
to<00:02:52.079> get<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.620> maybe<00:02:53.040> once<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.400> get<00:02:53.519> 108

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
to get here and maybe once you get 108

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.220 
to get here and maybe once you get 108
diamonds<00:02:54.329> it<00:02:54.450> should<00:02:54.599> be<00:02:54.660> fair<00:02:54.840> enough<00:02:54.989> game

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
diamonds it should be fair enough game

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.870 
diamonds it should be fair enough game
that<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.500> should<00:02:55.650> get<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:56.069> you<00:02:56.310> know<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.700> rest

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
that you should get to you know the rest

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.250 
that you should get to you know the rest
of<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.970> dimes<00:02:57.150> or<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.810> know<00:02:57.930> if<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.110> don't

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
of the dimes or you know if you don't

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.809 
of the dimes or you know if you don't
think<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:58.560> fair<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.769> 108<00:02:59.310> diamonds<00:02:59.640> means

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
think it's fair that 108 diamonds means

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:00.890 
think it's fair that 108 diamonds means
infinite<00:03:00.060> diamonds<00:03:00.480> because<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.750> reality

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
infinite diamonds because in reality

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.600 
infinite diamonds because in reality
look<00:03:01.349> how<00:03:01.440> fast<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.799> can<00:03:01.860> break<00:03:02.069> these<00:03:02.190> blocks<00:03:02.430> I

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
look how fast I can break these blocks I

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.280 
look how fast I can break these blocks I
can<00:03:02.849> get<00:03:02.970> infinite<00:03:03.209> diamonds<00:03:03.599> very<00:03:03.810> very<00:03:04.049> fast

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
can get infinite diamonds very very fast

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.410 
can get infinite diamonds very very fast
I<00:03:04.410> want<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.730> well<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.819> could<00:03:05.940> do<00:03:06.030> also<00:03:06.239> to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
I want to well you could do also to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.089 
I want to well you could do also to
balance<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.840> place<00:03:07.079> is<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.590> could<00:03:07.739> make<00:03:07.920> it

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
balance this place is you could make it

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.039 
balance this place is you could make it
so<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.730> know<00:03:08.760> as<00:03:09.060> well<00:03:09.299> as<00:03:09.329> just<00:03:09.690> you

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
so that you know as well as just you

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.479 
so that you know as well as just you
know<00:03:10.170> like<00:03:10.470> you're<00:03:10.590> having<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.920> get<00:03:11.040> 100<00:03:11.340> dimes

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
know like you're having to get 100 dimes

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.949 
know like you're having to get 100 dimes
to<00:03:11.579> get<00:03:11.700> here<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.120> could<00:03:12.299> make<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.660> most

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
to get here you could make this the most

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.020 
to get here you could make this the most
insanely<00:03:13.590> tricky<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.310> dimensions<00:03:14.849> like

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
insanely tricky of the dimensions like

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.729 
insanely tricky of the dimensions like
the<00:03:15.209> really<00:03:15.569> late-game<00:03:15.780> thinkers<00:03:16.290> kind<00:03:16.680> of

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
the really late-game thinkers kind of

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.140 
the really late-game thinkers kind of
like<00:03:16.860> how<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.040> had<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> any<00:03:17.489> drug<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.910> then<00:03:18.030> we

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
like how we had the any drug and then we

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.090 
like how we had the any drug and then we
got<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.420> wither<00:03:18.600> as<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> harder<00:03:19.200> boss<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.769> we

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
got the wither as a harder boss and we

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.319 
got the wither as a harder boss and we
could<00:03:20.250> kind<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.760> end<00:03:20.940> which<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.299> a

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
could kind of have the end which is a

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.370 
could kind of have the end which is a
harder<00:03:21.690> mentoring<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.109> it's<00:03:22.200> sort<00:03:22.350> of

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
harder mentoring so it's sort of

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.900 
harder mentoring so it's sort of
Enderman<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.859> end<00:03:22.980> dragon<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.370> would<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:23.819> the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
Enderman the end dragon I would have the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.640 
Enderman the end dragon I would have the
diamond<00:03:24.329> dimension<00:03:24.870> which<00:03:25.019> really<00:03:25.410> requires

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
diamond dimension which really requires

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.400 
diamond dimension which really requires
full<00:03:26.280> enchanted<00:03:27.180> armor<00:03:27.359> just<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.810> standard

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
full enchanted armor just a standard

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.750 
full enchanted armor just a standard
proper<00:03:28.620> chance<00:03:28.859> you<00:03:29.190> could<00:03:29.340> fill<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.549> with<00:03:29.639> its

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
proper chance you could fill it with its

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640 
proper chance you could fill it with its
exclusive<00:03:30.150> challenging<00:03:31.019> mobs<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.380> could<00:03:31.560> do

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
exclusive challenging mobs you could do

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.349 
exclusive challenging mobs you could do
all<00:03:31.829> these<00:03:31.980> things<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.459> then<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.239> know<00:03:33.329> just

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
all these things and then you know just

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.240 
all these things and then you know just
kind<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.840> make<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.590> damn<00:03:34.769> blocks

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
kind of make the damn blocks

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.129 
kind of make the damn blocks
know<00:03:35.549> like<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:36.030> reward<00:03:36.450> full<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.870> if<00:03:37.019> you

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
know like the reward full of that if you

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.690 
know like the reward full of that if you
can<00:03:37.170> what<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:38.010> you're<00:03:38.130> gonna<00:03:38.250> be<00:03:38.400> distracted

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
can what like you're gonna be distracted

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.039 
can what like you're gonna be distracted
while<00:03:38.970> you're<00:03:39.120> mining<00:03:39.389> but<00:03:39.510> if<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.870> mine

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
while you're mining but if you can mine

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.449 
while you're mining but if you can mine
free<00:03:40.290> blocks<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> broke<00:03:40.799> that's<00:03:41.010> awesome

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
free blocks the broke that's awesome

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.890 
free blocks the broke that's awesome
it's<00:03:41.639> kind<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:41.940> like<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.660> know<00:03:42.690> it's<00:03:42.810> a

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
it's kind of like you know it's a

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.090 
it's kind of like you know it's a
late-game<00:03:43.109> way<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.440> get<00:03:43.620> diamonds<00:03:43.829> that

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
late-game way to get diamonds that

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.979 
late-game way to get diamonds that
doesn't<00:03:44.459> just<00:03:44.609> import<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.269> know<00:03:45.389> mole<00:03:45.600> mining

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
doesn't just import you know mole mining

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.390 
doesn't just import you know mole mining
down<00:03:46.109> below<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.680> think<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.100> would<00:03:47.250> be<00:03:47.280> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
down below and I think that would be a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.039 
down below and I think that would be a
cool<00:03:47.639> way<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.819> do<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.239> yeah<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.660> think<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
cool way to do this so yeah I think the

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.809 
cool way to do this so yeah I think the
diamond<00:03:49.200> dimension<00:03:49.709> could<00:03:49.950> be<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.370> really

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
diamond dimension could be a really

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.190 
diamond dimension could be a really
quite<00:03:51.030> debt<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.299> know<00:03:51.389> any<00:03:51.569> anything<00:03:51.870> like

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
quite debt you know any anything like

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.780 
quite debt you know any anything like
this<00:03:52.380> just<00:03:52.799> by<00:03:52.920> making<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.519> late-game

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
this just by making it a late-game

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.789 
this just by making it a late-game
dimension<00:03:54.600> where<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.079> know<00:03:55.170> there's<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:55.680> many

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
dimension where you know there's so many

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.710 
dimension where you know there's so many
challenging<00:03:56.340> things<00:03:56.549> here<00:03:56.760> mmm<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:57.389> makes<00:03:57.569> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
challenging things here mmm it makes the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.180 
challenging things here mmm it makes the
never<00:03:57.900> seem<00:03:58.170> like<00:03:58.349> it's<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.680> know<00:03:58.769> something

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
never seem like it's you know something

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.009 
never seem like it's you know something
easy<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.639> then<00:03:59.790> boom<00:04:00.120> that's<00:04:00.389> that<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.660> think

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
easy and then boom that's that I think

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.509 
easy and then boom that's that I think
that's<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.290> great<00:04:01.470> idea<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.920> even<00:04:02.370> if<00:04:02.430> you

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
that's a great idea and even if you

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.949 
that's a great idea and even if you
don't<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:02.970> way<00:04:03.209> even<00:04:03.480> if<00:04:03.540> that's<00:04:03.720> like

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
don't do it that way even if that's like

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.509 
don't do it that way even if that's like
no<00:04:04.290> let's<00:04:04.590> not<00:04:04.799> give<00:04:04.950> out<00:04:05.040> diamonds<00:04:05.400> for

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
no let's not give out diamonds for

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.309 
no let's not give out diamonds for
people<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.790> take<00:04:05.910> at<00:04:06.120> one<00:04:06.599> you<00:04:06.810> can<00:04:06.959> make<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:07.230> a

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
people to take at one you can make it a

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.720 
people to take at one you can make it a
new<00:04:07.530> type<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.769> or<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.250> make<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.639> know

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
new type of or you can make it you know

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.400 
new type of or you can make it you know
like<00:04:08.849> me<00:04:09.120> for<00:04:09.299> like<00:04:09.450> dimension<00:04:10.019> this<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.319> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
like me for like dimension this is the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.099 
like me for like dimension this is the
only<00:04:10.739> way<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.010> get<00:04:11.310> CERN<00:04:11.609> or<00:04:11.870> which<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:13.019> you

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
only way to get CERN or which is you

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.539 
only way to get CERN or which is you
know<00:04:13.200> good<00:04:13.410> from<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:13.859> not<00:04:14.040> quite<00:04:14.220> as<00:04:14.310> good<00:04:14.459> as

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
know good from but not quite as good as

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.339 
know good from but not quite as good as
diamonds<00:04:14.910> or<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.569> could<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.870> make<00:04:16.019> this<00:04:16.169> a

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
diamonds or you could just make this a

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.440 
diamonds or you could just make this a
dream<00:04:16.680> dimension<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.370> let's<00:04:17.519> say<00:04:17.700> every<00:04:18.329> time

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
dream dimension so let's say every time

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.020 
dream dimension so let's say every time
you<00:04:18.570> go<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> stick<00:04:18.959> you've<00:04:19.079> got<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.229> one<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.620> like

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
you go to stick you've got a one in like

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.949 
you go to stick you've got a one in like
20<00:04:21.030> chance<00:04:21.269> were<00:04:21.419> just<00:04:21.570> being<00:04:21.690> teleported

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
20 chance were just being teleported

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.899 
20 chance were just being teleported
here<00:04:22.320> while<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.740> sleep<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.220> then<00:04:23.669> you<00:04:23.789> know

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
here while you sleep and then you know

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.490 
here while you sleep and then you know
it's<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.090> cool<00:04:24.270> place<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:24.510> can<00:04:24.810> go<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:24.990> like<00:04:25.229> get

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
it's a cool place you can go to like get

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.140 
it's a cool place you can go to like get
potential<00:04:26.070> items<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.550> diamonds<00:04:26.849> would<00:04:26.940> come

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
potential items the diamonds would come

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.629 
potential items the diamonds would come
back<00:04:27.240> with<00:04:27.300> you

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
back with you

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.830 
back with you
and<00:04:27.879> you<00:04:28.000> could<00:04:28.150> give<00:04:28.270> answer<00:04:28.509> that<00:04:28.689> way

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
and you could give answer that way

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.659 
and you could give answer that way
either<00:04:29.050> way<00:04:29.259> just<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.919> know<00:04:30.039> even<00:04:30.340> just<00:04:30.580> a

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
either way just you know even just a

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.100 
either way just you know even just a
basic<00:04:31.030> blocks<00:04:31.300> off<00:04:31.479> of<00:04:31.599> the<00:04:31.689> never<00:04:31.870> way<00:04:32.050> you

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
basic blocks off of the never way you

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.570 
basic blocks off of the never way you
can<00:04:32.319> see<00:04:32.530> this<00:04:32.680> is<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:33.009> know<00:04:33.129> it's<00:04:33.310> just<00:04:33.430> all

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
can see this is you know it's just all

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.129 
can see this is you know it's just all
the<00:04:33.669> same<00:04:33.819> blocks<00:04:34.060> or<00:04:34.210> switch<00:04:34.389> now<00:04:34.539> it<00:04:34.840> looks

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
the same blocks or switch now it looks

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.350 
the same blocks or switch now it looks
amazing<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:35.889> want<00:04:36.099> to<00:04:36.250> explore<00:04:36.669> this<00:04:36.849> thing<00:04:37.120> and

you<00:04:58.000> can<00:04:58.150> see<00:04:58.300> they<00:04:58.449> took<00:04:58.750> out<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:58.960> chunk<00:04:59.229> just

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
you can see they took out a chunk just

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.689 
you can see they took out a chunk just
to<00:04:59.620> show<00:04:59.800> you<00:04:59.860> where<00:05:00.039> they're<00:05:00.189> never<00:05:00.430> with
