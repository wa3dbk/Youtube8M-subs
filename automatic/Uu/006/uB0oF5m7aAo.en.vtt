00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hey guys this is a review on the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.960 
hey guys this is a review on the
mountain<00:00:03.480> master<00:00:03.780> pace<00:00:04.220> 60<00:00:05.220> mm<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.549> nip<00:00:05.730> and

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
mountain master pace 60 mm in a nip and

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.780 
mountain master pace 60 mm in a nip and
I'm<00:00:06.359> doing<00:00:06.600> this<00:00:06.720> Spade<00:00:07.080> flow<00:00:07.429> speed<00:00:08.429> blur<00:00:08.639> has

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
I'm doing this Spade flow speed blur has

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.570 
I'm doing this Spade flow speed blur has
less<00:00:09.150> pitchman<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.130> table<00:00:11.130> saw<00:00:11.250> which<00:00:11.400> has

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
less pitchman and table saw which has

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.850 
less pitchman and table saw which has
obviously<00:00:12.150> more<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.929> Josh<00:00:13.139> pitchman<00:00:13.530> video

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
obviously more it's Josh pitchman video

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.129 
obviously more it's Josh pitchman video
not<00:00:14.099> as<00:00:14.219> much<00:00:14.370> which<00:00:15.360> means<00:00:15.570> obviously<00:00:15.809> its

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
not as much which means obviously its

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.290 
not as much which means obviously its
plays<00:00:16.320> better<00:00:18.980> then<00:00:19.980> lead<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.789> be<00:00:20.880> rather

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
plays better then lead can be rather

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.230 
plays better then lead can be rather
hard<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.720> get<00:00:21.840> off<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.730> bitumen<00:00:23.970> does

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
hard to get off because the bitumen does

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.200 
hard to get off because the bitumen does
stick<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.460> then<00:00:26.460> you'll<00:00:26.849> probably<00:00:26.939> end

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
stick to it and then you'll probably end

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.320 
stick to it and then you'll probably end
up<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.660> amazing<00:00:28.349> nib<00:00:28.880> are<00:00:29.880> coming<00:00:30.240> out

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
up like this amazing nib are coming out

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.470 
up like this amazing nib are coming out
quite<00:00:30.539> far<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.529> read<00:00:31.980> everything<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
quite far so just read everything and

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
quite far so just read everything and
push<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.630> back<00:00:33.809> into<00:00:33.989> place<00:00:36.230> I'm<00:00:37.230> gonna<00:00:37.320> be

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
push that back into place I'm gonna be

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
push that back into place I'm gonna be
comparing<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> smoogle<00:00:38.360> smoogle

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
comparing it with the smoogle smoogle

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
comparing it with the smoogle smoogle
fat<00:00:41.270> s<00:00:42.270> 30<00:00:42.629> millimetres<00:00:43.579> but<00:00:44.579> yeah<00:00:44.910> it's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
fat s 30 millimetres but yeah it's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.440 
fat s 30 millimetres but yeah it's
obviously<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.809> big<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> 60<00:00:47.450> because

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
obviously not as big as the 60 because

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:58.180 
obviously not as big as the 60 because
we<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.719> don't<00:00:48.930> any<00:00:49.350> page<00:00:49.680> over

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.130 

okay<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.250> then<00:00:59.490> three<00:00:59.850> main<00:01:00.600> strikes<00:01:00.900> you<00:01:00.990> get

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
okay so then three main strikes you get

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.450 
okay so then three main strikes you get
honest<00:01:01.350> people<00:01:01.530> fat<00:01:04.010> yeah<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> fairly<00:01:05.309> broad

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
you know it's quite a broad market it's

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.160 
you know it's quite a broad market it's
probably<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> big<00:01:08.250> thing<00:01:08.370> in<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.550> burner

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
biggest player each one is still a bit

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.370 
biggest player each one is still a bit
bigger<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.170> because<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.770> bad<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.630> I<00:01:42.380> I
