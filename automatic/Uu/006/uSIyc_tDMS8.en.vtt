00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi there, this is the day's distribution 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.440
 pokerstarter and with you Sergey Nikitin 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.600
 Today, our distribution will take place in 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.850
 tournament format a6 max as we see 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.400
 our hero was given a miscellaneous king 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.800
 a lady in the position of cats and he opens 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.020
 gets a count in general preflop pretty 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.289
 it's standard to discuss it here especially 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.180
 nothing and so we go out on the flo we get 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.640
 in top doper 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.710
 and our opponent decides to play dong here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.130
 bet and now it is worth staying and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.240
 evaluate our opponent's range 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.450
 I think there will not be well its spectrum 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.180
 any on tv as such 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.160
 hands like pallets kings ladies he raises 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.410
 preflop ace 10 in principle he too often 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.500
 hit preflop 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.690
 ready so much the more so here 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.040
 turns into an absolutely nation and donkat 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.220
 into this board here a lot of sense not 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.800
 has as the best standard pretty 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.400
 check and give ourselves to put here 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.580
 kombat that is, I see its spectrum 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.790
 here like some average hit in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.369
 board plus gutshot and here's about 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.950
 such is the spectrum and will play here 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.750
 doh k now which line we choose 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.030
 can develop this house to bid on you or 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.950
 since our opponent 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.830
 apparently not there very much 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.140
 a strong player and hardly ever 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.569
 hands of the above spectrum he 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.840
 will be able to reset 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.729
 And well, it is clear that with such a raise 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 him and get the second option just 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.630
 call his bet and give 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.720
 realize him further his aggression on 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.810
 blank turn and 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.660
 Well, if he will not put it already 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.429
 yourself to get on further streets both 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.520
 options correctly which option will choose 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.950
 our hero now see our hero 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.950
 chooses january and we go on the turn 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.200
 what comes eight especially she something 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.459
 don't close 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.440
 our opponent checks and here it is necessary 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.030
 set yourself to pick various worst 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.150
 hands 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.450
 still with a gutshot of budgets in general 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.200
 from all that as all that we 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.220
 we put the flop we bet we get 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.960
 call well, everything is fine on the turn 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.060
 and the river has an ace and itâ€™s already here 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.050
 stay here we don't have vala beta 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.150
 since no hands are worse than us here 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.610
 pay will not be at the highest 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.530
 ace and the only thing you can do 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.400
 bet about you love yourself 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.030
 so the river is already worth going out to 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.030
 showdown 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.610
 what does your hero do 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:08.349
 shows scored maximum line 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.319
 our opponent skip action 9 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.159
 which we have not laid him a spectrum 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.530
 because of his donka yes it's lower streetball 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.620
 But in principle, our hero played 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:25.799
 pretty optimal and this distribution 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.799
 shows that in principle against the spectrum 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.440
 no line can be optimal 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.350
 poker and a few 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.800
 The main thing that each of these lines was 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.300
 balanced on the streets that showed 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.970
 our hero in this hand 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.840
 Thank you all for your attention. Good luck to everyone. 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.840
 poker and in life
