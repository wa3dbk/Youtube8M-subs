00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.429
 Save me guys, I'm jumpin 'here to my 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.709
 side with multi instrumentalist eduardo 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.150
 alves that is in southern jaraguá 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.070
 visiting the city it that there is already a 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.710
 Some time ago I lived here in Jaguarão 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.300
 Eduardo and on a visit to the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.240
 people to whom he has also contributed 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.820
 years writing about culture 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.350
 ability and I took advantage of it 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.000
 brought an instrument presents now 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.340
 that he is dominating here he 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.600
 built the bagpipes and I want to 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.090
 That he talks a little bit to us. 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.710
 about this instrument and why 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.520
 this new passion, everything good, Eduard 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.560
 gonçalves 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.420
 Thank you for the invitation, a tram is not there. 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.250
 in jaragua and see new people friends 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.920
 me when a little bit because the bagpipe 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.910
 bellows is not easy to see through here 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.890
 Brazil, right? 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.630
 good only when I leave the south jaragua 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.000
 the city anyway ten years ago 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.280
 to São Paulo to specialize in 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.520
 audio I felt the need to 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.780
 play an instrument right is how it looks from 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.869
 It was an instrument that always called me 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.979
 attention many years and saw and guitarist and 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.259
 guitar player 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.200
 I went behind got an instrument and 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.009
 I started to try to understand the instrument 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.319
 huh 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.240
 and then I started to like it more and more 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:21.039
 this is because it really is much better than 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.229
 that I imagined despite their 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.420
 difficulties but it's a fantastic dream 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.409
 No, I do not believe this is what I told you. 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.030
 ask the credit is not a 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.090
 easy instrument for any 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.789
 person because it requires coordination 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.369
 lung or breath and this is exactly the 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.740
 Instrument idea to be a bellows 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.560
 this supernatural power that is because 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.109
 people think the trigger is 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.849
 because when you use the bellows 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.599
 you practically breathe with the 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.209
 forum 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.849
 You breathe together, you're an instrument. 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.560
 that it can be fully configured 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:56.200
 to the taste of who will play you can 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.810
 find palette and double oboe 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.149
 It can be harder or you do not have the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.859
 advantages and disadvantages, then it is 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.259
 an adjustable instrument 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.419
 but in if it is not so easy to 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.369
 people will realize not to get there alone 

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.989
 persist then you are here in jaragua 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.000
 from the south this week to attend a 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.440
 event at a party on Saturday that the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.500
 client closes the event closed 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.180
 but in addition to the people of this line who 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.550
 At the end of the interview the instrument 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.860
 Someone wants to see you playing 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.870
 presenting instruments will scroll 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.270
 some shit some participation like this 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.770
 in the city ​​a place with no problem 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.160
 I think when you have one 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.710
 instrument of this and you study research 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.140
 I think she's a little too directional. 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.370
 common sense and to disseminate the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.050
 suddenly do not leave in a few years I can 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.300
 Teaching you who knows, right? 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.690
 I think it's important this is something new to 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.360
 city is a cool thing so it does not have 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.790
 how to state but I have heard that in the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.900
 Thursday at the mall something 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.050
 like this 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.340
 Can a metal happen to me? 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.590
 said 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.360
 It's like you said someone told you can 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.920
 happen then the galley can happen 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.720
 if you want to see a 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.280
 Eduardo's presentation can happen to 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.790
 any time around the city or not 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.770
 anyway I do not have much information 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.960

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.250
