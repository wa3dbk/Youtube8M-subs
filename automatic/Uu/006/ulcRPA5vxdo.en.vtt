00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Leon 2 3 lost to Borussia 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.700
 dortmund the final result and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.710
 especially in the back and very much 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.500
 short gameplay as bitter as 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.000
 this defeat is very painful 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.950
 then hurts at first but I must at 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.049
 the team apologize for my 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.220
 yellow-red card where I think with a 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.210
 I can do a bit of tact 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.039
 continue playing already still can because it 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.390
 now no coarse fouls were too 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 not somehow noticed with evil 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.500
 a whole game and I think so 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.599
 we win 11 times this game 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.609
 certainly like today occurred times 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.610
 again in one has seen unity 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.540
 in the square and just sorry for us 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 I have to work for the team 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.600
 excuse me because I think he is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.600
 more in it 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.260
 I'm really shit and I think so 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.520
 until the last minute you have seen 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.140
 that each one really is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.730
 please fight and fight 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.840
 once something to morale of the team me 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.309
 I think that's really very great today 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.930
 to emphasize positively 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.100
 I do not believe that we say everything 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 seen also the fans have us then 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.059
 also actively supported but there 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.140
 you just see it in the team 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.370
 within the team also agrees 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.650
 the trainer in here and today again 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.570
 We were so handy and prepared 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.770
 had so many good options 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.670
 and there you just see that we 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.530
 together from this situation 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.850
 have to come out and now together 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.869
 will go together and that's why 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.619
 I'm there good things that we're there 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.890
 come out again 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.990
 Thanks a lot to the lego 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.790
 a close defeat 2 3 against 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.150
 borussia dortmund how big is that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 disappointment after the close result yes 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.990
 first of all it is natural if 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.780
 you look like the game again 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 Running is very disappointing for us 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.420
 all and there were again these sticking points 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.270
 We play in many of the second half of the season 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.619
 We either had this one 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.490
 key to leadership not 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.820
 achieve 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.290
 or how today is a card then 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.950
 Just relax with a man 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.229
 leaves the place and then that this 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.060
 let game tilt because I think up 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.770
 especially after that from them 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.020
 the whole thing was in our hands 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.860
 There was control in the end 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.200
 stop 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.170
 we still go as a loser of 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.750
 what was the plan before the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.130
 play i believe in the fields 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.330
 Solidarity readiness to fight 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.360
 willingness to run can be done anyway 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.980
 some positive the next weeks 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.400
 and meet mentality first of all 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.570
 mentality and even agile will 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.980
 But there it was football as we did 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.420
 that we also had to tackle 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.190
 of course also shake after 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.260
 but the goal to the first opponent are 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.730
 then with the statement full in 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.340
 actually have dortmund 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.620
 then clearly dominated finally stop 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.920
 there still had this huge chance to 2 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.180
 1 and if we will do that will 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.500
 that might play a different game 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.209
 is a whole different story and that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.140
 we just did not make it and these 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.730
 Moments we had in the last 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.540
 play very often and that's easy 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.950
 Fact and that's why we have to do everything 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.380
 analyze well then we look 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.680
 continue working day and fell cordially 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.680
 thanked
