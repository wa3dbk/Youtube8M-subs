00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.610 

well<00:00:40.330> no<00:00:41.330> I<00:00:41.360> mean<00:00:41.510> just<00:00:41.810> because<00:00:41.930> Mary<00:00:42.320> Lee<00:00:42.500> has

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
well no I mean just because Mary Lee has

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.050 
well no I mean just because Mary Lee has
come<00:00:42.830> close<00:00:43.040> to<00:00:43.220> shore<00:00:43.370> doesn't<00:00:43.700> mean<00:00:43.820> we<00:00:44.030> have

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
come close to shore doesn't mean we have

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.880 
come close to shore doesn't mean we have
to<00:00:44.150> change<00:00:44.390> our<00:00:44.600> attitudes<00:00:45.050> towards<00:00:45.470> thinking

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
to change our attitudes towards thinking

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.260 
to change our attitudes towards thinking
that<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.370> white<00:00:46.520> sharks<00:00:46.820> are<00:00:46.910> there<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.090> kill

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
that the white sharks are there to kill

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.790 
that the white sharks are there to kill
us<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:47.960> know<00:00:48.050> she's<00:00:48.200> probably<00:00:48.320> been<00:00:48.530> doing

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
us you know she's probably been doing

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.370 
us you know she's probably been doing
this<00:00:48.950> for<00:00:49.220> decades<00:00:49.450> and<00:00:50.450> other<00:00:50.810> sharks<00:00:51.140> do<00:00:51.290> it

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
this for decades and other sharks do it

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.050 
this for decades and other sharks do it
as<00:00:51.500> well<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.100> think<00:00:52.130> what<00:00:52.400> Mary<00:00:52.610> Lee<00:00:52.760> points

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
as well and I think what Mary Lee points

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.160 
as well and I think what Mary Lee points
out<00:00:53.180> is<00:00:53.330> we<00:00:53.450> really<00:00:53.660> don't<00:00:53.750> have<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.050> be

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
out is we really don't have to be

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.810 
out is we really don't have to be
worried<00:00:54.440> because<00:00:54.590> Mary<00:00:55.400> Lee<00:00:55.520> didn't<00:00:55.730> do

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
worried because Mary Lee didn't do

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.250 
worried because Mary Lee didn't do
anything<00:00:56.030> when<00:00:56.270> she<00:00:56.390> was<00:00:56.510> close<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.780> shore<00:00:57.110> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
anything when she was close to shore and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.240 
anything when she was close to shore and
all<00:00:57.739> likelihood<00:00:58.160> she<00:00:58.190> won't<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.980> rains

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
all likelihood she won't the rains

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.979 
all likelihood she won't the rains
broken<00:01:01.550> way<00:01:01.879> was<00:01:02.150> hard<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.480> get<00:01:02.600> some<00:01:02.720> clear
