00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
when that is the case and we can start

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.810 
when that is the case and we can start
stacking<00:00:45.300> them<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.960> until<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.190> house<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.340> 50

stacking them up until the house is 50
meters<00:00:48.059> high<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.629> where<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> magic

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
meters high and this is where the magic

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.799 
meters high and this is where the magic
happens<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> 3d<00:00:50.730> printer<00:00:51.390> where<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
happens this is the 3d printer where the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
happens this is the 3d printer where the
3d<00:00:52.289> house<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.949> being<00:00:53.190> made<00:00:53.370> piece<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:53.940> piece

3d house is being made piece by piece
can<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.960> tell<00:00:55.110> us<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.320> bit<00:00:55.350> about<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.710> you're

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
can you tell us a bit about what you're

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.400 
can you tell us a bit about what you're
doing<00:00:56.160> yeah<00:00:56.699> well<00:00:57.449> today<00:00:57.750> we're<00:00:57.960> testing<00:00:58.140> some

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
doing yeah well today we're testing some

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.590 
doing yeah well today we're testing some
new<00:00:58.710> materials<00:00:59.280> they're<00:00:59.760> based<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> old

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
new materials they're based on the old

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.049 
new materials they're based on the old
materials<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.649> include<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.370> fibers

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
materials and they include some fibers

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.789 
materials and they include some fibers
which<00:01:03.300> increases<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> strength<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
which increases the strength of the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.429 
which increases the strength of the
material<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.519> also<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.420> helps<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
material and also it helps with the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.640 
material and also it helps with the
printing<00:01:07.890> itself<00:01:08.250> by<00:01:08.960> giving<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> material<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
printing itself by giving the material a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
printing itself by giving the material a
better<00:01:10.860> cooling<00:01:11.430> properties<00:01:11.939> whilst

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
better cooling properties whilst

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.510 
better cooling properties whilst
printing<00:01:12.840> 3d<00:01:13.590> printing<00:01:13.979> has<00:01:14.100> already<00:01:14.369> been

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
progress and this is what it will look

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.039 
progress and this is what it will look
like<00:01:44.909> when<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.479> finished

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
like when it's finished

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.560 
like when it's finished
but<00:01:46.799> these<00:01:46.920> visitors<00:01:47.430> from<00:01:47.700> Australia<00:01:48.329> are

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
but these visitors from Australia are

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749 
but these visitors from Australia are
already<00:01:48.990> sold<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> concept<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.310> printing

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
already sold on the concept of printing

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.149 
already sold on the concept of printing
locally<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.540> cut<00:01:51.750> transport<00:01:52.380> costs<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.920> waste

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
locally to cut transport costs and waste

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.020 
locally to cut transport costs and waste
we<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.329> very<00:01:55.020> high<00:01:55.140> very<00:01:55.950> high<00:01:56.070> costs<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
we have very high very high costs to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.480 
we have very high very high costs to
build<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:58.200> remote<00:01:58.500> locations<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
build in really remote locations and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.690 
build in really remote locations and
this<00:02:00.420> might<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.719> an<00:02:00.990> answer<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> future

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this might be an answer for the future

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789 
this might be an answer for the future
and<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.810> organically<00:02:04.439> shaped

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and because it's so organically shaped

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.130 
and because it's so organically shaped
you<00:02:05.009> could<00:02:05.189> do<00:02:05.369> things<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:05.759> were

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
you could do things that were

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.719 
you could do things that were
sympathetic<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.710> landscape<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
sympathetic to the landscape and to the

team<00:02:11.760> say<00:02:12.030> human<00:02:12.450> creativity<00:02:12.930> will<00:02:13.290> never

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
team say human creativity will never

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.979 
team say human creativity will never
disappear<00:02:14.099> from<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> process<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.599> using

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
disappear from the process but using

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.960 
disappear from the process but using
technology<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.950> could<00:02:17.310> one<00:02:17.550> day<00:02:17.760> be

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
technology like this could one day be

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.910 
technology like this could one day be
the<00:02:18.000> environmentally<00:02:18.900> friendly<00:02:19.350> way<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.560> put
